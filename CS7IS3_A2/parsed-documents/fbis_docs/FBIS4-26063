FBIS4-26063 "drchi117_n_94015" FBIS-CHI-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Economic & Agricultural Peasants Told To Put Fertilizer Underground Peasants Told To Put Fertilizer Underground OW1606141094 Beijing XINHUA in English 1204 GMT 16 Jun 94 OW1606141094 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China is urging its hundreds of millions of farmers to put fertilizer underground -- to reduce pollution and farm expenditure and improve yields. By so doing, China could save at least 9.5 million tons of carbamide each year, and reduce environmental pollution caused by inefficient use of chemical fertilizers. China imported about 18 million tons of chemical fertilizers in 1993. Song Shuyou, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture, told a national agricultural meeting today that the new method of applying fertilizers can enable farmers to cut their expenditure for fertilizers and raise yields and income by about 600 yuan per hectare. The official told agricultural officials from nine provinces and municipalities that the traditional way of applying chemical fertilizers is wasteful and causes large-scale pollution. Traditionally, fertilizers were unevenly spread manually over the surface of the soil. Only some 30 percent is actually absorbed by plants, while most of the useful elements were lost by evaporation after exposure to sunlight or washed away by water or rain, thus polluting the air, rivers and lakes, said Song. "If the efficiency is raised by 10 percentage points to 40 percent, it would mean an equivalent of 9.5 million tons of carbamide will be saved," said the official at the meeting in Hebei Province's Guan County, about three hours' drive from Beijing. In some developed countries, sixty percent of the chemical fertilizers were absorbed by plants, Song said. According to the method listed on the ministry's nationwide technique extension program, farmers are advised to put chemical fertilizers six to 10 cm under the soil by hand or machine. The official said the new method helps the plants to absorb more nutrients from the fertilizers and reduce pollution. According to the results of the experiments in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Liaoning and Heilongjiang by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the new method increased the per unit yield of cotton, wheat, corn and soybean by six percent to 15.2 percent in comparison with the traditional one. The ministry plans to introduce the new technique to 66 million ha [hectares] of cultivated land over a five-year period, starting this year.
