FBIS TRENDS-20May94-Russia Yeltsin Attempts Conciliatory Gesture to Legislature Yeltsin Attempts Conciliatory Gesture to Legislature SUMMARY In what appears to have been intended as a conciliatory gesture to the legislature, President Boris Yeltsin has signed into law legislation on the prerogatives and perquisites of lawmakers even though he has challenged the Federal Assembly on the constitutionality of some of the bill's provisions and requested specific amendments. Yeltsin is primarily challenging the bill for ascribing to deputies significant oversight functions that he contends exceed their constitutional role as legislators. By declining to veto one of the first pieces of legislation passed by both parliamentary chambers, Yeltsin appears to be trying to choose his political battles carefully, but the chances for a successful legislative-executive compromise will depend on whether lawmakers are willing to accept Yeltsin's narrow view of their powers. END SUMMARY Suggesting that he is not interested in engaging the legislature in political battles at this early juncture, Yeltsin signed the law "On the Status of Federation Council Deputies and the Status of State Duma Deputies" despite expressing serious concerns about the constitutionality of some of its provisions. (See Note 1) In a letter to both chambers of the Federal Assembly, Yeltsin indicated that the decision to sign the law was "difficult" because it "contains obvious juridical imperfections and inconsistencies with the Constitution." At the same time, he noted that the law "as a whole" is necessary for "effective legislative work" and portrayed his decision to sign it as a "step toward fulfilling the treaty on social accord." Nevertheless, he attached a lengthy memorandum recommending amendments to the law and "inviting" the legislature to "suspend" those provisions he claims are at odds with the constitution (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 May). (Note 1) Yeltsin's decision to sign the law reportedly came despite contradictory advice from his advisers. According to Izvestiya's parliamentary observer Sergey Chugayev, an edict for a veto had already been drafted at the behest of Presidential Administration leader Sergey Filatov, but Georgiy Satarov, Yeltsin's adviser on legislative affairs who counseled Yeltsin to sign the bill, prevailed (Izvestiya, 12 May). Objections to Oversight Functions At the heart of Yeltsin's objections to the law are its provisions granting deputies extensive oversight functions that he says violate the constitutional role of lawmakers. Showing particular sensitivity to parliamentary intrusion in executive affairs at all levels of government, Yeltsin has challenged provisions in the law granting deputies broad access to inspect government bodies and state enterprises and requiring state officials to respond in timely fashion to requests for information from deputies: Access. Article 5 of the law states that a deputy is entitled to "visit without hindrance all organs of state power and organs of local self-government . . . and enterprises, institutions, organizations, military units, and public associations." Yeltsin argued in his letter that such unrestricted access "is in no way connected with the legislative process" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 May). Right to Information. Several articles in the law concern the deputies' right to demand information from state and local officials and to receive the requested information in a timely manner. In his memorandum, Yeltsin argued that the constitution does not grant the Federal Assembly an "all-embracing monitoring function with regard to other state institutions." (See Note 2) He claims that deputies will use broadly formulated oversight functions to "interfere in the activity" of state and local governments and enterprises. It is less clear, however, whether Yeltsin is also challenging the practice, described in Article 14 of the law, whereby deputies are entitled to question any member of the federal government during parliamentary sessions. While he wrote that "Articles 13-17 indicate that the deputy will possess powers to interfere actively in the activity of all other bodies of state authority and local self-government," he has not previously objected to ministers' participation in the Duma's weekly "government hour" session to report on an issue and answer deputies' questions. For example, Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko addressed the Duma on 4 February on the enterprise payment crisis and budget issues (ITAR-TASS, 4 February). Similarly, Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin reported to the Duma on the crime situation on 11 February (ITAR-TASS, 11 February). (Note 2) The only oversight function explicitly granted to the Federation Council and the State Duma under the constitution is the right to monitor implementation of the federal budget through the parliamentary Comptrollers Office (Article 101). In challenging these parliamentary oversight functions, Yeltsin has demonstrated his intention to consign lawmakers exclusively to a lawmaking role. In his memorandum Yeltsin noted that Article 1 of the bill "correctly" defines a deputy as the "people's elected representative, authorized to exercise legislative power in the corresponding chamber of the Federal Assembly." Moreover, according to Yeltsin, the legislative function is the deputy's "sole" constitutional function. He argued that the oversight functions prescribed in the law are "in no way connected with parliament's legislative activity" and violate the constitution's separation of powers by combining "legislative, executive, and monitoring functions." According to Yeltsin, the law's oversight provisions demonstrate that deputies continue "as before" to view themselves as an "individual state official . . . and possessor of extensive independent powers" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 May), an oblique but obvious reference to broadly empowered Supreme Soviet deputies. Yeltsin's Strict Constructionism Yeltsin appears to be basing his view that deputies should function exclusively in a legislative role on a narrow interpretation of the constitution. While the constitution contains no explicit language on the role of legislators, Article 94 defines the Federal Assembly as the "representative and legislative organ of the Russian Federation" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 December 1993). By contrast, Article 1O7 of the previous Russian Constitution--based on the 1978 RSFSR Constitution- -explicitly gave deputies a significant oversight role by defining the Supreme Soviet--the standing parliament--more broadly as a "legislative, directive, and supervisory body of governmental authority" (Konstitutsiya Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 1992). Opposition From Deputies Predictably, Yeltsin's narrow interpretation of lawmakers' functions has already met with opposition from some deputies who want to see the legislature more broadly empowered to counterbalance the executive. Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the Duma's Legislation, Judicial, and Legal Reform Committee and a staunch Yeltsin foe, has complained that a narrow legislative function turns deputies into "a minor official with a large wage," whose only right is to "press the voting button" to vote on legislation. According to Isakov--who may be articulating the position of a significant number of opposition deputies, particularly those who served in the old Supreme Soviet--a deputy is a "plenipotentiary representative of his voters" and the "guarantor of the rights and freedoms of his own electors." Isakov has vociferously supported the right of deputies to question any state official, arguing that "in a rule-of-law state any citizen has the right to appeal to any official and any official is obliged to answer" (Trud, 11 May; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 17 May). Isakov also claims that Yeltsin wants to do away with the legislature's practice of questioning members of the federal government--" the most important institution of democracy since the birth of the parliamentary system"--charging that Yeltsin's intention is to turn the Federal Assembly into a mere "democratic adornment" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 17 May). Duma's Response Cool Although under no legal obligation-to amend a signed law, the Duma has signaled some receptivity to Yeltsin's proposals by forming a conciliation commission to review the legislation and also addressing Yeltsin's proposals in plenary sessions. The commission's chairman, Valentin Kovalev, a deputy chairman of the Duma and Communist Party (CPRF) representative, has indicated that the Duma is "favorably disposed" to Yeltsin's proposed amendments, but he cautioned that there is no procedure allowing the Duma to suspend selected provisions of a bill (ITAR-TASS, 12 May). Suggesting that Yeltsin may have a difficult time selling his proposals to the deputies, an attempt by Ruslan Orekhov, head of Yeltsin's State-Legal Directorate, to represent the president's position reportedly met with a cool response from the deputies on 13 May (ITAR-TASS, 18 May). The administration's next chance to defend Yeltsin's proposals will come at an upcoming plenary session of the Duma, when Filatov is scheduled to answer further queries from deputies (ITAR-TASS, 18 May). Because media reports have not been observed to report the vote total when the Duma passed the bill, it is difficult to gauge the level of support for the law in its current form. In an indication that deputies may be reluctant to make significant modifications, a press report noted that the Duma passed the law "practically without debate" (Kommersant-Daily, 14 April), and Isakov claims that deputies "stood and applauded" when the law passed (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 17 May). Implications The issue of parliamentary oversight may prove difficult to resolve because it rests on widely diverging interpretations of the constitution, but deputies may seek to compromise with Yeltsin on his less contentious objections to the bill. The significant differences between Yeltsin and some members of the Duma on lawmakers' constitutional role may spur passage of legislation to reconstitute the Constitutional Court--potentially the final arbiter of the dispute. If, as Isakov contends, Yeltsin is in fact challenging the Federal Assembly's practice of questioning members of government at its sessions, Yeltsin appears to have embarked on a collision course with the legislature despite having signed the law.
