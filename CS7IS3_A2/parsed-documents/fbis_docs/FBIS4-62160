Gorbachev and continued by B. Yeltsin. Nowadays the representatives of our and the U.S. establishment hold diametrically opposed viewpoints on the majority of Russia's foreign and domestic policy questions. These divergences were also demonstrated by the Aspen Dialogue, a Russian-U.S. forum which took place in Sochi 1-6 May. This was the fifth in the series of dialogues, which was launched in August 1991 by the International Association of Enterprise Directors [IAED] headed by Konstantin Zatulin -- now chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations with Fellow Countrymen -- and the International Center for Civil Administration (United States) in Aspen, Colorado. The Americans, who included prominent figures from the Department of State, politicians, and political scientists -- inquired during the forum primarily about the new Russian realities and expressed misgivings about a return to authoritarianism in Russia. The case made by Presidential Council Member Andranik Migranyan that the suprapresidential powers given to Boris Yeltsin by the new Constitution will make it possible to consolidate the democratic transformations in Russia produced a cautious reaction by members of the U.S. delegation. They asked: "Is there a hope that the present enlightened authoritarianism in Russia will create democratic institutions, which will continue operating after 1996?" And they added that the Americans feel skeptical about autocracy as a means of promoting democracy. Furthermore, Greg Guroff, director of the Department of State's World Development Agency, stated that the "U.S. press" and people no longer love Yeltsin as much as they used to and that there will be no repetition of the U.S. politicians' support for actions similar to the storming of the White House in Moscow. The opinion of IAED President Mark Masarskiy was listened to with interest in this debate. He believes that "the regionalization of the economy and the federalization of the state will hinder a return to authoritarianism in Russia." In his opinion, the mere fact of the two-tier [dvukhkanalnyy] tax system will not allow the federal center to concentrate financial resources in its hands and without those resources power is not power at all. There was an equally keen exchange of opinions on mutual relations between the two great powers. "U.S. policy toward Russia is one of temporizing and indifference" -- that position was expressed by Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, well known in the United States as the number two man after Gorbachev, who helped to bring down totalitarianism across one-sixth of the globe's surface. Aleksandr Yakovlev is convinced that the United States carried out the Marshall Plan to revive West Europe after World War II solely because that plan was a continuation of its victory. But for the United States the revolution of the 1980's and 1990's in Russia was "alien." Whereas billions of dollars were spent on the Marshall Plan, nothing has been spent on aid to Russia. "Indeed, there is no need to," Aleksandr Yakovlev declared. However, the academician also noted with regret that in the United States there is no understanding of the fact that "the reform of Russia is of worldwide significance, especially for the creation of a postconfrontational situation." From that viewpoint, he believes, it would be wise for the United States and the Western powers to assist Russia's entry into the world community because that process is also proving very difficult. The U.S. delegates to the forum agreed that their country does not have a clear policy toward Russia or a clear picture of what is going on in our country. That was demonstrated by a movie about Russia which David Shipler, a U.S. journalist who for many years was THE NEW YORK TIMES Moscow correspondent, brought to Sochi. Presented as an "intellectual product," this movie was, in the opinion of the Russian participants in the forum, a superficial reportage which did not reflect the essence of the Russian political process even in the slightest. The participants in the Aspen Dialogue displayed a mutual lack of understanding about the future of the CIS as well. When the Russian politicians, in particular Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations with Fellow Countrymen, explained to the participants in the forum that Russia cannot leave the 25 million Russian speakers living in the neighboring foreign countries to the whim of fate, the Americans immediately countered that by saying: "Does that mean that the United States must bear the responsibility for the entire English-speaking population of the world?" They refused to take into account Andranik Migranyan's arguments that "Russia is not indifferent to the direction of the development of the CIS republics because instability and conflicts in the Commonwealth countries influence the domestic political situation in Russia itself." The mutual lack of understanding of the two states' politicians stems, in A. Yakovlev's opinion, from the burden of the old ideological cliches, from the legacy of Sovietology -- a "lost science in a lost era." However, as for the creation of an atmosphere of trust between the two powers, this, according to the U.S. representatives, cannot be formed "centrally" but must develop "from the grass roots." The question repeated most often by the U.S. delegation at the forum was about the preferable forms of aid to Russia. In Mark Masarskiy's opinion, since small and medium business is the natural environment for the development of democracy, that is where aid must be given first of all, bypassing the government. But ITAR-TASS General Director Vitaliy Ignatenko noted that the press remains an important instrument of democracy and if the world community does not want to lose the free flow of information from Russia and the CIS countries this flow cannot be left without injections of finance otherwise it will dry up. The Aspen Dialogue showed once again how difficult the path toward mutual understanding is and that it is not only the politicians who have to shoulder those difficulties.
