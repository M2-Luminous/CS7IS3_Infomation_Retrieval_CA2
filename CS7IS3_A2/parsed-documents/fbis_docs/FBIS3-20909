"It is absolutely essential for us to be able to get beyond the recession so that the basis of our know-how is preserved and we can reap the fruits of our investments in a national system of innovations in the future as well," the chairman of the council, Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), said during a press conference on the report in Helsinki on Friday. According to him, it is also a question of changes in challenges. "Internationalization is imposing a demand for absolute quality. Only high-quality products are successful on international markets, just as only research that represents the international level has a chance of participating in international collaboration on equal terms." Funding for Research Must Be Realistically Increased The report that outlines the three-year period, 1994-1996, "A Finland of Knowledge and Know-How," considers it to be especially important for us to be able to realistically increase funding for research and do it so that the percentage of the gross national product (GNP) invested in research increases. Both private firms and the state must increase funding for research. The goal is a 2.7-percent share of the GNP by 1997. With this relative investment Finland would rank fifth among the OECD countries this year. The Science and Technology Council points out that government funding for research will clearly be reduced next year. The detrimental effects of the cuts will especially heavily hit the universities. The council considers preservation of their ability to operate to be important. According to it, university research resources would have to be developed in cooperation with the Academy of Finland. Painful Decisions Have to Be Made We must be able to improve the quality and productivity of research. As the chief ways of doing this, Aho cited making appropriations more competitive, systematic evaluation of research projects, and structural improvement of research activities. "We are also inevitably facing painful decisions: the reallocation of funds and the elimination of poor quality research without prospects of success," Aho said. In its development strategy the Science and Technology Council expresses the view that, in addition, new funds are needed to achieve objectives of current importance and to strengthen our future know-how. More Funds Through Budget-Internal Transfers "In connection with this, the council has concentrated on the status of basic research and the universities and on the possibilities of increasing our contribution to research and development projects stemming from the needs of the future through budget-internal transfers of funds. It is obvious that the new funds must be channeled to carefully selected projects," Aho said. The vice chairman of the council, Minister Seppo Kaariainen (Center Party), pointed out that the development of private sector activities based on knowledge and know-how will have a significant effect on the society's ability to create new jobs. "This development will be stronger than it has been in the future. For example, the electrical equipment and electronics industry has itself estimated that it will need 10,000 new, well-trained employees for research, production, and marketing jobs over the next few years." Opportunities for Innovations Must Be Created According to him, if it is implemented, this development would have noticeably more far-reaching effects on employment when we include the indirect effects on employment in subcontracting networks and the service sector. "It goes without saying that the public sector must protect opportunities for realizing this development by developing a national innovation system," Kaariainen said. As a member of the council who participated in the study, Prof. Ilkka Niiniluoto was, like the other investigators, satisfied with the report's appropriation guidelines. "The message is ideally suited to raising people's spirits, which are currently at a very low ebb in the universities," he said. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Government Research Appropriations in Budget Proposals for 1991-1993 by O-| |rganization | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Millions of Markkaa |Real Change (%| | | |) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |1992 |1993 |1991-1993 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Universities |1,513 |1,541 |1,481 |-5.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Academy of Fi-|449 |450 |449 |-3.2 | |nland | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tekes* |930 |1,040 |1,347 |+40.2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Research inst-|1,580 |1,624 |1,560 |-4.5 | |itutes | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other funding |790 |836 |897 |+9.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |5,262 |5,491 |5,734 |+5.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* [Technology Development Center] | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Academy of Finland | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
