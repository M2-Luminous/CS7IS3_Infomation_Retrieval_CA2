Panou Koffi, spokesman for the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally (RPT) explained the decision by saying "People were prevented from voting" in Sunday's second, run-off round of general elections. The opposition coalition meanwhile claimed victory, declaring that had taken at least 42 of the 81 parliamentary seats, which would compel General Eyadema to choose a prime minister from its ranks. But the smaller opposition party, the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) warned that it would quit the new parliament if results were annulled in five constituencies where the RPT has accused its rivals of violence and vote-rigging. [passage omitted] The national electoral commission has announced that the opposition had taken a two-seat lead over Eyadema's supporters with 39 to 37, with the outcome known in 77 constituencies. Former transitional premier Joseph Koffigoh, who stood as an independent, also won a seat in the West African country's first multi-party polls, but it was not clear which way he would lean. Imposed on Eyadema in 1991 by a national conference to pave the way for multi-party democracy, Koffigoh was subsequently accused by opposition parties of falling into the camp of Togo's ruler. The election results contested by the government concern a seat officially said to have been taken by the opposition and the four constituencies where the outcome had yet to be announced. On unofficial figures, the opposition was said to have won all four. "If there is an annulment, the UTD will pull out of the game," Ajavon Ata Messan, secretary general of the party and its candidate in a Lome constituency contested by the government, told AFP. "It won't take part in anything, in any case not the new national assembly," he added. On official results, the UTD has so far won six seats. [passage omitted] Electoral commission chief Garba Sipophon on Tuesday said the body would deliver its findings in the evening to the Supreme Court, the sole authority empowered to rule on the validity or the annulment of votes. The Burkinabe head of an international team of election monitors, Hermann Yameogo, said he would "not be astonished" if the court decided to annul some results. The interior ministry denounced "regrettable and anti-democratic incidents," declaring that "a number of voters were not able to make their choice freely." [passage omitted]
