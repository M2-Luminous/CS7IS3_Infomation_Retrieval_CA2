The leading figure of the SKOI is former Czechoslovak Interior Minister Jan Langos. The governing KDH (18 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak parliament and 8-10 percent in polls) had conducted talks with several right- wing and centrist parties about their possible joint slate. "It was not possible to wait any longer," Carnogursky said about the National Democratic Party (NDS) whose representatives showed interest in the KDH slate in early June. However, two weeks ago, they received a similar offer from Premier Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union (DU) and stopped the talks with the Christian democrats. The final version of the KDH slate will be approved on July 9, Carnogursky reported. The elections will be held on September 30-October 1.
