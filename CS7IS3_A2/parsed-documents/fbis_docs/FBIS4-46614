They consider him one of them. And I think now it is understandable why the Cossack atamans of Far Russia unanimously chose Chechevatov as their "nakaznoy ataman" [Translator note: name given a Cossack ataman appointed by Czarist authorities in prerevolutionary Russia]... [Usoltsev] Viktor Stepanovich, many political figures of the most varied calibers and ranks are flirting with the Cossacks today and trying to get into their good graces, i.e., to be in your position--love, esteem, respect... What do you think? What is moving these politicians toward the Cossacks? [Chechevatov] Well, you turned out to have a whole "bouquet" of questions. So from my own experience I am to analyze the goals of people who, I assume, are simply using the Cossacks to achieve their own interests and advantages in politics? My experience will not serve. All my heart and soul is with the Cossacks. These are the kind of bright people which our homeland needs today! This is strength. That is why people stick to them. This is a special spiritual world order of our excellent ethnic "mix." And to "play" with the Cossacks today, to "flirt" with them, I believe, is to ruin, deliberately ruin, the sprouts of our state rebirth. They wish to use them, but for destructive purposes. And the Cossacks... They are an open people; they often trust those who lead them not at all where they should be going, where our Russia herself should be going... Today so much "dirt" and "garbage" has attached itself to the Cossacks, and there are so many "masqueraders" among them... "Masqueraders" not just outwardly, but also inwardly, defective in their thoughts... And it seems to me that there is practically no fight going on against all this that is false, counterfeit, and superficial in the Cossack environment. I often say this to Cossacks at meetings. For this compromises the whole movement and generates mistrust in the Cossacks among those around them in the best case, if such an expression is apropos in the given instance, and generates caustic gibes and open jeers in the worst case. But I believe that the Cossacks still will not give up their banners and their military glory to the dirty hands of others. Recently I returned from an official trip along the Amur and Ussuri. I spent time in Cossack stanitsas. Traditions are alive, and traditions are like roots for a tree. There are roots, they "pump" the earth's strength, allowing everything else to have knowledge and to exist. Hereditary Cossacks again are here among us--the Kalmykovs, Nazarovs, Poluyanovs, Byankins. They know how to teach sense to Cossack "saplings," how to kindle love for the Motherland in their hearts, how to develop a sense of Duty, Honor and a soldier's self-sacrifice for the sake of the land on which they were born. And the Cossack stanitsas themselves? It is as if you are in another world. Take Mogilevka, for example. Wise, strong Cossacks live and create here. The houses are a feast for the eyes, always with a good harvest, no despondency, and the people believe in tomorrow because they are preparing this tomorrow for themselves, without indulging in vain expectations. You know, after meeting with such people, you feel an absolutely spiritual uplift and the world seems brighter... All in all, it turns out that the district commander has become sentimental. And as one of Aleksandr Kuprin's main characters noted, this is contraindicated for us military people. No? Has the time come to talk about Cossack soldiers? [Usoltsev] Do you mean establishing Cossack subunits in the district? [Chechevatov] You just now used the concept of "subunit." Some Cossacks and atamans are offended if we use this word and not "formation," let's say, or "unit" at worst. It is humiliating, they say. We, they say, are ready to field corps and armies today. You are not ready, I respond. Why do you begin to compromise a good thing? And then, what kind of new game in "gigantomania" is this? Don't make the first steps painfully wide, you can sprain an ankle. And who needs the lame? Not all of them understand the jokes and they take offence... As a rule, the ones arguing about "corps" are those who are not thinking about the job itself, but about themselves in the job so as to be in the public eye and be an important figure. In general, of course, many have appeared today who wish to command "corps" and be resplendent in a general's shoulderboards, considering that for some Cossacks, I notice, it is a rather simple matter with ranks--whatever I like, is okay, I will appropriate it. By the way, there already has been a discussion about all this. My opinion is that the time has come to begin serious work on a program for military training of young Cossacks "locally" in their native stanitsas. For previously how was it? A Cossack would come to serve after being already sufficiently trained professionally. We began to undertake something in this direction. Classes are held in military affairs in a number of Cossack stanitsas under the direction of the atamans and with the help of officers and NCO's discharged to the reserve. The district command element makes available its training grounds and firing ranges for these purposes and allocates weapons and ammunition. Many active-duty officers also work with young Cossacks and prepare replacements for themselves--as a rule, on days off and on off-duty time; on personal time, as we say. This already is the most genuine, selfless devotion. It turns out that despite everything, genuine officers have not become extinct here. Today Cossacks living along the border already know where they are to go in case the situation is exacerbated and a threat arises for Russia, where to draw weapons, and in what weapon emplacement to perform the combat mission. We have begun making it a practice to involve Cossacks in security of military depots and other Army installations. By the way, security and defense of Big Ussuri Island even now has been assigned to Cossacks. A Cossack company has been established there and young Cossacks are serving worthily. As district commander, I would like to name the best by first and last name. All are "hereditary stanitsa inhabitants": privates Aleksandr Chernyshov, Konstantin Mamontov, Vladimir Ivanov, Sergey Petaltsev. The district command element views Cossacks as a real military force, as its reliable reserve, and of course we will not leave them one on one with problems. [Usoltsev] Cossacks complain of the absence of a uniform and gear. All this now costs much money. And where to get horses? Can the district help here? [Chechevatov] We will help the Cossacks with uniforms and gear. Consider this matter taken off the agenda. With respect to horses, they have begun to be raised in stanitsas which are being revived. In that same Mogilevka. While he was a sovkhoz director, present Ataman Vladimir Torkhov founded a horse-breeding farm there, built a gallop-course, and involved dozens of boys and girls in classes in equestrian sport. It was from here for the first time in the region, and probably in the entire former Soviet Union, that young boys began leaving with their own horses to serve in the Border Guard Troops. No, any problem can be solved--if, of course, there is a desire to solve it. If there are people who dream of making Russia great and bringing up a new generation of her true sons, reliable defenders of native borders. These will not be "poteshny troops" [Translator note: refers to the boy-soldiers of Peter I]. These troops will be the pride of our Armed Forces. I believe this.
