This year, vietsovpetro plans to tap 6.9 million tonnes of crude oil, an increase of 600,000 tonnes over last year's figure, while setting a target of 50 million tonnes from now to 2000. To reach that goal, vietsovpetro has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the purchase of new drilling vessels, 155,000 tonne tankers, while renewing derrick equipment. Preparations are being made to begin the operation in the second oilfield, nearby Rong (Dragon) within this year. Two rigs have been set up and six wells have been sunk on this new field. Bach Ho (white tiger) is the first oilfield to begin commercial production in the country: vietsovpetro has already pumped over 14 million tonnes of crude oil from white tiger oilfield. Vietsovpetro is a joint venture between Vietnam and the former Soviet Union, and has been operating since 1986.
