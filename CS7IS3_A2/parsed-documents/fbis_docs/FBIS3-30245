Although a government-sponsored bill on orders, a document on European coproduction in film-making, and an amendment to the law on financing political parties and movements from the state budget were also on the agenda, most of the day was taken up by the debate on the Law on Signposts. In spite of that, the law did not pass. The bill on orders met, for the time being, with the same fate. In the debate on the legislative norm on signposts, Deputy Jan Pivoluska, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], proposed that an ethnic minority's minimum representation in a community required for the installation of signposts in the minority's language be raised from 20 percent [as recommended in the government bill] to 50 percent. Erno Rozsa, Coexistence, on the other hand, proposed that 10 percent of ethnic minority members in a community should be sufficient for the community to be designated also in their language. Miroslav Gandi, HZDS, ended his contribution with an appeal for the unification of deputies representing Slovak political parties against the demands of the Hungarian coalition. Ladislav Pittner, Christian Democratic Movement, stressed in the debate that one cannot fight irridentism by suppressing the rights of ethnic minorities and that ethnic minorities must be accommodated in line with European conventions. Igor Gazdik endorsed the Hungarian coalition's proposal on behalf of the Club of Independent Deputies. Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, communications, and public works, discussed linguistic aspects and how the names of communities came about. Deputies Rejected Everything Most changes proposed in the [parliamentary committees' rapporteurs'] joint report and during the debate by individual deputies did not pass. The deputies also turned down the comprehensive proposal tabled by the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Coexistence coalition, changing substantial portions of the law. Of the 134 parliamentarians present, 52 voted for the proposal of the Hungarian coalition, 65 against, and 17 abstained. The proposal that communities should be able to have names in the language of ethnic minorities on the basis of a decision by the local council, or on the basis of a local referendum, did not pass, either; it was short of three votes. During the final vote on the amendments, 132 deputies reported their presence. The law was not approved because only 64 deputies voted in its favor, while 35 voted against and 33 abstained. [passage omitted] The 26th NRSR meeting will continue next Wednesday [2 February].
