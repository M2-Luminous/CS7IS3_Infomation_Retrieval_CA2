All encounters took place 50 to 70 kilometers from the Thai border, except for the fighting opposite Mae Sai District of Chiang Rai Province. Government troops and the rebels in the vicinities of Namon and Hin Kong Mountains and Mong Chot Town continuously exchanged artillery shelling. It is believed that the new units sent to reinforce the government's position at Thachilek border town are planning to attack the rebels now surrounding Mong Chot, Mong Ton, and Mong Pan Townships. Kun Sa's men reportedly have set up a field hospital opposite Lak Taeng Village of Tambon Wiang Luang, Wiang Heng District, Chiang Mai Province. The hospital is capable of providing treatment for 300 patients. Meanwhile, Khun Sa has dispatched 3,000 men from Mong Mai, opposite Mae Hong Son Province, to the northeastern region of the Shan State. Major General Yutthana Muangmangkhang, commander of the 33d Military Circle in Chiang Mai Province, ordered reinforcements for the security force at Doi Tung Royal Villa, the residence of the princess mother, because the fighting between Burmese Government troops and rebels are not very far from the place.
