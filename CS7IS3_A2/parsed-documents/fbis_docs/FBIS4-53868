FBIS4-53868 "dreas100__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-100-A Daily Report 9 May 1994 ANNEX Japan NEDO Partnership Wins China Environment Contract NEDO Partnership Wins China Environment Contract 942A0196A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 May 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0196A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] A partnership composed of Chiyoda Corporation and the Petroleum Energy Center (Yasutomo Tateuchi, chairman) has accepted a contract to participate in Chinese projects to conserve energy and preserve the environment. As part of a model project implemented by the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), the partnership will provide technical assistance in the recycling of gases emitted in the operation of refineries to generate electrical power. The project will extend over three years from this fiscal year to encompass a 30-month construction period and will cost about 2.5 billion yen. Chiyoda Corp. has been exerting special efforts in winning contracts for environmental preservation projects in developing nations. The model project represents a joint venture between NEDO, the Chinese National Planning Committee and China Petrochemical Company (CINOPEC) and involves the construction of an energy recovery system in the fluid contact cracking (FCC) unit of the Shengli Refinery with an annual capacity of 7 million tons in Zilu, Shandong Province. The project has been subdivided so that Chiyoda Corporation will handle the engineering phase of the petroleum refinery-related system and the Petroleum Energy Center will handle the training of local personnel in the operation and maintenance of the new system. The system will gasify heavy crude at high temperatures, cause the separation of high-octane gasolines and light oils and extract high-temperature, high-compression gas emissions from the newly constructed FCC recycling tower for in-house generation of electricity through the use of an expander turbine. The system will enable a reduction in energy consumption and enhance environmental preservation by capturing catalytic particles including heavy metals which were formerly released into the atmosphere. Chiyoda Corporation has also tied up with the Engineering Promotion Association (Yoshihiko Kamitoko, chairman) in winning a contract from NEDO this fiscal year to install a simple sulphur removal system at China's Chongqing Zhangshou Chemical Plant as a model project promoting clean coal technology in support of the effective use of coal and prevention of environmental pollution. These organizations will beef up their technical assistance programs in response to the increasing number of environment-related projects in China and Southeast Asia.
