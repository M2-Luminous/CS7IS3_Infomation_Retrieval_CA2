During a meeting he had Thursday, 21 April, at Victoria Palace with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Mr. Kopliku made a point of saying that after 45 years of isolation Albania's most important foreign policy objective is the opening to all European states, and primarily to the Balkan states. Both sides shared the opinion that the Romanian-Albanian relations, by their traditionally friendly nature, are an example of cordiality between peoples in this so very troubled region of Europe. The multiple problems generated by the Balkans' ethnic patchwork configuration do not exclude the possibility of their becoming the bridge between states, as is the case of the Albanian minority in Romania, was one of the positive ideas of the meeting. The dialogue enabled the two sides to exchange opinions on the stage reached by the reform process in their countries.
