This is how we may describe what has been happening since Wednesday morning at the old Moscow town house at 11 Kolpachniy Pereulok. Press Service Director Yuriy Kobaladze has been parrying questions about Aldrich Ames, the Soviet-Russian agent in the CIA, which journalists have been asking all day, with just one answer: "We have no comment to make on events in Washington" and "the Foreign Intelligence Service is concerned and would not want to see anything hamper the building of good relations between the United States and Russia." Replying to an IZVESTIYA question about how our intelligence service -- when it was still Soviet -- managed to recruit such a high-ranking CIA staffer as Aldrich Hames, Yuriy Georgiyevich sighed heavily: "Who told you we recruited him?" My explanation -- that Bill Clinton himself had told everybody that Ames had been recruited -- provoked an altogether human reaction from the chief of the intelligence service Press Center. "Well, you must understand that I am not the president or the Foreign Ministry! I cannot comment. And no special service in the world would comment on whether a particular person is one of its agents or not. If I say yes, then I put a guilty man in the dock, and if I say no, you will ask me to prove it. Basically, the official position of the Russian intelligence service is not to comment!" Mr. Kobaladze stated. In order to find out about the Russian intelligence service's unofficial policy, we had to approach a ranking Foreign Intelligence Service staffer who asked us not to reveal his name. Thus something unusual has happened in the normal practice of intelligence services. The U.S. President has personally informed the whole world that the FBI has caught a former Soviet and now Russian spy together with his wife, also a spy. The Russian intelligence service representative believes that Clinton has started a real "spy-mania" which has not been long in coming. All the American newspapers have taken up the improbable scandal, and the arrest of the Ameses has been covered in great detail. The intelligence service representative did not agree that the arrest of such important agents could be regarded as a setback. "Just a minute, why do you think it's a setback?! The intelligence service has recruited practically the head of the department. What do you call that, a setback?! In this matter interpretation is everything. Well...of course, the fact they have been arrested is not a good thing. The intelligence service certainly can't rejoice about it. But it is completely wrong to state unequivocally that it is a setback," the representative told IZVESTIYA. He did not deny that all the fuss that has been made could be connected with the fact that the FBI and CIA are worrying about their budgets. Propaganda stunts of this nature are practiced by intelligence services all over the world. Particularly in countries where public opinion has an impact on the size of the budget. In this representative's opinion, today Moscow could also arrest CIA agents in Russia and create a furor. "But we won't be doing this," the representative added; he believes that Russian spying against the United States is at least no greater than the level of U.S. intelligence activity against the former Soviet Union. And so the facts look like this. It is clear that Clinton has taken an unprecedented step by personally announcing the capture of a spy, thus linking his name with the success of the special services forever. From this it would seem that the proof of Ames's guilt cannot be doubted. Moreover, the CIA and FBI are not getting tired of praising one another, which is also surprising. The squabbling between these two departments has long been a tradition. Finally, one last point. The Ames agents apparently did everything in their power to ensure that the FBI found them out. They bought a house in a luxurious suburb of Washington and paid for it with a lump sum rather than in installments. They bought a very expensive sports car. And most surprising of all, they spent an enormous quantity of money which far exceeded their salaries. And when they spent all this money, as if for the FBI's convenience, they used credit cards rather than cash! All this is somehow not very hush-hush. Judging by the reaction of Russian departments and the text of the U.S. protest note, it has been suggested that our country should stay silent until the United States has concluded its investigation and Clinton has won his brownie points. All the indications are that there are no specific complaints against Russia.
