Of course, Balladur can argue that he did not like the reform. He gave into his majority. But the lay torrent that was unleashed plunged him into an abyss of perplexity. An eminently reasonable man, Balladur is fearful of the irruption of the irrational in the political debate. The mastery of communication skills he has shown since March 1993 has obscured the fact that the prime minister is a neophyte in politics. Unlike Francois Mitterrand or [Rally for the Republic leader] Jacques Chirac, he lacks decades spent in the provinces in his background. His knowledge of France is not carnal. A simple councilman in Paris, he cannot even be seen as really locally chosen. Outside ministerial cabinets, Balladur has only frequented the world of the companies. [passage omitted] Today, Balladur has learned to consult polls. But let their predictions not come true, and the prime minister finds himself without a compass. All the more so since he has formed a cabinet in his image. While agile spirits abound around him, most are known for their total lack of knowledge of the terrain. A very "Balladurian" minister noted last week that the "Matignon" [prime minister's office] lacks one or two experienced men who would anticipate low blows. Such sentinels would be useful because, contrary to common belief, Balladur grants a lot of freedom to his flock. Because he has learned to like television platforms and eclipsed the government, some people deduced that the ministers were only shadows. Wrong: they have regained a power lost since Pompidou. A member of a ministerial cabinet under Giscard d'Estaing notes: "At that time, a minister was unable to promise a cent without the green light of an Elysee [president's office] adviser. On the contrary, Balladur has let his ministers become responsible. He trusts us." The prime minister told the members of his cabinet that they should not be replacements for the government. He himself opted for rather loose control. Balladur preaches "interministeriality." In his view, the prime minister's intervention is only justified if there is a conflict between two ministers. But let a minister propose an apparently well-planned project and claim it can be carried out, and Balladur easily gives the green light. [passage omitted] This is one of the main reasons for the infatuation numerous ministers feel for their leader. They have the feeling of being real bosses, not just simple cogs. But it is surely also one of the reasons for the dysfunctions noted in the government's action in the last nine months: the absence of a filter. An absence all the more damaging given that a number of ministers have revealed themselves to be inexperienced, if not downright deficient. With the Matignon's lack of flair, this will probably remain the main lesson of the Falloux episode: Professor Balladur is singularly lax with his small governmental class.
