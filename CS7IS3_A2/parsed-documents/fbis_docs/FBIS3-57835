[Schaeuble] No, honestly, that is not true. The first time I came across this issue was during the 1985 world economic summit in Bonn. There were rumors of a possible air attack. Only the Bundeswehr would have been able to prevent such a strike. Yet due to the strict regulations under the Basic Law, the Bundeswehr is not allowed to get involved in such a case. [DER SPIEGEL] Even friends from your own party fail to understand what made you bring up this preposterous subject in the peaceful time before Christmas? Was it intended to sharpen the CDU's profile? [Schaeuble] No, I am concerned about the matter itself. [DER SPIEGEL] You certainly knew that the necessary Basic Law amendment would not achieve a two-thirds majority in the parliament. [Schaeuble] Well, I think that in the foreseeable future we will get a decision on the framework of the Basic Law for Bundeswehr missions. It will be a good opportunity to continue this debate. The first reaction by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] somewhat reminded me of the Pavlovian reflex: When you show the dog the sausage it begins to salivate. [DER SPIEGEL] The name of the sausage was: With this subject Schaeuble wanted to impress friends on the right fringe. [Schaeuble] No, not at all. There is a broad common agreement -- this includes the SPD -- that we have to do more for internal security, which is why I thought it important to broach this subject in view of the beginning of a new year. [DER SPIEGEL] Let us come back to your example of the world economic summit. Nobody can prevent terrorists from firing missiles at Bonn from some place -- neither the Bundeswehr, nor the police nor the Federal Border Police. [Schaeuble] I felt very uncomfortable at the time. Let us take an example that is technologically less ambitious, a model aircraft carrying explosives. Of course one could do something against it, namely shoot down such a flying object; yet, the Bundeswehr is not permitted to do that. [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not ask: How could one improve the equipment of the Federal Border Police to enable it to deal with such threats? You are looking for a subject that creates controversy. [Schaeuble] I do not see it as such. If the result of the discussion was that more is done for the Federal Border Police it would be a good consequence. The ridiculous thing about the debate is that people in Germany act as if my proposal were an axe looming over the roots of democracy. [DER SPIEGEL] There are historical sensibilities. [Schaeuble] One must not rule everything out from the very beginning or regard it as taboo by pointing to special experience from our history. I certainly do not underestimate this objection. However, I am asking myself - particularly regarding the Germans' historical experience -- whether it is good to do everything differently from other countries. Sometimes we could really adopt something from traditional democracies. From France to America and New Zealand -- it is possible to use military forces everywhere for missions at home also. [DER SPIEGEL] You have yourself mentioned an example from the United States, namely the attack against the World Trade Center, which was blamed on Islamic fundamentalists. The Americans did not resort to the Army. [Schaeuble] What is certain is that the borderline between internal and external security can no longer be defined as clearly as in the past. Therefore, it must be possible to resort to the Bundeswehr as a kind of security reserve. It is stupid to conclude from this that one should shoot at demonstrators . [DER SPIEGEL] During the debate on emergency laws in the era of Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Chancellor Kiesinger the idea was discussed to use the Bundeswehr also against demonstrators and strikers. [Schaeuble] I fear that the liberal democracy is threatened once people get increasingly worried about the state no longer being able to sufficiently guarantee their protection. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think that the state is too weak? [Schaeuble] Of course one can say that the history of Western democracies is the history of the limitation of state powers to guarantee the freedom of the individual. That is undoubtedly true. Yet, today I am worried that the people regard the state as too weak and that this might constitute a danger to freedom. [DER SPIEGEL] So you are in favor of a strong state. [Schaeuble] I would like to see the state as strong enough to prevent people from thinking that they have to turn to some kind of radical forces for shelter. [DER SPIEGEL] None of the examples that you mentioned, not even that of "international migratory movements," requires the use of the Bundeswehr for missions at home. [Schaeuble] This is a case that I took over from Polish President Lech Walesa. He said that he would open his country's borders in the east and west so that refugees from Russia could travel on to the FRG. Still, I do not want to press for a discussion on individual examples because I might then be accused of trying to scare people. [DER SPIEGEL] Your colleague Gerster mentioned as a first example the "import of organized crime." Should the Bundeswehr perhaps be used to fight crime in the future? [Schaeuble] I think that Johannes Gerster's considerations were correct: We must be able to respond to any conceivable situation. And I have explicitly invited everybody to discuss this. [DER SPIEGEL] You have yourself said that taboos have to be broken: using the Bundeswehr for missions at home now that missions outside the NATO area are being tried out. The existing consensus is thus being smashed in decisive points. Do you want a different republic? [Schaeuble] Certainly not. [DER SPIEGEL] Other profound changes such as limiting the right to asylum or bugging apartments show how the course is set for a new direction. [Schaeuble] I do not consider those to be profound changes. All I want is to guarantee security for the citizens at home and toward the outside. I think that my worries -- namely that our efforts in this connection are rather too lax than too great -- are shared by the majority of the people. [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not frankly say what you want? Maybe your demand for a strong state and your appeal to national feelings will help you to gain the necessary support for continuing the coalition between the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. [Schaeuble] You are constantly suggesting that I want a different republic. No, I want to preserve this republic. [DER SPIEGEL] Recent surveys do not indicate that the citizens are impressed with your ideas: According to Emnid, support for the CDU/CSU was 27 percent in December, which means that is was only 4 percentage points ahead of the group of those who said they would abstain in the election. [Schaeuble] I can fully understand that the people are confused; constant controversies and negotiations on every new issue. Many Basic Law amendments are required; in the Bundesrat there is a different majority, which is doing some awful things. Since people are unable to see the exact difference they blame it on the government. We must now focus on the main subjects: the economy, the labor market, and internal and external security. [DER SPIEGEL] The policy you offer in these areas only appeals to the conservative, loyal segment in your party, maybe 30 percent of the electorate. Have you stopped competing on the SPD for the votes left of center? [Schaeuble] I do not think very highly of a race intended to show who is able to promise more. After all, this is not what the great majority of people expects. The people feel that in this difficult time we are unable to preserve all our well-acquired rights and that they have to put up with greater changes than those to which they have been accustomed so far. [DER SPIEGEL] Your address to the party congress in Berlin was clearly directed to such faithful conservative voters. You criticized the social system and called for more patriotism and national feeling. Is the era of a party with a broad base, which used to range from Strauss to Bluem, over? [Schaeuble] Do you really think that Norbert Bluem does not share my opinion in issues such as patriotism and national solidarity? [DER SPIEGEL] We are thinking of the social system. This has become obvious in the controversy over nursing-care insurance. [Schaeuble] Come on: We have been trying hard for years to create the basis for nursing-care insurance at a time the framework conditions for a further increase in labor cost do not exist. This is what Bluem has quite rightly described as "rebuilding." This is a much nicer word for something related to compensation -- that is to say compensation for higher costs on the part of the employer. Bluem's, Geissler's, and my priority is to get nursing-care insurance now by accepting cuts in other spheres of our social security system. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schaeuble, you are covering up the problems of this debate. Together with the chairman of the FDP Bundestag group, Solms, and the employers' associations you led to a culmination of the controversy over one or two public holidays of compensation, which almost led to the resignation of the labor minister. Just as with the SPD, Bluem considers one day to be enough. [Schaeuble] What is true is that we had to make concessions to the SPD whether we liked it or not, even though Bluem and I were of a different opinion: We had to drop our proposal of making people bear part of the risks themselves for continued wage payments in case of sickness. This would have been the correct compensation. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you intending to foil nursing-care insurance because of a difference of one public holiday? [Schaeuble] Considering our weak economy the compensatory effect of abolished public holidays regarding the cost of labor is problematic. We opted for this path only to win the SPD's support for nursing-care insurance. But, two days are the absolute minimum. Besides, this does not mean that bearing parts of the risk of continued wage payments may not be discussed again in the next legislative term. [DER SPIEGEL] Kurt Biedenkopf has now repeated his old thesis and you supported him: As of the year 2020, pensions will no longer be safe. Are you planning to bring up the pension issue in the election campaign? [Schaeuble] No. Bluem as well as myself are saying that the pensions for the current generation of pensioners and those who are near retirement age are safe. Still, politics is never made for eternity. Considering the foreseeable demographic developments -- more and more pensioners, fewer and fewer working people -- we now have to think of how pensions can remain secure and how they can be financed in a more distant future, too. On this issue I cannot contradict Biedenkopf. Why should one not discuss difficult and long-term problems also in an election year? [DER SPIEGEL] Do you agree with your colleague Volker Ruehe who has linked the fate of this government to the way in which it will fill the gaps in the federal budget? [Schaeuble] If I remember correctly the 1994 budget already passed the Bundestag. [DER SPIEGEL] Correct. Yet, the various ministries still have to effect 7.5 billion German marks [DM] in cuts. The chairman of the Budget Committee, Rudi Walther, even estimates that the gap will be DM15-20 billion. FDP officials Solms and Lambsdorff have called for a supplementary budget and a budget safeguarding law. [Schaeuble] I was a Cabinet member for longer than most current government members, which is why I know that strict implementation of the budget can save much more than many people will admit today. [DER SPIEGEL] Lambsdorff has described people who make such proposals as "fools." [Schaeuble] I suppose that Mr. Lambsdorff just approved of the budget. Look at the dramatic developments in the labor market: When we devised the 1993 budget we thought that we could do without subsidies to the Federal Labor Office. Now we need some DM20 billion. Considering these huge amounts it does not make any sense to use such militant arguments as Mr. Lambsdorff likes to apply at times. [DER SPIEGEL] The Kohl government will have to enter the election campaign with the burden of a very large number of unemployed. [Schaeuble] This is why we are considering possibilities to introduce work contracts with a time limit on a permanent basis. We also want to break up the Federal Labor Office's monopoly in the labor exchange in the entire FRG. What we will certainly have to do is to examine crucial points in our transfer system: Those who have a regular job -- even if it is only on a temporary or seasonal basis -- must have higher incomes than an unemployed person. This has nothing to do with social coldness, of which I have been accused, but with the concern that the unemployed people will accept the jobs they are offered in Germany. [DER SPIEGEL] Could a government reshuffle polish up the government's image before the election? [Schaeuble] No, not as far as I am concerned. [DER SPIEGEL] Is it necessary to have a new face at the top? [Schaeuble] Are you referring to the federal president when you say "at the top?" [DER SPIEGEL] No, we were thinking of the cabinet head. [Schaeuble] You are familiar with my opinion: In this time, which has become so insecure through the many changes, it is a great asset for our country to have such an experienced, reputable federal chancellor, who is also a strong leader. [DER SPIEGEL] Could it not be that, in comparison to the United States, the feeling that "it's time for a change" begins to spread in Germany, too? [Schaeuble] If I were in the opposition I would also bring forth such an argument. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you regard it as necessary that the person who is chancellor is also party chairman? [Schaeuble] Absolutely. In a parliamentary system in which, for the duration of one legislative term, the government is nothing else but the organized majority in the parliament, the government's and the government head's leadership power is based on the solidarity in his or her own political camp. Helmut Schmidt today regards it as his biggest mistake not to have been chairman of the major government partner when he became chancellor. [DER SPIEGEL] In your capacity as Bundestag group chairman do you regard it as your duty to advise the chancellor to step down if you think that this is the only way to maintain your party's chances in the election and to save the coalition? [Schaeuble] There is a difference between practical-political and academic discussions. You can say a lot about the abstract duties of Bundestag group chairmen. [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping has said what many other people, including CDU Bundestag deputies, think: Schaeuble has become tougher and more embittered. [Schaeuble] I do not see that. This was meant to hint at the change in my living circumstances. There can be no doubt that such an event changes one's pattern of behavior. One begins to see many things with a greater distance. However, I have the feeling that I have become more open for many things of which I did not know the first before. This not only applies to the concerns of handicapped people. I have also learned that affection and human coexistence are much more important than other things. It has upset me that leading SPD officials -- Mr. Vogel was the first one to do so in your magazine; Mr. Scharping has been the last one thus far -- have tried to label me with a cliche. [DER SPIEGEL] What cliche? [Schaeuble] That a disability must embitter a person. This is how unjustifiedly prejudice against the handicapped is being used for political purposes. This would not only hurt me but also run counter to my cause, namely to prove that handicapped people can be as active in all spheres of human life and with the same rights, responsibilities, chances, and opportunities as people who are not disabled. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you not have to welcome the fact that as a handicapped person you are able to demonstrate your efficiency in the election campaign under even more difficult conditions? [Schaeuble] Actually, I do not have to prove anything. I am grateful that I can make a contribution to politics with what I am able to do. [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schaeuble, thank you very much for the interview.
