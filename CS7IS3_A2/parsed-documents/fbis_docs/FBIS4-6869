This view has become widespread within the United Nations. Regarding Japan's contributions, however, it would be difficult for Japan to feel it is actually making contributions unless it actually participates in UN activities." Ogata, who is temporarily back in Japan, made the comments in response to a question by an ASASHI SHIMBUN reporter. She added: "It is desired that Japan participate in activities in diverse ways, whether it be refugee problems or development assistance programs. What is important is a willingness to actively contribute in areas where Japan can do its best."
