Dr. Fathi Shaqaqi, general secretary of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine spoke to our colleague in Beirut few hours ago: [Begin Shaqaqi recording, in Arabic with superimposed Persian translation] The stance taken by the UN general secretary and the head of the Security Council in condemnation of the martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula practically proves that the UN and the Security Council are controlled by U.S. policy. It took the Security Council three weeks of negotiations and great doubt to issue a resolution in condemnation of the Zionist regime in the al-Khalil massacre. But only several hours after the martyrdom-seeking operations in 'Afula, which was carried out in revenge for the al-Khalil killing, the Security Council and the UN general secretary speedily condemned the operations. This indicates the height of conformity of the UN and the Security Council to U.S. policies. Yesterday's martyrdom-seeking operations against the Zionists is a legitimate right of the Palestinians because according to international law, residents of occupied lands have the right to operate against the occupiers. [end recording] Dr. Shaqaqi referred to the signed agreement between PLO and the Zionist regime and said: [Begin Shaqaqi recording] Such an agreement will not lead to peace. On the contrary it will further inflame war because this agreement will legitimize the Zionist occupation and the Palestinian people will fight this design in whatever form they can. The continuation of anti-Zionist operations in occupied Palestine is in fact an indication of people's opposition to deals with the occupiers. [end recording]
