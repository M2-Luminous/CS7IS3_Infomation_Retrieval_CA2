In a paper of May 10, Yeltsin says that parts of the law he endorsed on May 8 were in breach of the country's Constitution. The president contests the deputy's right to unimpeded access to all government bodies--both federal and local--, and to visit plants, offices and agencies, army units and public groups--on the grounds that this has no relation to the parliament's law making activity. Nor is he for the deputy being entitled to free access to any government official and the latter being bound to give a prompt reply to his questioning. Yeltsin thinks that the law as it is now will vest the parliament with legislative, executive and controlling functions. He is also opposed to a broader interpretation of the deputy's right to a prompt reply to his questions on the grounds that this will not be an expression of the legislature's controlling function. Yeltsin thinks it necessary to bring the provision on further guarantees of parliamentary immunity in line with the appropriate clause of the Constitution. He also wants to amend parts of the law concerning the conflict between parliamentary and civil service duties. Yeltsin insists that the period that members of the armed forces, police or prosecuting officers spend carrying out parliamentary duties must be put on their usual work record and they must be allowed to resume their former jobs when their term in office expires. Yeltsin says the law on the deputies' status was adopted in breach of the constitutional procedures. Any bill providing for federal spending is subject to government approval, something that the authors of the law have failed to obtain, he said. Yeltsin pointed to the abundance of mistakes of a legal nature, terminology and style in the law saying he authorized his envoy Aleksandr Yakovlev to brief the State Duma about them in the order of the day.
