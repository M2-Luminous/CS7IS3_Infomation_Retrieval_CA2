It was the first search of university campuses since the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" government a year ago. In the two-hour raids that began at 4:30 a.m., police failed to arrest leaders of "Namchongnyon," an organization of students in Cholla-namdo and Kwangju regions, but seized four-tons of leaflets, iron pipes, clubs, fire bombs and other demonstration items. The student leaders are suspected of masterminding the raid on the U.S. Cultural Center in Kwangju last November and other protests. Some 5,000 police troops were mobilized in the pre-dawn operation during which no violence broke out. "The search was inevitable to uproot violent protests and to arrest students who led dozens of demonstrations even since the inauguration of the civilian government," a police spokesman said. "We will put riot police into any campuses from the dimension of safeguarding law and order, if radical and violent protests are to take place in the days to come," he stressed. Campus protests had almost died out last year under the influence of Kim's strong reform drive, but the government's decision to allow rice imports rekindled the students action against the agreement of the Uruguay Round talks. Student leaders last month declared they would embark on a nationwide struggle this spring to support farmers in blocking rice imports.
