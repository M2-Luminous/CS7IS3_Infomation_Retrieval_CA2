This resolution has not been fulfilled, however, and, even after its Presov assembly [on 26-27 March], the HZDS remains a broad-spectrum movement. [Meciar] The discussion about the shape the movement should take is a permanent one. Half of our members and functionaries are in favor of its transformation into a party and the others are opposed. They say that they have never been, and will never be, members of any party. It is premature to say how the HZDS will evolve because this is also connected with the support of the changing social base of society and the profile the other parties will assume. Everything will become more legible after the elections. We are holding on to the pragmatic center and will surely eventually shift somewhere, even though the evolution on the European political scene is taking another direction, away from the traditional right-center-left division. [Melis] Judging according to the present [polls on party] preferences, it can be assumed that you will score another electoral victory--one, however, that need not be as striking as that of 1992. The question therefore arises whether you will be able to set up a new government should the president entrust you with its formation, as this should be a broad-coalition government. [Meciar] Forecasting the outcome of the elections is premature because it can be influenced by a number of factors. The present preferences represent a good foundation for success, but we shall seek the broadest possible support. Two sorts of decisions will have to be made after the elections: what the citizen will say and whom I will accept and who will accept me. There is no point in sitting in the government at any price and implementing someone else's program. I do not expect many people to stay away from the polls, nor do I expect the miniparties to succeed. Those who let themselves be intoxicated by the vision of getting into the government fast miscalculated. [Melis] The government parties want to offer you one seat each in the leadership of the Supreme Inspection Office [NKU], in the National Property Fund [FNM] Presidium, and in the FNM Supervisory Board. Will you accept these offers? [Meciar] They would be well advised not to corrupt us with offers of seats in the NKU leadership because we will not recognize the NKU. The preceding leadership was recalled in contravention of the Constitution. After all, the National Council cannot, by means of a resolution, violate the Constitution and the laws of this state that it had itself passed. We cannot provide legitimacy to breach the Constitution. Let them lie on the shameful bed they made for themselves. Regarding the FNM bodies, we have proposed one candidate for each of them. We reserve the right to our own viewpoint when it comes to approving the FNM Presidium.
