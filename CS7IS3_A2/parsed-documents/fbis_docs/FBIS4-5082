The analyst says: The South Korean puppets a few days ago arrested a working member, the organizational section chief and two other core members of the Ulsan-based Hyundai Heavy Industries Trade Union on the suspicion of the violation of "the National Security Law" (NSL). Meanwhile, the puppet Labour Ministry put forward "a policy of intensifying investigation into the operation" of trade unions and announced that it "would be promoted from the viewpoint of reforms." These facts clearly show how craftily and viciously the foxy traitor Kim Yong-sam is working to suppress trade unions. The suppression is aimed at keeping the workers from being awakened and organized and from taking a massive action through trade unions. Last year in which the traitor came to power, 2,590 workers were put on the "want" list and more than 3,000 workers were fired unjustifiably for their involvement in the labour movement. As if it were not enough, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested core elements of trade unions by invoking the notorious "NSL" and is going to intensify "investigation into the operation" of trade unions. This reveals their consciousness of crisis. The reality proves that, with the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, it is impossible for the South Korean workers to win the right to existence, let alone democratic freedom. The South Korean workers will vigorously struggle to overthrow the traitor Kim Yong-sam engaged in anti-popular misrule and establish an independent, democratic government, concludes the analyst.
