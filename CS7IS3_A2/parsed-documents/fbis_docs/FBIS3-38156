At the same time, Mr. Papandreou expressed optimism about the government course and attempted to prove wrong those who are trying, as he put it, "to prove that nothing has changed after the elections." The prime minister made his first analytical address after the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] victory before the party's Central Committee (which dissolved itself in view of the party congress which will be held 14-17 April). He expressed concern over the showdowns in the upcoming elections [for European Parliament deputies and local communal authorities] and admitted that the dynamics favor the small parties and this is why he put emphasis on the need for the party's reconstruction and for a congress that should be open to society. Discussing the first months of PASOK's rule in the country, Mr. Papandreou: - Admitted that the government machinery has weaknesses, that there are coordination problems as well as different views between government departments and state organizations. However, he maintained that "the account is more than positive." - Maintained that, although it is still very early, "the people can clearly see that a new leaf is turning over for the country," that "the type of administration is changing radically," that "there is a government of democratic practice and openness as well as of new style and character." - Enumerated the first government activities: institutional change in justice, establishment of urban transportation organization, tax reforms, fairer distribution of [tax] burdens, big reforms in the administration and local self-government, gradual reinstatement of those who were oppressed, safeguarding of confidentiality in telecommunications, establishment of independent organization for the management of state supplies, enactment of a merit system in the public sector and in hiring for public service, and sensitivity toward inequalities, unemployment, and corruption. [passage omitted] Mr. Papandreou made a brief reference to national issues and foreign policy: - He talked about a "new era" in relations with the United States. - He attributed Turkey's provocations to "its tragic economic situation" and "to the struggle of the Kurds for autonomy." He also announced that in the next few weeks the cabine? will make decisions on "a multifaceted defense, economic, cultural, and social shield of the country." - He said that the Cyprus issue is the cornerstone of our national strategy and reiterated the doctrine of "joint decisionmaking" and of a "unified defense area." On the Skopje issue, he contented himself with the phrase "we are trying to pass rough dangerous straits." [passage omitted]
