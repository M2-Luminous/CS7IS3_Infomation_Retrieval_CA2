According to him, the tax reform will not change the income tax law concerning foreign investment enterprises effective as of July 1991, with all the incentives maintained. Foreign investment enterprises set up in special economic zones, coastal opening-up districts and the Pudong new area in Shanghai, will still enjoy an unchanged 15 percent preferential income tax rate, Jin Xin said. He added that for domestic enterprises, a single flat rate of 33 percent is being implemented. However, as he disclosed, the nationally unified value added tax, excise tax and business tax will be levied on enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises as of January 1, 1994, as was decided at the 5th Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). He said this was to satisfy the requirements of a socialist market economy, to equalize tax burden, as has also been the request of the enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises. Jin vowed that to keep the foreign tax policy successive and stable, the tax reform has followed an important policy principle for foreign investment enterprises, namely, the redesigning of tax rates would neither increase nor decrease the aggregate tax burden. To favor the smooth transition from the old to the new taxation system, the NPC Standing Committee has approved that for foreign- funded enterprises licensed before December 31, 1993, any tax burden increase resulting from the tax reform is to be refunded to the enterprises as approved by the tax authorities. According to him, this preferential treatment will be limited within the time period of the contract, with a maximum period of five years. But, any foreign-invested enterprises approved after January 1, 1994, will be subject to the new tax regime. Jin Xin concluded that the measure will allow foreign enterprises a five-year period to transmit management mechanisms and raise economic benefits, in order to exercise fair competition with domestic enterprises after five years. He emphasized that this measure has once again demonstrated China's determination to open up to the outside world at an accelerating pace.
