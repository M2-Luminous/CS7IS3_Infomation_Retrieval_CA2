U.S. President Bill Clinton said during North Korean-U.S. talks, Pyongyang will not conduct refueling operations at its reactor in Yongbyon or reprocess [kagong] waste fuel accumulated at the reactor. International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts stationed in North Korea will remain at its nuclear facilities [haek taesang]. Responding to Pyongyang's freezing of its nuclear program, Washington said that it will resume high-level talks with the DPRK. The United States will not bring up the issue of economic sanctions against the DPRK at the UN Security Council. The acute situation over the DPRK nuclear program has remarkably been eased. The situation was extremely aggravated by Pyongyang's refusal of a complete inspection of its nuclear facilities [haek taesange taehan sacharul wanjon surakhaji anatkko] and its declaration on withdrawing from the IAEA. Recent changes in the situation do not mean that a way to the complete solution of the North Korean nuclear problem has been found, but necessary conditions for a solution to the problem have been prepared. The international community wants to assure that weapons of mass destruction are not being produced on the Korean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said: If Pyongyang's attempt to possess nuclear weapons is ignored, other countries will try to possess nuclear weapons, following Pyongyang as a model case. Its neighboring countries, such as the ROK and Japan, will actively be engaged in developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, Russia cannot help but carefully watch the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The situation in Northeast Asia will be normalized only when Pyongyang's nuclear program is clarified. Anyhow, Pyongyang's statement on freezing its nuclear program will make South-North dialogue possible. A South-North meeting is already under discussion. The easing of tensions will make it possible to hold an international conference on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
