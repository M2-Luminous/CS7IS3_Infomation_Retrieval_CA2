Does this mean this decision will be crucial and decisive for the peace process? [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership is continuing its contacts on all levels and in more than one area, whether on the Arab or international levels. In the meantime, the PLO leadership is pursuing political activity on all levels. We would like to say that the support extended to us and the denunciation and condemnation of the massacre perpetrated against our people in Hebron are indications that the world understands and sympathizes with the just Palestinian demands. Moreover, we believe that much of the future of the political process hinges upon the positions to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government and on the measures and positions that will be taken toward the Palestinian demands for the sake of advancing the peace process and extricating it from the vicious circle. I think the experience of the past months clearly showed that it was the Palestinian side which was serious in its quest for peace, termination of all acts of violence, withdrawal, and coexistence for all peoples in the region. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the peace cosponsors--Russia and the United States--are mediating an end to the causes which stopped the peace talks. Yesterday, a Russian envoy met with Yasir 'Arafat and will meet today with the decisionmakers in Israel. What conditions has the PLO conveyed to the Russian envoy? [Ghawshah] During yesterday's meeting, the Russian envoy and brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] discussed in detail the peace process and the obstacles facing it, especially the recent developments. The most important point of discussion was the need to provide protection and security for our people, especially after it has been proven that the Israeli Army did not and will not carry out its duty in preventing attacks on our people. The two sides discussed the obstacles facing the peace process and Israel's failure to carry out its commitments as stated in the Declaration of Principles. These included its delay of withdrawal from the Jericho and Gaza areas, earlier scheduled for 13 December. The entire peace process was discussed. A basic Palestinian demand was submitted; namely, the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian people and international observers to guarantee this security. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, when do you expect the Israeli-Palestinian talks to resume and what about the Palestinian delegation which will leave for Washington? [Ghawshah] The matter depends primarily on the measures and policies to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government. This is the issue. The first fact which should be considered is the degree of seriousness in taking measures and responding to the Palestinian people's just demands. This is the first basic factor. The second is the extent to which the cosponsors of the political process will play their role and give a new push to the peace process. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO Executive Committee. Thank you very much. [Ghawshah] Thank you.
