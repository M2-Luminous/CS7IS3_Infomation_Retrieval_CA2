Members of the government cabinet continued to answer questions raised by National Assembly deputies on the implementation of socioeconomic tasks in the first six months of the year and plans for the next six months. Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and social welfare answered questions on the calculation of pensions for retired cadres, pensions and allowances for wounded soldiers, death benefits for survivors of war dead, allowances for cadres and soldiers [formerly] on combat duty in the south leaving families behind without support, and wage scales for cadres of education and medical agencies at the grassroots level. On the issue of spontaneous immigration, Minister Tran Dinh Hoan revealed major measures that the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare are applying, including the setting up of new economic zones projects in areas with many spontaneous immigrants already settled there or in areas to which they like to move. On the issue of rehabilitation for drug addicts, the minister spelled out measures currently used by the government to set up a rehabilitation service at the ward and commune level with wide cooperation from local authorities, mass organizations, and families of drug addicts. Drug addicts who use intravenous drugs should be sent to institutionalized centers; however, the most important task is always the active prevention of this social vice. Construction Minister Ngo Xuan Loc answered questions on the price of houses in Ho Chi Minh City, and revealed that in the recent past his ministry has quickly rectified errors previously committed when carrying out the task of appraising house prices . Trade Minister Le Van Triet answered questions on cases concerning paper imports, import quotas for motorcycles, and one case concerning 38 motorcars imported into Binh Dinh Province. The minister held that the Trade Ministry was basing its work on the amount of paper produced domestically to allow the import of a necessary amount of paper -- types of paper that cannot be produced here -- for use in the sector concerning external relations. The decision to withhold motorcycle import permits is in line with the government policy to use foreign currency reserves to import production supply.
