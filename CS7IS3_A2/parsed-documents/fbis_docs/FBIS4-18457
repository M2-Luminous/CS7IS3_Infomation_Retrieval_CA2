[Heseltine] It is apparent that worsening relations between the two economic giants will bring benefits to nobody. Solutions to trade problems should be sought in GATT multilateral trade negotiations. I rate highly Japan's concessions in the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks because they greatly contributed to the successful conclusion of the talks. [Sakai] How do you assess Japan's market-opening efforts? [Heseltine] Japan is still a protectionist nation. It should open its door wider to investments and trade. Its discriminatory tariffs on Scotch whisky is a good example. It is also very difficult for foreign companies to gain access to the Japanese trading market unless they are associated with major Japanese trading firms through capital participation. Japan entered the world market in the 1860's and integrated its more controlled society and culture with a capitalistic system. I think the capitalistic system in Japan is different from capitalism. [Sakai] Do you meet opposition from bureaucrats to deregulation? [Heseltine] Yes, some of them are opposed to deregulation. But we intend to keep intact regulations related to health care, the environment, and social affairs. What should be abolished are the regulations that prevent creativity and investments. It is also important for the administration to have bureaucrats constantly review their own structure according to changes. What politicians should decide is whether the government should promote deregulation while placing priority on the benefits of manufacturers or those of consumers and markets. [Sakai] Against the wishes of Honda Motor Company, British Rover Group is to be acquired by BMW of Germany. [Heseltine] I understand how Honda feels. But the future success of Rover Group will be advantageous to Honda in auto parts supply. I hope other parts suppliers also should not have negative feeling. Forty-one percent of Japan's entire investments in Europe are made in Britain. Japanese companies are welcomed here. I think they are fully aware of their capability to manufacture competitive products. [Sakai] The sale of Rover Group to BMW means that Britain entrusts automobile production to a foreign country. [Heseltine] Britain has also a large share in possessions and management of major European companies. Industrial nationalism is now less important compared to the past.
