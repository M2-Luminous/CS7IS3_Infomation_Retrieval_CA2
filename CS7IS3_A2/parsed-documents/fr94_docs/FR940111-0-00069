FR940111-0-00069 FR940111-0-00019 The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose stated that the essential purpose of the Rule is to lower barriers to price competition in the funeral market and facilitate informed consumer choice. 5 The Rule thus seeks to ensure that consumers have access to sufficient information to permit informed purchase decisions, that consumers are not required to purchase items they do not want and are not required by law to purchase, and that misrepresentations are not used to influence consumer purchase decisions. 6 5 47 FR 42260 (Sept. 24, 1982), R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (hereafter cited as ``SBP''). 6 47 FR 42260 (Sept. 24, 1982), R&hyph;B&hyph;5. The staff on July 9, 1985 issued Final Compliance Guidelines to assist providers in their efforts to comply with the Rule. 7 Following an initial period where the Commission sought principally through educational efforts to encourage industry compliance, the Commission to date has obtained thirty-six consent orders and one litigated order in thirty-seven completed federal district court actions filed against individual providers regarding various violations of the Rule. 8 7 R&hyph;B&hyph;6 (50 FR 28062). 8 U.S. v.

The Amended Rule The Commission, in promulgating the amended Rule, seeks to increase the Rule's potential benefits to consumers by clarifying its requirements and reducing actual or potential compliance burdens on the funeral industry. Such action should increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosure and other obligations. Based on the record in this proceeding, the Commission has concluded that the low levels of industry compliance with, and consumer awareness of, the Rule do not permit a full cost-benefit analysis of its impact, because the analysis does not capture the full effects of the Rule had there been greater compliance. Despite this finding, the Commission has determined from the record evidence that the Rule is providing pro-competitive and informational benefits to consumers that outweigh its costs to providers, and that those benefits, but not costs, are likely to increase over time as Rule compliance and consumer awareness of their rights under the Rule increase. The Commission has further concluded that the record in this proceeding does not contain a sufficient basis to overturn the Rule's presumptive validity as a legally promulgated rule.
