This document outlines Israeli and Syrian policy regarding a future peace agreement between the two countries." This was said by Dr. Yosi Olmert, an expert on Syria who participated in the meeting and was involved in the drafting of the document. According to Olmert the contents of the document was brought to the knowledge of senior political circles, including Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and raised a lot of interest and hopes in Jerusalem and Washington. Olmert notes the October meeting was the last in a series of six meetings organized by an American fund named "Common Ground Research Fund" [name as published]. Olmert claims that due to leaks of the document no more meetings were held since October. The Norway meetings were held under the auspices of Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. Mr. Holst and his wife attended the opening of the meetings, which were held in the same Oslo castle in which the agreement of principles between Israel and the PLO was formulated. The Israeli academics who participated in the meetings were: Professor Aharon Lev-Ran of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, Dr. Dori Gold, Brigadier General (reserves) 'Amos Gilboa', and Dr. Yosi Olmert. The military commentator Ze'ev Schiff also attended one of the earlier meetings. Two Syrians attended the meetings. One of them remains anonymous due to his sensitive position vis-a-vis the Syrian regime. The other is Professor 'Aziz Shuqri, dean of the Damascus University Law School. Shuqri, an expert of international renown, is known to be very close to the top Syrian political echelon. "It is true that this was an academics' meeting, but the Syrian representatives can be seen to reflect the positions of the Syrian establishment," according to Olmert. Olmert claims that in a structured and rigid country like Syria people are not allowed to attend such meetings without the knowledge and authorization of the government. Syria, unlike Western states, does not have to take into consideration public opinion and the media. It does have a small group of persons, however, who are allowed to speak abroad and who serve as a sort of trial balloon for the future moves of the Syrian regime. The positions they express probably reflect the future positions of the Syrian regime. Olmert reveals that an intensive 48-hour marathon of talks was held in Oslo last October which resulted in the joint document. This document caused a lot of interest in Israel due to several points: -- This is the first time the Syrians have provided full details regarding their concept of peace. From the document it clearly transpires that the Syrians understand full peace to include open borders, normalization, economic, trade, and cultural relations, embassies and consular relations. -- It is not stated in the document that during the withdrawal it will be necessary to evacuate all the Israeli settlements on the Golan Heights. It is stated that their status during the withdrawal will be subject to negotiations. Two main points are not included in the document: -- The duration of withdrawal. It is clear that there are substantial gaps between Syria and Israel regarding this point. The Syrians expect Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights in three or four years; Israel unofficially believes the process should take much longer to complete. -- Security arrangements. Obviously this issue will prove a future bone of contention between Israel and Syria if and when they enter concrete negotiations. It is assessed that Syria will agree to mutual demilitarization of territories, but will not agree to a deep demilitarization of all the area from the future international border to Damascus.
