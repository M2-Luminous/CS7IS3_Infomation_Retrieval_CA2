[Passage omitted]-The Secretary-2 said in his address that cooperative system enables those lacking strength to become strong economic organization to win a competitive edge in the market economic system. The country, he said, is practising market economy. In a market oriented system, he pointed out, people doing business will certainly encounter such conditions like insufficient supply of capital, weakness in commodity production technology, incompetence in the administrative skills and market instability. All those who are weak must cooperate and reciprocate one another to remedy the weaknesses, he said. This is cooperative way, he added. He noted that the Cooperative Market Festival aims at securing vast markets for domestic products and strengthening the existing markets for the products. The cooperative societies, entrepreneurs and the public are to strive toward that end, he added. The Cooperative Market Festival in itself is self-evident, he said. It involves trading, collective efforts and entertainment programmes. Products of different localities, traditional costumes, works of art and traditional dishes will also be available at the festival thereby promoting and preserving cultural traditions, the Secretary-2 said. He said the festival is vital for finding markets for domestic products, strengthening and expanding the existing ones and introducing new products in accordance with consumers' demand. He said he believes acquiring new markets and producing new products will contribute toward realizing the Allround Development year in 1994-95. The people of Mandalay Division and Mandalay can take pride for being able to organize the festival welcoming the Allround Development Year, he said. The Secretary-2 looked forward to expanding trade as transactions are to be carried out through contracts at the festival. Cooperative societies, those engaged in cooperative undertakings and interested persons of the States and Divisions are converging on the festival. During their stay at the festival, they are said to be attending a seminar on upgrading and improving cooperative activities, he said. The seminar will concentrate on doing cooperative undertakings actively, boosting export and producing new items required by the markets, he said. He underscored that stability is ensured in political, economic and administrative spheres in the country. The National Convention has made some progress in laying down principles to serve as base in drafting the State Constitution. Altogether 11 armed groups in the jungles have responded to the government offer, then returned to the legal fold and finally are implementing the regional development projects together with the government. Economically, he said, short-term projects have been laid down and then implemented from 1992-93 to 1995-96. With the fulfilment of targets during the first and second years, firm economic bases have already been established, he said. Foreign nations are found to have invested more in the country and efforts are being mad3 with added momentum during the current fiscal year of 1994-95, the third which is designated as Allround Development Year. In the process, he said, cooperative societies are to play an important role. Cooperativie University and colleges are to be opened soon, he said. Cooperative undertakings, he said, have already engaged in agriculture, livestock breeding and fisheries and industries. They are also doing business in services such as transport, monetary and health care. In trading too, he said, they are making preparations to step up domestic and foreign trade. He urged cooperative societies to try their utmost as they are deeply involved in allround economic activities. In conclusion, the Secretary-2 called on the cooperative societies to try to realize economic objectives of the State for the establishment of a modern and developed nation and also try to fulfil the objectives of the Cooperative Market Festival--to find markets through collective efforts, promote and preserve cultural traditions, develop commodity production, promote friendship and cooperation among cooperative societies and substitute imports.
