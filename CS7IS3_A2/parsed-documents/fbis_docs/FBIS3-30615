Last night the agency disseminated a report that the Russians had warned our special services that this was happening. The Russians allegedly hinted that the Americans had eavesdropped on the secrets of the Bulgarian legislators. According to the report, a commission had already been formed to investigate the tip-off, with members from the NSO [National Protection Service], the VKR [Military Counterintelligence], the Higher Institute of the Interior Ministry, and other bodies. It was claimed that it was easy to wiretap the proceedings of parliament from a telephone cable junction box nearby. Last night DUMA reporters were unable to find any junction box outside the National Assembly. Viktor Mikhaylov said that the Interior Ministry Institute cannot take part in such a commission because it has no consultative powers. Specialists point out that the National Protection Service provides bodyguards, and does not perform operational functions. Even former spies, who had suffered bitter experiences when the former military counterintelligence was destroyed, discounted the possibility of Military Counterintelligence being involved in such matters.
