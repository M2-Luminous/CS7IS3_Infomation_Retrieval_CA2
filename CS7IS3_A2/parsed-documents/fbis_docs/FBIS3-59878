These are important topics, but the real problem Israel is facing is much deeper than this. Three months have passed since Yitzhak Rabin and Yassir 'Arafat shook hands on the White House lawn. Many grasped then at the straw of confused hope that the Middle East would be able to adopt the type of relations that exist between France, Belgium, and Luxembourg, but they, too, knew the history of the leader of the PLO murder organization, so that in their hearts they gave the PLO a trial period, as we would with a dangerous convict freed on parole. In the three months that have passed, all the warnings have been proven true, and not one of the hopes has come to pass. In a great engineering innovation, Shimon Peres suggested that we stop a rising flood by blasting streams of water, while Yitzhak Rabin suggested an innovation in physics: fighting fire with fire. The innovation of the Israeli left, of curbing terror against Jews by using an anti-Jewish terror group, has been repudiated by reality. There is not a single sign, as of now, that supports any possibility that this theory can be put into action, and, indeed, signs are multiplying that say precisely the opposite. Unlike the accepted theories, the basic problem is neither Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] nor the little PLO rejectionist groups, but the main rejectionist group--that is, Fatah and its never changing leader. In 1974, the Palestinian National Council [PNC] decided upon its famous policy of moving in stages. Old hat, right? Why be so small and narrow-minded as to bring it up today, three months after the handshake in Washington? The answer can be found in Arafat's speech that was broadcast on Jordanian television at the same time as the ceremony at the White House. While the Biblical verses poured from the mouths of the prime minister of Israel and his second-in-command, the chief of the PLO band said the following words in Arabic: "Oh my beloved, do not forget that the PNC made this decision in 1974. It called for establishment of a national entity on some portion of Palestinian land that would be freed, or which Israel would withdraw from. This is the fruit of your struggle, your sacrifices, your jihad...this is the moment of return, the moment of setting foot on the first Palestinian territory to be freed...this is an important, definitive, and basic step.... May Palestine live, free and Arabic." Slowly, as is his fashion, Yitzhak Rabin is apparently also beginning to understand that there will be no security for Israel if the "freed" territory is handed over to the PLO and Hamas. Last week, the prime minister said in the Knesset that after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has withdrawn from the Gaza and Jericho regions, Israel learns that terrorist squads are preparing themselves to attack Israelis, Israel will stand on its right of hot pursuit, "and hot pursuit, for us, means not only during an incident, but also to prevent an incident." This new condition of Israel's completely contradicts the Oslo accord, which stipulates that in the hands of the PLO will be both authority over the territory Israel has withdrawn from, and responsibility for the war against terror ("internal security"); while the IDF will have freedom of movement on the highways alone. If Mr. Rabin follows through with his announcement, there will be no agreement: either it will not be signed, or it will explode after the first foiling hot pursuit. In any case, it is clear today that Mr. Rabin already understands that carrying out the agreement as it is written would completely abandon the security of Israel and her citizens. This is the time to stop, think, and look at the Oslo agreement dispassionately and without illusions. To those who approve of the agreement, the PLO is being given a trial period. The gang and its leaders have failed this trial. Calling off the process now will avert serious perils in the future.
