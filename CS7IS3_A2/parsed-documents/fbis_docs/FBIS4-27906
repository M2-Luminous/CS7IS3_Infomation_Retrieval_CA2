The EU is about to complete work on the European edition of the "information highway concept" by the end of this month and participate in a joint project to develop standards with the United States which is engaged in a similar project, but has decided to persuade the United States of the three-region approach in view of opposition from U.S. industry over the idea of adding Japan to the joint effort. However, the EU has cited as a condition for the three-region approach implementation of deregulation by Japan, signaling the need for Japan to clearly provide deregulation in the area of information and telecommunications as part of the external economic measures outline to be completed by the end of June. According to European information industry sources, EU and U.S. representatives met in New York last month and agreed to a mutual linkup of the U.S. "information superhighway" and the European next-generation high-speed communications network as well as the joint development of applicable standards. They also discussed joint research with Japan, but U.S. industry representatives expressed strong reluctance to joint development with Japan for fear of an expansion in Japan's share of related programs. The U.S. Government will propose the formulation of standards for international linkage of next-generation high-speed communications networks at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) plenary meeting to be held in Japan in September. The objective of U.S. industry sources is to have Japan adopt standards developed under the auspices of the United States. In previous conferences, the U.S. side appears to have asked the EU side to collaborate in the suggested approach, after pointing out that if next-generation high-speed communications network standards were jointly developed with an equal voice exercised by Japan, the United States, and Europe, the risk existed that Japanese information and communications equipment makers would expand their market share in Europe and the United States. In response, the EU pointed out that influential Japanese computer makers are already deeply involved because of a central role being played in European programs by British ICL, which is 80-percent owned by Fujitsu, and French Bull, in which NEC has a 4.43-percent interest, and therefore advocated that "Japan should be included in the development of standards." However, some sources in the EU embrace the position that "unification of standards should be handled primarily by the United States and Europe, and Japan should be limited to a role of joint development," which means that in order for Japan to gain the support of the EU, it must make major concessions on the deregulation issue as strongly advocated by the United States and the EU.
