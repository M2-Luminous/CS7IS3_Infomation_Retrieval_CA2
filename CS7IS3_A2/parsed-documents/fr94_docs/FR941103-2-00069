FR941103-2-00069 FR941103-2-00031 Response: As a part of Western's Strategic Planning initiative: Western will, as the marketing agent for Federal power, participate in the decision making process whenever possible with other resource agencies whose operating decisions significantly affect Federal power rate and repayment obligations. Western will do so to sustain the marketability of the Federal hydroelectric resource. 9. Miscellaneous Comments Long-term Capacity Sales: (1) Comment: (The commentor) notes that there is a discrepancy between the projection of capacity sales shown in Western's ``1993 Power Projections'' and the values in the PRS. Upon inspection of the two set of values, it appears that the values used in the PRS may have been misentered 1 year below the proper year. This causes the amount of capacity sales to be slightly understated in several years. Response: Western agrees. Western has checked these data and has found a disconnect between the kW of capacity sales estimate found in the work papers and that in the PRS. It appears that the data from FYs 1993 through 2003 in the work papers were put into the PRS in FYs 1994 through 2004. The error has been corrected. (2) Comment: Western calculates the PRS for Integrated Projects such that replacements are repaid up to the rate-setting year. In part, this is due to the assignment of a lower repayment priority (to irrigation) in the PRS. Assigning the lower priority (to irrigation) causes a less than optimal rate calculation, since the rate could be lowered by allowing for some replacements to remain unpaid beginning 9&hyph;10 years prior to the ratesetting year. Response: Western recognizes that some replacements have been paid earlier in the PRS than required. Western conducted a test to determine if forcing payments to irrigation obligations would postpone early payment of replacements, thus lowering the rate. Forcing payments reduces the composite rate 0.13 mills/kWh. This change has been made in the ratesetting PRS. 10. Untimely Responses to Data Requests a. Comment: Three commentors stated that their consultant did not receive all the information needed to reconcile certain key portions of the proposed rate and did not have adequate time to verify all the data underlying the rate adjustment. Response: The consultant submitted five official data requests.
