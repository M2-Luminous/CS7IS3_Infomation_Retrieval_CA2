He stressed, however, that the decision came late. In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, 'Abd-al-Rashid said: Most countries in the world, if not all, have companies and offices that deal with foreign currencies in a regular way and are subject to the control and supervision of the competent authorities. It is difficult to predict the extent of the success that will come from applying this decision, which every citizen that cares for his people and nation wishes to see. We are certain that the experience and insight of leaders of the competent state agencies will ensure the success of this decision, which will produce positive results for the national economy and for all the parties that have an interest in the decision. He stressed that the primary indicator of the success of this decision will be the stabilization of the dinar's exchange rate. He explained that the long-term objective of the decision is to improve the exchange rate against foreign currencies so that we can buy more for one Iraqi dinar than we can buy now. Asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH about the reasons for the sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate, the director of the Financial Control Bureau said the main reason is the deliberate subversive attempts carried out by foreign and domestic parties, who took advantage of the circumstances of the unjust economic blockade and the weak points of the Iraqi economy, which used to rely heavily on oil exports and on importing commodities and services from abroad. These parties, he said, succeeded in bringing about fluctuations in the Iraqi dinar's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. They have also succeeded in producing price hikes on commodities and services, thus laying a heavy burden on the shoulders of citizens with limited incomes. He added that the remedy for the current inflation is based on maintaining prices at their current level, or even bringing them down to a lower, constant level, and on long-term action. The action should start now to lower prices to the previous levels in Iraq or to the international levels, as well as keeping the inflation rate below 20 percent, as is the case in advanced industrial countries. Regarding the price hikes on commodities, Dahham 'Abd-al-Rashid said that they are due to speculation, gambling, rumors, and psychological warfare staged against Iraqi citizens. The main reason for price hikes, he said, is the low supply of commodities compared to the demand and the purchasing power created by the surplus cash liquidity. He said the imbalance between the supply of commodities and the real demand is due to the low output of local products of commodities and services, including the industrial and agricultural products and so forth. The imbalance is also due to the fact that Iraq has lost all of its foreign currency assets and the revenues it used to make out of its oil exports before 2 August 1990. Thus, the country lost the ability to import basic commodities and services needed by its citizens. Dahham stressed that the solution requires increasing production first, and then organizing the increase in real income to correspond to the increase in production. He explained that Iraq, from the 1970's, should have adopted an organized policy of income and prices. Income is not limited to wages and salaries, he said, but should also include profits and their distribution, whether in individual enterprises or companies. Taxes and other financial and monetary instruments must be used to implement this policy to achieve a balance between prices and incomes and improve their levels to ensure a fair distribution of wealth among the various individuals, groups, and segments of society.
