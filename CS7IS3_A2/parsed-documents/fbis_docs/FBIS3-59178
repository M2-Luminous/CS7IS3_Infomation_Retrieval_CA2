Lambeck in Bonn; date not given: "Liberals Keep CDU/CSU Waiting"] [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Kinkel, after the strategic summit of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] in Munich, Helmut Kohl clearly stated that the CDU and the CSU want to continue the coalition with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. Do you also want to continue the alliance with the CDU/CSU? [Kinkel] I am, of course, pleased that the chancellor and Mr. Waigel said that they want to continue the alliance with the FDP. Despite all the forebodings, we have achieved remarkable things in a difficult time. I have always said that I do not want to make a statement on a coalition without coordinating it with the FDP's executive bodies. We will decide before each of the 18 elections this year whether and when we will make a statement on a coalition and, if possible, what it will be like; this will also be done before the Bundestag elections. I am proceeding on the assumption that it is more likely that a statement on a coalition will be made. [Lambeck] The chancellor said in Munich that he expected the FDP to revise its position on the "great bugging campaign" at its party congress in Rostock. Have you indicated a change on this issue to Helmut Kohl? [Kinkel] I have not. My personal attitude toward this question is known. I have always said, and said as early as the time of the party congress in Muenster, that the vote of the party congress is binding on me. We voted against the bugging campaign with a two-thirds majority in Muenster. Nevertheless, there can be different opinions on such a difficult legal and political question. [Lambeck] Theo Waigel has demanded that the FDP vote for the CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, in the decisive ballots in the Federal Assembly.... [Kinkel] After every ballot, we, the FDP, will get together in the Federal Assembly and consider what we will do in the next ballot. I am against continuous speculations before the presidential election. [Lambeck] Do you still see any chance for Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher? [Kinkel] Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher was chosen as candidate for the presidential elections with overwhelming support in the FDP. I can say only again and again: She is not a mere pawn that can be exchanged at will. [Lambeck] The coalition is again trying to find a compromise on nursing-care insurance with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Do you also see a chance for the desired solution if, for the time being, only one holiday is abolished? [Kinkel] We indeed want to make a new attempt at mediation on the basis of a solution for the nursing-care insurance that includes outpatients and inpatients. From the point of view of the CDU/CSU and the FDP, a solution for outpatients and inpatients is only possible by compensation that involves the abolition of two holidays. [Lambeck] The CDU/CSU is now demanding that the SPD clarify events concerning the pasts of the Social Democratic politicians, Wehner and Wienand, which have now become known. Might the case of Herbert Wehner be the undoing of some people in the present SPD leadership? [Kinkel] I am of the opinion that, in the first place, the SPD has to be committed to clarifying this and taking an interest in it. On the other hand, I think there should be no mudslinging in the election campaign. I cannot assess whether this might result in any problems for SPD politicians who are still alive. I am interested in the historical question of whether German politics was influenced in an unacceptable way by the former GDR or the Soviet Union in the postwar period. [Lambeck] In view of the imponderabilities in the East, may Germany continue to cut its defense budget constantly? Should the Bundeswehr not actually get more money as an insurance policy for politics? [Kinkel] The Bundeswehr is a very important factor in our society. It has to be excluded from the quarrels between the parties. It has to be excluded from the permanent criticism and fumbling. It cannot be right that we say we have a certain amount of money and we can afford a certain amount of Bundeswehr for it. It has to be the other way around: In the changed world situation we need a Bundeswehr that can cope with new tasks. This concept has to be developed and then the money needed for the concept must be made available. [Lambeck] In your opinion, does the coalition have a convincing concept for the Bundeswehr or does this not exist yet? [Kinkel] The world and thus the tasks of the Bundeswehr have changed. Only think of the future tasks that hopefully also will be possible for us after the Basic Law amendment, that is, to keep and to make peace. In addition, there are preventive and humanitarian measures. Indeed we need a new concept. Volker Ruehe must present one. As for the rest, I am convinced that the Bundeswehr's personnel strength of 370,000 men should be maintained. [Lambeck] What do you think of the proposal by your party friend, Juergen Moellemann, to limit the chancellor's term to eight years? [Kinkel] Nothing at all.
