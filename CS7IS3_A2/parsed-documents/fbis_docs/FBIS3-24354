Today, we offer the reader a more detailed interview with the minister of defense of a House of Soviets that was riddled with gunfire. [Turchenko] Vladislav Alekseyevich, let us begin from the moment that you were appointed minister of defense. Many of our readers ask in their letters: Why did you not take any kind of steps for real execution of the duties that were entrusted to you by the Congress of People's Deputies? [Achalov] When the Congress of People's Deputies appointed me, Barannikov, and Dunayev force ministers, individual people, even from among the people's deputies demanded: Go to the ministries, take up your positions, and start to manage. But the real situation and common sense suggested another path for resolving the question. Since the three force ministries were appointed, this meant that a government should be formed as well. Without this, for us to go to the ministries and there establish parallel managerial structures would mean the direct involvement of the Army, the MB [Ministry of Security], and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in opposition inside these very structures themselves, which would lead to a full-scale civil war. I told both Khasbulatov and Rutskoy: If a new government is to be formed, and this is their prerogative, then questions of the Ministry of Defense can be resolved within its framework. But this, as is well-known, was not done. [Turchenko] Some analysts think that it was a tactical error to appoint new force ministers outside the framework of a government, for this would seem to doom Grachev, Yerin, and Golushko to opposition with respect to the congress. [Achalov] Grachev, Yerin, and Golushko were invited to a meeting of the congress as full-fledged ministers, but they did not appear. And this was their deliberate choice: To take the side of the president immediately. They undeviatingly took the path of unconstitutionality. When this became obvious, the congress appointed new force ministers. For me personally this was a surprise, but nothing remained to be done except to fulfill the will of congress. [Turchenko] What does to fulfill mean? What could the minister of defense do sitting inside the blockaded House of Soviets? [Achalov] We knew, and now it is obvious to many, that in September the MVD planned and prepared an operation to eliminate the Congress of People's Deputies. Besides the forces and resources of Moscow Oblast, OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachments] Personnel and Internal Affairs subunits from many regions were drawn up at the House of Soviets. In addition, in September, all of the army units closest to Moscow were dispatched to harvest potatoes, and all of the militia subunits were pulled out of the potato fields. The fact is that people from Yeltsin's circle knew what kind of an attitude the army showed to the regime in the referendum, and they did not count on it. They put into operation specifically cultivated OMON and Spetsnaz [Special Purpose Forces] forces. In this connection, I had the task of organizing antiprovocation measures and the security of the House of Soviets. That is, all of my work was directed at ensuring the safety of the deputies and more or less the peaceful work of the congress. Such tasks as going to the troops, inspiring them, and leading them in a breakthrough were not assigned. The biggest misfortune was that neither Yeltsin, nor his circle, wanted to accept a compromise and to resolve the dispute at the top. They brought the situation to a point where the people themselves undertook the task. And when they saw that on 3 October the people came to the defense of the House of Soviets and the legal authority, they incited bloodshed. [Turchenko] Let us look at 4 October through the eyes of a military professional. What was the sense of the tank shelling of the House of Soviets? [Achalov] On the evening of 3 October, authority was paralyzed. The most resolute figures from Yeltsin's circle understood that only a harsh bloody battle would be capable of bringing their supporters out of shock. These tank firings were necessary to them at any price and for any money. The Army, MVD, and the MB ended up drawn into a monstrous bloody game. No matter how much the finger is pointed at us now, declaring us to be the culprits of this tragedy, it is apparent to any sensible person: Being completely isolated, behind barbed wire, without communications means, theoretically we could not even create any kind of a dangerous situation. There was no military necessity to fire into the parliament building. This was a purely political act with the unjustified employment of heavy weapons. [Turchenko] What do you remember particularly from this nightmare? [Achalov] For two hours before the assault, our people in the MO [Ministry of Defense], MVD, and MB reported that an irreversible decision for its execution was already made. Military people came to me and tried to persuade me for a long time so that I would leave with them. I answered firmly that I would remain with the deputies to the end. I recall, as a minimum, two moments when Khasbulatov tried to get to Yeltsin in order to avoid bloodshed, but the president's circle did not permit such negotiations. And a savage reprisal started. I had occasion to participate in different conflicts in the border areas of our country. But there was nothing comparable to this barbarous brutality. After all, it was not without reason that workers of the Procuracy afterwards were not permitted in the House of Soviets for three days. All this time, the MVD and the OMON were clearing the building of blood and corpses. When the shelling reached the fiercest stage, Khasbulatov and Rutskoy telephoned Zorkin, and they tried to reach Chernomyrdin so that they could promote a ceasefire. In the end--it was already the evening of 4 October--some Alpha officer arrived and said that he was authorized to take me, Barannikov, and Dunayev to negotiations with representatives of Chernomyrdin. We came out of the 20th entry way and got into an armored personnel carrier that took us to Krasnaya Presnya. Buses were parked there. Near one of them I spotted Barsukov, whose eyes were restless. I understood immediately that we had been tricked. When the bus started to move and I saw what route it was taking, no doubts were left: We were being taken to Lefortovo, and not to negotiations. The first interrogation was held at 2300 hours on 4 October. I declared immediately that I was detained through deceit and, in addition, that my diplomatic immunity was violated. But no one paid any attention to this, as happens in our country. At first an attempt was made to steer me into the Terekhov affair. It did not work. Then they brought the standard accusation of massive disorders. But nothing here also could be linked to the law. If it were not for the amnesty, I do not know how the Procuracy would have extricated itself from the situation into which it had cornered itself. [Turchenko] A judicial process could have shed light on the truth about September-October 1993. Perhaps you should have refused amnesty and attempted to go to court? [Achalov] I do not believe in an objective court trial in the present state where the highest law--the constitution--is crushed with tank tracks. [Turchenko] Do you consider yourself vanquished? [Achalov] No. But I also do not see any victors. The present authority conducted a provocation against itself as well. As a matter of fact, it signed its own sentence. The elections showed that the people turned away from it and that it will not accept such authority. [Turchenko] Now everything is being done in a clumsy way by the president's team, and an economic catastrophe is imminent in the country. Did you not give some thought to the fact that perhaps you were released from the dungeons in order that there would be live material for drawing a picture of an internal enemy? [Achalov] Really, parliament cannot be shot up a second time. But the authorities are in urgent need of an internal enemy in order to divert the attention of the people from hunger and cold and from the true culprits of the impending catastrophe. And so the "democratic" mass media has pounced on us. They are a priori shouting about some kind of extremist plans. I do not doubt that there will be attempts to involve some of the released prisoners in a new escapade. Objectively, a period of spontaneous protest demonstrations are drawing near. Undoubtedly, they will always be linked to us, even if we do not begin to participate in them. After all, this is so easy: Put signs with our portraits in the hands of "plants" and then have them shout: They will say, the October prisoners are stirring up the people, and they are trying to take power. Is this not a pretext for the introduction of a dictatorship, without which the present authorities are not capable of lasting? [Turchenko] Does this mean that you are distancing yourself from any kind of a spontaneous or organized struggle whatsoever of the people against the current tyranny? [Achalov] I am against forceful variants of this struggle, because this will be a catastrophe. A civil war is already going on in outlying areas. Different groups are fighting for spheres of influence and sales markets. It will already be impossible to extinguish the next skirmish in the center. And in no case is it possible to allow it to happen. [Turchenko] The present authority is moving toward an economic catastrophe. An attempt to replace it is fraught with military catastrophe. How is it possible to avoid these two catastrophes? [Achalov] The solution is the common sense of the people. I read a lot in Lefortovo and I became convinced: The Russian people always found the medicine against leaders who were unacceptable to it. Undoubtedly, it will find it now as well. Time will put everything in its place. [Turchenko] What are your near-term forecasts? [Achalov] Far from optimistic. If assistance is not provided immediately to agriculture, an inevitable famine awaits us. No one will start to feed us for nothing. We have already eaten up all of NATO's spoiled products. We have to give our peasant an opportunity to sow... [Turchenko] And what are your personal near-term plans? [Achalov] After coming out of Lefortovo, it is necessary to look into my own situation to the end; after all, my status is still unknown, and then I have to find my place in contemporary life. There already are proposals for work. Not only in our country, but abroad as well. But I do not plan to depart for anywhere. I have one thought--to be of use to the people. I have not decided yet in what capacity.
