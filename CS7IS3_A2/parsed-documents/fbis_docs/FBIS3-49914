He said that Walesa had not the slightest, reservations towards the Czech republic in connection with its individual approach towards NATO and the U.S. Partnership programme. Dobrovsky said that it would depend on the course of discussion at the working dinner, given by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, whether or not there would be a joint statement from talks between the leaders of the Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) and Clinton. He said he expected at least one of the presidents to make a statement that there is agreement between all of them as regards fundamental approaches towards the project. Dobrovsky declined to answer a question about whether or not the Czech Republic agrees with a joint standpoint or approach. He told journalists that, prior to Clinton's departure from Brussels to Prague, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner had informed Clinton of his order to NATO staff that its military representatives immediately begin talks with their Central European Countries' counterparts on the specification of a future Partnership For Peace agreement. Dobrovsky said that it would be up to the Visegrad countries how quickly they would start fulfilling their ideas of the Partnership Project. The Czech Republic's idea in this respect is quite clear, he said, but did not elaborate. At a press conference after the NATO summit in Brussels on Tuesday [11 January], Clinton said he would intend to convey to the leaders of the Visegrad countries in Prague that the Partnership Project was opening up the possibility for their becoming NATO members. Clinton said this was a very serious proposal.
