ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maine. This revision incorporates the class I and class II Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)NO 2 increments and related requirements. The intended effect of this action is to approve a program to implement the NO 2 increments in the State of Maine in accordance with the federal PSD regulations. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act. DATES: This final rule will become effective May 17, 1994, unless notice is received April 18, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Linda M. Murphy, Director, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building, Boston, MA 02203. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air Docket 6102, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the Bureau of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, 71 Hospital Street, Augusta, ME 04333. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lynne A. Hamjian, (617) 565&hyph;4181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 16, 1990 and September 5, 1990, the State of Maine submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a program to implement the NO 2 increments to prevent the significant deterioration of air quality in the State of Maine. Background On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40656), EPA promulgated regulations pursuant to section 166 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) to prevent significant deterioration of air quality from emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ). These regulations establish the maximum allowable increase in the ambient NO 2 concentration above the baseline concentration in an area. These maximum allowable increases are called ``increments.'' The increments use NO 2 as the numerical measure because NO 2 is the pollutant on which the national ambient air quality standards for NO x were based. In addition, NO x emissions from stationary sources convert to NO 2 in the atmosphere. The NO 2 increment program has a three-tiered area classification system which was established by Congress in section 163 for increments of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Class I areas (including certain national parks and wilderness areas) were designated by Congress as areas of special national concern, where the need to prevent the significant deterioration in air quality is the greatest. Therefore, the increment levels in class I areas are the most stringent. Class II increments allow for a moderate degree of growth. Class III increments allow for higher levels of industrial growth. There are no class III areas in the country yet. (All areas not specifically designated in the Act as Class I are designated as class II, unless the state chooses to redesignate an area to class I or class III.) The NO 2 increments for the three areas are the following: Class I: 2.5 μg/m 3 annual arithmetic mean Class II: 25 μg/m 3 annual arithmetic mean Class III: 50 μg/m 3 annual arithmetic mean. Forty CFR 51.166 sets forth the minimum federal requirements for the PSD program. State PSD programs must meet all of these requirements. The effective date of the amendments to 40 CFR 51.166 which incorporate the NO 2 increments was October 17, 1989. The Act allows states 9 months after the effective date to submit revised SIPs incorporating the NO 2 increments.
