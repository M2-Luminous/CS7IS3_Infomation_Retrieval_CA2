Between 1986 and 1993, Greenpeace documented 120 export proposals for toxic waste from developed countries going to the Third World. Over the past five years, the industrialized nations shipped more than 100 million t of toxic waste to the underdeveloped countries. More than 90% of the waste sales projects going to the Third World claimed that there was a possibility of recycling. Companies that do business with toxic waste cargo are using all kinds of expedients to get rid of those cargos. In 1992, the German Schmidt-Cretan Company exported 463 t of insecticides to Albania labeled as "humanitarian aid." Environmental legislation classifies this product as being extremely dangerous and its use is prohibited on German territory. In March of that same year, one of the two Albanian Government companies that coordinated the receipt of the donations asked that cargo shipment be interrupted, charging that this "humanitarian aid" had not been correctly packaged and that the deadline for its use had already run out. After the request, the German company sent another three loads of obsolete insecticides to Albania. After they had been returned to Germany and once again shipped to Albanian territory, the toxic products are today stored in a railroad station in Bajza. Another two German companies, ATG and Rimex, likewise participated in this new form of "philanthropy," shipping waste to the countries of Eastern Europe. ATG signed a presumed contract with the Government of Estonia for the export of between 500,000 and 800,000 t of used tires per year. According to company managers, the tires could be incinerated for the production of energy to be used in home heating. Following bitter discussions in the Estonian Parliament, 5,000 t were burned in the open air in the port of Tallin without producing a single watt of energy and emitting a large quantity of particles into the atmosphere. Rimex tried to send 78 barrels of burned engine oil to Ukraina as donation of "paraffin to the Central Committee of the Red Cross for investigations on the biosphere." This "research" could not be carried out because the shipment was confiscated by Polish customs officers who did not allow the cargo to be transported through Polish territory. Cases involving German companies gave Germany the title of world champion in the export of toxic waste, according to Greenpeace. Other big exporters are Switzerland and the United States. Stoller Chemical of the United States in 1992 sold more than 3,000 t of fertilizer contaminated with ash produced by the smelting of copper to the Government of Bangladesh. The transaction was financed by the Asian Development Bank. Analyses done in the State of South Carolina, where the company is based, proved that the fertilizer contained a large quantity of lead that causes neurological problems in children as well as cadmium that causes damage to the kidneys and is also cancer-causing. In June 1992, the Government of the United States sued Stoller and another three companies involved in this case. In spite of that, the environmental authorities of the United States allowed the toxic cargo to remain in one of the world's poorest countries (per capita Gross Domestic Product $220, according to UNICEF). Almost one year after the toxic substances were found in the cargo, the fertilizer continued to be sold freely in Bangladesh. Unofficial reports indicate that the government of that country stopped the distribution of toxic fertilizer after having sold 33% of the entire shipment. Switzerland annually exports 126,000 t of toxic waste, according to the Environmental Ministry of that country; this volume is greater than the volume of cheese exports (60,000 t) and chocolate exports (67,000 t). The Swiss companies treat the developed and underdeveloped countries in a rather egalitarian fashion, shipping toxic cargo both to Germany, France, and Belgium as well as to Slovenia and Somalia. This European country constantly disregards the Basel Convention which was signed on its territory and which calls for the sale of toxic cargo only between countries that signed the treaty or with others, provided there are bilateral agreements between the importing country and the exporting country. The Convention's host country has zeroed in on Germany as one of its preferred targets for the shipment of toxic waste; Germany did not sign the treaty nor does it have an agreement in force with Switzerland. The second meeting of the Basel Convention will be held in March in Geneva. Greenpeace will submit a proposal to the meeting calling for the complete prohibition of exports of toxic and hazardous waste from the industrialized countries to those of the Third World. According to Marijane Lisboa, Latin American coordinator for the Greenpeace Campaign against Trafficking in Toxic Waste, the Basel Convention as it stands now "only legalizes the immoral commerce in toxic waste."
