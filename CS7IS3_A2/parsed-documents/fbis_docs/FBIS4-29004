But what are "hot spots?" Looking at many different events in many places, many people think that a "hot spot" is a place where a major or even fierce struggle is going on among the people over some issue in a particular sphere (from a hamlet or village on up). The matter cannot be resolved on the spot and requires intervention on the part of the party committee echelons, the authorities, and judicial organizations from the primary level on up. Thanh Hoa is one province where a rather large number of "hot spots" have appeared since the end of 1988. The first was the land dispute that arose between the Thanh Son Cooperative and the Sao Vang State Farm (subordinate to Xuan Son Village in Tho Xuan District) on 22 November 1988. Other disputes arose at the end of 1989. Most of the "hot spots" are in rural areas, and they are concentrated in places where the population density is high and where order and security have always been a problem. The "hot spots" are mainly at the level of the hamlet and village, with a few at the city level. From 22 November 1988 to 30 December 1992, there have been eight hot spots in Hau Loc District, six in Tho Xuan District, six in Cam Thuy District, five in Ngoc Lac District, five in Trieu Son District, nine in Thanh Hoa City, and two each in the cities of Bim Son and Sam Son. The thing to note is that "hot spots" have a tendency to "expand" rather rapidly, and they are concentrated in a short time period. For example, in 1992 alone, there were five hot spots in Ngoc Lac, four in Trieu Son, six in Hau Loc, and three in Thieu Yen. By 12 November 1993, a total of 120 "hot spots" had appeared in Thanh Hoa. Analyzing those 120 hot spots shows the following: Scale: Sixty-five percent of the disputes were confined to a single village, almost 18 percent of the disputes were confined to villages within a single district, more than 5 percent involved villages in different districts, and other types accounted for more than 7 percent. Form: Fifty-four percent of the disputes concerned arable land, 19 percent had to do with a loss of solidarity between the people and the cadres at the primary level, 19.5 percent concerned loss of solidarity among the people, and 7.5 percent were disputes within state organizations. Nature: Conflicts concerning land (which accounted for most of the disputes), conflicts between the people and civil service organizations, conflicts involving a struggle for power and material rights, and conflicts that broke out suddenly. Degree: Eleven percent of the conflicts have been very fierce, 49 percent have been tense, and 40 percent have been "smoldering." The Reasons for the "Hot Spots" There are three main reasons: 1. There are hot spots that have arisen because some of the leading and managerial cadres at the primary level are corrupt and have violated the ownership rights of the people. The majority of the party members and people detest these people and have denounced them and filed complaints against them, but their violations have not been investigated or dealt with promptly and resolutely, with the result that the masses do not understand things and lack confidence. In some places, the masses suspect that the district is covering up the mistakes of the primary-level cadres, which has made the situation even more complex and tense. Making use of this situation, a number of evil elements, including dissatisfied and opportunistic cadres and party members have incited a number of people whose vigilance is poor to go to extremes in waging struggles, which has led to people violating the principles of the party and the laws of the state. Widely used forms include organizing suits in many places, making excessive demands, insulting the cadres and party members who have made mistakes based on "self-judgment," and taking people hostage. This has led to conflicts between a number of people and the primary- and district-level leadership organizations and the internal affairs, public security, control, and inspection sectors. Looking at the "hot spots" of Nam Giang in Tho Xuan District, Tho Ngoc in Trieu Son District, Tien Loc in Hau Loc District, and Quang Loc in Quang Xuong District, it can be seen that they arose for the reasons mentioned above and exhibit the above manifestations. These are complex "hot spots" that all have "leaders" and "instigators." The "leader" may be a single individual or a group of people. These people have organized themselves, there are "leaders," there is a division of labor, and they have established illegal organizations using the words "open and democratic," "anti-corruption front," and "anti-negative association" in order to trick party members and the masses into following them. On the other hand, they also use people with police records and hoodlums to put pressure on the authorities and internal affairs sectors, terrorize and threaten those who are waging an honest struggle, spread false information, look for ways to neutralize the party and administrative apparatus, and force the districts and provinces to do what they want. 2. There are hot spots that have arisen because of disputes about administrative boundaries, land, markets, and so on between different hamlets and villages and, in some cases between two villages in different districts. Those disputes that have not been resolved promptly by the echelons and sectors with jurisdiction have resulted in spontaneous clashes between large numbers of people. At the same time, the authorities and bases have been put in a passive position and have not been able to control the situation. Or because they are biased, they have "followed" the masses. There have even been cases in which the militia and self-defense forces have been mobilized to attack people, which has had serious consequences and had a bad effect on hamlet and village order and security and internal security among the people. The problems between Quang Phuc and Quang Vong in Quang Xuong District, between Dong Quang and Dong Van in Dong Son District, between Quy Loc and Yen Tho in Thieu Yen District, and between Vinh Quang in Vinh Loc District and Cam Van in Cam Thuy District are all of this type. This type of "hot spot" usually arises in a relatively short period of time, but the consequences are immeasurable and this has caused many difficulties and problems in handling things using administrative and judicial measures. Furthermore, there are usually a large number of people participating at these "hot spots" and so it is difficult to determine the causes. Because of this, it is easy to forget about taking legal action against the criminals. As of 17 June 1992, Thanh Hoa had four such "hot spots." Even though the situation had been stabilized, the criminals had not been prosecuted. 3. Finally, there are hot spots that have arisen spontaneously for a variety of reasons. For example, some people have blocked and opposed those who are carrying out their public functions, and evil elements have "made a mountain out of a molehill" of this. This type of "hot spot" usually arises in places where order and security is a problem. At the same time, the local authorities and internal affairs organizations are weak and unable to handle specific situations, with the result that "hot spots" can arise and expand. Studying the hot spots: there was a fight between members of Unit 3 and Unit 9 in Tan Tuong Village, Tinh Gia District; there was a clash between Thanh Hoa City public security forces and the railroad station defense forces; there were two disturbances at the provincial people's court; and there was the case of people falsely accusing public security forces of beating someone to death and then stealing a public security vehicle and taking the body to the provincial CPV organization to jeer and incite people. All of these have a similar form. Handling the "Hot Spots"--Initial lessons Looking at the 120 hot spots in the past 5 years, as of 12 November 1993, Thanh Hoa had basically resolved more than 97 percent of the cases. Of these, almost 24 percent of the cases had been fully resolved, and almost 40 percent of the hot spots had been basically stabilized. The remaining cases are in the process of being concluded. To gain experience and preliminarily summarize the process of handling the hot spots, Thanh Hoa will organize a special symposium. But based on the successes and failures in dealing with a number of broad, complex, and serious hot spots, we can learn a number of lessons: 1. Discovering things early, finding the real reasons, and advancing ideological work: The successes in handling the hot spots in Thanh Hoa show that there must be an attitude of fairness. Also, the situation must be evaluated carefully and objectively, and the true causes and nature of the matter must be found in order to have suitable means to deal with the matter. Whenever there are signs that a "hot spot" is arising or that a new hot spot has recently arisen, the organizations responsible must find out what the real reasons are and analyze the nature of the conflict. At the same time, they must organize work teams consisting of capable cadres who have great prestige, who are experienced in party work and mass mobilization, and who are skilled in dealing with various situations and skillfully insert them into the "hot spots." Through the highly trusted people on the spot, they must clarify the problems and, together with the people, discuss and resolve the issues and problems on the spot, including those of relatives of the targets, in order to "gradually reduce the temperature," "ease the situation," and "defuse the situation." In particular, in places where the masses can easily be incited and already have problems with the leaders, ideological work must be carried on resolutely and skillfully in order to create good public opinion. The more good pressure is applied by the people, the better the results will be. The hot spots in Vinh Ninh in Vinh Loc District, Tan Lap in Ba Thuoc District, and Dong Hung in Thanh Hoa City were dealt with mainly in this way. And based on this method, almost 25 percent of the hot spots in Thanh Hoa have been basically "defused." 2. Using economic measures in conjunction with improving the apparatus and cadre work: Handling the "hot spots" will take time. This cannot be rushed. Things cannot be done in a subjective manner, and stages cannot be skipped. At the same time, things cannot be delayed, which would allow the situation to dray on. Reality shows that if such situations are allowed to drag on, efforts to resolve matters will encounter many complex difficulties. Thus, there are things that must be carried on tensely, especially tasks related to stabilizing life at the primary level, particularly economic life. For example, the "hot spots" that have difficulties concerning work formulas can be guided and given help in building a number of infrastructural and public welfare projects in order to involve the people in production and reduce their concerns. On the other hand, tasks related to organizing and solidifying the apparatus and strengthening the cadres must be handled promptly, and those who have committed violations, particularly cadres and party members who have clearly committed violations and who no longer have the confidence of the people, must be dealt with, which includes taking legal action against them, recovering things and paying material damages (if any), and doing things openly before the people. The experiences in handling the hot spots in Tho Ngoc in Trieu Son District, Nam Giang in Tho Xuan District, Quang Loc in Quang Xuong District, Nga Thach in Nga Son District, and a number of other complex spots in Tho Xuan and Cam Thuy show that this is a very important measure that is in accord with the legitimate demands of the cadres, party members, and masses and that manifests the strictness of the law. If these problems are solved well, there will no longer be any reasons that dissatisfied and extremist elements can use to complicate the situation. 3. Dealing with things promptly and resolutely from within: Taking resolute action against cadres and party members who participate in the "hot spots" is both urgent and necessary in order to "set an example" for the people. This is very important for blocking and handling the "hot spots." The experiences in dealing with typical hot spots such as Tho Ngoc, Quang Loc, Nam Giang, and Nga Thach show this very clearly. For example, in the Tho Ngoc case, one person was disciplined and expelled from the party, three were given warnings, and the chairman of the village people's committee, the head of the village public security force, and the secretary of the village CPV committee were dismissed from office. In particular, Le Hong Bao, the cooperative director, was tried and sentenced to 5 years in prison. As a result, the problems there were basically solved, the situation at Tho Ngoc stabilized, and the village has continued to advance. When handling the hot spots in Quang Loc, Nam Giang, and Nga Thach, 29 party members there were disciplined. Following this, other hot spots declined in intensity, and this created a good tendency for handling other spots on a provincial scale. Something that should be noted is that with respect to the "leaders," in general, an open attitude and flexible measures for dealing with them are required. There must be a dialogue. People must listen to their ideas, analyze things, and persuade them. At the same time, we must adhere to the principles and resolutely criticize their extremist actions that violate the law. The die-hard instigators and leaders must be differentiated from those who have been misled or used, with appropriate methods used to deal with each type of target. Along with dealing with things promptly and resolutely from within, troublemakers and hoodlums and those who "grope for fish in muddy waters" must be resolutely suppressed in accord with the law. The sympathy and support of the people must be obtained, and spontaneous actions that cause trouble must definitely be avoided. This is a very important guideline for handling things. The five prison sentences meted out to the above targets at four "hot spots" (with the stiffest sentence being 12 years in prison and the lightest being 2 years) clearly affirms that "being strict both within and among the masses" has a great effect in dealing with the hot spots. 4. The independence of the bases must be strengthened, but the close leadership and guidance of higher echelons must be maintained. In order to deal with the hot spots, the party committee echelons and authorities, from the primary to the district level, must do things actively and speedily under the close leadership and guidance of the provincial CPV committee and provincial people's committee. In particular, there must be a high degree of unanimity from top to bottom in determining the reasons for the rise of "hot spots" and formulating solutions. Simple, subjective, and quick methods and a desire to deal with things immediately using rigid methods must be opposed. On the other hand, rightist thinking and not daring to deal with things must be opposed, and the concept of relying on others must be opposed: the primary level waiting on the district, the districts waiting on the province, and the functional sectors shifting responsibility to each other. The methods used to deal with the hot spots must be synchronized. Educating, propagandizing, and mobilizing the masses must go hand in hand with solidifying the party and administrative organizations and dealing with things using administrative and judicial measures. As for the complex "hot spots," particularly the burning and very tense hot spots, work groups or teams headed by a key leader must be formed and sent to the hot spots. They must have full power to deal with the situation, and they will be responsible to higher echelons for their actions. What must be emphasized is that enforcing the laws at the hot spots must be based above all on having accurate and timely information, serving as the staff for the leaders, and dealing effectively with situations on the spot swiftly and safely. As for hot spots in the hamlets, the villages must handle things on their own, with the district monitoring things and providing help. When the hot spots are in the villages, the district must personally handle things, with the province monitoring things and providing help. Based on their functions and tasks, the committees and sectors at the provincial level must help the districts. The province must not do things in place of the districts, but it must not be lax in providing leadership and guidance or slight its responsibilities. Proposals Based on Realities From the realities in Thanh Hoa, in order to actively prevent hot spots from arising and to continue dealing effectively with those hot spots that have arisen with the aim of maintaining stability and promoting development from the primary level, I would like to propose the the following: First, the central echelon should soon review the work of building and solidifying the bases and improving the quality of the ranks of cadres and party members. It should strengthen propaganda activities, give the cadres and people at the primary level an all-round education, particularly concerning legal matters, overcome the "illiteracy" concerning judicial knowledge, and standardize judicial knowledge for the key leaders and managers at the primary level. At the same time, the central echelon should soon review and learn the lessons in building models of organizations subordinate to the primary-level authorities (hamlet and village) and in regulating the activities of the hamlet and village heads so that these can be used on a nationwide scale. Second, the central echelon should soon revise the laws and documents under the law to concretize dealing with the petitions and complaints of citizens. It must provide guidance in formulating concrete solutions based on the functions and powers of each echelon and sector with respect to the above tasks in order to ensure that the complaints of the people are dealt with effectively, promptly, and in accord with the law and in order to overcome the situation in which people simply try to shift the responsibility to someone else, which weakens the confidence of the masses. Third, the central echelon should soon promulgate regulations in order to put an end to the confusion. These should deal with such things as, How should the internal affairs forces be used to deal with the hot spots? What should the contents of "martial law" orders be? And how should the mass means of information convey information to the hot spots in order to ensure accuracy and to prevent the enemy from making use of this and distorting the situation?
