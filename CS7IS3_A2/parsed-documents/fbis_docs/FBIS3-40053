"The void left by the Warsaw Pact cannot last long. Either the West fills it or Russian hegemony will return," Fabbri told journalists here. "The West is again facing a Russia problem," he said, adding that this "delicate issue must be treated by combining dialogue and firmness." Russia was politically and economically weak but its conventional and nuclear weapons also made it strong, he said, adding that its weaknesses and internal contrasts could explain why it was "asking for a new Yalta and claiming a freedom of action in what it defines as its intangible sphere of influence." He was referring to the Yalta accords, reached between Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill three months before the end of World War II, by which the Soviet Union gained hegemony over East Europe. Fabbri said statements by Italy's opposition communists that NATO had outlived itself and should be disbanded were "not in the interest of Italy, Europe or the West." "Never more than today has the Atlantic Alliance been a pillar of security for the West and the international order."
