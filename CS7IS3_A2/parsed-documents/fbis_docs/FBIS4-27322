If the United States insists on numerical indicators for such supplementary categories as the increase in stores selling foreign products, which it is proposing in place of "numerical targets," conflict may arise again. This may even undermine the basic agreement already reached at unofficial consultations on the "participation and sales increases of foreign products." The following looks at the points of agreement and remaining differences between Japan and the United States on the eve of reopening the negotiations. Points of Agreement [subhead] According to sources in the Japanese and U.S. negotiating teams, compared to the time that the framework talks broke down last February, both sides compromised at the recent unofficial meetings which resulted in the resumption of negotiations. In the first place, the United States backed off on its demand for "numerical targets" which set a specific amount of increase in imports or sales until a specific point in time in the future -- the greatest stumbling block in the talks. It also did not ask for a deadline for concluding the talks. Japan also compromised on the issue of the objective of the framework talks, giving up its stand of July 1993 that the talks are meant to "effect an overall increase" in the participation and sales of competitive foreign products in the Japanese market, and accepting "sector-by-sector increases" in market participation and sales as the negotiations' objective. While some people are still negative about sales increase in insurance, this is still a major concession on Japan's part compared to its position last February that "we cannot promise any increase in the future." In short, the United States gave up its demand to set numerical targets for imports and sales, while Japan compromised on the framework talks' objective by accepting sector-by-sector increases. Differences and Ambiguous Points [subhead] In previous sector-by-sector negotiations, the question of the application of the objective criteria was not resolved. Instead of insisting on its previous position that this should apply only to "past results," Japan has now indicated a willingness to accept the application of such criteria on the number of dealers, past sales trends, and other "indicators" of expanded market opportunities, which it opposed last February. Taking advantage of this concession, the United States is now asking for the inclusion of "figures for the future" with regard to the supplementary indicators which do not directly reflect imports and sales, and this is considered to be merely a roundabout form of "seminumerical targets." A typical example of this is the proposal on figures for the future on the "number of dealers of foreign products" and so forth in the negotiations on automobiles and auto parts. In government procurement -- for instance, telecommunications -- which is entirely under government control, the United States may renew its demand to set future numerical indicators for the "procurement volume" itself. If the United States insists on such proposals and Japan refuses stubbornly, saying "these are numerical targets," the negotiations may break down again. However, certain U.S. sources claim that "bringing up future numerical indicators again for the supplementary categories is merely a negotiating technique of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)." They say that it is doubtful that the United States will insist on such proposals at the risk of another round of the depreciation of the dollar. It is possible that the United States will compromise further on numerical targets at the sector-by-sector negotiations.
