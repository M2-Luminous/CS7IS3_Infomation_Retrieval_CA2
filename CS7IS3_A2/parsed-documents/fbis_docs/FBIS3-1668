Elated by his initial "easy success," the governor quickly announced that he would put more parts of the electoral reform package before Legco for deliberation. This indicates that the British Government is bent on moving further away from the accords concerning Hong Kong it had formerly reached with China. The Chinese Government has reacted to the erroneous steps taken by the British side by declaring that any system forged under the Patten plan, including Legco itself, will come to an end when China recovers sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. And Hong Kong's political structure will be decided by the Chinese National People's Congress in line with the Basic Law. This is a just and appropriate stand that we, like all our fellow countrymen, with due sense of national dignity, voice full support. [sentence as published] The British have been vociferous that they only mean to meet the basic political demands of the Hong Kong residents, as if they were truly the champions of democracy. But this can only incur the scorn and derision of anyone who knows anything of the British colonialists track record over the last two centuries. The British have been in Hong Kong for more than 150 years but have they ever treated the Chinese people there as their equals? Why is it only now when they are being forced to quit that they begin to show "deep concern" for the democracy of Hong Kong? Are they really sincere or do they have ulterior motives? If the die-hard colonialists are daydreaming of playing tricks to obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong after 1997, they should be told that their dream will never come true. In the face of the unco-operative attitude of the British Government, the Chinese side has affirmed more than once that it will ensure a smooth transition for Hong Kong and continued prosperity for the area. China can be expected to be as good as its word. However, Britain's hypocritical actions over Hong Kong's future will inevitably have undesirable effects on Hong Kong and its people. The British side must bear all the responsibility for any adverse consequences which arise from its action. If the British do care about the residents of Hong Kong as they claim to, they should change track and mend their ways.
