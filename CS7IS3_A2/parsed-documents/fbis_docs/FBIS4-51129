As required by the circular, the market for these enterprises' property rights must be closed, and the operation of institutes engaged in this type of transactions must be temporarily suspended. The department concerned under the State Council will work out regulations on trading in state enterprises' property rights as soon as possible in order to standardize and legalize control over state enterprises' property rights transactions and the proceeds derived therefrom. The circular stressed that provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments must apply to the State Council for approval before they can engage in transactions in state enterprises' property rights. The government, which has not gone through the above procedure, must immediately suspend existing transactions and apply for permission. The people's government at the prefectural city level and below shall not engage in transactions in state enterprises' property rights. State enterprises are owned by the state. The transfer of the property rights of state enterprises controlled by local governments must be approved by the people's government at the prefectural city level and above. The State Council department concerned must apply to the State Council for approval before the property rights of state enterprises controlled by the central government can be transferred. The State Council's approval must be obtained before the property rights of exceptionally large or large state-owned enterprises (including those controlled by local governments) can be transferred. According to the circular, before the property rights of the state-owned enterprise are transferred, the enterprise's assets, including the relevant land-use rights, must be assessed in accordance with the "Regulations on Assessing State-Owned Assets." The property rights must be transferred in accordance with the state's relevant regulations, and, after the transfer, the parties concerned must register with the proper authorities. The proceeds derived from transferring state enterprise property rights must first be used to pay off bank loans and make proper arrangements for the workers and must then be used by the people's government at the same level to support structural adjustment or to inject capital into the enterprise, which needs to be supported, instead of using the funds to cover running expenses or deficits, pay wages, or award prizes. The department managing state-owned assets must strengthen the supervision over the use of proceeds from transferring state- owned enterprise property rights. It is strictly forbidden to convert the property rights of state enterprises into shares, to sell them at low prices, to give them away to individuals without compensation, or to transfer the property rights and interests of state-owned enterprises on credit. Such mistakes must be corrected. Specific measures must be taken to properly solve problems concerning the workers' employment and social security in transferring the property rights of state enterprises.
