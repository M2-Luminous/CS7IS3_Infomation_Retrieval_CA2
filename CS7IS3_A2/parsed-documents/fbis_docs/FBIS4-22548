In addition, 100,000 household gas meters will be installed this year in Ukraine. In the opinion of experts from the State Oil and Gas Committee of Ukraine, these measures will serve as the first step towards introducing a normal economy drive and precise controls on gas consumption in the country. This will also make it possible to determine accurately what each enterprise owes. It should be noted that this innovation by UKRHAZ is not an excessive measure: last year, because of a lack of tight controls by the gas corporation, the State Oil and Gas Committee was forced to write off approximately three billion cubic meters of gas as technical losses. In light of the above, UKRHAZ has decided to begin implementing the state program for producing household gas meters at Ukrainian enterprises this year. This program was developed jointly with the Ministry of Machine-Building of Ukraine in accordance with the government decree of 19 April 1993 "On Measures To Reduce the Consumption of Fuel and Energy Resources." Ukraine needs a minimum of some three million gas meters, while the number required in the household sector is more than 9 million meters, lus an additional 100,000 more each year for farms furnished with gas. In light of these figures, UKRHAZ was the initiator of the Cabinet of Ministers decree (3 April 1993) that charged the Ministry of Machine-Building with setting up the series production of individual gas meters beginning in the second half of 1992. In accordance with the plan worked out by the Ministry of Machine-Building, the gas meters will be produced by six enterprises in Ukraine: the OKTAVA and KYYIVPRYLAD production associations (both in Kiev), the PROMPRYLAD Producation Association (Ivano-Frankivsk), the Zhulyany Machine-Building Plant (Kiev Oblast), the ARKSI Concern in Boyarka, and the joint venture formed by the MUKACHEVPRYLAD leased enterprise and the Slovak PREMAGAZ enterprise (Zakarpattya Oblast). The volumes of the planned series production of gas meters are indicated in the table [table not reproduced]. UKRHAZ acquired several types of meters abroad, and these will also be installed in Ukraine. The cost of these meters has so far not been announced. According to Ivan Kolesnyk, the deputy chairman of UKRHAZ, 120 meters of the RL-20 type have already been tested in nine Western Ukrainian oblasts. This type of meter is designed primarily for use in small municipal and everyday services enterprises and farms. The advantage of these meters is that all their component parts can be produced from materials that are manufactured in Ukraine. A portion of the meters has already been produced by the OKTAVA Production Association. However, this association ran into difficulties at the end of 1992 because of a lack of component parts. We should note that in 1991, OKTAVA was granted the licensed equipment of the French firm SHLUMBERGER INDUSTRY valued at $3 million dollars. In order to set up normal production, OKTAVA also needed funds for mechanical assembling and for the training of Ukrainian specialists. Following negotiations between UKRHAZ and representatives of the French firm, agreement was reached that the OKTAVA Production Association would compensate the outlays of its foreign partners with finished products and certain components. As indicated above, OKTAVA has already completed the first batch of meters. By the end of 1994, production is to reach 50,000 units for the year. The enterprise's total annual projected output is 150,000 meters. Incidentally, experts feel that Ukraine has rather good technologies for manufacturing the diaphragms required in the production of household gas meters -- precisely what OKTAVA lacked. This technology has already been developed by the Kiev branch of the Scientific-Research Institute of Polymer Fibers and one other plant. According to UKRHAZ estimates, Ukraine's enterprises will not supply the required initial volume of household meters until 1997. An incentives system is currently being developed to boost the installation of meters by Ukraine's population. A household gas meter is expected to cost $25. This price was set taking into account the recommendations of a group of experts from the World Bank. UKRHAZ experts believe that given the world rates for the price of gas ($55-$80 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas), gas consumers will be interested in obtaining meters in the shortest possible time, inasmuch as today's rates are based on the average conventional per capita consumption of gas (1,000 cubic meters) -- a figure that is virtually conventional. The fact is that gas meter owners are already paying only 45 karbovantsi for one cubic meter of gas, rather than the 90 karbovantsi paid by the rest of the population of Ukraine.
