He explained that the government had done everything in its power to prevent the present clash, and even offered "major concessions." The YSP, however, proceeded to escalate to crisis, until it has reached the point where it is today. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani revealed, in a telephone interview with the Qatar News Agency, that the pro-secession forces in the South were receiving outside aid. He expressed his doubt, however, that the secessionists would be able to take advantage of this assistance. In his interview, al-Zandani criticized some of the Arab media for the way they were covering the events in Yemen, and called upon them to check their accuracy in the treatment of these events. He also called for a clear and strong Arab position that supported "truth and constitutional legitimacy." In this connection, the Presidential Council member lauded Qatar's position on the Yemen crisis, saying that "our brothers in Qatar have stood with us in our predicament, and stood with truth, unity, and legitimacy." Shaykh al-Zandani said in the interview that the forces of legitimacy and unity were in a secure position, and that they were now very close to Aden. He categorically denied the rumors about the presence of other Arab forces fighting alongside them. Responding to a question about the background of the events, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani said in his Qatar News Agency interview that the Socialist Party that had ruled the southern part of Yemen for 23 years, and that the communist regime had used the union as a cover, after the fall of the communist parties of other countries of the world, though they still were working for secession, and retained their hegemony over the southern and eastern governorates. They had, he said, spent the funds allocated to them, and budgets, for services benefiting their party, and never cared about the union. He added that the Socialist Party had never changed its agenda, even now, and still acted in line with the philosophy of struggle and the existence of contradiction, which it fed in creating the crisis. Furthermore, it still had a factory making alcoholic beverages, and encouraged sectarian, tribal, and party conflicts. He went on to say, "Then this party began to mortgage its policy to foreign interests and lost its appetite for the unity of Yemen, people, land, and government. So the crisis flared up." He said that the instigator of the crisis was 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who started it after his return from America on last 19 August, while the House of Representatives had put its trust in the coalition government on the third of that month. He added that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had begun to escalate the crisis after his "seclusion in Aden." He made life hard for people, until the crisis reached the point of military engagements. He said that the government had offered concessions that deserved consideration in order to avert collapse, but in spite of them the explosion took place in Abyan on the day the "Pledge and Accord Document" was signed. In his interview, His Excellency Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani enumerated many facts as evidence that it was the Socialist Party that had started the trouble and brought things to where they were now. He said that the Socialists were behind the fighting that took place in Shabwah, 'Umran, and Dhamar, between units of the armed forces. He said that the government had done everything in its power to contain these events, and keep their scope as narrow as possible, but the Socialist Party was engaged in plans to stir up and escalate the fighting in several regions, and this forced the government to take steps to protect its army and people, and to protect the union and the legitimate government. The president of the Yemeni Presidential Council indicated, however, in his answer to a question, that there was a large anti-secession group in the Socialist Party, which opposed the party's plans, and its voice was now being heard against the leadership. He said, "We wanted the Socialist Party to change its ideological and political conduct, to bury the past, and to resume a good life, but it utterly rejected this opportunity." In response to a question about whether it would be possible for the government to deal with the Socialist Party in the event the party's leadership changed, he said, "The government has laid down conditions for that, the first of which is that we cannot put down our arms unless the rebels submit to the legitimate government and the results of the April 1993 elections. And they must turn over war criminals for trial." As to whether the present war might turn into a civil war, Shaykh al-Zandani expressed his confidence that the Yemeni people in the South were even more dedicated than the people of the Northern governorates when it came to getting rid of the Socialist Party, because they had tasted the bitterness of that party's rule for 23 years. He added, "Many of those who are fighting the Socialist Party are from the southeastern governorates. As soon as they were assured that they would be protected from the Socialist Party and its maltreatment of them, and once they had the opportunity, they proclaim their true opinions of this party. Addressing the Socialists' position in the House of Representatives now that events had run out of control, al-Zandani said, in his interview with the Qatar News Agency, that some of them were still members of the House of Representatives' presidential commission, and that there were other members of House of Representatives who were now among the most vehement opponents of the Socialists. He added that "the wartime conditions could not besiege several Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives, who left the House of Representatives when some roads were blocked." In response to a question about the military situation, al-Zandani expressed "regret, because our brothers, especially those close to us, have not made the effort to seek out the facts." He went on to say that "union forces now are close to Aden, in Abyan. The media attacking us says that the battles are taking place on the former border. We do not know whether the call for Arab unity has now become a crime, or perhaps the union of Arab countries is now an atrocity. Is it now a crime to safeguard our legitimate government, freely chosen by the people, and to oppose a mutiny? We cry to God about this oppression of our loved ones, neighbors, and brothers." He said that the city of al-Dali' was now under union forces' control, and that the people in the Southern provinces only wanted to be reassured that the government would protect them from communist oppression, for them to show their true feelings. He indicated that secessionist brigades were surrendering one after the other, and joining the forces of the legitimate government. He explained that the biggest obstacle on the road to Aden now was the site of al-'Anad [military base], as it was a very strong fortress, with an airport and various equipment, and was surrounded by steep mountains. Turning to rumors that some Arabs, from Sudan and Iraq, were fighting alongside government forces in Yemen, the member of Yemen's Presidential Council said that these reports had absolutely no basis in truth. He said Sudan itself had denied it, and that there had been Iraqis in Aden for a long time; there were also Somalis fleeing the war in a camp in the Southern governorates. He expressed his regret that there was "media deception whose objective was to mislead," and that there was "a political movement at the pan-Arab level, based on the circumstances of the Gulf war, and for other reasons, to slander some Arab countries." Addressing Qatar's position on the crisis, Shaykh al-Zandani said that "our brothers in Qatar have a special place in our hearts, a place that has grown even dearer in this crisis. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Our brothers in Qatar have stood with us in our predicament, and stood with truth, unity, and legitimacy, and with their faith. They have adopted clear positions for which we thank them." He went on to say, "We say to the Arabs, `Ask yourselves, do you support mutiny against governments? Are you now for a socialist, communist party that fights Islam?'" In response to a question about whether the Southern forces had foreign backing, Shaykh al-Zandani that "there is foreign backing, which we know about. If it weren't for this foreign backing, they would never have dared to get involved in something like this. But if this aid reaches those who cannot use it, it will hurt the recipient and the giver." Al-Zandani expressed his confidence that this would do nothing to change the balance of power; it would not tip the scale in favor of the mutiny. He said, "We are in the right, and God will give us victory." Al-Zandani concluded by directing his remarks to Yemeni communities abroad, saying that "this is a decisive time for defining our position on this faction which has abandoned its nation, faith, and consensus. Your army and your people are dealing with this faction the only way they understand."
