But it contains the extremely important question of the budget message of M. Shaymiyev, president of the republic. The mere fact that the Tatar Parliament is considering the question of the budget when there is as yet no Russian budget clearly illustrates the commencement of the Russian-Tatar treaty. After all, this was previously impossible in principle, and local members of parliament could only discuss figures already confirmed by Moscow. No great joy on account of the new independence was discerned in the faces of the deputies, for that matter. A very gloomy picture is already taking shape from the three reports delivered on the first day of business of the session by the two deputy prime ministers and the minister of finance. All the negative trends of 1993 have only intensified in the first quarter of 1994. The decline in production, enterprises' nonpayments, and the corresponding reduction in the tax base are making optimization of the budget a nearly insoluble problem. This was why the deputies had a sea of questions for Finance Minister D. Nagumanov and F. Khamidullin, chairman of the State Committee for the Economy, who presented the forecast of socioeconomic development for 1994. The question-and-answer warmup did not satisfy the deputies, and they decided to devote the latter half of the first day of business to a detailed study in committee of the material that had been presented. The morning of day two of the business of the session began with questions to Deputy prime Minister R. Muratov, who had the day before reported the results of foreign economic activity. There were things to ask about. Imported food has been sold here at prices higher than world prices, and it is hard to see in the documents how the money earned was returned to the treasury or if it was returned at all. There are many puzzles concerning the petrodollars. It is now several sessions running that the deputies have attempted to obtain detailed information on the use of the oil money--and all to no avail as yet. But the question of the coming reform of the Cabinet of Ministers was the most interesting. R. Muratov had already let slip this measure at the recent annual meeting of the Trade and Industry Chamber, and this topic was now heard at the session. Just one thing was said about the essence of the reform: "Marketeers" should join the government. About everything else, we can only guess. The first conjecture is an unsubtle one--an increase in the machinery of administration. We heard at the session that expenditure on this in 1991-1993 had tripled, so the trend is clear. Things are more complex with regard to the "marketeers." Who personally? And in which position? President M. Shaymiyev is remaining silent also. The deputy prime minister is responding to all questions in a skillfully evasive manner. And the presentation to parliament of the most important budget question was for some reason or other entrusted not to the prime minister.... The subject of reform of the government was heard in the debate also, but there was no further clarification. The main motifs in the deputies' speeches were, for all that, demands for money for various sectors, depending on their place of employment. V. Mustafin defended the interests of the defense industry, specifically the KAPO. M. Shaykhiyev put the main emphasis on agriculture. V. Ivanov, on housing construction. O. Vladimirov, on investments in power engineering. This could be continued ad infinitum. The simple question of where the money for all this was to come from remained unclear. Through the mouth of Deputy A. Shtanin the "Power of the People" group moved that the budget in the form in which it had been presented be rejected and modified, revenue from exports and off- budget funds having been included in it. Deputy I. Salakhov made even more drastic proposals. The main one was that the cabinet be required before mid-May to have drawn up an anticrisis program and that socioeconomic development be forecast and the budget approved only then. Somehow on the quiet and imperceptibly in the interval between money battles the Supreme Soviet elected eight people's judges and terminated ahead of time the authority as deputies of I. Grachev, V. Mikhaylov, and G. Yegorov in connection with their election to the Russian Duma. Well, bon voyage! The evening sitting was addressed by M. Sabirov, prime minister of Tatarstan.
