With an investment of 222.8 million yuan so far, these projects, to be completed in two to three years, are mainly small and medium- sized ones in agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and technology-related industries needing relatively small investment but promising quick returns. The projects underway are two bridges, two reservoirs, two power stations and two power transmission lines. A local official said that Tibet plans to start a total of 58 construction projects with an annual investment of 167.5 million yuan this year as part of the three-rivers comprehensive development program. According to him, the central and regional governments will invest 2.1 billion yuan in the ten-year program, which is expected to boost the total industrial and agricultural output value of the valleys from 840 million yuan in 1990 to 1.724 billion yuan in the year 2000.
