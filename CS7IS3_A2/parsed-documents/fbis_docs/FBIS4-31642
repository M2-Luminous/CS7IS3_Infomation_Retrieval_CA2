Earlier, he accepted the resignation of Jerzy Milewski, who has, however, retained his post as deputy defense minister. Henryk Goryszewski started his political career as a Christian National Union [ZChN] deputy in the first democratically elected Sejm. In Hanna Suchocka's government, he was deputy prime minister as well as ZChN deputy chairman. After the fall of Suchocka's Cabinet, he left the ZChN leadership and retired from political life. Henryk Goryszewski told a reporter from the Polish radio "Signals of the Day" that he does not intend to introduce radical changes at the BBN: [Begin Goryszewski recording] I have great respect for the achievements of the BBN so far, when the bureau was managed by Minister Milewski. For this reason, it would definitely be premature to talk about any changes in the way the bureau works. Of course, like Minister Milewski, I shall be modifying the ways in which the bureau works, its procedures, when the need for such modification arises. In a way, this will occur in response to changing needs. I have always attempted to be a flexible politician. People view me as a pragmatist. [end recording]
