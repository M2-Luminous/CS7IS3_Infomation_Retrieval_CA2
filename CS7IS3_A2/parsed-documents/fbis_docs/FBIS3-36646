It was in the plane bringing him back to France on the afternoon of Saturday 5 February after a three-day visit to Moscow that the French defense minister learned of the massacre at the Sarajevo market, one of the six areas in Bosnia protected by the United Nations and now under fire from 188 Serbian guns according to French intelligence. Invited by Gen. Pavel Grachev, his Russian counterpart, with whom he visited the Taman mechanized infantry division, Francois Leotard tried at the end of last week to convince his interlocutors -- who included Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the council of ministers, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, and General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff -- of the need for air support for the humanitarian bridge to Tuzla and Srebrenica, two of the other areas placed by mandate under UN protection. Mr. Leotard thought he detected a slight difference in tone in the statements of Mr. Kozyrev, the diplomat, and Gen. Grachev, the soldier. The former struck him as "less peremptory and less stubborn" than the latter. The French minister told Mr. Kozyrev that an air operation backed by the United Nations, under the terms of a resolution already approved by the Russians and requested, if necessary, by the local UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] officials, is not aggressive because it would be "close air support" intended to accompany humanitarian aid to prevent it from being attacked. It is not "an Iraqi concept" Mr. Leotard explained, referring to the 1991 raids on Baghdad. Mr. Kozyrev agreed that it is necessary to avoid any quarrel on terminology and that more detailed explanation should be continued. However, he suspects the big Western powers at the United Nations of "wishing to punish the Serbs alone" by these actions. New Military Doctrine Mr. Leotard also suggested to the Russian foreign minister that Moscow should support the attitude of France which is seeking to obtain the international community's "impartiality" and "neutrality" in the Yugoslav conflict. Starting with the United States. Without having any formal proof of this, the French suspect the Americans of arming the Bosnian Muslims by secret supplies, as they did in Afghanistan. This French request for Russia's cooperation is strange to say the least, addressed to a country which, as Mr. Leotard's entourage admits, makes no secret of its pro-Serbian sympathies -- although it denies that -- or of its desire as a European and Slav power to reestablish a more active diplomacy in the region after three years of low profile. With Gen. Grachev, however, the dialogue was more closely argued. The Russian defense minister thinks that the use of fighter planes "could lead to an escalation" on the ground and that these are "bombing raids" aimed at "exerting pressure on the Serbian side" in situations -- the Tuzla and Srebrenica areas -- which are "artificial" and "exaggerated" for demonstration purposes. Gen. Grachev therefore rules out any "bombing" of Tuzla. His French interlocutors had the feeling that he was also opposed to it in that, to carry out such actions in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations chose NATO's structures and military resources as its secular arm. In an indirect but fairly convincing way, these discussions between Russians and French on the Balkan crisis also revealed the ambiguity of the new military doctrine adopted in November 1993 by Moscow. Mr. Leotard was given a commentary on this text by Gen. Grachev and Gen. Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security Council. Indeed, in light of what is happening in Bosnia, but also in Moldova, in the Transcaucasus, in Tajikistan, or in Georgia, for instance, two more specific points should warrant greater attention from the Western general staffs. The first of these aspects apparently relates to the difficulty which the Russian military have in designing defensive actions, although their new doctrine is intended to be based resolutely on operations of a nonoffensive nature. Concept of `Nearby Foreign Countries' The confusion -- if it is unintentional -- which the Russians are maintaining between a bombing raid (which can be a deliberately aggressive action) and air support (which amounts to prevention of a possible provocation) suggests that they do not share this distinction, which is usual in the Western general staffs and that they have stuck to their previous concept based on the offensive. The second point seems even more fraught with misunderstandings. It relates to the idea which the Russians have of what is called the security "architecture" in Europe and, through this collective notion, the security area proper to their country and the sphere recognized as that of "nearby foreign countries" [countries of the former Soviet Union] according to an expression used in their new doctrine. In other words, as Mr. Leotard asked his interlocutors, when and where does Russia's security start if it does not want to be accused of making the limits of its interests coincide with the borders of the former Soviet Union? The answers may have varied from one interlocutor to another, but they were close in substance. According to Gen. Lobov, Russia has 60,000 km of borders to protect -- half of which are not currently protected -- and, with its 2.1 million men under arms in 1995, it would respond to the countries which might seek its aid. According to Gen. Grachev, Russia is the only state in the world to have currently deployed so many "peace soldiers" (1,200 "blue helmets" in the former Yugoslavia and 16,000 of its men in Moldova, the Trancaucasus, or Tajikistan without any UN mandate). In reply to the Russian minister who wanted France to send observers to Georgia under UN auspices, Mr. Leotard said that it would send around six "White Helmets" of the 55 originally planned. Mr. Kozyrev, for his part, summed up the Russian position on "nearby foreign countries" by rejecting the accusation of "imperialism" or a return to Greater Russia which has often been made against his country's military doctrine. He asked Mr. Leotard how, from this viewpoint, France justified "the legal basis" of its military presence in Africa. He expressed the hope that he should be sent -- as a source of inspiration if necessary -- the defense agreements on which France bases its interventions on that continent. Despite the many differences of opinion, Gen. Grachev and the French defense minister nonetheless signed two framework cooperation agreements one of which -- by far the most important -- establishes the conditions in which France will help to renovate old Mig-21's, delivered for export, and to produce a twin-jet training plane called the Mig-AT [Advanced Trainer].
