Before the election the country's inflation rate had reached 200 per cent, Rangsi said, adding that Cambodia should be registered as the only country to reduce its inflation rate to zero while its economy is developing after a decade-long war. "The growth rate of the GDP in 1993 is 5 per cent and we expect to increase it to 7 per cent this year," Rangsi said in an interview with THE NATION. Rangsi said that one year after the UN-organized elections the government is still functioning, and civil servants and police have been fully and regularly paid their monthly salary. "One year after the election, the government can maintain itself, not collapse. It can provide public utilities for the people -- water, electricity and other facilities. We did not collapse, although we got only US$13 million from the UN against a promise of about US$60 million for the first six months after the election," he said. He blamed a budget deficit and inflation on the previous administration of then Prime Minister Hun Sen, of the Cambodian People's Party. The problem facing the country now was law enforcement, he said.
