The explosion occurred in Kanggye in Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several buildings in the city. The "Kanggye No. 26 General Plant" was North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed following the accident. SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song, 32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in 1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in the plant's "sports team." Moreover, his two brothers were serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar with the internal affairs of the plant. According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130 [1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2 kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130 GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned. The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no. 11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127, but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about 200, including civilian casualties. Immediately after the incident, a "suicide squad" was organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some 20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later awarded the title "Heroes of the Republic." Following the incident, many party and government leaders-- including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers' Party [KWP] Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho, and KWP Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim Man-song--inspected the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20 days following the accident, and a strict news blackout was imposed on the area. In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface missiles were respectively codenamed "Hwasong [Mars] 1, 2, and 3"; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted the plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of over 550 kilometers. All products of the plant were originally designed in the former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: "The Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons." The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2 kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as material dumps and management offices are located outside. Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been kept secret until now.
