Though the two nations do not share common border, both had, each in a different way, to suffer being made a colony of a foreign power. Both nations had long and arduous freedom struggles, each in its own way, but nevertheless were able to expel the intruders. Premier Vo Van Kiet noted with nostalgia the visit of his country's beloved leader, President Ho Chi Minh, to Myanmar 36 years ago. Today, both nations are bringing about economic reforms in similar ways. This has prompted Senior General Than Shwe to note that gaining knowledge from each other's experiences and developing mutually beneficial cooperation at the present moment would enable the two nations to see prosperity and move on toward creating a prosperous region. Moreover, the Senior General, in his banquet speech, has also opined that from the mutual goodwill generated by the visit, the spirit of mutual assistance, goodwill and understanding, and unified cooperation will flourish in our region of Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese Premier was also pleased to note that in the current new situation, the good traditional relations thus far nurtured by our two peoples are now gathering new momentum to further develop through sincere cooperation for the prosperity of the two nations. The Senior General shares these views. He said he firmly believes that through the frank and open exchanges of views during the visit, the two nations will be able to enhance the mutual regard and understanding and the friendly ties which already exist. Our two nations share common values, common ideals and similar culture. It is with this common identity and respect for each other that nations like ours must work together in order to accomplish what we wish to. The Vietnamese Premier and entourage are taking in Mandalay and Pyin Oo Lwin in their short visit. They will at least be able to get a better idea of the socio-economic changes brought about in this country. The reforms being brought about in our two countries and the initial strides we have made reflect the wisdom and integrity of the leaders and the peoples. We wish our distinguished guests an enjoyable stay.
