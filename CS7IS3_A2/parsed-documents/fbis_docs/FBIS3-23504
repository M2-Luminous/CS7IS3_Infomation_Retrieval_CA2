Levin under the rubric "Information for Reflection": "Ground-Attack Aircraft"] [Text] Ground-attack aircraft, which were developed most heavily in Soviet aviation during the Great Patriotic War, were removed from service in the 1950s. The work stopped at that time on the try-out of new aircraft in this class. The experience of local wars, however, forced a return to the idea of creating a specialized, well-armored aircraft armed with a powerful cannon for the battlefield. The Su-25 and the A-10A thus appeared almost simultaneously in the USSR and the United States. Su-25 Versions. Su-25 UB (1985)--combat trainer; SU-25UT (1988)--trainer intended for air clubs; SU-25UTG (1989)--carrier-based trainer. Crew. One. Dimensions. Wingspan of 14.36 meters, area of 30.1 m[.sup]2[/]; length of aircraft (with PVD [pitot boom]) 15.36 meters, height 4.8 meters. Mass (with R-195 TRDs [turbojet engines]). Maximum takeoff 17,600 kg, normal takeoff 14,600 kg. Flight characteristics (with R-95Sh TRDs). Maximum speed at ground level 950 km/hr, landing speed 200 km/hr; maximum weapons delivery altitude 5,000 meters; effective flight range with ordnance load of 1,000 kg and without external fuel tanks at ground level 510 km, maximum ferry range with four external tanks more than 1,850 km; turning radius with 1,500 kg bombs at altitude of 1,500 meters: 570 meters at speed of 460 km/hr, 680 meters at speed of 555 km/hr; takeoff run 600 meters on hard-surfaced runways, 1,200 meters on unimproved runways; landing runout on concrete runway 400 meters (600 meters without braking chute); maximum operational G-forces of 6.5 with ordnance load of 1,500 kg, 5.2 with load of 4,000 kg. Engines. R-95Sh (2 x 4,100 kgf) turbojet engines, R-195 (2 x 4,500 kgf) on later models. Armaments. Gravity bombs of 100 to 500 kg, small payload pods, 57 to 270 mm rockets, air-to-ground missiles with Kh-25 and Kh-29 laser or television homing systems, cluster bombs of various types, pods with cannons or two R-60M air-to-air missiles on ten pylons. Normal mass of armaments on external stores racks 1,000 kg, maximum of 4,000 kg. Built-in armaments are GSh-30 twin-barrel cannon (30mm, 250 rounds, rate of fire 3,000 rounds/minute). Equipment. ASP-17BTs-8 firing and bomb sight, Klen-PS laser rangefinder/target designator, A-031 radio altimeter, DISS-7 Doppler speed and drift angle meter, passive means of infrared protection, K-36 ejection seat. The aircraft design employed a fully welded cockpit with titanium armor, a canopy with an armored front optical block, protected fuel tanks filled with porous materials, and control lines with enhanced damage resistance. Later versions of the aircraft have the TRDs separated by an armored partition, and the firefighting system was improved using freon. An autonomous system of technical maintenance located in four pods that are transported on the external pylons of the Su-25 aircraft was developed for the aircraft, providing for the servicing of the aircraft at unimproved frontal airfields. The SU-25 with the R-195 engine may be used as a target tow and platform for diving targets. Status. In service with the air forces of the CIS countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Iraq. Additional information. Additional information. The necessity arose at the end of the 1960s of creating a ground-attack aircraft able to wage battle successfully against small targets on the battlefield and at the front line, as well as for use in local conflicts. Attempts were undertaken to make such an aircraft on the basis of the Il-28 bomber, as well as to "resuscitate" the Il-40 project of the 1950s. Under these conditions, the OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] of P. Sukhoy proposed at the end of the 1960s, on its own initiative, the creation of a light and highly maneuverable armored ground-attack aircraft that would be fitted with existing armaments and equipment. Despite the fact that the idea did not meet with the unanimous support of the Air Forces (the pilots wanted to get an aircraft with advanced armaments and BREO [on-board electronics gear] optimized for use in ground-attack aviation), the program obtained approval from the leadership of the Air Forces. The first flight of the experimental T-8-1 aircraft fitted with the R-9 TRD (a variation of a non-afterburning engine that had been installed in the MiG-19), took place in 1975, after which the T-8-1 and T-8-2 experimental aircraft were fitted with R-95 TRDs created on the basis of the R-13 TRDF [afterburning turbojet engine]. Preparations for series production of the new aircraft began in 1976 at the aviation plant in the city of Tbilisi, and the first flight took place in 1978. Twenty three aircraft were lost during combat operations in Afghanistan, with the death of eight pilots. One aircraft that was shot down had accumulated 2,800 hours of combat flying time. The Su-25 as a whole proved to be a most effective strike aircraft in Afghanistan. The Su-25 earned the highest evaluation in the Iraqi Air Forces during the Iran-Iraq War. Iraqi Su-25s were effectively not employed in combat operations in the Persian Gulf, but two aircraft were shot down by American fighters while attempting to fly to Iranian territory. The improved Su-25T, which is deserving of a separate article, was created on the basis of the Su-25. Fairchild-Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II Versions. A-10B--a two-seat trainer, N/AW-10 (1979)--a version of the A-10B for operations at night and in bad weather conditions, OA-10D--forward air spotting and target-designation aircraft (retrofitted from series-production A-10A aircraft). Crew. One. Dimensions. Wingspan of 17.53 meters, area of 47.01 m[.sup]2[/]; length of aircraft 16.26 meters, height 4.47 meters. Mass. Maximum takeoff 23,680 kg, in takeoff from unimproved airfields 14,865 kg, without ordnance 11,320 kg; fuel in internal tanks 4,853 kg, in external tanks 5,300 kg (3 x 2,270 liters). Flight characteristics. Top speed of 722 km/hr, speed at 1,500 meters with six 227-kg bombs 704 km/hr; cruising speed 623 km/hr at altitude of 1,500 meters; radius of operations when performing tasks of close support (including loitering for 1.7 hours) 460 km,, with deep strikes into enemy rear 1,000 km, ferry range of 3,950 km; takeoff run 760 meters, landing runout (with braking parachute) 410 meters. Engines. General Electric TF34-GE-100 TRDDs [afterburning turbojet engines] (2 x 4,100 kgf). Armaments. GAU-8A Avenger cannon (30 mm, 1,174 rounds, rate of fire 2,100/4,200 rounds/minute), up to 28 Mk.82 bombs (227 kg), up to six Mk.84 bombs (904 kg), up to eight BLU-1 or BLU-27/B ZABs [incendiary bombs], up to 20 Rockeye RBKs [combat missile systems], up to 18 GBU-12 KABs [cluster bombs] (with laser homing systems) or GBU-10 KABs, up to six AGM-65A/B/D Maverick guided missiles, two AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles, two SUU-23 (20 mm) external cannon pods. The number of weapons racks is eleven, with a maximum load of 7,260 kg. Equipment. The Tacan radionavigational system, the ASN-141 INS [inertial navigation system], an instrument landing system, ILS [head-up display], ELT [television radar display] indicator providing the opportunity to employ the Maverick missiles with television or infrared homing systems; the AN/AAS-38 Pave Penny laser target search and tracking laser system in a pod under the fuselage in the nose (there is no laser rangefinder/target designator; the aircraft is able to operate against targets illuminated by laser from another aircraft or the ground), an AN/ALR-46(V), AN/ALR-64 or AN/ALR-69 radar illumination warning receiver, an AN/ALE-37 or AN/ALE-40 chaff and IR decoy dispenser, and an AN/ALQ-119 pod with jamming transmitters (on external racks). The installation of a system to warn of proximity to the ground is also possible. Armoring protects the cockpit and other vitally important parts of the aircraft against shells up to 23 mm in caliber (the mass of the cockpit armor box is 544 kg). The ejection seat is a McDonnell-Douglas ACES-II. There is an aerial refueling system as well. Status. Series produced from 1975 to 1984. There were 813 aircraft built. There were 610 A-10A/B and 20 OA-10D aircraft in service with the Air Force and the National Guard of the United States in 1992. The aircraft costs 7.3 million dollars (at 1980 rates). It was not supplied for export. Figure Additional information. Generation of TTT [tactical-performance specifications] in 1966, issue of contracts for development in 1970, first flight of experimental aircraft in 1975. The experimental two-seat N/A-10W version, refitted from the A-10B trainer and intended for operations at night and in bad weather conditions, was tested in 1979. Testing of aircraft equipped with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, intended for self-defense, was conducted in 1986. The possibility of replacing these aircraft with A-16 strike aircraft using the General Dynamics F-16C fighter has been under study in the United States since the end of the 1980s (an aircraft of this type was to have performed the tasks of close support and battlefield air interdiction, i.e. combine the functions of a ground-attack aircraft and a fighter/bomber), owing to the ineffectiveness of the A-10 in operations against the second echelon of enemy subunits. Funds were not allocated for the program, however, because of the cutbacks in defense spending. The high survivability of the aircraft made it possible to retrofit some of the ground-attack aircraft into forward air spotter aircraft (they are replacing the North American OV-10 Bronco aircraft, which had been used as far back as in Vietnam, in this role). The A-10A showed itself to be one of the most effective means of defeating manpower and vehicles on the battlefield during the combat operations in the Persian Gulf. The aircraft were employed both day and night (with the aiming performed using the infrared homing heads of the Maverick missiles). The combat losses were five A-10A aircraft. Fire from the cannon of an A-10A attack aircraft shot down an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
