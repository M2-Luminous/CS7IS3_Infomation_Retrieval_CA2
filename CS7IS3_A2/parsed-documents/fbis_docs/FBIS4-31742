Belgrade (from our associate)--Communism in Yugoslavia has not yet died; it has only turned into a vampire. In the building of the former Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia [CC LCY], at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube, the Yugoslav Revolutionary Youth Organization [JRM], or, as its leaders call it, the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia, held its founding assembly. By "Yugoslavia" they do not mean the present mini-Yugoslavia, but rather the one from Broz's time, which reached from Triglav to Vardar. The JRM's first activities have already begun. Fourteen years after Tito's death, one can see on Belgrade streets posters saying "We are Tito's--Tito is ours," and one can hear the anthem "Hey, Slavs." That circus of communist offspring would not merit any attention if it did not have its base in the building of the former CC LCY, which is controlled and managed by Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. The JRM has guaranteed spaces there and the best opportunities to operate, which means that the ruling Serbian regime is backing it. Who are those young people and where are they from (actually they are not really young, since none of them is under 25) is hard to find out. It is even harder to explain their harsh slogans, uttered with a fist raised high: "We will restore Yugoslavia," "Hope is on the left," "Fraternity and unity again," "Socialism is democracy," "The five-pointed star is our shrine...." The residents of Belgrade who have seen that communist offspring of Yugoslavia did not realize immediately what was going on. At first they thought that some sort of film was being taped. Recently, in fact, a splendid impersonator of Josip Broz, known as Micko, on instructions from director Zelimir Zilnik, walked along Belgrade streets and spoke with astonished bystanders. Skillfully disguised and dressed in a marshal's uniform, he asked Belgrade residents whether they missed him at all. Most of them answered that they regretted that he was no longer with them, and that he was in their hearts forever. Forever? The establishment of the JRM obviously indicates that people in the present Yugoslavia also think so.
