[passage omitted] Some time before the Israeli-PLO signing ceremony in Cairo, opposition faction leaders held a special news conference, at which they sharply attacked the government. Knesset Member [MK] Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud, said this was a dark day for the state and one of the lowest points in the history of Zionism. "In an hour, Rabin will be able to declare that he has founded the Palestinian terrorist state in Cairo," Netanyahu said. He maintained that the government has kept none of the pledges it had made on the eve of the Knesset elections: not to negotiate with the PLO and not to permit the establishment of a Palestinian state. He stressed that this government did not have a popular majority, just as it did not have a mandate to give up the Golan Heights. According to him, the government was carried by a tiny majority of PLO supporters in the Knesset, and during its term in office, the citizens' personal safety had suffered unprecedented deterioration. Netanyahu noted that it was the opinion of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] elements that rather than decline, the scope of terrorist activities would rise in the near future. He added that terrorist organizations might mutually agree to carry out attacks in new locations, and that their Gaza and Jericho squads might carry out attacks on Israeli territory. The Likud chairman stressed that the opposition factions had decided to launch an extensive public campaign against the creeping withdrawal and against the terrorist state's expansion up to the outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. "We want to prevent this cancer from spreading and to put an end to this inept government's fraudulence. We plan to stage demonstrations and protest vigils, and to obtain the signatures of 500,000 citizens in support of the call for early elections," Netanyahu said. He voiced his confidence that the opposition factions' public struggle would be crowned with success, thereby relegating the present government into history as a passing episode; and that idea of a Palestinian state would fail, because the government was incapable of uprooting 120,000 Israeli settlers in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted] Later in the day, opposition leaders reacted to the ceremony at which the Israel-PLO accord was signed. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that "Rabin's series of concessions ended at a public degradation ceremony. Suffice it to see with whom Rabin signed the agreement to understand the nature of the agreement and the nature of the government that signed it." MK Refa'el Eytan, the Tzomet chairman, said: "In Cairo, Rabin signed orders launching Israel's second war of independence, a war sure to be ferocious. The faltering that accompanied the signing proves that the unknown far exceeds the known. If the agreement is not stopped in time, it will lead to a Palestinian state whose final goal is the annihilation of the State of Israel." MK Eytan added that like the other opposition factions, Tzomet demands that the Knesset be dispersed and new elections held within 100 days. MK Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party leader, said: "The prospects offered by this agreement are not on par with the vast risk that national security will be endangered and with the damage caused by a profound national rift." He asserted that a Palestinian state was being served on a platter to the same terrorist organizations that made merry with the blood of our sons and daughters, while a majority of the nation are hurting and sorrowful, apprehensive and distrustful, feeling completely insecure and unsafe as a result of the blurred facts and vague reality painted by the government. Commenting on the agreement, MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, chairman of the Moledet movement, said: "Acting as if we were the ones who lost wars, the Israeli prime minister today signed the writ of surrender to the head of the PLO gang. This day will be remembered in our national history as a dark day, a landmark on the Jewish state's way to perdition and voluntary suicide. Yet we have not lost hope, and we will be again lords of this land when this government of coercion and annihilation is defunct and we become a free nation in our own country." "This is a dark day, a day of humiliating surrender to our enemies and murderers, a day on which a mistake for which we will have to pay with blood was made," former Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir said yesterday afternoon. "What they did today is worthless, without any value; it wastes time and strengthens our enemies, whom we could have defeated by now," MK Shamir added.
