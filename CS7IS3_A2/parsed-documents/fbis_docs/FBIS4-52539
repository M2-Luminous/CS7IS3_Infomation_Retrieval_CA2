FBIS4-52539 "dreas091_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 South Korea * DPRK Transportation System Analyzed * DPRK Transportation System Analyzed Second Installment 942C0104A Seoul PUKHAN in Korean No 267, Mar 94 pp 134-137 942C0104A Seoul PUKHAN Korean CSO [Excerpts] As of 1991, North Korea had 5,059 kilometers of railway trackage, or 78 percent of 6,462 kilometers in South Korea. In North Korea, 3,280 kilometers, or 65 percent of the total length of railways, were electrified. The rate of electrification is high compared with South Korea. Nevertheless North Korea's railways are not playing their proper role. First, 98 percent of the railways in North Korea are single-track. Regardless of improvements made in the efficiency of transportation on single-track railways through electrification, the more North Korea depends on railways for long-distance freight transportation, the more frequently the trains need to operate (dependency on railways in freight transportation is said to have risen from 88 percent in 1988 to 90 percent in 1992). The greater the frequency of train operation, the greater the number of intermediate stations needed, and consequently, the longer the stoppage-time required. Therefore, the efficiency of electric rail transport is bound to fall, despite electrification's purpose having been to improve the speed of train runs. When freight transportation depends so much on single-track railways, any distribution system North Korea has is far from adequate. [passage omitted] According to So Yong-chol, a former North Korean guard and guide for south-bound spy missions who defected to the South across the armistice line in September 1989, "between Kaesong and Wonsan there is no means of transportation other than the railway. The train leaves Kaesong for Pyongyang at 1845 daily." It is hardly understandable why there is only one train run a day between Pyongyang and Kaesong, if we assume that materials are transported and delivered in North Korea in a quantity commensurate with the scale of the North Korean economy. The trains should run far more frequently. As of 1991, the total length of expressways in North Korea was 354 kilometers and the total number of motor vehicles was 270,000 (there are 4.25 million in South Korea). Assuming one-tenth of these vehicles, that is, 27,000 are on the Pyongyang-Nampo, Pyongyang-Wonsan, Pyongyang-Kaesong, and Pyongyang- Huichon expressways, linking major industrial areas and urban centers, simple arithmetic indicates that about four vehicles should be seen on these expressways for each 100 meters. Supposing trucks run on the expressways at 60 kilometers per hour, at least 2,000 trucks could be seen per hour. Granting that the North Korean authorities are limiting the operation of trucks in order to prevent increases in oil imports, the volume of materials transported that can be projected from the actual observations of the defectors and travellers provides sufficient ground to raise doubts about the actual scale of the North Korean economy. [passage omitted] North Korea's explanation of [the lack of traffic and activity in Pyongyang] is rather ironical. They say that the stores in North Korea play the role of a distributor who distributes goods to local inhabitants, instead of keeping stocks of goods on a regular basis so that he might sell articles to the customers from time to time as they come. People come to pick up their items at a given time when those items are available; that is why on ordinary days there are very few customers visiting the stores. If this is true, we cannot but be curious about whether there are sufficient means of transportation necessary to distribute all the daily necessities and whether such means are in an operational condition.
