A 12-member Chinese delegation led by Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi will arrive here on Tuesday [14 June] for the meeting. Apart from the official delegation, the Chinese minister will bring with her a Chinese businessmen team consisting of chairmen of major Chinese trading corporations. The Chinese businessmen will interact with their Indian counterparts to tap the great potential of bilateral trade between the two countries.

Two-way trade between India and China, which has been developing fast over recent years, totalled 670 million U.S. dollars last year, nearly doubling that of the previous year, Hu said. "At the meeting, we will focus on further development of bilateral trade through setting up more joint ventures and transferring technologies," he said.
