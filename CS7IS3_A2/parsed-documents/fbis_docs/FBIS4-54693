Just as they did two years ago, chetniks attacked this morning as well. They were shelling defense lines at the northwest section of the battlefield. They opened mortar and intensive infantry fire at the Pobjeda Factory from Grbavo Brdo. The situation was the same along the entire line of separation at the left bank of the Drina. They were peaceful at the right bank this morning, but despite all decrees, resolutions, and ultimatums, they are still positioned only several hundred meters away from the town center. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] forces are trying to do something, but without effect. They are explaining this by the fact that they have no authorization and precise instructions from their superiors and that they are waiting for results of the Silajdzic-Akashi and Karadzic-Akashi talks. The Chetniks, however, are not waiting at all. They continue plundering, carrying out provocations, blackmailing, and distorting facts. This could certainly not be done without influential sponsors in the United Nations.
