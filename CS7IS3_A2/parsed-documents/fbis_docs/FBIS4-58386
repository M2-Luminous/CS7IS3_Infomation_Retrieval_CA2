FBIS4-58386 "drnes086_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 ISRAEL Release of 2,500 Palestinian Prisoners Begins Release of 2,500 Palestinian Prisoners Begins TA0405113594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1100 GMT 4 May 94 TA0405113594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] The release of the 2,500 prisoners slated to return home by Sunday, as stipulated in the Cairo agreement, began at midday today. Our correspondents Nisim Qeynan and Moti Amir report that seven buses carrying freed prisoners left the Qezi'ot detention facility and headed for the Gaza Strip, but were stopped at the Nahal 'Oz checkpoint. Meanwhile, a large crowd of relatives was waiting for the returning prisoners on the other side of the checkpoint. The hold-up is believed to have been caused by the delay in the Cairo ceremony. The buses with released prisoners were eventually permitted to drive on. It has been learned that all the released prisoners are affiliated with Fatah, with the exception of two Islamic Jihad and two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] members who signed a statement of support for the Declaration of Principles, and that about 1,000 prisoners will be released by the end of the day. In Gaza city and in refugee camps in the Strip, the returning locals are being received with festive processions. In Jericho, local inhabitants decorated the police station with flowers and palm branches and hoisted a PLO flag. The city has been declared a closed military zone.
