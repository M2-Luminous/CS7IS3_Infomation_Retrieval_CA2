FR940705-2-00190 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;A. The original reference to organisms as Class 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 refers to the classification in the publication Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, 4th Edition, July 1974, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Biosafety, Atlanta, Georgia 30333. Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;A&hyph;1. The NIH Director, with advice of the RAC, may revise the classification for the purposes of these NIH Guidelines (see Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(d)). The revised list of organisms in each class is reprinted in Appendix B. Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;B. A subset of non-conjugative plasmid vectors are poorly mobilizable (e.g., pBR322, pBR313). Where practical, these vectors should be employed. Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;C. Defined as observable under optimal laboratory conditions by transformation, transduction, phage infection, and/or conjugation with transfer of phage, plasmid, and/or chromosomal genetic information. Note that this definition of exchange may be less stringent than that applied to exempt organisms under Section III&hyph;E&hyph;5. Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;D. As classified in the Third Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses: Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses, R.E.F. Matthews (ed.), Intervirology 12 (129&hyph;296), 1979. Appendix C&hyph;VI&hyph;E. i.e., the total of all genomes within a Family shall not exceed one-half of the genome. Appendix D. Major Actions Taken Under the NIH Guidelines Under Section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1), the NIH Director may take certain actions with regard to the NIH Guidelines after the issues have been considered by the RAC. An updated list of these actions are available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Appendix E. Certified Host-Vector Systems (see Appendix I) While many experiments using Escherichia coli K&hyph;12, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Bacillus subtilis are currently exempt from the NIH Guidelines under Section III&hyph;E, some derivatives of these host-vector systems were previously classified as Host-Vector 1 Systems or Host-Vector 2 Systems. A listing of those systems follows: Appendix E&hyph;I. Bacillus subtilis Appendix E&hyph;I&hyph;A. Bacillus subtilis Host-Vector 1 Systems The following plasmids are accepted as the vector components of certified B. subtilis systems: pUB110, pC194, pS194, pSA2100, pE194, pT127, pUB112, pC221, pC223, and pAB124. B. subtilis strains RUB 331 and BGSC 1S53 have been certified as the host component of Host-Vector 1 systems based on these plasmids. Appendix E&hyph;I&hyph;B. Bacillus Subtilis Host-Vector 2 Systems The asporogenic mutant derivative of Bacillus subtilis, ASB 298, with the following plasmids as the vector component: pUB110, pC194, pS194, pSA2100, pE194, pT127, pUB112, pC221, pC223, and pAB124. Appendix E&hyph;II. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Appendix E&hyph;II&hyph;A. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Host-Vector 2 Systems The following sterile strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all of which have the ste-VC9 mutation, SHY1, SHY2, SHY3, and SHY4. The following plasmids are certified for use: YIp1, YEp2, YEp4, YIp5, YEp6, YRp7, YEp20, YEp21, YEp24, YIp25, YIp26, YIp27, YIp28, YIp29, YIp30, YIp31, YIp32, and YIp33.
