Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), made the request when he and other leaders of his business lobby met with the prime minister over breakfast, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at a news conference. Hosokawa told the business leaders that now is the crucial time in Diet debate on a government-sponsored political reform package aimed at rooting out corruption in Japanese public life. Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enactment of the package before the current Diet session ends on January 29. The premier reportedly said he wants to make a judgment on fresh pump-priming measures in line with talks of an economic panel of the government and ruling coalition parties.
