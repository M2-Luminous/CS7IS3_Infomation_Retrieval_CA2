Israeli officials said Peres and 'Arafat discussed the possibility of a meeting between the PLO leader and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but no more details were given. In Cairo, where PLO and Israeli negotiators held further talks Thursday, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Rabin and 'Arafat were expected to sign a final accord on the launch of Palestinian self-rule in the first week in May. "It will very probably be between Monday, May 2, and Wednesday, May 4," Sha'th said. "Rabin and Arafat will meet in Cairo over two days." Peres said 'Arafat was "encouraged by the good news" coming from the Cairo talks. "We feel we are very near to the conclusion of an agreement" on autonomy, Peres said. The PLO and Israel would "try to resume and conclude the talks as soon as possible," he said, adding that there were "some remaining issues which are being negotiated in Cairo." "Both the Palestinians and us are deeply interested in shortening the transition." Peres told Israeli radio differences remained over control of airspace and territorial waters, jurisdiction in the future autonomous areas and the Palestinian autonomy council due to oversee five years of interim self-rule leading up to a final settlement. After his first meeting with Arafat in the Romanian capital Peres also noted differences over economic issues and the identity papers Palestinians would carry. Peres and 'Arafat held three sessions of talks, their first since a Jewish settler slaughtered 30 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque on February 25 leading the PLO to halt the autonomy talks for five weeks. They were due to give a joint press conference at the end of the day. Romanian officials said they would also have a joint meeting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu Thursday, before co-chairing a session of the Crans-Montana Forum, an international conference on the economic future of the Middle East. Israel was due to begin a troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on December 13 and complete it by April 13, but the handover was delayed by disagreements over security arrangements and the disruption caused by the Hebron massacre. On arrival in Bucharest 'Arafat again deplored the fact that the April 13 deadline had not been kept. However, Peres said he hoped the pullout would take place "as soon as possible." After his first session of talks with 'Arafat he said he had tried to dispel the PLO leader's anxiety about implementation of the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington last September. 'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave Bucharest Friday, will instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of the Executive Committee" of the PLO, he said.
