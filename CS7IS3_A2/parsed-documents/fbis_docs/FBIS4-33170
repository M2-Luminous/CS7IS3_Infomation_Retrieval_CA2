If we have gotten to where we are now and we are still here, it is because we have learned never to make the slightest compromise regarding sovereignty and independence. Vaies points out that 20 May 1902 is not Cuban Independence Day; it is the day that the crime of seizing the independence that the Cuban people had fought for for over a third of a century pseudojudicially took place. He adds further on in the article: We arrived at 20 May 1902 through the cunning and greed of a nation that coveted Cuba for a century. After analyzing a number of historic events that prove this, Luis Vais responds, clearly and precisely, to several of the U.S. President's statements regarding our people and his government. In this manner, the deceit in those statements is exposed.
