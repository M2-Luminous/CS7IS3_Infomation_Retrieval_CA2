FBIS4-5601 "dreas070_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 North Korea White Paper Issued on Japan's Nuclear Armament White Paper Issued on Japan's Nuclear Armament Development at `Danger Line' SK1104102394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1016 GMT 11 Apr 94 SK1104102394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expresses the belief that the governments, parliaments, political parties and public organizations of all the anti-nuke and non-nuclear states and international organizations and peaceloving people all over the world will heighten vigilance against the dangerous moves of the Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and check and frustrate them, thereby actively contributing to peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world," says a white paper of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released on Monday regarding Japan's nuclear armament that has reached a danger line now. It further says: In defiance of the bitter international denunciation and apprehensions, Monju, the first fast breeder reactor of Japan, was put into normal operation on April 5. This is a dangerous step in Japan's moves for nuclear armament. "Japan's nuclear armament being promoted on the danger line today is an open challenge to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the human desire to build a nuclear-free world. This is a question of which the international community must take a serious view." The white paper roundly exposes the fact that Japan, opposing and distorting the "peace constitution," has manoeuvred overtly and covertly ever since the 1950s to adopt nuclear armament as its policy and legalize it under the veil of "three non-nuclear principles". Citing data, it reveals that Japan has, in fact, completely laid material and technological foundations for the production of nuclear weapons. Pointing out that though Japan is practically promoting nuclear armament on the danger line, the United States and other Western countries are turning blind eyes to this, while engaging themselves in a hysteric pressure campaign over the fictitious "suspicion of nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the white paper says: "This double standard policy virtually encourages Japan's nuclear armament."
