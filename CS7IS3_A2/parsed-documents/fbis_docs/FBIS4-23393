FBIS4-23393 "drafr108_e_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Support for Ebute Pledged Support for Ebute Pledged AB0506193094 Paris AFP in English 1902 GMT 5 Jun 94 AB0506193094 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Lagos, June 5 (AFP) -- Some members of the dissolved National Assembly pledged here Sunday [5 June] to give "solidarity support" to detained former senate leader Ameh Ebute whenever he is brought to court for trial. "He is our leader and he deserves our moral support in his moment of travail," four of the ex-legislators told AFP in a telephone interview. They did not disclose what form the support would take but said it would be demonstrated around the court premises. At least three senators, including Ebute, who attended a meeting last Wednesday and issued a communique in which they declared "illegal" the government of General Sani Abacha, have been arrested. Ex-senators Polycarp Nwite and Okoroafor were arrested and detained Saturday, respectively in Lagos and Abeokuta. Nwite, who spoke to AFP Sunday from his detention room on his cellular phone, alleged that the conditions under which he was being held were harsh. He complained of non-provision of food, water and a bed to sleep on. His colleagues in the dissolved senate, Bola Tinubu and O.J. Adewunmi, told AFP Sunday that they were also being sought by security agents who had paid several fruitless visits to their Lagos residences in the past 24 hours. The arrest of the former legislators marked the beginning of a government clampdown on the opposition, including members of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a recently-formed pro- democracy group, made up of prominent politicians, ex-ministers and state governors and retired military officers. Like the legislators, the NADECO has called on General Abacha to quit office to pave the way for the installation of Moshood Abiola, the self-proclaimed winner of last June's annulled presidential election. Members of the House of Representatives who met last Friday asked General Abacha to quit "not later than" June 11, the eve of the first anniversary of the presidential election. The government has described their action as "illegal, criminal and very dangerous." The National Assembly, made up of the senate and the house of representatives, was dissolved last November, along with other democratic institutions, when General Abacha came to power.
