Yesterday a number of dissatisfied Labor Party parliamentarians threatened protest action unless a congress decision in this regard is repealed. An LP spokesman, Mr. Peter Hendrickse, said the party had decided unanimously at its recent congress to fight the election under the ANC banner and said the five caucus members who now wished to have the resolution revoked had not raised objections to the resolution at the time.
