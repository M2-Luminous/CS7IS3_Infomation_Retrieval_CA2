Ex-pressman Choe Ung-mo in Chongno District of Seoul said that the New Year address of the respected president gives a new hope and confidence to the South Korean people who are looking up to the North under the people-centred politics as a beacon of hope. He further said: "His New Year address is a declaration expounding the historical truth that anthropocentric socialism is sure to win. "This is a heavy blow to the imperialists and the group of traitors who are frantically trying to stifle socialism in the North, clamouring about `end' of socialism." Kwak Chong-to, a worker residing in Mapo District of Seoul, said: "Every sentence of the New Year address, especially the respected president's manifestation of a resolute position that pressure or threat will have no effect on the DPRK and the United States must see all the facts squarely and behave with circumspection makes us once again feel more keenly how strong the political and military power of the North is in the international arena." Dissident Yi Sang-ho in Kwangju said: "The respected president, considerate of the ardent desire of the fellow countrymen for reunification, reclarified in his New Year address that the country should be reunified by means of confederacy. The proposal for reunification through confederation is the most fair and realistic supreme proposal." Min Chong-nan, a housewife in Pusan had this to say: "Upon hearing that respected President Kim Il-song in his New Year address said the reunified country must be handed down to the generations to come, I could not go to sleep all the night through. Though I was a weak woman, I will devote everything to the sacred cause of anti-U.S. national salvation and reunification."
