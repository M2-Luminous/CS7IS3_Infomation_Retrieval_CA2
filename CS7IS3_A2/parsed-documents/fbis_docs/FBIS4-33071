In his second visit to the region after becoming president for the second time, Caldera expressed his faith and optimism that the country will overcome the serious difficulties it is facing. He said our problems are not the result of nature or Providence but, rather, of errors made in setting national policy. [passage omitted] The president delivered a speech at the closing of the commemoration ceremony. He affirmed that there are large differences between the Venezuela that never knew what oil was and the Venezuela that experienced the oil boom, but, more important, he said was the fundamental fact that there now exists a "willingness to promote and open new possibilities and horizons." He added: "Maracaibo is being increasingly incorporated into the nation's development each and every day, and it is constantly showing its ability to compete for the best position in the task of making Venezuela a prosperous country. "We are, without a doubt, confronting a difficult situation that has not been prompted by natural causes, nor by the cyclical development of national life, but by the serious mistakes and errors in forming national policy. "Within this difficult situation, however, there is undoubtedly a common objective, as has been outlined in the speech by Chamber of Commerce President Jorge Porras: `It is the responsibility of all Venezuelans to overcome the obstacles posed by the current situation.'" [passage omitted] The president also said: "We are convinced that our efforts to reactivate the economy will not be enough if we fail to understand that the fundamental objective is not wealth in and of itself, but wealth in favor of human needs to improve the standards of living of all human beings." The president said the country is experiencing a yearning for victory, a feeling of hope, and a favorable outlook, adding that it has the deep feeling that there exists a healthy, firm, and decisive resolve to guide the nation toward meeting established objectives." [no opening quotation marks as published] "At this moment, we feel there exists, both within and outside of Venezuela, a favorable trend to invest in various economic activities, because it is perceived that we live in a country blessed by nature and protected by Providence and that all well-intended initiatives will be successful." He added that on this 100th anniversary of Maracaibo's Chamber of Commerce he sees signs of hope and encouragement for all Venezuelans. Caldera remarked: "This 100th anniversary represents for all a great inspiration and the reaffirmation of self-esteem, which has been crippled in recent years." Meanwhile, the president explained there are people who, in recent years, have experienced the diabolical pleasure of harming, destroying, and sowing doubts in our own country and ourselves. Caldera concluded: "I feel that at this time it is our duty to fight to make the Venezuelan people take pride in our traditions. This is a time for action, faith, and unyielding resolve to get Venezuela back on its feet. We must recognize the difficult situation the country has been in, but we must also understand that there exists a vitality that will enable us to overcome these difficulties. There is a powerful national and regional vitality that lets us see that we will enter the 21st century with the distinct opportunity to progress and achieve reaffirmation and stability. "I congratulate the people of Zulia at this commemoration. Here is a confirmation of endurance and a contribution in favor of the greater needs of the region and country."
