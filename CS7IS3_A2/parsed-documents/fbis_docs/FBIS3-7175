President Kim Yong-sam said that he thinks China basically does not want North Korea to develop nuclear weapons since China does not want to be isolated as a member of international community. President Kim said that he will be able to have frank exchange of views with Chinese President Jiang Zemin through summit talks with him on the measures to cope with the critical North Korean nuclear issue.
