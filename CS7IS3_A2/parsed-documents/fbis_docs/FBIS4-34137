The document must also mention the need to improve the balance between nations with higher and lower levels of development, and in the social sector, it must insist that economic development is incompatible without its social counterpart. To be honest, in a continent where neoliberalism is still in style, some of the ideas of neoliberalism are included, tempered with a list of some of the urgent social needs which afflict a majority of the 500 million human beings who live in countries of Iberian descent. Because we do not know the final version of the document, we will not venture an overall analysis of the same. Fidel defines our position in a brief speech. Cuba does not reject foreign investment or some economic market mechanisms adapted to our national needs, but it believes that financing for development is insufficient. Cuba also emphasized there are no definite solutions for the increase in Latin America's foreign debt. Cuba was the country to establish a clear position concerning the summons issued by the United States for a hemispheric summit -- with a cowardly exclusion in our case. The summit will be held in Miami in December this year. Cuba does not oppose this meeting if it really lets Latin America establish its legitimate positions before the northern metropolis, but it rejects any attempt by Washington to use the summit as an anti-Cuban forum or as a mechanism to increase Washington's hemispheric rule in the subcontinent's economic and social areas. According to what we have learned and what special envoy Demetrio Villaurrutia has reported, the summit's final document, to be signed by the heads of state and government today at Cartagena de Indias, must demand the elimination of economic measures which negatively affect the free development of international trade and are detrimental to the lifestyle of Ibero-American peoples, in a much clearer allusion to the U.S. blockade against our country. This is an unprecedented action compared to previous summits. We may recall that the final document for the last summit, the one held at Salvador de Bahia, endorses the decision adopted in other forums concerning problems, meaning the unfair blockade suffered by our country. This time there is a statement that is much more attuned to reality even though the term blockade is not mentioned. In essence, the final document of this fourth summit is not an ideal document that faithfully reflects the problems which afflict us as Latin Americans and Caribbeans, or urgently needed solutions. It is a position of consensus in favor of integration, however. In this concern, it is positive.
