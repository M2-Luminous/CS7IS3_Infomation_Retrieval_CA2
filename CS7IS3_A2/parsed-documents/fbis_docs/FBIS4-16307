The Russian Federation Pension Fund is a financial and credit institution, therefore the explanation and interpretation of pension legislation does not come within this organ's terms of reference. All necessary information on questions of applying existing pension legislation, as well as on normative acts being drafted in this sphere, is given by the Russian Federation Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population. The Russian Social Protection Ministry confirms the information given at a press conference 9 April 1994 that from 1 May this year the implementation of the Russian Federation president's edict No. 2121 of 10 December 1993 "On Increasing Previously Fixed Labor Pensions," begun 1 April this year, will be continued. Under this edict earnings before 1 January 1993 on which pensions are calculated are subject to an 80-percent indexation (increase). This measure is intended to rectify the miscalculations made when determining the size of the coefficients used to "index-link" past earnings. This provision is being brought into effect in three stages from April through June 1994: from 1 April in relation to pensions fixed up to and including 1981; from 1 May in relation to pensions fixed in 1982-1987; and from 1 June in relation to pensions fixed in 1988-1992. From 1 May this year there will be another indexation because of the increase in prices for consumer goods and services. The actual level of indexation is being determined at the moment. In addition it is intended to retain the existing compensation of 19,700 rubles payable in addition to a pension. Indexation and retained compensation because of price increases will be payable over and above the level of a pension increased under the Russian Federation president's edict of 10 December 1993.
