The foreign minister made the statement at a symposium on the prospect of developing Sino-Russian border trade in Russia's far east city of Blagoveshchensk, ITAR-TASS reported. Kozyrev said that last year, exclusive border trade volume between Russia and China amounted to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, and 2.5 million people crossed Sino-Russian border from both directions the same year. At present, he said, the trade and cooperation between the border areas of the two countries should enter a higher stage of establishing joint ventures for production. Meanwhile, new transit ports should be opened along the border, he added. The minister then crossed into China's Hei He City of Heilongjiang Province, where he met with government leaders of Heilongjiang and Hei He City, and discussed with them border trade. Kozyrev also visited a free economic zone in Hei He City. He is due to arrive in Beijing today for an official visit to China.
