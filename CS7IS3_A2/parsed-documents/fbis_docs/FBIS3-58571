[Arsenis] Indeed. New technology demands that some soldiers serve more than the average term. We have the voluntary five-year service term, but its purpose is limited. The main body of the Armed Forces includes the regular recruits. We should have some specialized soldiers. [Panayiotarea] Will there be reform in the composition of units? For example, will a regiment, as we know it now... [Arsenis] Yes. The basic defense doctrine we have dates back to 1985. Today, we face a new situation. The meaning of danger and stability have changed. We should also deal with our defense budget perhaps with fewer numbers in the military. If possible, with a smaller defense budget. To do all this, we need mobile, more effective, and modern forces. [Panayiotarea] Is NATO forcing this reform or is it your initiative? [Arsenis] It is our initiative, but there is also a parallel move by NATO. Previously, NATO gathered its forces on borders to face the danger from the East, the Soviet bloc. This threat no longer exists. The meaning of common security has changed, hence NATO's structure is changing. They go together. [Panayiotarea] But our defense against Turkey does not run parallel with NATO... [Arsenis] Unfortunately, this threat exists. It is the primary threat facing Greece. Lately, there has been an effort, an unsuccessful one in my opinion, by the Turkish side to artificially revive the crisis between Greece and Turkey, aiming to create problems for Greece during its Presidency of the European Union. [Panayiotarea] So, our defense policy toward Turkey remains firm? [Arsenis] Of course. The reform of the Armed Forces we discussed is designed primarily to deal with this basic threat. [Panayiotarea] Well, what is NATO's role now that the former Warsaw Pact is close to becoming part of NATO and there is no longer a threat? [Arsenis] Brussels found the ideal solution. The 16 NATO members will remain members, but NATO will be open to ad hoc cooperation with other countries, mainly European, and of course with Cyprus. In that way, we will have greater, flexible cooperation with the 16 NATO members as the main body. [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] Before the election, you discussed a popular defense. What did you mean? Did you mean the TEA [National Defense Battalions]? [Arsenis] There is a need to implement it soon. It is not the TEA. We have many kilometers of border without defense depth. We have a demographic problem; we have few young people to enlist in the Armed Forces. So, the people who do not participate in the Armed Forces must be used as support in time of need. [Panayiotarea] To take up arms? [Arsenis] Not necessarily. Let us take an island for example. Beyond its tactical army, the population is there to help in a defense plan in case of emergency. If, for example, the water reservoir is bombarded, the well- organized locals can take care of it so there will be no need to send the army to repair the system. In February, I hope we will circulate the relevant draft bill to the involved ministries and discuss it with the political parties. I hope to secure the support of all the parties in the Chamber of Deputies. [Panayiotarea] What about the defense of Cyprus? [Arsenis] It is a high national priority. We are two independent states of Hellenism facing a threat from the same source -- Turkey. We can and should coordinate our defense plans. When we discuss a unified defense space, we are actually discussing coordinating our defense plans so that together we can be more effective than we are alone. [Panayiotarea] But don't some say that you alone decided who will be the new National Guard commander? [Arsenis] We will abide strictly by the procedure prescribed by the form of bilateral cooperation. The commander of the Cypriot National Guard will be appointed by a joint decision.
