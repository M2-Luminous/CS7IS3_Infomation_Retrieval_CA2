FR940919-0-00143 FR940919-0-00017 Service Response: Methodological flaws and ambiguities in the analysis conducted by this commenter invalidate the report's findings. The most serious flaw is the comparison of wetland acreages in various studies that focused on different geographic study areas. For example, the two Service reports reviewed by the commenter cannot be used together to draw conclusions on changes in wetland acreages because data from the Central Valley and the entire State are not comparable. Issue 24: Several commenters disputed the Service's statement in the proposed rule that 90 percent of the original vernal pool habitat throughout the Central Valley has been lost and that an estimated 2 to 3 percent of vernal pool habitat continues to be lost annually. Several commenters contended that the study referenced by the Service actually showed a 67 to 88 percent historic loss of vernal pool acreage. One commenter further stated that additional interpretation and analysis of the data used in the study revealed that historic losses were 63 percent. Based upon information contained in a separate document prepared by the Service, other commenters asserted that the actual loss more closely approximated 50 percent. After the comment period closed, one respondent commented that preliminary results from a newly-initiated soils data analysis indicate that the original estimates of historic vernal pool losses in the Central Valley may be substantially less than was identified in the proposed rule. Another late commenter noted that U.S. Soil Conservation Service information supported recent conclusions drawn by other soil scientists that 404,700 hectares (1 million acres) of soils suitable for vernal pool habitat remain from 809,400 hectares (2 million acres) determined to have historically existed in the Central Valley, thus implying that historic losses were close to 50 percent. Service Response: After closer review of the referenced study (Holland 1978), the Service discovered apparent arithmetic errors in the estimates of historic vernal pool habitat (i.e., areas that could have supported pools) losses. Correction of these errors yields estimates of vernal pool habitat losses between 60 and 85 percent. Accordingly, the Service finds that the study's corrected estimates of historic vernal pool habitat loss in the Central Valley are reasonably close to the range of estimates determined by those commenters who criticized the study. Comments concerning a 50 percent habitat reduction based upon a Service publication appear to be derived from the Wetlands of the California Central Valley; Status and Trends 1939 to mid-1980's (Frayer et al. 1989), which estimated losses of palustrine emergent wetlands. However, calculation of vernal pool losses cannot be deduced from the numerous wetland types categorized as ``palustrine emergent wetlands.'' The results of the soils data analysis under preparation by the commenter were not available for review at the time of publication of this final rule. The purpose of addressing historic vernal pool losses in the proposed rule was to provide a historical context to the Central Valley ecosystem inhabited by the four crustacean species. It was not the intention, nor is it appropriate, to conduct an exhaustive analysis of information pertaining to the history of vernal pool habitat losses affecting the five crustacean species. Unverifiable and/or contradictory information on the extent of former and current vernal pool habitat will generate continued debate on this issue throughout the foreseeable future. In a legal context, the extent of historic habitat loss is of academic interest only, since the five factors at 50 CFR 424.11(c) under which species may qualify for listing look prospectively to the future rather than retrospectively on the past. The relevant issues are whether the current extent of fairy and tadpole shrimp habitat is depleted and/or fragmented enough to render the species vulnerable to extinction, or whether foreseeable threats similarly threaten the species. Issue 25: Eight commenters, including four mosquito abatement districts, reported that vernal pools provided an important breeding source for mosquitoes. They stated that the listing of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, when coupled with the preservation and creation of vernal pools next to residential areas, will create a serious health risk to people. They were especially concerned about the western encephalitis mosquito ( Culex tarsalis ), a vector of western equine encephalitis and Saint Louis encephalitis. Some of the respondents also expressed concern about mosquito-borne malaria and yellow fever. A number of commenters stated that continued urban development would result in greater numbers of people being affected by mosquitoes and increase the need to control mosquitoes in vernal pools. The four mosquito abatement districts were concerned that listing of the crustaceans would increase the costs and restrictions on their control activities. Expressing a contrary position, four biologists stated that mosquitoes rarely are found in vernal pools and swales that have not been impacted by humans. They reported this is likely due to the presence of the high abundance of predatory crustaceans and aquatic insects that inhabit this ecosystem. A crustacean specialist noted that mosquitoes were absent or not present in significant numbers in pools inhabited by the fairy shrimp and the tadpole shrimp. Significant numbers of mosquito larvae were found in areas that contain created vernal pools or artificial bodies of water e.g., ditches and stock ponds where the crustaceans are sparse or absent. One biologist reported that no mosquito larvae were found in any of the 27 randomly sampled vernal pools at Beale Air Force Base (Mary Ann Griggs, private biologist, Colusa, California, in litt., 1992). However, mosquitos were found in areas that had augmented water supply from a pressure release valve on a well. The water supply produced a distinctively different flora and fauna than nearby vernal pools. Commenting biologists stated that the use of oil and mosquito fish ( Gambusia affinis ) will adversely affect vernal pool fauna, including the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, consequently allowing mosquitoes populations to sue vernal pools where they otherwise are controlled or eradicated by the nature pool fauna.
