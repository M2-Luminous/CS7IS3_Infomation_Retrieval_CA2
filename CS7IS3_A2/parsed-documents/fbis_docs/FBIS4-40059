[Stupishin] Excellent. I have complete mutual understanding with the leadership of Armenia, and there are contacts daily, which is an essential condition for productive work. I should say immediately, incidentally, that there are close relations also between all official authorities of our two states--at the parliamentary, governmental, ministerial, and departmental level. This is making it possible to decide a mass of urgent questions promptly. What I have just said does not mean, of course, that everything is ideal. Moments of choppiness arise also, but they are quickly smoothed over to our mutual satisfaction, thanks to the fact that there are today no political problems between Russia and Armenia. The climate for the operation of the Russian Embassy in Armenia is altogether highly favorable. I have felt at home here since day one. And not only among officials, I would say. The attitude toward Russia [word illegible] and toward me personally, as toward all the embassy staff, is [three words illegible] most warm and cordial in all circles of society. [Khanbabyan] Well, this is good to hear. But certain difficulties also arise from time to time in this connection? An ambassador is exclusively an official, after all.... [Stupishin] There are difficulties. And one of them is that it is hard for some people as yet to get used to the idea that the representative of Moscow is no longer the former "party Gauleiter," to whom it was possible to complain about the local authorities. Some people would clearly like to see me wearing this cap, and this is why some people are today disappointed. They are uncomfortable, as it were, with the absence of a "Gauleiter," with the fact that the times when it was possible to "run down" one's own people have gone, never to return. They would like me to put pressure on the leadership of the republic--de jure or, at least, de facto. Yet the diplomat's job is something else--to contribute to a strengthening and development of diverse and productive interstate relations. This is what we are working for. And some people would clearly like to see the ambassador of Russia "on their side," make him a participant in some internal political intrigues, and link him with some internal collisions. This is absolutely ruled out. I see as my job the realization of the interests of Russia in the host country. Of Russia, not this political force or grouping or the other. I believe that it is to the advantage of Moscow and Russians getting to know Armenia and the realities of the life of its people and their problems better. This will enable them to answer the question, "What do we need Armenia for," and will enable them to identify Armenia and Armenians as their sincere friends. This is the true state interest for both Russia and, I believe, for Armenia. [Khanbabyan] It is no secret that in a number of republics of the former Union there are organizations of the so-called "Russian- speaking population" that, to put it mildly, are in none too benevolent a frame of mind with regard to the local authorities. It is known also that certain political circles in Russia are endeavoring to make use of these organizations in their own interests, thereby turning them, as it were, into a fifth column threatening the young independence of the new states.... [Stupishin] I am categorically opposed to the inevitable difficulties of a socioeconomic order being experienced in the present transitional period by the new states of the near abroad being used by anyone at all for his own political ends. Manipulating the fate of millions of people by playing on difficulties and resuscitating a bankrupt ideology is the height of irresponsibility. Unfortunately, it is this that "national-patriotic" organizations like, for example, Ragozin's "Congress of Russian Communities" or Barkashov's Nazi Party are doing. I would note that it was at the instigation of the notorious "Congress..." that what is now called the "Russian Community of the Republic of Armenia" appeared in Armenia. Forgive me, but this is nonsense; declaring oneself a community is impossible! A national community takes shape historically and cannot have political characteristics. It is no accident that this notorious "Community" has nothing in common with the "Russia" Society--the largest, mass organization of Russians in Armenia. I have to say, in general, that the difficulties that are affecting inhabitants of Armenia who are Russian by nationality (and we, the embassy, are endeavoring to the best of our abilities to minimize these difficulties) should and can be overcome only in cooperation with the government and the authorities of the republic. And we are aware of their support. [Khanbabyan] But there are in Armenia, unfortunately, not only the "Russian Community" but also other, no less odious, organizations and personalities. While not ethnic Russians and having, as a rule, no real idea of present-day Russia and its people, they are insistently attempting, nonetheless, to play the part of that fifth column. I believe that in their unconcealed aspiration to discredit the existing authorities they have as of late overstepped certain bounds, namely, they have attempted to use in their unscrupulous political game the name of the Russian ambassador and to damage the prestige of the Russian state and its leadership. A clear example of this was the publication in GOLOS ARMENII of 2 June of this year. I believe that this publication did palpable damage to Armenian-Russian relations. What can you say in this connection? [Stupishin] Well, first, I regard the said publication as a cheap and vulgar denunciation and a clumsy attempt to discredit me in the eyes of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and our national parliament. But these are idle endeavors. It is not for them to teach the authorities in Russia how they should evaluate the activity of a Russian diplomat. The GOLOS authors lie when they claim that Russia is their home. Not Russia, merely a particular, and far from the best, part, what is more, of Russian society: neofascists of all stripes, revanchists, political gangsters--these are the Moscow friends of GOLOS ARMENII. This newspaper, which lays claim to the appellation "independent," has publicly taken the part of the most reactionary and most suspicious and regressive forces both in Armenia and in Russia. And I have the impression that the GOLOS authors are simply intoxicated with delight at their political choice. It is not fortuitous that personal assaults and attacks leveled not only against the president and government of Armenia but also of Russia are so frequent on the pages of this newspaper. Although "what is Hecuba to them," it would seem! Only now, finding it necessary to recall my interview of eight months ago, are they, without a moment's doubt, attempting to accuse me of having used "derogatory epithets" in respect to the Russian people--for having after the October putsch in Moscow openly called things by their proper name: gangsters--gangsters, fascists--fascists, and killers and provocateurs--killers and provocateurs. How should I have acted? Put the executioner and victim on the same footing? Treated equally the Barkashovite sniper and the innocent citizen that fell from his bullet? This would be the same as equating in "all-forgiveness" Talaat and Enver and the people they killed. And what about the constant attempts to "privatize" Victory Day! Disgusting attempts, there is no other way to put it. It is as though these people forget that not only members of the Communist Party, but also peasant toilers ruined by collectivization and true patriots repressed by the regime--in a word, all to whom the fatherland is dear--fought and died for the motherland. And in this connection this article contains also an absolute lie in regard to me and my position. After all, both last year and this year we employees of the Embassy of the Russian Federation participated in conjunction with representatives of the civilian and military authorities of Armenia in solemn ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and in other activities. And this was a splendid symbol of our friendship, our brotherhood in arms. I cannot imagine how General A. Kazaryan, whose signature stands beneath the publication in GOLOS ARMENII, could have "forgotten" this. It remains to be regretfully assumed that some forces and people who have never been anywhere near combat are cynically using the distinguished veteran--a hero and combat general--in their own interests and shamelessly manipulating his name. The name of the holiday and its status is another matter. Each state decides these matters in its own way, independently. And the attempt by any methods to compel a diplomat to interfere in the internal affairs of the host country is unethical, therefore. [Khanbabyan] GOLOS essentially accused you of neocolonialist manners, of allegedly undertaking to "lecture" the local press and public, and in an "offensive form," what is more, in a word, of behaving as the Moscow party emissary--the second secretary of the Central Committee--would not have dared to behave in the former times. But at the same time you are attempting here to play "the part of advocate for a bankrupt regime...." [Stupishin] I do not know what the authors of the publication mean in speaking about "lectures" and so forth. After all, these people were simply not present at the Yerevan State University when I met the university's professorial and lecturer staff. In the apt expression of Anna Andreyevna Akhmatova, "They were not there." If for no other reason, they are not entitled, I believe, to make evaluations of my words in the course of a meeting or to comment on them. And I did not attempt, incidentally, to lecture anyone; I answered the questions put to me. It is GOLOS that is constantly attempting to lecture everyone, in the most pushy fashion, what is more, shifting the whole blame onto others, distorting the facts, and taking out of the context of a speech individual words and expressions, as they did, for example, in respect to my words concerning the possibilities of a solution of the Karabakh crisis. They probably greatly disliked the fact that I passed a comment on their newspaper without any great enthusiasm. Excuse me, but this is my right, the right of a reader. And, as ambassador, I may say objectively that many of the publications in GOLOS ARMENII, particularly that of 2 June 1994, do not contribute to the strengthening and development of Russian-Armenian relations and are sowing between the two peoples grains of hostility, hatred, and suspicion. Nor do they in any way serve a civilized solution of the tragic Karabakh conflict. [Khanbabyan] Sowing hostility, hatred, suspicion--this is altogether highly characteristic of publications that adhere to neofascist, nationalist positions.... [Stupishin] Yes, this, by all accounts, is precisely how they understand political struggle. They speculate on people's ignorance, their insufficient knowledgeability. And I can say plainly that many urgent matters for Armenia are being tackled today with the help of Russia precisely because a high level of mutual understanding has come about between Moscow and Yerevan. The Government of Armenia has no need of advocates, but, knowing the true state of affairs, I am duty bound to emphasize that the president of the republic and the parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers are doing everything possible for the continued development and intensification of bilateral interstate relations. And people like the GOLOS authors, although swearing their love for Russia, are in practice doing everything to hinder this work, since for them the worse things are, the better. They are, alas, giving no serious thought to the needs of their people and their true interests. [Khanbabyan] The licentiousness, in the full sense of the word, that GOLOS ARMENII has been demonstrating constantly as of late in its evaluation of phenomena and individuals would seem to me personally to be a consequence, frankly speaking, of a not entirely comprehensible timorousness on the part of the law.... [Stupishin] Democracy should be defended, of course. This is axiomatic. Otherwise, it degenerates into license, chaos, and anarchy, that is, things that are the direct opposite of freedom. But the whole point is that both with us, in Russia, and with you, in Armenia, democracy is still very young, still in diapers. And we are all only just learning democracy as yet. Learning how to defend it included. It is our inexperience of which publications like GOLOS ARMENII are taking advantage. They frequently abuse each and everything without proof and falsely, but with impunity here, and do they forget, in addition, to shout about the lack of "true freedom." It is easy to appear intrepid and high-minded if you know full well that there is no threat to you from this. A convenient position, there is no denying. Convenient, but, essentially, harmful and unconstructive. And simply unscrupulous also. I would say this: God is their judge. And as far as the "timorousness of the law" is concerned, I repeat: It is not the business of an ambassador to interfere in intrastate matters. You yourselves and you alone must decide to what extent this publication or the other of GOLOS and its ilk are in keeping with the requirements of the press act and other laws of the Republic of Armenia.
