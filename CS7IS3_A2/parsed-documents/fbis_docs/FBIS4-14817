The initiative came from President Guntis Ulmanis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs in compliance with the 20th article of the Latvian Constitution. Under the agreement, Russia operates its radar facility at Skrunda in Latvia for four years and has 18 months to dismantle it. Latvia also guarantees the social protection of retired and serving military personnel on its soil. In return, Russia pledges to get all its troops out of the Baltic country by September. So far, the deal has met with fierce protest by Latvia's opposition parties and political organizations claiming that the signature and ratification of the agreement would mean legalization of Latvia's occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940.
