Zieleniec told the journalists, who accompany him on his current 7-day tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Australia, that Vietnamese partners had made it quite clear during the talks that in the future Vietnam did not intend to unambiguously orient itself towards standard Western countries. Provided Czech companies maintain a certain level of competitiveness, Vietnamese state bodies were ready to assist them in entering the Vietnamese market with the aim to diversify the country' foreign policy contacts, Zieleniec said. He said his Vietnamese partners had pointed many a time to the traditional relations existing between the two countries and even used the proverb that "one old friend is better than two new ones." Zieleniec said the main goal of his visit -- adapting the old contacts to the new conditions -- had been achieved. Zieleniec said that two Czech-Vietnamese agreements were currently under preparation. One is a new trade agreement and the Czech Republic would like to link its completion to finding a scheme for repaying Vietnamese debts to the Czech Republic. The other one is an agreement on the employment of the other country's citizens which, although balanced, mostly concerned Vietnamese. It would be signed soon during Czech Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's visit to Vietnam, Zieleniec said. Regarding agreements on the prevention of double taxation and investment protection, Zieleniec said that it was important that work on them started. Although such agreements are standard, they are not a matter of course in the event of such countries as Vietnam with predominantly centrally-managed economy and a non-convertible currency. Asked whether the Czech Government was considering the establishment of a free trade zone with Vietnam, Zieleniec said that this would be difficult in case of a country whose economy was not based on the private ownership principle, and which was lacking a united taxation system and a market economy. On the last day of his stay in Vietnam, Zieleniec visited the Viet Tien textile factory here. He was accompanied by Czech entrepreneurs and businessmen whose presence Zieleniec considers one of the most important aspects of his visit. Vietnamese guests acquainted Zieleniec with the current way of industrial management in the situation when Vietnam has been switching over to a market economy for several years. A seminar to provide Vietnamese partners with information on the current economic situation in the Czech Republic and exports possibilities of Czech companies was organised today here by Czech entrepreneurs and representatives of the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Czech National Bank. On Saturday [16 April] a similar seminar was also held in Hanoi.
