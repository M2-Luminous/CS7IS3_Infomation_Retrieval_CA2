At this meeting, the delegations resumed the talks that were begun in Sarajevo on 1 June with a view to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and implementing the Washington and Vienna agreements. A high degree of accord was reached on many issues. Regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, both delegations start from the stand that Bosnia-Herzegovina is indivisible and sovereign within its internationally recognized borders, that its peoples are sovereign on the entire territory of the state, and that the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is only a road toward a final reintegration of all parts of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its borders. The two delegations do not recognize the results of the genocide and will invest maximum effort toward having all escaped and displaced people return to their homes. The delegations agree that the persons responsible for crimes committed in war cannot be entrusted mandates within the establishment of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in the authorities. The delegations also agree that the creation of permanent cooperation between Croatian and Bosniak peoples should be worked upon with a view to preserving the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders.
