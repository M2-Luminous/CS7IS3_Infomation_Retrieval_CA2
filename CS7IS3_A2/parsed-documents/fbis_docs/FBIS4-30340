FBIS4-30340 "dreas123_a_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 June 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Shinseito's Watanabe on Political Strategy Shinseito's Watanabe on Political Strategy OW2706065094 OW2706065094 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 0109 GMT on 26 June, during its regular "Sunday Discussion" program carries a live interview with Kozo Watanabe, deputy secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] from the NHK studio in Tokyo. Watanabe is interviewed by Takashi Yamamoto, NHK commentator, and Naoki Tanaka, noted economic commentator. Asked by Yamamoto to comment on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's resignation, Watanabe says it was an inevitable choice by the minority government. He explains that at the moment, the coalition parties would rather take a wait-and-see attitude on how the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will react, and would not actively seek to regain political power. Answering Tanaka's question on what caused the failure of the Hata administration, while Watanabe admits that the issue of the "Kaishin" group was not handled properly, he emphasizes that the administration as a whole, and Hata personally, were not at fault, and even claims that the resignation itself "has not damaged Mr. Hata's reputation in any way." However, when asked by Yamamoto if Shinseito is actually expecting Hata to be reelected as prime minister, Watanabe denies this, saying the sole reason behind the resignation was Hata's desire not to create a political vacuum when the Naples Summit is held in July, as in the case of the summit last year. He also stresses the importance of talking with the SDPJ at this point. As to Shinseito's strategy in dealing with the present political situation, Watanabe refuses to go into detail, saying Shinseito will decide on this after looking at how the LDP and SDPJ react. He expresses a willingness to talk with all political parties, except the Japan Communist Party. He also denies reports that Shinseito actually wants to form an alliance with certain forces both in the LDP and SDPJ to effect a general reconfiguration of political forces immediately. However, he does not deny political realignment is a future goal if Shinseito and the other coalition parties become the opposition, and a general election is held. Turning to the possibility of forming an alliance with rebellious LDP and SDPJ members to form a new majority government, Watanabe replies indirectly: "In politics, it is important for people who have similar political ideals and policy concepts to work together. I believe many SDPJ members seriously want to promote political reform and to create politics for a new era. There are also such people in the LDP. I think it is important to form a new political force for the next era with such people." Asked by Tanaka if such an alliance is likely to materialize before the next prime minister is elected, Watanabe admits that the present situation is such that no one can tell what will happen next. However, he terms the present confusion as labor pains preceding the birth of new political norms. The interview ends at 1020 GMT.
