FR940705-2-00136 FR940705-2-00090 The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules, shall be used. Appendix K describes containment conditions Good Large Scale Practice through BL3&hyph;Large Scale. Section III&hyph;C&hyph;7. Human Gene Transfer Experiments Not Covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;3, and Not Considered Exempt Under Section V&hyph;U Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that are not covered by Sections III&hyph;A&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;2, III&hyph;B&hyph;3, and that are not considered exempt under Section V&hyph;U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation. Section III&hyph;D. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous With Initiation Experiments not included in Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, III&hyph;C, III&hyph;E, and their subsections are considered in Section III&hyph;D. All such experiments may be conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration document (see Section III&hyph;C) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment is not required (see Section IV&hyph;A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III&hyph;D and may be conducted at BL1 containment. Section III&hyph;D&hyph;1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant DNA Molecules Containing No More Than Two-Thirds of the Genome of Any Eukaryotic Virus Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V&hyph;Q) being considered identical (see Section V&hyph;S)) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;3 should be used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.
