This is the verbal message from Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou that European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans Van den Broek will be conveying to [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, President Kiro] Gligorov. After his meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today, van den Broek will be visiting Skopje again. In a statement, Papoulias noted that the government says yes to the dialogue as long as the conditions it has set out are fulfilled. Papoulias added: Gligorov and Skopje should abandon their intransigence and Greece will wait until then. Van den Broek said the disagreements between the two sides should be raised for discussion at the negotiating table urgently, stressed that his own efforts are of a temporary nature, and referred to the good offices of Cyrus Vance at the United Nations. Papoulias made it clear that if and when the dialogue resumes at the United Nations, the name issue would be excluded from the package of issues to be discussed. The foreign minister further noted that the process of handling the name issue will be very time consuming. The EU commissioner will have a telephone conversation with Papoulias tomorrow to brief him on the commissioner's meeting with Gligorov today. Asked about the likelihood of a meeting on the foreign minister level between Athens and Skopje, Papoulias said that the current facts indicate that this is premature. Asked whether Greece would give its consent to Skopje's accession to the CSCE, Papoulias noted that as far as the Greek side is concerned, nothing has changed, since Skopje's intransigence continues.
