FR940203-2-00003 FR940203-2-00002 Forest Service Department of the Interior National Park Service Grand Canyon Railway, Inc., Passenger Railway Service Grand Canyon Airport to Grand Canyon Village; Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, joint lead agencies, have prepared a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) on the provision of initiating passenger rail service form Grand Canyon Airport, Tusayan, Arizona, to the Maswick Transportation Area in Grand Canyon Village, Grand Canyon National Park. The draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was circulated for public review between July 31, 1992 and September 30, 1992 (57 FR 33168) and the comment period extended to November 14, 1992. Both the DEIS and FEIS describe and analyze a proposal and five alternatives. The proposal, Alternative A, provides for the construction of 5.4 miles of new railway line on the national forest, with 1.1 miles on an old rail line alignment, and use of existing rail line within the national park. One wash would need to be crossed within the airport property. Additional features are the construction of two depots, 75 acres of parking, a road for maintenance, and the addition of storage tanks for fuel, water and wastewater. A maximum of eight (8) trips per day would be generated between the airport and Maswick. Interpretive activities and visitor orientation to the park and national forest would be integrated into the service. Alternatives B, C and D, all provide for the proposed passenger service but vary in the track alignment and length to be constructed, the amount of national forest lands needed and generally increase the number of washes that would be crossed. In addition, Alternative D provides for a single depot. Alternative E is a non-rail alternative, utilizing a shuttle bus system in conjunction with a parking area outside the park. Alternative F is the no action alternative. Alternative A, the proposal, is the environmentally preferred alternative. The 30 day no action period on the FEIS and ROD will end March 7, 1994. The ROD, as it affects National Forest System Lands, is subject to appeal in accordance with 36 CFR part 217. A notice of appeal must be in writing and clearly state that it is a Notice of Appeal being filed pursuant to 36 CFR part 217. Appeals must be filed with the Regional Forester, Southwestern Region, 517 Gold Avenue SW., Albuquerque, NM 87102&hyph;0094 within 45 days of legal notice of this decision in the Arizona Daily Sun. While The National Park Service has no formal appeal process, no implementation of the proposal within Grand Canyon National Park will occur before expiration of the 30 day no action period and contingent on any appeals received pertaining to National Forest System lands.
