FR940912-0-00030 FR940912-0-00006 The Funding Corporation suggested that the regulation be expanded so that, upon its request, each bank would be required to provide the Funding Corporation with the Reports of Examination and related information for the bank and related associations. The Funding Corporation is concerned that the regulation as proposed may be interpreted to implicitly absolve a bank of its responsibility to report to the Funding Corporation any significant regulatory conditions imposed or actions taken by the FCA against the bank or its related associations. Conversely, the FCBT supported proposed §630.4(a)(9) as written on the basis that it maintains an appropriate balance between the confidentiality of examination reports required by §602.205 of this chapter and the need to provide complete and accurate disclosure to investors required by the proposed rule. Section 630.4(c) sets forth the responsibilities of each bank for preparation of the report to investors. Based on §630.4(c)(5)(i), which requires that each bank certify to the Funding Corporation that the bank has submitted all information needed for preparation of the report to investors in accordance with the instruction of the Funding Corporation, the FCBT concluded that protection of the confidentiality of examination reports will not encourage banks to avoid their primary disclosure responsibilities with respect to material matters that may be discussed in the examination report. While the FCBT supports §630.4(a)(9) as proposed, it commented that the phrase ``if necessary'' leaves doubt as to whether the Funding Corporation should request the FCA to provide information contained in the examination reports in all cases or simply in those cases where a bank does not provide information contained in the examination report to the Funding Corporation. The FCBT requested that the FCA provide a definitive and unambiguous rule regarding the obligation to furnish copies of these reports. In response to the comments received, the FCA has revised paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9) of §630.4 to clarify that the Funding Corporation is responsible for collecting from each disclosure entity information needed for preparation of the report to investors, including any information that is material to a single disclosure entity. Likewise, in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions, each bank is responsible for providing the Funding Corporation with information that is material either to the bank or, on a combined basis, to the bank and its related associations. If information necessary for preparation of a report to investors that is meaningful and not misleading is not forthcoming from a bank in accordance with the provisions of §630.4(c), the Funding Corporation may request the FCA to provide information regarding the content of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks or related associations necessary to ensure that the information presented in the report to investors is meaningful and not misleading. The FCA will then make a determination whether to provide the Funding Corporation with relevant information contained in the Report of Examination or, if appropriate, the entire report. The FCA is cognizant of both the Funding Corporation's desire to have direct access to Reports of Examination and the FCBT's concern with protection of the confidentiality of the Reports of Examination. The FCA does not believe that §630.4(a)(9) would relieve a bank of its responsibility to report any significant regulatory conditions that would have a material impact on the information being presented in the report to investors. It remains the primary responsibility of each bank to provide accurate and complete information to the Funding Corporation for preparing disclosure to investors. Each bank is required to certify to this effect to the Funding Corporation. Section 630.4(a)(9) is established to provide the Funding Corporation with a contingency source for obtaining information needed to prepare accurate and comprehensive annual and quarterly reports to investors, while maintaining the confidentiality of the Reports of Examination. However, such requests from the Funding Corporation to the FCA are expected to be rare. Also, as the FCBT noted in its comment letter, §630.5 prohibits banks from making incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosures. Failure to disclose material information would violate these regulations and subject a bank and its officers and directors to possible FCA enforcement action. 2. Sections 630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)_Bank-Only Financial Data Section 630.4(c)(1) requires that each bank provide the Funding Corporation with information needed for preparation of the report to investors. The FCC suggested that proposed §630.4(c)(1) be revised to clarify that, for Systemwide disclosure, information to be provided by each bank to the Funding Corporation includes not only financial information, but nonfinancial information as well, including information covering structural changes and regulatory enforcement activity. Proposed §630.4(c)(1) has been clarified to refer to other nonfinancial information. The FCC also suggested that proposed §§630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)(i) be revised to clarify that it is appropriate to include any wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank in the bank-only information. The FCBB submitted a separate comment in which it urged the FCA to include the FCC's suggestion in the final rule to address the treatment of the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the FCBB.
