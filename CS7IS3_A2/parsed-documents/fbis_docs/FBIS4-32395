"The dispute is over whether this state, which is smaller than it was under the Premyslids (kings from the 10th-13th centuries), smaller than it was in the time from when the models are being taken (when part of Czechoslovakia) should have a state administration consisting of a central body, regions, districts and communities," he said. Cost was another factor in the ODS' reluctance to have two levels between the community and state. At issue was not the creation of an autonomous element (i.e. some decentralization of the state's power] but the level at which this ought to be created), Strasky said. "It is clear to the ODS that the ideal number of autonomous units does not approach 100, or 80 - the number of districts today - but that it has to be smaller," he said. He believed the ODS' coalition partners also admitted that there was not and would not in the near future be sufficient strength to get rid of any administrative body existing today. If the government bill on higher units of local administration were passed in the form suggested by deputy premier Jan Kalvoda (ODS), this would mean setting up autonomous regions, and then districts which would probably not have the autonomy they now had, in addition to the communities and central organs. The most important thing was to find a solution which would not shake the state administration and which would constitute a first step, for in the building of inner structures of the state there was never any final solution, Strasky said.
