The resignation of the high-ranking official of the Health and Social Action Ministry was based on the fact that "he stated that he had carried out the administrative mission he had been charged with." Borgonovo, who had been under secretary under Secretary General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza [when he was interior minister], will once again work with Bauza as an adviser. Some political sources have interpreted Borgonovo's resignation as a step toward an upcoming replacement of Health Minister Alberto Mazza. Moreover, a high-ranking government source denied this possibility and stressed that Mazza will continue in his post and that Borgonovo's leaving was due simply to the fact that "he had concluded his internal administrative mission." Fornes is an accountant who for a long time worked within the private sector in Mendoza Province, mainly with the Nazar Construction Enterprise, whose owner is linked to the radicals. Borgonovo's replacement was named by Mazza and he is considered to be a man who is close to Bauza's political faction in Mendoza.
