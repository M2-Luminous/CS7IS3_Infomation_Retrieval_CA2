Denktas is accompanied by Prime Minister Hakki Atun, Minister for State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit. Denktas said during his first official visit to Turkey with the new coalition government they will coordinate efforts as the new rounds of Cyprus talks which are scheduled to take place under the auspices of the United Nations. TRNC president said the talks in Ankara will focus on the package of 'confidence building measures,' adding 'we will inform the Turkish Government about our thoughts on the measures'. He said TRNC is ready to say 'yes' to a satisfactory, balanced and stable solution to the Cyprus problem. Denktas said a positive result could only be taken if the Greek Cypriots show the same good will. U.N.-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were interrupted last July. Cyprus has been practically divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup which attempted to annex the island to Greece and to annihilate its Turkish Cypriot population. The TRNC came to existence in 1983. Denktas as well as Prime Minister Atun and those accompanying them will return to Cyprus on Wednesday after their talks in Ankara.
