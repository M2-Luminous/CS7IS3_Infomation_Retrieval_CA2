FR941130-2-00121 FR941130-2-00070 •The Substitution will be effected pursuant to the established net asset values of CIGNA Funds and PCM Funds as of the effective date of the Substitution, in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder. •The Substitution is intended to provide owners of Account I Policies and INA/Putnam Policies with underlying investment vehicles which correspond to the options currently available under the CIGNA Funds. •The Substitution is intended to provide owners of Account I Policies and INA/Putnam Policies with continuity, given the announced intention of CII to withdraw as investment adviser to the CIGNA Funds. •The Substitution is expected to result in lower expense ratios. •The Substitution is not expected to have federal income tax consequences for Policy holders. 6. The Applicants further submit that, with respect to the ``in kind'' aspects of the Substitution: (a) Investors has been advised by CIGNA Funds and PCM Funds that only those securities which Putnam otherwise would select for the applicable portfolios of PCM Funds will be included in the ``in kind'' transfer to Investors; (b) Investors has been assured by CII and Putnam that the securities to be included in the ``in kind'' transfer will be valued at independent current market prices on the effective date of the Substitution; and (c) CII and Putnam have assured Investors that no brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration would be paid or charged in connection with the in kind transfers. 7. The Applicants represent that because the ``in kind'' transfer would occur only once_i.e., on the effective date of the Substitution, Account I and INA/Putnam Account have not adopted the written procedures described in paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a&hyph;7. Investors submits that the purposes intended to be served by such written procedures are not applicable to the current situation. Investors submits that the proposed transactions involved in the Substitution fall within the intent of Rule 17a&hyph;7 securities redeemed in kind and that, consequently, there will be no overreaching because all securities redeemed in kind and used to purchase shares of the PCM Funds will be consistently valued for all purposes. Nonetheless, Investors, Account I and INA/Putnam Account will comply with paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 17a&hyph;7. 8. The Applicants submit that the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and does not present any of the investor protection concerns that Section 26(b) is designed to address. The Applicants note that Policy holder will be informed fully of the terms of the Substitution and will have an opportunity to vote on the Substitution following the approval of this application by the Commission. The variable annuity contracts issued by Account I and the INA/Putnam Account provide that, in the event of a substitution of underlying fund shares, ``prior approval by the vote of a majority of the votes to be cast by persons having their contract values determined by the affected [separate account] [d]ivision will be obtained.'' Applicants' Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Applicants submit that the requested order under Section 26(b) meets the standards of that section, and that the requested exemption from Section 17(a) meets the standards of Sections 6(c) and 17(b). For the Commission by the Division of Investment Management pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
