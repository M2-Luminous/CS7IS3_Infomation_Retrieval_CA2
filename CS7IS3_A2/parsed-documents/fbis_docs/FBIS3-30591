[Belcak] In past years our cooperation was conducted within the framework of the CEMA bloc. The decline in foreign trade turnover during the period of transformation of a centrally steered economy into a free market system is a phenomenon that is not exclusive to our countries. It is found throughout Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of developments that extended far beyond the creation of two independent states: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The value of trade exchange between Poland and Slovakia fell from $397 million in 1991 to less than $228 million in 1992. In the first quarter of 1993 the value of exports from Slovakia to Poland was $23 million, while that of imports from Poland to Slovakia was $15.4 million. The current state of affairs in this field was the subject of talks between our respective deputy premiers in July last year. During the current visit [to Poland by Slovak President Kovac] we aim to attach much importance to economic questions. This is evidenced, among other things, by the personal composition of the Slovak delegation, which includes the chairman of the Slovak Industry and Commerce Chamber, the Minister of the Economy, and representatives of 11 individual companies. The schedule of the visit includes a meeting between President Michal Kovac and Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairperson of the Polish National Bank. President Kovac will also meet with Polish businessmen, while yet another meeting at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be attended by ministers-heads of the following departments: Foreign Economic Cooperation, Transport and Maritime Economy, and the Central Planning Office. [Bereza] What are the reasons responsible for the poor condition of Polish-Slovak economic cooperation to date? [Belcak] I believe that the main reason is the lack of efficient exchange of information concerning our respective cooperation potential. We often import goods from distant places which we could easily be buying from one another--and that would involve lower transportation costs. We should not forget, either, that in certain parts of both Poland and Slovakia it is much easier to transport goods from across the Carpathian mountains than to carry them in from the more distant parts of our own respective countries. We share a very long stretch of state border--altogether 520 km--but there are only three border crossings along its entire length that have been adapted to cargo transportation. We should be offered more favorable terms of mutual trade exchange within the framework of the Visegrad Group and the GATT agreement. The present terms of our mutual trade exchange cannot possibly be viewed as satisfactory by either side. I hope that the trade turnover between Poland and Slovakia will double its value within the next two to three years. [Bereza] How does Slovakia encourage potential foreign investors to invest their capital within its borders? [Belcak] We offer a variety of incentives and preferential terms to foreign investors because we need their capital to make good use of our existing industrial enterprises and our highly trained professional cadres. To give you an example, in the parish of Banska Bystrica a bank with an input of foreign capital is entitled to a longer tax holiday than banks in other regions of the country. These matters are regulated centrally by means of parliamentary acts. For the time being, according to data for the first half of 1993, the value of foreign capital invested in Slovakia came to $320.4 million. The highest share in that amount is represented by Austrian investors (25.8 percent); these are followed by Germans (18.2 percent), Americans (14.5 percent), Czechs (12 percent), and French (upward of 9 percent). [Bereza] What can be done to enable Poles to join that group of leading investors? Following the announcement that interest rates will be raised in Poland, some businessmen are beginning to consider moving their companies to your country. [Belcak] There is extensive unused potential in many areas of our economy: not only in industry but also in agriculture and the food economy. Work is currently in progress on setting up a joint Polish-Slovak chamber of industry and commerce, to be situated in Krakow, a city close to the Slovak border and also easily reached from other regions of Poland. Dynamic involvement on the part of specific enterprises is essential if we are to develop effective cooperation between corresponding economic entities in both countries. We see much evidence of individual companies' interest in such cooperation as we answer some 20-30 telephone requests for information on the subject every day.
