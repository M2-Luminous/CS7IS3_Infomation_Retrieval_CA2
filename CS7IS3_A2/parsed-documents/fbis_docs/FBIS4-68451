Sufficient time to have left the infant and toddler phase and to have begun to walk unaided. But the diagnosis "something is rotten," which was once appended to the state of affairs "in the state of Denmark," has proven appropriate to the CIS also. The processes of the formation of the Commonwealth are proving contradictory, and successes are being replaced by failures, setbacks even. As a result, no one can say for certain what will come of all this. Let us attempt to grasp the realities that have emerged. It would seem that the correct reference point is the historical background from which the present relationships in the Commonwealth are growing. Is the Role of Leader a Burden? How were the components of the CIS' predecessor--the Soviet Union--correlated between themselves? A well-known charge leveled at it is that it was an empire. Let us take a look according to a dispassionate criterion of identification of a real empire, namely, whether the center (metropolis) pumps resources from the periphery (colonies). According to figures used by, we would note, the International Monetary Fund, the charges are not borne out--the Union center was a major donor in respect to the five most backward Central Asian republics. Thus at the last stage of the existence of the USSR, in 1991, Union subsidies, according to IMF data, constituted the following proportion of these budgets: 45 percent in Tajikistan, 43 percent in Uzbekistan, 35 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 25 percent in Kazakhstan, and 22 percent in Turkmenistan. Thus according to a key criterion, the Union was not an empire. It effected infusions into the economy of the outlying areas, did not pump resources out. But this is only the first step toward establishment of the root system. Let us try to exfoliate the facts further. There arises, for example, the question: Where did the sums of money for the subsidies come from? From other, more economically developed Union republics, primarily Russia, which accounted for 60 percent of the overall potential. So what kind of nature of relationship was it--"plunder in reverse," as it is sometimes portrayed? Not this either. World experience testifies that this is a normal, even typical, mode of interaction within any federation. It is a question of the civilized redistribution of resources among its members. Let us look at Canada, the federation most similar to us both in terms of size of territory and natural and climatic conditions and in terms of difference in the development of individual parts of the country. The most industrially advanced province of Canada--Ontario, accounting for 55 percent of national production--is the main donor in relation to the majority of the remaining 11 provinces and territories. Some of them receive very substantial resources nominally from the federal government, but in fact from Ontario. Thus for Canada's four Atlantic provinces these transfers constituted in 1987 the following percentage of their total income: 47 for Newfoundland, 46 for Prince Edward Island, 40 for New Brunswick, and 38 for Nova Scotia. In other words, the identity of the roles of Russia and Ontario is obvious. It consists of the function of leader of the federation, its locomotive, which is followed by the whole train. It is important that the allocations made the others by a forward-looking leader are by no means a one-sided burden. They are also an assurance of the health of all members of the single organism, a guarantee of the unity and integrity of the federation. A wise head does not refuse to maintain the arms and legs. The main thing is that the leader himself obtains a prize in the form of more extensive national markets. He uses this to considerable advantage, compensating the original costs. Thus all members of the federation ultimately benefit, and this is why they are interested in it. It should be added that this nature of relations (with some specific singularities, understandably) is characteristic of other federations also--the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Australia. Of course, the CIS is not a federation, not even a confederation, and only coordinating, not supranational, bodies are possible within it. Yes, a lesser contribution of Russia to the common pot is, consequently, justified as yet. But, on the other hand, the CIS is a unique organization: Its participants, even having become independent states, are tied to the Russian Federation by the umbilical cord of many centuries of economic and other relations and interdependencies. In so closely interwoven a common space the guiding role of Russia is justified. If we are all thinking in categories of voluntary reintegration, and this has been the case thus far, we should not, in any event, be taking abrupt steps back, moving back in order subsequently, possibly, to take a step forward. But it is this problem, apparently, that has arisen for Russia--this, by appointment, nucleus of the Commonwealth. Recoil--Where and For What Purpose? Unfortunately, a struggle of common sense and, in addition, the lessons of world development against irrational improvisations continues in the Russian position in respect to the CIS. Consequently, the Commonwealth is at times recognized as a legitimate child, with whom hopes for the future are linked, what is more, at other times it suddenly comes to be slighted as a foundling and sponger. It is well known what has as of late served as a stimulus to a strengthening of the trends of attraction on the periphery of the CIS. Disenchantment with the euphoria of the sovereignties and a growing understanding that it is easier to cope with difficulties together. All the harder does what began as of the middle of last year--opposite impulses of rejection from the center--lend itself to a rational explanation. There was in July 1993 a relapse into the Belovezha syndrome--a new statement of the "Slav trio"--on this occasion concerning urgent measures to strengthen only its economic integration. This was followed by attempts by Moscow to impose a "new-type" ruble zone on the rest of the participants in the CIS. According to the conditions of its formation, the Russian Federation could use these states' credit liabilities to place an important part of their economies under control. Another condition of Russian credit was the conclusion with CIS countries of dual-citizenship agreements. It was said here that we had not thought up such conditions, the entire international credit system works on the basis of them, and that linking policy with economics is a normal practice. This is not true. First, as far as it itself is concerned, the Russian Federation is justifiably rejecting the attempts by the creditors of the London Club to sell its assets overseas for the debts. Second, the demand for dual citizenship in respect to 25 million citizens of one country who suddenly, through no fault of their own, have found themselves abroad is without precedent. The main thing is that while in no way helping them specifically, it even makes their position worse, putting the corresponding states, a substantial part of whose population would thereby become "semi-foreigners," on their guard. Similar claims were not made on Estonia and Latvia, incidentally, where severe discrimination against the Russian-speaking population is being openly directed by the governments. It is not surprising that both Russian conditions set the CIS countries in respect to credit were rejected. Following this, a policy of evicting the malcontents from the ruble zone was adopted, and all was crowned this March by a statement that the burden of leader of the CIS does not suit Moscow. As of the present there are more questions than answers in connection with so abrupt a development. But the reflections are highly disturbing. What is the reason, for example, for priority being given the creation of an ethnic Slav union? The 1,000-year history of the multinational Russian state has known of no such reference point. This could be a mine beneath the fate of the Russian Federation itself. Why, further, is it acceptable to impose in the CIS the patronage of an older brother capable of dictating his terms to the younger ones? To be honest, this is akin to the imperial approach which we have sacredly forsworn. Finally, does not all this mean virtual renunciation of a full-fledged Commonwealth and its death knell? It is not, evidently, from having nothing better to do that the president of Kazakhstan, a convinced supporter of the CIS, has put forward the alternative idea of a Eurasian Union. One thing is certain--ignoring realities is dangerous. Only in close interaction and on an equal basis with other countries of the CIS, not in isolation from them, in confrontation with them even less, is Russia's own revival conceivable. Potential of the Commonwealth There are three main reasons why Russia's emergence from the multidimensional crisis is possible only in cooperation with the other countries of the CIS. First, the imperatives of world development, with which Russia should proceed in step, not against the current. These amount to the fact that only extensive regional (meaning regions of the world) markets afford real prospects of economic growth. This is why the United States, despite all its colossal possibilities, preferred to join forces with Canada and then with Mexico also in the NAFTA trade and economic bloc. In turn, Germany, France, Britain--also great economic powers--agreed to unity with other states within the framework of the European Union. In this context the sole possibility for Russia of not withering away with its ailing economy and not suffocating from a lack of oxygen is to have its own regional market in the form of the CIS. The time of "lone wolves" in the world economy is gone. Second, the tasks of ensuring national security push in the same direction. The collective interaction of the states of the CIS is a dependable common shield. Arguing from the opposite: Members of the Commonwealth, abandoned to the whim of fate, would have even fewer chances than the Russian Federation of not finding themselves plunged into chaos. But acquiring thereby an "encircling lichen of conflicts" along its entire perimeter would be most unpropitious surroundings for Russia. Such as it has never known throughout history and should not know, even less generate. Third, as regards the geopolitical dimension. In short: Unless the Russian Federation is the leader in its region of the world, so much more will it not be a power of truly world caliber. An adjustment of the impulsive actions, based on elementary miscalculation, is needed. A journey in the turbulent waters of world economics and policy cannot be started by jettisoning the lifesaver.
