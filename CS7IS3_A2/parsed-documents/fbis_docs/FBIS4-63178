Rumors of Savostyanov's imminent resignation had been around for several weeks. The request was finally written but turned down. Various things are being said about the major general's wish to resign. According to one guess, Savostyanov decided to go into politics. Many staffers in his directorate however think their boss is simply in a hurry. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has information that Sergey Stepashin, FCS director, would like to see Cherkasov, the current chief of the St. Petersburg FCS directorate, occupying the Moscow directorate. Stepashin has been friends with Cherkasov for a long time and he interceded for him at the time of the repeat certification procedure.
