The survey was conducted nationwide, and 1,753 people were polled from 25 to 27 February. This is the first poll conducted since 8 February when the Electoral Tribunal closed the registration period for candidates to elective office. According to the poll, Perez Balladares continues to be the favorite candidate, with his support increasing by 5 percent. The poll revealed that if the elections were held today, 37.3 percent of the people would vote for Perez Balladares. This reflects an increase in the number of followers of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] candidate. He registered a 32.1 percent popularity rate in the last poll taken on 27 January. Meanwhile, Ruben Carles, presidential candidate for Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement], Morena [National Renewal Movement], and Civic Renewal parties, came in second place with 20.5 percent. Carles' popularity rate rose 7.3 percent from the previous poll, in which he placed third with 13.2 percent of the votes. Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement's presidential candidate, suffered the largest decrease in popularity in this poll by registering only a 9.9 percent popularity rate, which placed him third among the candidates chosen to win the 8 May election.
