When asked if a break-up of the official alliance is imminent, Rolla replied that Molirena should be asked as "they are the ones breaking-up." Rolla stressed that the sole candidate for the 8 May elections is Mireya Moscoso de Gruber and that the next government will belong to the Arnulfists. "If other government parties are confused and do not have a candidate of their own, that is their problem; however, if they want to be part of the government in the next elections then they should come under the banner of the Arnulfist Party," Rolla said. The experienced politician and health minister warned that whatever government party wishes to join the triumph of the Arnulfist party, must work for the needs of the Panamanian people and not for economic and personal interests, or have in mind ambassadorial, consular, or banking posts, otherwise they will harm the party and the country. Rolla said that whatever party wishes to withdraw from the government alliance "can leave" because the Arnulfist Party has the capacity to fill all the ministerial posts. The health minister insisted that if the Molirena Party leadership decides to withdraw from the government coalition, "let them," but they must remember that it is "the Arnulfists who call the shots." Lastly, Rolla Pimentel confirmed that his Arnulfist Party is holding talks with parties that are progressive, positive, and nationalistic, such as the Papa Egoro Movement, National Unity Mission, and people from the Christian Democratic Party.
