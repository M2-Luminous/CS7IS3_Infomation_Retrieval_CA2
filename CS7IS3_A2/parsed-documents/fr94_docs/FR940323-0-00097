ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to increase certain cost-of-living allowance (COLA) rates paid to General Schedule, U.S. Postal Service, and certain other Federal employees in Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii; and St. Thomas and St. John, Virgin Islands. The increases are based on living cost surveys conducted by Runzheimer International, under contract with OPM, during the summer of 1992 and winter of 1993. EFFECTIVE DATES: These regulations are effective March 23, 1994, and are applicable on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after March 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Allan G. Hearne, (202) 606&hyph;2838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, certain Federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous States are eligible for cost-of-living allowances (COLAs) when local living costs are substantially higher than those in Washington, DC. Currently, nonforeign area COLAs are paid in the following locations: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. OPM contracted with Runzheimer International to conduct living cost surveys in the allowance areas in 1992 and 1993. All allowance areas, except those in Alaska, were surveyed in the summer of 1992. Alaska was surveyed during the winter of 1993. The surveys showed that adjustments in various COLA rates were warranted. This included increases of three COLA rates in three allowance areas and reductions of eight COLA rates in six allowance areas. However, a provision in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;141) bars OPM from reducing any COLA rate through December 31, 1995. Therefore, only the COLA rate increases will be implemented. The increases implemented by this rulemaking are summarized in the following table:
