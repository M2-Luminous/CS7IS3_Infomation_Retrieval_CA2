Hawaii grantees shall follow the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section except that the amendment does not need HUD approval, and does not have to be submitted to HUD. §570.432 Repayment of section 108 loans. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a unit of general local government in a nonentitlement area where the State has not elected to administer the CDBG program shall be eligible for Small Cities Grant assistance hereunder for the sole purpose of paying any amounts due on debt obligations issued by such unit of general local government (or its designated public agency) and guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to section 108 of the Act (see subpart M of this part). The award of grant assistance for such purpose shall be consistent with section 106(d)(3)(B) of the Act, in such amount, and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine. Since guaranteed loan funds (as defined in §570.701) are required to be used in accordance with national and primary objective requirements, and other applicable requirements of this part, any grant made to make payments on the debt obligations evidencing the guaranteed loan shall be presumed to meet such requirements, unless HUD determines that the guaranteed loan funds were not used in accordance with such requirements. Any such determination by HUD shall not prevent the making of the grant in the amount of the payment due, but it may be grounds for HUD to take appropriate action under subpart O based on the original noncompliance. 3. In 24 CFR part 570, subpart I, a new §570.497 is added to read as follows: §570.497 Condition of State election to administer State CDBG Program. Pursuant to section 106(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, a State has the right to elect, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary may prescribe, to administer funds allocated under subpart A of this part for use in nonentitlement areas of the State. After January 26, 1995, any State which elects to administer the allocation of CDBG funds for use in nonentitlement areas of the State in any year must, in addition to all other requirements of this subpart, submit a pledge by the State in accordance with section 108(d)(2) of the Act, and in a form acceptable to HUD, of any future CDBG grants it may receive under subpart A and this subpart. Such pledge shall be for the purpose of assuring repayment of any debt obligations (as defined in §570.701), in accordance with their terms, that HUD may have guaranteed in the respective State on behalf of any nonentitlement public entity (as defined in §570.701) or its designated public agency prior to the State's election. 4.
