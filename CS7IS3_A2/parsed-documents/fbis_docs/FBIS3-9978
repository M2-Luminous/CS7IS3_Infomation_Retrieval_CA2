The rebel leader added that although the government's resignation will not be decided at the dialogue he is holding with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis in San Cristobal de las Casas, "we still have to state our position at the national level, whether individually or at the bargaining table." The Zapatist leader said: "The federal government, the federal executive branch, and its cabinet should resign, because how can this government guarantee that the people's will, as expressed at the polls, be respected when the government has already defined its position from the outset in favor of one of the candidates?" President Salinas' resignation and other points concerning democracy are among the political demands made by the EZLN since its 1 January insurrection in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas. Noting that "no one can be both judge and jury," Marcos said there should be a transition government whose members should not belong to any political party, or a government formed out of an agreement among the various political parties, which will then be able to organize the 21 August presidential elections. Marcos said the regional conflict will not be resolved "unless there is a radical, fundamental change -- a deep-rooted change that will support a solution. [no closing quotation marks as received] Marcos added that southern Mexico (Chiapas, Tabasco, Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo) is the most exploited region in Mexico -- an area "where more resources are extracted and less benefits are received, a situation that will only worsen under NAFTA." Marcos said NAFTA "will designate the southeastern region as a banana republic, but instead of a banana-growing region, it will be an oil and electricity region." He added, "The country will be divided, and poverty in the southeast will increase to even more unimaginable and inhuman levels, worse than those seen in Somalia." With regard to the progress made at the Chiapas peace talks now under way at the San Cristobal Cathedral, Marcos reiterated that the Indian groups have been very clear in stating that the resolution of problems must be at a national level. "The toughest and most difficult part" of the negotiations is still pending, Marcos stressed. He attributed the spectacular progress and coverage of 50 percent of the agenda to the fact that the talks began by dealing with the least divisive issues "to send a signal to the country that peace, perhaps, is possible."
