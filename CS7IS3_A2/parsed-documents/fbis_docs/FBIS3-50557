The rebels controlled Las Margaritas after occupying the town on 1 January and withdrew early on 3 January, journalists who arrived there after they had left told EFE. The journalists said when leaving the town they saw the corpses of Police Commander Berlain Perez Perez and a guerrilla at the Union de Uniones Building. A rebel identified as "Major Moises" told the journalists that General Castellanos, who was kidnapped on 2 January, will be judged in a summary trial at their general garrison for "repressing the people." "He will not be freed. He already enjoyed freedom and will be executed," the rebel told the journalists who managed to enter Las Margaritas. He reiterated that his organization "will remain armed and will fight to the death. We are determined. We are not demanding negotiations; we have declared war on the Army." Meanwhile, the almost 120,000 inhabitants of Comitan are living hours of terror tonight, fearing the town, located 15 minutes from Las Margaritas, could be attacked by the rebels posted in the surrounding areas. Helicopters and "Pilatus" type planes are constantly overflying Comitan, and the Army has reinforced security in public buildings and access roads to the city.
