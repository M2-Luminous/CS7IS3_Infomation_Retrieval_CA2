This is corroborated by news from Sombor [northern Vojvodina province] where a debate was held yesterday evening on the subject of the position and rights of national minorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Also attending was FRY Human and Minority Rights Minister Margit Savovic. Asked by Mate Mataric, president of the Sombor branch of the Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats [DSHV], about the status of Croats in Yugoslavia, she replied that Croats cannot even be a national minority in the Serbian-Montenegrin state. According to her, this is because the FRY does not recognize Croatia; and as international law prescribes that the national minority status can only be accorded to peoples with a parent country, Croats in the FRY cannot even be a national minority. Commenting on the existence of a threat to the Croats in Vojvodina, she said that this is not the case and that all Croats who moved from Yugoslavia did so voluntarily. We would like to add that more than 35,000 Croats were expelled over the past three years from Vojvodina alone, and that the ethnic cleansing of Srem, Banat, and Backa [areas in Vojvodina] continues.
