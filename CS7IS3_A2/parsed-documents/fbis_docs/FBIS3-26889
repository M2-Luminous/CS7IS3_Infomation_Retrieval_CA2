This is another positive step in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process following the agreement on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, which was signed between the two sides in Washington last year. The "Cairo Document" was hard-won. As everybody knows, since the Palestinian-Israeli Principled Declaration went into effect, the two sides have set up four committees responsible for holding talks to implement the autonomy accord. Owing to the three major obstacles -- control of passage, the Jericho area, and security in the settlement sites -- the Palestinian-Israeli talks, especially those on troop withdrawal and security arrangements, were on and off and almost came to a standstill, so that Israel was unable to begin withdrawing its troops as scheduled. Over the past few months, Palestinian and Israeli leaders took various opportunities to meet in Cairo, Oslo, Paris, Grenada, and Davos in a bid to break the stalemate and stop dragging on without a solution. Although some progress has been made in these meetings, no agreement could be reached because of the relatively wide differences between the two sides on the above issues. The current Cairo talks also experienced hardships and difficulties. It has been learned that President Mubarak positively acted as a mediator to help them out of the predicament five times in succession, in order to diminish their differences and enable the talks to go on. After nine rounds of marathon talks, an agreement on a number of crucial issues has finally been reached. The initialing of the "Cairo Document" is conducive to signing a final agreement between Palestine and Israel and will also have a positive impact on pushing forward the peace process in the Middle East and making progress in other areas. Hence, it has been widely welcomed and seriously heeded by public opinion throughout the world. The "Cairo Document," which is more detailed and specific, is the first document toward the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration. It is composed of two agreements, which primarily involve the control of border passage and security arrangements for the future Palestinian autonomous regions. It covers several issues, including the general principle on the passage control in Gaza and Jericho, the external security during the transition period, the supervision of passage control, entry and exit procedures for the territory, the examination of passengers, and the establishment of a liaison office. Although the "Cairo Document" did not resolve all the security problems concerning the future autonomous region and the Jewish settlement sites, it has removed the major obstacles to the implementation of the principled declaration. The signing of the document reflected the spirit of trust, cooperation, flexibility, and accommodation shown by the two sides. The PLO maintains: "Although the "Cairo Document" failed to satisfy all the demands of the Palestinian side, generally speaking, it is a good agreement." The Israeli side has said that the "Cairo Document" takes its security requirements into consideration and does not infringe upon the dignity of the Palestinians." Of course, the "Cairo Document" has also met with some opposition. For example, Shamir, former leader of the ultra-right-wing Likud and prime minister of Israel, called the "Cairo Document" an "investment agreement," which, he said, has ruined all the "fruits of victory" gained by Israel in the past 27 years and runs counter to Israel's future, security, and interests. The initialing of the "Cairo Document" does not mean that the Palestinian-Israeli peace train is now on the easy path, given the great number of outstanding problems that are awaiting a solution between the initialing of the document and the conclusion of a final agreement. An example is the actual area covered by the Jericho region and the Jewish settlement sites in Gaza, which have not been determined up to now. Although 'Arafat has signed the map that indicates the scope of the future Jericho autonomy, he still has some reservations on the issue. The Israeli side promised to make its final decision during the meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin. Also, the size and power of the future Palestinian police and the role of the electoral organs of the Palestinian autonomy have not been defined, and the detailed rules regarding the transfer of administrative power and the economic relations between Palestine and Israel still require further negotiations. Even though such problems and difficulties exist on the road of implementing the Palestinian-Israeli principled declaration, they will possibly discover relatively satisfactory ways of settlement and achieve the anticipated goals, as long as both sides continue to work assiduously for these aims.
