That tendency was reflected in a statement by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister and member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC], who said that "contacts are underway between YSP leaders and the government of Sanaa to agree on holding a dialogue." [passage omitted] AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from sources of arms dealers in Europe that Jordan has expressed willingness to purchase arms on behalf of the northern forces command in Sanaa after numerous states banned the sale of arms to Sanaa and Aden as long as the war between their forces in Yemen continued. The sources said that Jordan acted in the same way to purchase arms for Iraq throughout the years of war between Iraq and Iran. [passage omitted] While the intensity of the battles generally eased after fierce fighting on the Kharaz-Bab el Mandeb front on the western axis the day before yesterday, the most important battle yesterday was in the Shabwah Governorate. Shabwah Governor Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the southern forces have captured the northern part of 'Ataq, the capital of Shabwah, and that fighting was raging in the southwestern part of the town. In an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT via satellite from the battlefield, the Shabwah governor said that the remnants of the northern forces consisting of a Republican Guard brigade, a shock brigade, a paratroopers brigade, and the 6th Brigade "withdrew from parts of the town after their soldiers looted people's property and acted like thieves." He confirmed that the southern forces recaptured several towns including al-Sa'id and al-Musayni'ah after inflicting losses on the northern forces including hundreds of casualties. He emphasized that "the liberation of the Shabwah Governorate will be completed within two days at the most." [passage omitted]
