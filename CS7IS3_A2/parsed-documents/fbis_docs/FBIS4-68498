A Gangster for Every Militiaman!"] [Text] The Moscow GUVD [City Internal Affairs Administration] has delivered a volley of paper against crime. Using secret orders and instructions in Petrovka they hope to win the war against crime. Previously the leaders explained in words who should catch how many gangsters. Now the GUVD has issued secret order No. 017. The local offices quickly adjusted. The militiaman had forgotten the number of criminals assigned to him, he went up to the board on which the orders were posted and looked. And there he saw, for example, order for the Southern Administrative District of the City of Moscow of 10 March of this year signed by Major General of the Militia Ye. Rozhkov. It gives the sections the assignment of solving from one to three crimes each month, reporting on no less than two people who have been previously convicted, one drug addict, and so forth. The roundup of the criminal brotherhood has been placed on a conveyor belt. The operations workers laughed their heads off over these figures. The regional division for combating organized crime of the Southern District during the month ordered that six criminal groups be caught. They were to uncover seven crimes committed by the same criminal groups and uncover a total of 16 crimes. The main thing is that everything must go according to plan. They may catch more, but by no means fewer. If they do not fulfill the plan they will be docked half their salary. And if they catch more--there will be a reward. The plan will be increased. The most terrible figures are for the workers of the state automotive inspection. The department of the GAI [State Automotive Inspection] and GPS [Patrol and Guard Service] must catch 72,532 drivers a month for traffic violations. The pedestrians got lucky. Fewer of them will be caught--20,723. This plan deals a blow to us first of all. But it is easy to evade it. On the first days of each month try to stay home as much as possible. Let them catch the people who do not read our newspaper: They will help the militia fulfill their monthly plan.
