To the 14th June inclusive, he stated, the citizenship status of 1,463,582 Macedonian citizens of age, i.e. of 98 percent of the population, has been regulated. The figure of 150,000 citizens to be left with unresolved status, which appeared earlier, was not correct. Only 5,500 applications have been negatively answered thus far, and about the same number of applications is being decided on, he explained. (?86,368) citizens have not yet been delivered their citizenship notification, but this will also be done in due time before the census. As for recent accusations of the State Intelligence Service, Minister Frckovski said these were plain political games of certain parties, which attempted to slander and vilify the Macedonian Interior Ministry in order to justify their own failures of cover for intentions to glorify certain political parties. This is only a pre-election warming up, he said, in which parties are using methods appropriate to their own profile and internal structures. The minister exposed information showing the Interior Ministry has evidence on activities of certain political parties, especially of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity], during this party members' meetings with another party from Bulgaria, in and out of Macedonia. These meetings included plans for the joint appearance in the coming elections. But, he pointed out, the Interior Ministry cannot be possibly blamed for these activities. It can notify part of them and present them to the Macedonian public, but cannot be blamed for their existence, just as it cannot be blamed of making them up. If following such a logic one could end up concluding that entire parties are simply made up, this goes into the territory of science fictions, Frckovski said. What really concerns the ministry, Frckovski added, is the fact that the level of political struggle is being brought down to a level of political discussions focused on political pornography. [sentence as received] Parties make up stories of secret documents and party police squads, avoid checking the truth of the presented "evidence," attempt to politically manipulate with the public, and, as a result, the ministry is disabled to introduce any serious inspection or a serious democratic procedure to check any accusations. In regard to rumors of organized crime in the state and mentioning of two names by the ex-undersecretary in the Interior Ministry, Frckovski said charges have been brought against the ex-undersecretary and apologized to the individuals whose names were mentioned in connection with such alleged crimes.
