FBIS4-64393 "drweu085__a94016" FBIS-WEU-94-085-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Germany Lufthansa-United Airlines Cooperation Settled Lufthansa-United Airlines Cooperation Settled AU2904111494 Hamburg DPA in German 0949 GMT 29 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2904111494 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn -- The cooperation agreed between Lufthansa and United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. airline, in both Europe and America has finally been settled. Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann informed the press in Bonn on Friday [29 April] that the U.S. Administration has agreed to this strategic alliance of the two airlines. The first flight based on the so-called code-sharing agreement is to take place at the beginning of June. The alliance is based on the aviation agreement that was concluded by Bonn and Washington in mid-March. The two airlines will be able to offer joint flights in the future. Wissmann said he expects that this will enable Lufthansa to win back market shares on the hotly contested North Atlantic route and to operate more profitably in the future. He did not rule out that the company's currently negative balance sheet could improve by amounts in the three-digit million mark range over the next few years. On the development of prices he said that if Lufthansa can achieve a higher degree of utilization and work at lower costs, there is a chance of this trend being passed on to customers. As advantages of this cooperation he mainly lists more flexible flight offers, a better utilization of joint installations and worldwide attending to customers. Wissmann said that the breakthrough in the difficult German-U.S. aviation negotiations was achieved when other American airlines were also given the right to cooperate with companies in Central and East Europe. In return, Lufthansa can now cooperate with domestic airlines on flights between the United States and the Caribbean or South America.
