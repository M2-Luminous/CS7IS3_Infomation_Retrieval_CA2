Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin who chaired the session said the Government will hold sessions more often in 1994 and expressed the confidence that the reduction of the Government and the ministries by 20 per cent will not affect the quality of their work. He paid special attention to relations between the Government and the Federal Assembly. Chernomyrdin stressed that "the Government should learn to build its work with the Federation Council and the State Duma on a new basis. We need to develop close and business-like interaction. There should be no confrontation because we have common interests." Commenting on the work of the Government, former first vice-prime minister Yegor Gaydar said that the faction of the Russia's Choice bloc is in "constructive opposition to the Government and will support any of its constructive initiatives." At the same time his faction plans to argue all decisions which it will consider wrong or dangerous for Russia. Gaydar voiced the hope that the work of the new Government will be successful and it will solve the existing problems. His colleague, deputy Gennadiy Burbulis believes that the present composition of the Government "has resources and the country has specialists to continue the course of reforms." As for the strategy of reform, he said it "is in jeopardy, although not in a fatal one." "The present government has more people knowledgeable about the economic mechanism which should be rebuilt," Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, said. He said the new cabinet is more capable and suits Russia better than the previous one. He believes the Government will have to "feel the manufacturers's interest to work more effectively" and should reconsider the tax, credit and some other of its policies. Yabloko leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy proposed his own programme of urgent measures to curb inflation and stop production decline. According to his "optimistic forecast," inflation may get out of control by the fall and surge to 50 per cent, while production decline will total 52 per cent of the 1989 level. The year 1989 was the last year to see production growth. Yavlinskiy said his faction is ready to form a government capable of carrying out the proposed programme within eight to nine months. Among top priority measures aimed at maintaining inflation at 20 per cent in 1994, the economist named the need to bring the dollar exchange rate in line with inflation dynamics. To this end, the "government should take the responsibility for the dynamics of the dollar exchange rate. This means the need to conclude today a futures deal to sell hard currency at a certain rate." Another important measure is a "radical change of the policy of privileges for exporters." It will aim at keeping hard currency reserves within the country, he said. "The present government will not make quick successes," Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the Yabloko bloc, said. Lukin believes that the cabinet should prioritise measures aimed at fighting crime in the country. "Without the struggle against the criminalisation of all spheres of life it will be impossible to build a normal market system," he added. Speaking about the composition of the new government, Lukin noted that Chernomyrdin can act as its leader because he has supported major reform initiatives of the previous governments. "There should be only one leader bearing responsibility for the adopted programme. This is vital for the success of the entire government," Lukin said. Georgiy Satarov, a top adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, believes that the course of reform should not be linked to individual members of the government. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, he recalled that "over the eight months of 1993 when the cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin worked without Yegor Gaydar there had been no considerable backtracking from the anti-inflationary policy." He warned against making "dramatic forecasts" and called for assessing the situation by the changes the Government makes in the reform programme. Economist Pavel Bunich, a member of the Russia's Choice bloc, said the formation of the new Government marks "the decline in the vector of economic reform." he described the current period as a period of temporary appeasement connected with the formation of the president-premier-Federal-Assembly-chairmen axis. When inflation begins soaring, attempts will resume to find a scapegoat. The parliament will blame the Government. The president will do the same. This may lead to a situation in which the cabinet may become incapable. At present, the situation in the Government will depend on the prime minister's behaviour, he concluded. Former finance minister Boris Fedorov who resigned this week said he will focus his work in the State Duma on lawmaking in order to push reform forward. He described as a "provocation" a publication in the British newspaper GUARDIAN which claimed that he had allegedly requested the U.S. ambassador to Russia to help him get a job in some influential international organisation. Fedorov told ITAR-TASS that he "has not been in the American Embassy for several months." Vladimir Shcherbakov has denied reports that he has been offered the post of finance minister to replace Fedorov. "I have not received an official offer," Shcherbakov, who heads the international fund supporting privatisation and foreign investments, said.
