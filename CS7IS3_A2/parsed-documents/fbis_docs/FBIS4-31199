On its front page, the supplement carries the following introductory statement by Dusan Kleiman, head of the HZDS Press and Information Section: "Esteemed readers. As of today, we are beginning to publish in the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA a regular HZDS supplement. In a situation when the attitude of the majority of the mass media toward the HZDS is more or less hostile, our possibilities of informing the public are limited. Our aim is to at least partly fill the gap this has created in the public. We want to brief you in some detail about developments within the HZDS and put across to you the HZDS positions on current developments in the sphere of politics, the economy, culture, the social sphere, and so forth. We hope to meet your expectations and to retain your favor." The first issue of the supplement includes articles, interviews, and commentaries expressing HZDS positions on various recent developments (the motion of no-confidence in Privatization Minister Janicina, the Presidential Office's rejection of an HZDS-initiated referendum, the departure of Deputy Marian Kelemen from the HZDS group in parliament, the bill on conflicts of interest, the dismissal of district-office chiefs following their criticism of President Kovac, and the government's talks on the provision of an IMF loan). Contributors include members of the "shadow cabinet," such as former Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik, former Justice Minister Katarina Tothova, and former Transport and Communications Minister Roman Hofbauer.
