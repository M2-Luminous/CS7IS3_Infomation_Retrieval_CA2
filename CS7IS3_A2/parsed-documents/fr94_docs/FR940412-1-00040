(iii) Upon disposal by sale, retirement, abandonment, dismantling, or otherwise, of equipment depreciated on a group basis, the Association shall credit the account in which the property or equipment is carried, and charge the related depreciation reserve with the original cost thereof, less any salvage realized, regardless of the age of the item. No gain or loss is recognized on the retirement of individual items of property or equipment depreciated on a group basis. (iv) When property or equipment owned by the Association is applied as part payment of the purchase price of new property or equipment, the new property or equipment shall be recorded at its full purchase price, provided an excessive allowance is not made for assets traded-in, in lieu of price adjustments or discounts on the purchase price of assets acquired. The difference between the depreciated cost of assets applied as payment and the amount allowed therefor shall be treated as retirement gain or loss. (v) The Association shall maintain property and equipment records setting forth the description of all property and equipment recorded in balance sheet classification 12000&hyph;13000, Property and Equipment. With respect to each unit or group of property or equipment, the record shall show the description, location, date of acquisition, the original cost, the cost of additions and betterments, the cost of parts retired, rates of depreciation, residual values not subject to depreciation, and the date of retirement or other disposition. (d) Property and equipment depreciation and maintenance reserves. (1) Each Association shall include in this balance sheet classification the accumulation of all provisions for losses occurring in property or equipment from use and obsolescence. For example, it shall include accumulated depreciation established to record current and cumulative cost expiration of assets being depreciated due to wear and tear from use and the action of time and the elements which are not replaced by current repairs; as well as losses in capacity for use or service occasioned by obsolescence, supersession, discoveries, change in popular demand, or the requirement of public authority. Residual values and rates for accrual of depreciation and maintenance shall be calculated using the straight-line depreciation method. (2) Depreciation shall be calculated from the date on which a building, structure or unit of property is placed in service, and shall cease on the date such property is disposed of by sale, retirement, abandonment, or dismantling, or when the difference between the cost and residual value shall have been charged to expense. (3) Land owned or held in perpetuity; expenditures on uncompleted units of property and equipment during construction or manufacture; and items classified as current assets are not subject to depreciation. (e) Other assets. (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debit balances in general clearing accounts, including charges held in suspense pending receipt of information necessary for final disposition, prepayments chargeable against operations over a period of years, capitalized expenditures of an organizational or developmental character, property acquisition adjustments, and the cost of patents, copyrights, and miscellaneous intangibles. (2) Deferred charges having a definite time incidence shall be amortized over the periods to which they apply. (f) Current liabilities. (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debts or obligations for which liquidation or payment is reasonably expected to require the use, within one year, of existing resources of a type which are properly classifiable as current assets, or the creation of other current liabilities. Current liabilities shall include payables incurred in the acquisition of materials, collections received in advance of performance of services, debts accruing from expenses incurred from operations, and other liabilities that are regularly and ordinarily subject to current liquidation.
