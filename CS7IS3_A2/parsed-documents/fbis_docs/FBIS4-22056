In order to do so, he was to have gained access to large shipments of beef to be exported to Israel in order to poison them with a powerful toxic substance. This warning was sounded by the Israeli intelligence service soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police that Ahmed Al Mekdav, a fundamentalist Shi'ite, had arrived in our country a month ago. Police Superintendent Enrique De Jesus Martinetti, the director of the National Police Intelligence Department, confirmed this and pointed out that the information was provided by the Israeli secret service. The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export meat to Israel, find a way to get access to the product to be exported to Israel, and then poison it with a deadly toxic substance. The consequences would have been devastating. The objective was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their country. The name of the meat-packing plants are: "Frigobeef," located in Capitan Lombardo very close to Artigas, and "San Antonio" in the city of the same name. Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing plants and warned their managers to take the necessary precautions by not allowing strangers on their premises so as to thwart any sabotage attempts. Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private, and not government-owned, Israeli meat-packing plant. He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and now are conducting an inquiry. We have been informed that this Shi'ite, Imadal Mekdav [name as published], intended to poison a large shipment of beef that was going to be exported to Israel. We have seemingly aborted this attempt with the help of the Israelis. Mekdav has been spotted already in Lebanon." [passage omitted]
