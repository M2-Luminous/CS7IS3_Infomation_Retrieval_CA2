Peter Kessler, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said 25,000 civilians had taken refuge in the eastern Bosnian town since the Serb offensive on the Moslem enclave began March 29. Speaking in French, Kessler said: "Gorazde is submerged with refugees and there is not a single free square metre of space in both public and private buildings in the town." Most of the refugees had arrived since Friday, when the Serb offensive intensified, he said. Both Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government media reported that the battle for the enclave -- a UN-declared "safe area" -- was continuing Sunday, hours after NATO came within seconds of launching an air strike there when one of its planes was downed by missile fire. Meanwhile in Geneva, the Red Cross announced an emergency plan to ferry in fresh aid teams to ease the humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave. The town, which had a population of 37,000 prior to the Bosnian war, was now crammed full with more than 60,000 people, while Moslem villages outside the city walls had been left deserted in the face of the Serb advance, Kessler said. Kessler added that Serb "snipers" had now started firing at key locations, including the town's hospital, from frontline positions no more than a few hundred metres (yards) from the town centre. The snipers were targeting the wounded inside their hospital beds Saturday, Kessler said, adding that a doctor was injured the same day by a Serb shell which landed around 15 metres from the hospital. According to figures released Friday, more than 240 people have died and around 1,100 been wounded during the Serb offensive. Kessler said Sunday midday that "these figures have increased greatly since then." The four-member UNHCR team in the town has taken refuge in a bank strongroom and can only venture out after nightfall as Serb snipers have Gorazde in their sights throughout the day. The "dramatic humanitarian situation" in Gorazde prompted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva to launch an immediate "action plan" on behalf of the enclave. ICRC teams in Belgrade, Pale and Sarajevo "are ready to go immediately to Gorazde to bring help to the numerous victims" of the shelling, the organisation said in a statement issued overnight Saturday. The back-up teams could leave as soon as the necessary authorisation had been gained, the statement said. It added that the ICRC was seeking guarantees from the warring parties that they would "respect the civilian population" and give unrestricted access to aid teams treating prisoners and evacuating the wounded, and to road convoys bringing in emergency supplies. The ICRC currently has a 12-member team in Gorazde. [passage omitted]
