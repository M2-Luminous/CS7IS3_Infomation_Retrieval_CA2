FR940926-0-00060 FR940926-0-00011 Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Listing can encourage and result in conservation actions by Federal, State, private organizations, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species. The requirements for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. A population of Asplenium fragile var. insulare is located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Laws relating to national parks prohibit damage or removal of any plants growing in the parks. Another population of Asplenium fragile var. insulare is located within the Pohakuloa Training Area. The Army is aware of the location of this taxon, and any Federal activities that may affect the continued existence of these plants will be addressed through the section 7 consultation process. Ctenitis squamigera, Diplazium molokaiense, and Pteris lidgatei are found on Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. These plants are not located inside impact or buffer zones for ordnance training. There are no other known Federal activities that occur within the present known habitat of these four plant taxa. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered species set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the four fern taxa listed as endangered, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered plant species; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few permits would ever be sought or issued because the taxa are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
