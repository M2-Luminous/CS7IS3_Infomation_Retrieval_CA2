Poland, which in 1993 was the only country in the whole of East Europe to achieve growth, of about four percent, should continue to recover. Its gross domestic product (GDP) should grow by 4.5 percent in 1994. This performance should be followed by that of the Czech Republic with growth of two percent and of Slovenia with one percent. However, experts have calculated that in Poland, despite the growth, GDP at the end of 1993 was 14 percent below the figure for 1989 which was the last year of state-direction of the economy before the collapse of communism in East Europe. Czech GDP was 25 percent below the figure in 1989. Hungary, the favoured country for Western investment, would again experience zero growth this year, but Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria would go through their fifth consecutive year of a decline in GDP of about two percent. But this would represent a sharp improvement from a decline of about six percent in 1993. The institute here was less optimistic about former members of the Soviet Union, chief among them Russia and Ukraine. It said that GDP in Russia would decline by seven percent and in Ukaraine by 12 percent. In 1993 their GDP figures had fallen by 15 percent. Most of the countries in East Europe would also improve their performances on inflation. The Czech Republic might reduce its inflation rate from 21 percent to 11 percent, Poland from 39 percent to 28 percent, Slovenia from 30 percent to 20 percent and Slovakia from 23 percent to 18 percent. But in Hungary inflation would rise slightly from 24 percent to 25 percent. In the Balkans, it would fall to 55 percent in Bulgaria from 75 percent, and to 200 percent in Romania from 300 percent. The main indicator weighing on the outlook was unemployment. Privatisation, and increase in the number of bankruptcies and a strengthing of corporate financial discipline, would increase unemployment further despite a general improvement in the economic situation. Poland, leading the way to growth, would have an unemployment rate of 18 percent representing more than three million people, at the end of 1994. Bulgaria, Slovenia and Slovakia would have an average rate of about 18 percent. The rate of unemployment in Hungary and Romania was likely to stabilise at about 12 percent. The Czech Republic, owing to an ingenious system of early retirement and strong growth in the private sector, should achieve the best result with a rate of seven percent. Another worrying aspct of these economies was the trade deficit which appeared in 1993 and was likely to increase this year, the economists said. The institute said that it expected the overall deficit for the seven countries to total 7.2 billion dollars from 6.8 billion dollars in 1993. Hungary and Poland, which in 1992 had achieved spectacular surpluses, would be the most affected. Hungary was likely to report a deficit of 2.7 billion dollars and Poland of 1.9 billion dollars. Exports to industrialised countries were likely to increase slightly but imports would again rise strongly.
