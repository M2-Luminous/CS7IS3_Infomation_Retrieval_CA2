A responsible security source from the Interior Ministry stated that the incident took place in the town of Kafr al-Dawwar at 1430 when the two citizens were inspecting various pieces of metal. They found a strange metal object which looks like the armature of a car with a wire attached to it. Upon pulling the wire, the metal piece exploded. The salesman gathered the three similar-looking pieces and threw them into the water canal. Security men retrieved and detonated them. The security source said it is clear that these metal objects are explosives marked with "45 military offensive." The metal pieces have been seized. A report has been prepared on the incident and the northern military region of Alexandria has been notified so an explosives expert can come down to take the necessary measures regarding the seized bombs.
