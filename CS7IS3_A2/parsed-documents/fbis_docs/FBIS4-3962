The council, by adopting this resolution, invited the secretary- general to take the steps necessary to ensure that Unprofor is able to monitor the situation in Gorazde, one of the six UN-designated "safe havens" in the republic. Condemning in the strongest terms the shelling and attacks by Bosnian Serb forces against Gorazde over the past two weeks, the council demanded the withdrawal of these forces and their weapons to a distance where they no longer constitute a threat to the safe area. The council also demanded the immediate release of all UN personnel currently held by the Bosnian Serb forces, as well as unimpeded freedom of movement for Unprofor in the fulfillment of its tasks. In order to bring together current diplomatic initiatives, the council called for the intensification of efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement, with coordination and close consultation between representatives of the United States and Russia and those of the United Nations and the European Union. The council warned that it "stands ready promptly to consider taking further measures as required."
