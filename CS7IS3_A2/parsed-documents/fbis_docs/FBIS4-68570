Our party considers that the deepening of relations of sincerity, friendship and all-round cooperation with neighboring Azerbaijan will strengthen Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and contribute to peace and stability in the region. A delegation of the Georgian National Independence Party headed by its chairman traveled officially to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, on the basis of an official invitation from the Azerbaijan National Independence Party on 15-18 January 1994. In the course of the visit, an Agreement on basic principles of cooperation between the Georgian and Azerbaijani National Independence Parties was signed. Based on these principles, our parties consider that from the point of view of mutual belief, friendship and cooperation between our peoples the preservation of citizenship rights for Azeris living in Georgian territory and Georgians living in Azerbaijan's territory has paramount importance. Serious action is needed in this direction. Strong enemies of the Georgian people and Georgia's independence are trying to worsen and complicate relations between Georgians and Azeris by all means. They are even trying to start ethnic military conflicts. May God protect us from this! It is necessary to implement a series of measures to rectify completely the citizenship rights of Azeris who are Georgian citizens. From this point of view: a) to strengthen to the maximum the fight by law enforcement organs and strong administrations against all criminal activity on the territory of Gardaban, Marneul, Volnis, Tetriskaroy, Sagarchevo and Lagodekh Rayons, and to reduce the probability of creating personal conflicts between Azeris and Georgians; b) to assure the active participation of Azeris along with Georgians in local government and administrative structures, the procuracy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the security organs on the territory of these rayons; c) to include both Georgian and Azeri citizens in the ranks of the armed forces of the Georgian Republic; d) to broaden cooperation between government organs of the Georgian and Azerbaijan Republics in the sectors of defending the independence and territorial integrity of our states, to guarantee the inviolability of existing borders, to strengthen national security, stability and democracy, to give guarantees on human rights and the rights of national minorities, and to conduct a struggle against terrorism, narcobusiness and banditry. By giving to greatest importance to friendly and neighborly relation between Georgia and Azerbaijan, we hope representatives of higher government organs will approach this declaration with attention. [Signed] I. Sereteli, chairman, in the name of the Georgian National Independence Party, 22 January 1994. The declaration was submitted to E. Shevardnadze, head of state of the Georgian Republic, J. Yoseliani, chairman of the Temporary Committee on the Special Situation, I. Georgadze, Minister of Security, G. Karkarashvili, Minister of Defense, Sh. Kviraya, Minister of Internal Affairs, and J.
