For this reason, this reporter interviewed Minister of Personnel Song Defu, asking him to talk about the work in, and the idea behind, expediting reform of the personnel system. Song Defu gave a briefing on the situation and said that, according to the needs of the socialist market economic system, the general idea behind the future reform of the personnel system in our country is: Increase the weight of the reform, quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel management system which corresponds to the socialist market economic system. That is to say, establish a good personnel system for managing different types of establishments, a scientific and reasonable system to distribute wages, a multifold social insurance system, a macropersonnel management system, a system of personnel markets, and a system of personnel regulations. Building and implementing a public service system is the key point in this year's reform of the personnel system. Song Defu said that in 1994 we must create a good beginning for implementing the public service system. This year also, on the foundation of the reform of government organs, various departments under the State Council and a majority of provincial government departments and the government departments of the separately listed cities, we must establish a rudimentary shape for the public service system and change the current personnel into public servants. Whether units carry out reform of organs or not, when they hire nonleading personnel below the rank of a presiding member of an administrative section, they must hold open examinations, judge qualifications strictly, and hire the best candidates. Based on the: Needs of the market economy; nature, functions, duties, and characteristics of the institutions; and on the law of personnel growth, the reform of the personnel system in institutions must follow the road of "cutting links, dividing types, delegating power, and invigoration." Based on the need to build a modern enterprise system, we must expedite reform of the personnel system in enterprises and develop steps to cancel the barriers between cadres and workers, between cadres under different ownership systems, and between cadres under different operational patterns within enterprises, to form employment mechanisms wherein personnel can go up and down and in and out, wherein choices are bilateral, and wherein personnel flow in a rational manner. We must also develop and groom a contingent of high quality and professional entrepreneurs. Building a sound, scientific, and rational wages system is an issue which attracts the people's attention. Song Defu pointed out that we must further implement the principles of distribution according to labor, giving priority to efficiency and giving consideration to fairness. We must also introduce competitive and stimulating mechanisms, break egalitarianism, reasonably widen the gap, and establish corresponding wages systems and normal wage growth mechanisms based on the inherent characteristics of various government organs and institutions. The CPC Central Committee and State Council are paying a great deal of attention to this reform of the wages system and, under the condition that the state has a relatively difficult financial situation, they have done a great deal of work to increase wages and considered as much as possible the interests of the various quarters, enabling the new wages system to enter its track and operate. Because there are many contradictions which have been accumulated during distribution of wages, they cannot be solved by a single reform and the key is to enable it to get onto the track first and then gradually perfect it. Building a social insurance system for government organs and institutions is a rather difficult issue. When talking about this, Song Defu said that because the funds in organs, institutions, and enterprises are from different sources, the ways of managing these funds are also different. Generally speaking, when raising and using the funds, we must uphold the principles of combining rights, obligations, and the compulsory nature; of sharing by the state, units, and individuals; and of social security administration being separate from social insurance funds operations. We must actively carry out experiments, implement the easier ones first, and reach targets step by step. We must first establish a system of overall planning for pension funds for contract workers in organs and institutions and the old-age insurance system in institutions should first be built in institutions which operate on their own incomes and expenditures. At the same time, work must be done to build a social insurance system for government organs, especially for state public servants, while the work in building an insurance system for the unemployed and disabled must also be stepped up. The building of a socialist market economic system has increased the demand for capable personnel in society, so there is an urgent need to build a sound personnel market system. Song Defu said that building a personnel market system means "five changes." That is, the change from idle personnel and personnel shortages to market exchange, to regulation between too much and too few personnel, and to rational distribution; the change from ownership of personnel by units and organs to ownership of personnel by society, to meeting each other's needs, and to rational flow; the change from unilateral choices to bilateral choices in the flow of personnel; the change from "country markets" to "fixed markets" in the flow of personnel; and the change from the personnel resources distribution model characterized by "monopoly of supply and distribution," to the one wherein the personnel market plays a basic functional role in personnel resources distribution under the state's macromanagement. We must gradually establish sound regulations for personnel market operations and form a personnel market which is flexible, open, efficient, orderly, and characterized by fair competition; we must establish systems in areas such as personnel flow, arbitration, and contracts, to protect the legitimate rights of the units hiring personnel as well as those of the individuals, to guide the flow of personnel, and to control the volume and speed of flow, so that the personnel market operates in an orderly manner and within the limits of the law. We must also struggle to build, before 2000, a nationwide personnel market system which can perform a complete set of functions, has sound mechanisms, is supported by a legal system, and which can provide timely guidance and good services. On the issue of establishing a system of sound personnel regulations, Song Defu said that 1994 will be a year of legislation for personnel work and that we must formulate, as soon as possible, regulations supporting the public service system, such as the: "Procedures for Carrying Out Classification of Positions of State Public Servants"; "Provisional Regulations on Employing State Public Servants"; and the "Provisional Regulations on Examinations for State Public Servants." We must try to formulate temporary regulations on awards, training, promotion and demotion, and on appointment or dismissal. We must speed up the work in formulating regulations governing personnel markets and regulations on arbitration of disputes in the areas of personnel market management and personnel flow. In the area of personnel regulations for enterprises and institutions, we must formulate, as soon as possible, the "Regulations on Personnel Management for State-Owned Enterprises," the "Regulations on Personnel Management for Joint-Venture Enterprises," and regulations on the old-age insurance system and wages in institutions. Song Defu said that building a market economic system has brought many new problems to personnel work, requiring personnel workers to seriously learn from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; seriously study the laws of market economy; adhere to the reform direction; and, when developing our excellent traditions, change the way of thinking which we have inherited from the planned economy, cast off the trammels of the old concepts which are not in accordance with the actual conditions of contemporary China, resolutely use the reform way of thinking to study the new situation, and use the reform method to solve new problems.
