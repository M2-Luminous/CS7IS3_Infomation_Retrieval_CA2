This has been disclosed by a top Foreign Ministry official. During his telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has asked that the United States urge North Korea to resume the stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks when it holds high-level talks with that country and instructed Foreign Ministry officials to begin preparations for the talks with North Korean officials. Both the United States and North Korea are expected to resume the stalled third round of high-level talks early next month and North and South Korea are moving toward holding an inter-Korean summit meeting. In this way, moves are afoot to "resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue." These moves have made the government feel the need for Japan to hold a dialogue with North Korea. The Japan-DPRK normalization talks have been stalled since last November. The top Foreign Ministry official has pointed out that the "issue of Yi Un-hae" [a Japanese woman allegedly abducted to North Korea] -- who allegedly educated Kim Hyun-hi, who was sentenced to death for blowing up a Korean airliner -- and the issue of verifying North Korea's past nuclear development would stand in the way of resuming the stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks.
