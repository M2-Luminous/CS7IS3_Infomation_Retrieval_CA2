FBIS4-33242 "drlat107__a94002" FBIS-LAT-94-107-A Daily Report 28 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil State Enterprise Irregularities Investigated State Enterprise Irregularities Investigated PY0206183294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 28 May 94 p 10 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY0206183294 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Editorial: "Ungovernable Fiefs"] [Text] If anyone had any doubts that state enterprises have become ungovernable states within the Brazilian state, those doubts were dissipated by the appalling disclosure that the directors and administrative councils of 17 state enterprises linked to the Transport Ministry converted their salaries to the URV [Real Value Unit] when it peaked in April, thus violating the provisional measure that had set the conversion at an average value. Vexed by the violation of the provisional measure by organizations within the government itself, President Itamar Franco ordered the immediate dismissal of the administrative and human resources directors and the members of the administrative councils of these state enterprises. The directors directly involved with jobs and salaries, who have the responsibility of defining salaries in the enterprises considered rebels, have been dismissed until all the irregularities and the directors' responsibility have been investigated and in order to prevent a beheading of management within the enterprises. At the same time, the government has ordered that a clean sweep be made in state enterprises and the public administration to see whether the conversion of salaries to the URV was made with the average of the months of December, January, February, and March as outlined in the provisional measure, or whether the conversion was made at the peak with the last salary in March and in real cruzeiros. Moreover, this will not be the last clash between state enterprises and the presidency. A nationalist due to his political breeding and a historic defender of state enterprises in Brazil's development, Franco has been disenchanted several times with the conduct of those enterprises' employees: "The state enterprises belong to the Brazilian people, not just a half a dozen people," he blurted out at the beginning of last year, when he demanded clear- cut accounting by Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Last year, when the Planning Ministry asked state enterprises to submit the roster containing the salaries paid to employees and the benefits they receive, only a small number of the 150 enterprises, foundations, and autonomous companies controlled by the Treasury promptly complied with the request. More than two months passed until the list was complete, with the corresponding wear and tear for authorities. Because it is the country's largest state enterprise, because it has a complex accounting system, and because in addition to it own activities it acts as the cashier for Alcohol Production Program, Petrobras has been in the center of the tug of war between the government and the state enterprises. And by 27 May, the special commission named by the government to audit Petrobras' accounts had not been able to comply with the commitment of submitting a complete report on the enterprise's situation to Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko. More than the lack of official confidence in the Treasury's control, which generated an immediate corporate reaction by Petrobras' employees, the government always favored the enterprise because it always wanted to assess the weight of the taxes on the final price of fuels in order to help the consumer's pocket and eventually to free Petrobras from the weight of that unjust tax onus. The lack of submitting clear-cut accounts has boomeranged against the enterprises. Public enterprises should never be afraid of the public.
