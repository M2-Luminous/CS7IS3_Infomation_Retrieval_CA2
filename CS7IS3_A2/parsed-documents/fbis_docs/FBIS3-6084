FBIS3-6084 "dreas050__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-050-A Document Type:Daily Report 15 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo, U.S. View Phone Accord Interpretation OW1503083994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 15 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1503083994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Mar Morning Edition] [Text] Between the Japanese and U.S. Governments there are now emerging subtle differences of views on interpretation of the agreement on opening up of the cellular phones (portable and automobile phones) market, and this can be a new seed of trouble in the Japan-U.S. friction. The U.S. Government talks loudly about "achievements," insisting that "the Japanese Government has given a de facto guarantee on the use of U.S. company-made cellular phones," and ignoring the Japanese Government's refutation that "we have not given a guarantee." The United States indeed is poised to press for adoption of a similar framework of agreement in the Japan-U.S. framework talks. The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular phones is that the Japanese Government has agreed to help Japan Ido Corporation fulfill its pledges to U.S. Motorola Company, including the establishment of 159 ground stations, using "all available measures." The seed of trouble is the difference between Japan and the United States over the interpretation of this expression -- "all available measures." It looks clear that the Japanese Government wants to avoid giving much meaning to the expression, and Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito insists, "All this means is to do something like conducting, on a regular basis, checks on degree of progress being made in dealings between the private companies." But on the U.S. side, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor openly praised the accord as "the first step in result-oriented agreements." It is apparent that the U.S. Government interprets the accord as "containing in effect the government guarantee" regarding progress made in market access. In fact, there was a fierce tug of war on this expression. One of the officials who took part in negotiations said, "In Japan's original draft, a limited expression of 'measures within the scope of law' was used." But at the strong resistance of the United States, Japan was forced to swallow the expression "all available measures." This shows how the United States was determined to get its way whether the other party wanted it or not. Some ranking government officials are concerned about the United States' firm attitude lest "the automobiles and auto parts, which is one of the three priority areas in the economic consultations, should become the next target. Private auto manufacturers are now moving toward presenting "voluntary targets to purchase U.S.-made products," but the officials are concerned lest the U.S. Government should ask the Japanese Government to provide de facto guarantee on their performance as done in the recent agreement on cellular phones. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is already alarmed, insisting, "This area is different from the telecommunications. The government issues few permits and licenses in this area, hence has little room to interfere." But in the framework talks, confrontation between two nations continues -- as the United States wants to have certain future targets set as "objective criteria," while Japan stands by the position it will not accept anything other than a yardstick to measure the degree of the past market access. As such, there is the possibility that the method the U.S. Government used in the negotiations this time will become a "bridgehead," based on which the United States will push for Japan's compromise. The next move by the United States can be one which will put Japan into real anguish.
