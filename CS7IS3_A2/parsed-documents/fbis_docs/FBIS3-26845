Although it has only been 15 years, it is 15 years of earthshaking changes. Though the Chinese are world famous for their cuisine, Chinese peasants had not been able to stuff themselves with food until the last dozen of years or so during which the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output was practiced. Here are two peasant "food lists": one for 1978, in which Chinese peasants' per capita consumption of grain was 247.8 kg, vegetables -- 141.5 kg, meat -- 5.75 kg, eggs -- 0.79 kg, and fish and prawns -- 0.84 kg; the other for 1992, in which per capita consumption of grain, vegetable, meat, egg, fish and prawn were 250 kg, 129 kg, 11.83 kg, 2.85 kg, and 2.25 kg, respectively. This has fully shown the improvement in peasants' diet structure. In terms of calorie and protein criteria, which are a common practice in the world, the amount of energy taken in by Chinese peasants has risen above the average for developing countries and is close to the 2,630-kilocalorie [da ka 1129 0595] mark of the world average. However, their quantity of energy and protein taken from animal food is equal to those of the world's low-income countries. This means that their diet structure still awaits further improvement. We cannot ignore drinking water when talking about food. In 1980, 500 million people in the nation's rural areas were drinking water not meeting hygienic standards; among which, 150 million people drank contaminated ground water, 60 million of them drank bitter and salt water, and 45 million of them drank water containing high levels of fluorine. Fifteen years after the inception of reform and opening up, the state, collectives, and individuals have worked together and invested an accumulation of 13.3 billion yuan (over 70 percent from peasants) to build 330,000 waterworks around the country, and one-third of the peasants now have access to tap water. Despite the fact that millions of people in old liberated, minority, border, and poor areas still need donated clothing from other areas to pass the winter, an overwhelming majority of peasants have resolved the clothing problem once and for all and are beginning to set higher standards for their dress. Presently, over 98 percent of peasants buy their clothes from markets. Those hand-woven cloths and hand-made printed calicos of peasants, which used to be their articles of daily use, have turned into valuable handicrafts because of their scarcity and are found in stores. With large and medium-sized cities as the centers, urban residents' ideas about buying clothes are beginning to spread to rural areas. A peasant in a Western suit is no longer something new; the clothing and temperaments of those middle-age and young peasants, who spend a long time at work and in business, are no difference from those of urban citizens. If we term the dress of peasants in villages of Guangdong, Shanghai, and Beijing as a "suburban effect," the life of Tibetans in the grasslands in western Sichuan should be more convincing. On this great grassland, young Tibetans who become prosperous from running businesses turn their fortunes into clothes and ornaments they wear according to ethnic customs; it is nothing new for young girls and boys to wear clothes or ornaments worth over 10,000 yuan. Speaking about the things they use, peasants' "dreams" were limited before 1978 -- nothing but watches, bicycles, sewing machines, and radios, or the so-called "three things that turn and one thing that makes noise." Not many of them could turn their dreams into reality then. Now that the "three things that turn and one thing that makes noise" are within reach, they are now called the "four old objects." Presently, every peasant household has more than two watches or clocks and more than one bicycle, whereas every two households have one sewing machine and one radio around the country on average. At the moment, the "seven new objects" have come into vogue in rural areas; they are: televisions, electric fans, videocassette recorders, refrigerators, washing machines, cameras, and motorcycles. Over 60 percent of peasant households around the country own televisions and electric fans; over 20 percent of them have videocassette recorders, whereas motorcycles, refrigerators, washing machines, and cameras are becoming prevalent in villages in economically developed areas. As living standards are rising as a whole, peasants are more and more willing to spend their money on cultural activities. Acquiring literacy and scientific knowledge are becoming conscious pursuits for peasants. In 1983, there was the news that a peasant in Beijing's suburbs bought a piano. In 1984, 50 peasants in Hebei organized a tour to Japan at their own expense. This year, a resort for peasants appeared in Guangdong and some peasants used their money to buy automobiles, renovate airports, and run postal agencies. Every piece of such news is exciting. The peasants' world is becoming wider and their lives richer.
