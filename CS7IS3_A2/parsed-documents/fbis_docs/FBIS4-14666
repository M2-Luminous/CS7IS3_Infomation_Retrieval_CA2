Here we have a different type of problem: How to overcome the region's energy crisis. This was the purpose of the recent conference in Khabarovsk which discussed the problems of using small-capacity nuclear power plants in the Far East, the Far North, and the Baykal regions. We have been discussing the development of nuclear energy in the Far East region for a long time. The energy crisis in the territory forces us to return to this subject. It has been a pressing problem for a quite some time, but because of financial difficulties today, it has become even more complicated. If we assess the situation using Khabarovsk Kray as an example, it is enough to cite two factors to be convinced of the extreme complexity that exists in the energy situation. The supply of gas from Sakhalin has been reduced twofold. Our own local coal supply provides less than 4 percent of the requirement, and the rest of the coal is brought in. We are critically short of the money needed to buy the coal. [video shows meeting in session, then cuts to show V.M. Malich, chief of a department of the Vostok-Energo organization, addressing the meeting] [Begin Malich recording] It is necessary to point out that there have been no new power-generating capabilities introduced in the Far East since 1990. Many of you in the hall here know that from 1980 to 1985, we commissioned a little less than 1,800 megawatts of power. Between 1985 and 1990 it was even less, 800 megawatts, and since 1990, nothing. That is, currently we are not commissioning anything, not even power-generating capabilities which could and should cover the capacities that are being lost. [end recording; video shows participants in the meeting] The power engineers see the solution in the completion of the TET [heat and electric power plant], the GES [state electric power plant], and the GRES [state regional electric power plant] projects already begun -- of which there are quite a few in the region -- and in the building of small-capacity nuclear power plants. [video cuts to show V.T. Lebedenko, general director of the combined board of Far East nuclear power plants] [Begin Lebedenko recording] Nuclear power generation began to develop in the form of draft projects after the government adopted decrees on measures to provide the regions with fuel and energy resources. As you might recall, the first project was for a Far East nuclear power plant, the technical and economic substantiation plant, for which was completed and handed over for checking by the experts. This year we are faced with deciding whether or not this plant is to go into operation. This is precisely where Vyacheslav Mikhaylovich [not further identified; possibly V.M. Malich] and I have a divergence of views, although I will not be adamant. [end recording; video shows meeting, a wall map entitled "Electric Power -- Far East Economic Region and the Baykal Region"] Power engineers favoring traditional fuels and those favoring nuclear power have agreed on one thing: Both were satisfied with the alternative of building small-capacity nuclear power plants in the Far East, the Far North, and the Baykal regions.
