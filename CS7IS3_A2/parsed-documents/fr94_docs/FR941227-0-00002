FR941227-0-00002 FR941227-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 300 RIN 3206&hyph;AF80 Employment (General) AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is amending its regulations to reflect that agency heads must ensure that employees and applicants for employment at their agencies are notified of the provisions in the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, which prohibit individuals from requesting, making, transmitting, accepting, or considering political recommendations in effecting personnel actions. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 26, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jo-Ann Chabot, (202) 606&hyph;1700. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8 of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;94, amended section 3303 of title 5, United States Code, to expand and strengthen the prohibition against political recommendations in examinations and appointments. Although section 3303 was limited to prohibiting political recommendations in connection with examinations for, or appointments to, positions in the competitive service, the amended section 3303 includes other personnel actions as well. It defines ``personnel action'' as any action described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)&hyph;(ix), including appointments, promotions, disciplinary or corrective actions, details, transfers, reassignments, reinstatements, restorations, reemployments, performance evaluations, and decisions concerning pay, benefits, or awards. The amended section 3303 provides for OPM to issue regulations requiring agency heads to ensure that employees and applicants are notified of its provisions. On February 22, 1994, OPM issued its proposal to amend 5 CFR part 300 by adding a new subpart H which would require agency heads to ensure that applicants and employees are notified of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. OPM's proposal also listed strategies for issuing notifications, but noted that the list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider and implement other means of notification. OPM received comments from three Federal agencies and one Federal employee organization about the proposed regulations. One Federal agency commented that placing additional administrative requirements on Federal agencies appears to be inconsistent with the intent of the National Performance Review recommendations to streamline the Federal government and reduce funding, spending, and reporting requirements. The agency suggested that OPM explore other alternatives for complying with the Reform Amendments, such as issuing instructions to agencies to disregard political recommendations received incident to personnel actions and to notify the alleged offenders accordingly. The amended 5 U.S.C. 3303 provides that ``[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, the head of each agency shall ensure that employees and applicants are given notice of the provisions of this section.'' Section 3303, as amended, clearly contemplates that OPM shall issue the specified regulations; it does not give OPM any discretion to select an alternate method of requiring agency heads to notify employees and applicants of the prohibition against soliciting, making, receiving, or accepting political recommendations. Therefore, OPM cannot adopt the suggestion to explore other alternatives for complying with the regulatory mandate in 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. Moreover, OPM's regulations are consistent with the spirit and intent of the National Performance Review recommendations. In recognition of these recommendations, OPM has left to each agency head the discretion to select the methods of notification which most suit the needs of his or her own agency. Subsection (h) of the amended section 3303 specifically provides that the prohibition recommendations does not affect the right of an employee under 5 U.S.C. 7211 to petition Congress. A second Federal agency suggested that OPM provide examples in its regulations to show what would be included or excluded under the statutory right to petition Congress. OPM has already provided agencies with written guidance on the amended section 3303, and will provide further guidance should the need arise. Therefore, OPM believes it is not necessary to include such examples in its regulations. The third Federal agency suggested that OPM note in its regulations that subsection (f)(2) of the amended section 3303 permits recommendations which are based solely on the character of an employee or applicant. OPM does not believe that it is necessary to include this provision in its regulations because the provision already is stated in the controlling statute. The agency further suggested that, in section 300.801 of the regulation, OPM replace the word ``effecting'' with ``affecting.'' OPM intended that ยง300.801 would relate to ``effecting'' or bringing about personnel actions, rather than to ``affecting'' or influencing such actions. Therefore, OPM does not intend to revise the proposed ยง300.801 in the manner suggested. Finally, one Federal employee organization commented that OPM's regulatory proposal is fully supported by the applicable provisions of law.
