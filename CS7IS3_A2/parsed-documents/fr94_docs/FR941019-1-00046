ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations relating to gasohol blending and the taxes on diesel fuel and compressed natural gas. This document also proposes to remove obsolete excise tax regulations. The proposed regulations reflect and implement certain changes made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Energy Act) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the 1993 Act). The proposed regulations relating to gasoline and diesel fuel affect certain blenders, enterers, industrial users, refiners, terminal operators, and throughputters. The proposed regulations relating to compressed natural gas affect persons that sell or buy compressed natural gas for use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat. DATES: Written comments must be submitted by December 19, 1994. Outlines of comments to be presented at the public hearing scheduled for January 11, 1995, must be received by December 21, 1994.

The likely respondents are businesses and other for-profit organizations, including small businesses and organizations. Estimated total annual reporting burden: 10 hours. Estimated average annual burden per respondent: .1 hour. Estimated number of respondents: 100 Estimated annual frequency of responses: On occasion. Explanation of Provisions Background Effective January 1, 1994, the 1993 Act amends section 4081 to impose the diesel fuel tax in the same manner as the gasoline tax. Thus, tax is imposed on (1) the removal of gasoline and diesel fuel (collectively taxable fuel) from any refinery, (2) the removal of taxable fuel from any terminal, (3) the entry of taxable fuel into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing, and (4) the sale of taxable fuel to an unregistered person unless there was a prior taxable removal, entry, or sale of the taxable fuel. However, tax does not apply to any entry or removal of taxable fuel transferred in bulk to a refinery or terminal if the persons involved (including the terminal operator) are registered by the IRS. Conforming Amendments to Gasoline Regulations On November 30, 1993, the IRS published in the Federal Register (58 FR 63069) temporary regulations under section 4081 relating to the imposition of the diesel fuel excise tax for diesel fuel that is removed at a terminal rack, removed from a refinery, entered into the United States, or blended outside of the bulk/transfer terminal system. Those rules are similar to the rules relating to the removal, entry, or blending of gasoline under §§48.4081&hyph;2 and 48.4081&hyph;3. These proposed regulations generally consolidate the rules relating to gasoline and diesel fuel into a single set of rules applicable to all taxable fuel. Compressed Natural Gas Effective October 1, 1993, section 4041(a)(3) (added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 13241(e) of the 1993 Act) imposes a tax on compressed natural gas (CNG) that is sold for use or used as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat. The proposed regulations provide rules relating to the imposition of, and liability for, the tax on CNG. These rules are similar to the regulations relating to taxes on special motor fuels imposed by section 4041. Gasohol; Tolerance Rule The gasoline tax rate is 18.4 cents per gallon (the regular rate). However, a reduction from the regular rate is allowed for gasohol (a gasoline/alcohol mixture). Before January 1, 1993, section 4081(c) treated a mixture of gasoline and alcohol as gasohol only if at least 10 percent of the mixture was alcohol. The rate reduction under pre-1993 law was 5.4 cents per gallon for gasohol containing ethanol and 6 cents per gallon for gasohol containing alcohol other than ethanol. This was equivalent to a subsidy of 54 cents or 60 cents per gallon of alcohol used to produce gasohol. Section 48.4081&hyph;6(b)(2) provides a special rule for the application of the ``at least 10 percent'' requirement by allowing a tolerance for mixtures that contain less than 10 percent alcohol but at least 9.8 percent alcohol. Under the tolerance rule, a portion of the mixture equal to the number of gallons of alcohol in the mixture multiplied by 10 is considered to be gasohol. Any excess liquid in the mixture is taxed at the regular rate. Absent the tolerance rule, pre-1993 law would have taxed the entire mixture at the regular rate.
