The Russian Army's two years had been crammed full of events and novel tasks, the minister noted. "It has been a time for appreciating the enormous responsibility which has been laid upon the army," he said. "A majority of servicemen have displayed maturity and an understanding of their purpose and of the complex processes underway in society." "Whatever interpretation is put on the tragic events of October 1993, it is now clear that the military averted civil war in Russia," Pavel Grachev believes. According to the minister, "there are those who try to portray the army as weakened and bloodless and, in some cases, as a caricature of itself, in order to discredit it." "The reality is," in his opinion, "that the Armed Forces remain a reliable tool of the state and a guarantor of stability in society, in spite of the difficulties." Replying to journalists' questions, Pavel Grachev noted there are now three departments -- the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs and the Security Council -- working on a conception of a partnership between Russia and the countries of Europe. "The president has approved what we are doing," the defense minsiter stressed. "He set us this task a long time ago." The proposals of experts and academics will be looked at in the middle of May at a session of the Security Council and then revealed on 24 May in Brussels. In his opinion, the Partnership for Peace program is of a declaratory nature and is void of specific proposals for cooperation and interaction between the countries of Europe. Furthermore, the role of Russia -- "once again denied the capacity to have thoughts and make suggestions" -- has not been reflected in the program. [passage omitted]
