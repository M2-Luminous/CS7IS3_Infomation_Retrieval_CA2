They are UN peacekeepers from countries ready to contribute to the French intervention. AFP refers in particular to Senegal, Togo, and Congo. The UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] Command, quoted by AFP, specifies that the departure of these soldiers is not planned at the moment, but that they are nevertheless asked to be prepared for every eventuality. While waiting for the French resolution on intervention in Rwanda to be adopted by the United Nations, probably within the next 48 hours, France has already sent a small military detachment to eastern Zaire. Christophe Boisbouvier reports: [Boisbouvier] Paris has in fact confirmed that 15 or more French soldiers have arrived at the base of Goma, in eastern Zaire, very close to the border with Rwanda. It is a forward detachment and has the task of checking the runway before any wide-bodied aircraft land there. The wide-bodied aircraft could then make the shuttle trip between the operational platform of Bangui and the base at Goma. On the other hand Paris denies the report from our Belgian colleague LE SOIR stating that French soldiers have already crossed the border and are at Cyangugu, in the extreme southwest of Rwanda, to renovate a runway there. This is untrue, the French Defense Ministry states; we will not enter Rwanda until the United Nations has given the go-ahead. On the Zairean side, President Mobutu says he is ready to facilitate the task of this humanitarian force by lending the bases, but specifies that no Zairean troops will be involved. This is not appropriate under the current circumstances, he says. With regard to the Zairean opposition, Etienne Tshisekedi says he is fiercely opposed to this operation. He accuses France of attempting to put his old political rival, Mobutu Sese Seko, back in the saddle. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin was the guest of our colleagues at France Culture [radio station] this morning. He responded to the accusations and the opposition which, as we have seen, are increasing with regard to this French plan for intervention in Rwanda: [Begin Roussin recording] We are intervening because, in fact, what we see, what we hear, what we read is intolerable. It annoys me to hear France being constantly criticized and people pointing a finger at France. We are all involved in this business. The government takes the initiative and people still point the finger at it. What do you expect us to do? Leave things like that? Who is going to take France's place? Who is taking the initiative at the moment? Nobody. We are there, we are knocking at Europe's door and nobody answers. Nobody in Africa has mobilized or has stood up to protest against this genocide, even the neighboring countries, and now that we are taking the initiative -- well, people can be critical of the policy which we have carried out in Rwanda, but in any case we are now getting involved to help save lives and we are on our own. Even last night, if I heard the latest news correctly, it was not a big success at the United Nations. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Michel Roussin, speaking on France Culture this morning. The Cooperation Ministry has announced that a member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is in Paris today to meet French political officials. As we know, the RPF opposes French intervention, while on the government side this idea has met with a favorable response. This is what Martin Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge d'affaires in Paris, explained to Ghislaine Dupont: [Begin recording] [Bissaba] In view of the situation in Rwanda, which is truly catastrophic -- many people have died on both sides, in the area controlled by the government and in the area controlled by the RPF -- and also in view of the fact that the two sides have not been able to reach agreement on halting this real human tragedy which is shaking the whole world, well, I believe that the French initiative is welcome. [Dupont] Do you not think it would have been desirable for this protection force to be organized, made up, just of UN peacekeepers, in fact a beefed up UNAMIR force rather than a force which will apparently be made up mainly of French troops? [Bissaba] At the moment what we need is a force that can stop the Rwandan tragedy and, as you will know from following the deliberations at the UN, this is taking far too long. As you can see, with every minute that passes, more lives are being lost in Rwanda, so I believe that as an emergency measure this French initiative is really welcome, because if we had to wait for the UN procedures to come to an end I think we would have wasted a lot of time. [Dupont] France says that this humanitarian protection force will give aid to both sides, it will be impartial. Will the government forces allow Tutsi refugees who are still in areas controlled by them today to be evacuated? [Bissaba] I believe that the Rwandan government in any case has given an undertaking that the massacres may be halted in the areas it controls [as heard], it gave a firm promise to this effect in Tunis, and I believe, and furthermore according to the information in my possession, the situation is gradually calming down, so I do not see why the Rwandan government would refuse to allow the intervention forces to reach the Tutsis. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Martin Auko Bissaba, Rwandan charge d'affaires in Paris.
