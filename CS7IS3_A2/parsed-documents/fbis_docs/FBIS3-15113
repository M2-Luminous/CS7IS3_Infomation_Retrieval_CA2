It is planned to split the FCS and to subordinate the splinters to various ministries. For instance, the main service -- the Administration of Counterintelligence Operations -- will be renamed the Federal Administration of Investigations and subordinated to the Justice Ministry. The Military Counterintelligence Service is to become part of the Defense Ministry General Staff as a main administration. The Economy Ministry will also acquire its own counterintelligence service. It will be the Economic Counterintelligence Administration. It is planned to strip military ranks from staffers of the new special services to be set up on the basis of the FCS (except for the military counterintelligence service). Instead, counterespionage system officers will have the following positions: agent, agent second class, special agent, and so forth. In the course of reform it is planned to cut down the FCS central staff so as to strengthen the special service's regional branches at its expense. It is even possible that the entire central staff of the former FCS may move from the capital to nearby areas of Moscow Oblast. The reorganization of the FCS will be completed within the next six months.
