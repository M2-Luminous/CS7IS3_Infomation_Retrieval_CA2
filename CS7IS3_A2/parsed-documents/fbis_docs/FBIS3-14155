There is a gap in the positions of the sides, and the discussions will continue today, he asserted. Replying to a question by our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus, Maj. Gen. Shahaq said the atmosphere in the talks was normal. He added that the operation against terrorists in Hebron yesterday had nothing to do with the ongoing talks with the PLO. It is a terrorist event, and we will fight terror wherever it is uncovered, he stated. Our correspondent has learned that the discussions are currently centered on the number of foreign observers to be deployed in Hebron, the size of the future police force, and who will command it. Israel opposes the Palestinian demand to set up a force of no less than 1,000 [as heard] troops. Our correspondent adds that Israel will apparently not object to having the international observers carry guns for self-defense.
