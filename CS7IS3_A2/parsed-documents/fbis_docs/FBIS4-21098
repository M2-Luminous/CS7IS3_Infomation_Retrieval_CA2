In the discussions, Peng Jianfei said that since the beginning of the 1980s, provoked and enticed by international drug dealing activities, foreign and domestic drug dealing elements have colluded to seek exorbitant profits and smuggled drugs across the border for transfer to the international market. All of the drug dealing cases that the Yunnan police have broken and all of the drugs that they have confiscated came from outside. So, the core of the Yunnan anti-drug struggle has been to strike at the cross-border drug dealing. In the early 1980s, much of what was confiscated in the Yunnan border regions was opium and it was mainly a small number of people living on the frontier who dealt drugs. In recent years, drug dealing activities have changed greatly and have tended to become large-scale and refined. In 1990 Yunnan police broke 2,143 drug dealing cases and confiscated 1,445 kilograms of heroin. In 1991 they broke 3,583 drug dealing cases, of which 2,717 were for selling and transporting heroin, and they confiscated 1,656 kilograms of heroin. In 1992 they broke 3,643 drug dealing cases and confiscated 4,075 kilograms of heroin. In 1993 they broke 4,174 drug dealing cases and confiscated 3,546 kilograms of heroin. In addition, armed drug dealing has clearly increased. In one respect, this shows that Yunnan Province's drug enforcement has been strengthened from year to year and more drugs have been confiscated each year. In another respect, it shows that infiltration of foreign drugs into Yunnan has increased rather than decreased. Although Yunnan police are understaffed and lack equipment, it can be said without qualms that they have been highly effective in their anti-drug struggle and have made a very great contribution to international society. Assistant Secretary of State Gelbard expressed admiration and appreciation for the efforts of the Yunnan police under difficult conditions and the success that they have achieved. The two sides also exchanged ideas on how they can further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the anti-drug area. Assistant secretary-general of the anti-drug committee and head of the drug enforcement office of the provincial public security department Chen Cunyi [7115 1317 0308] also participated in the talks. In the evening, Governor He Zhiqiang met and feted Assistant Secretary of State Gelbard and his party at a Kunming restaurant.
