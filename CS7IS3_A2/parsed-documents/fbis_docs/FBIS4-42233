When the Allies liberated Europe, the U.S. leadership role was as undisputed, as it was in the postwar era when the continent was being stabilized. Today, the voices that deplore the leadership vacuum of Washington as the only superpower left cannot only be heard in the U.S. Congress, but also in European capitals. In the past, the leading role played by the United States ensured the implementation of a security policy system that brought peace but led to the division of Europe. Meanwhile, the question is being asked more and more audibly of how U.S. interests should be defined, given the Clinton administration's declining global commitment and the reorganization of Europe. In the context of the offer made to the East European states of a Partnership for Peace, not only Russia's role in a pan-European peace order is at issue in the United States, but also Germany's position. The U.S. President, who during his trip to Europe will visit Rome, Paris, London, Oxford, and Cambridge, will undoubtedly feel more at ease in places where protest demonstrations against the Vietnam War during his university years took place than on the battlefield of the veterans. This holds all the more true since confidence in Clinton's foreign policy has increasingly declined following the failure in Somalia, the zigzag course in Bosnia and Haiti, his backing down on human rights in favor of trade interests in China, the refusal of India and other nuclear threshold countries to support the renewal of the expiring Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and the unsuccessful intervention against North Korea's nuclear policy. No more than 53 percent of Americans are still satisfied with his performance. Clinton continues to place his foreign policy stakes on the propagation of democracy, economic progress, and a security policy that is adjusted to reality. However, the primacy of active multilateralism at the UN level has already lost much of its weight. Despite a one-sided Russia policy, in the framework of which Washington has mobilized $4.1 billion for Moscow's reform programs, the White House has become increasingly aware that the relevant basic security and economic policy decisions for East Europe will in the future be made on the Bonn-Moscow axis to a much larger extent. The real test case for the United States' European policy is the unsolved Balkan conflict. It is true that Clinton agreed to case-by-case air raids at UN request, but he left no doubt about the fact that U.S. troops would not be sent to the war area. Even though the early recognition of Croatia by the European Union, which had been engineered by Germany, has met with considerable criticism, the U.S. Administration is seeing an encrusted position in the current situation, which will thwart every endeavor by Bonn to bring about a European balance in the Balkans. Washington is still divided on Germany's position in Europe and the world. If the Federal Government, in the interest of consensus, maintains a low profile, it is accused of neglecting the alliance's interests. If Bonn assumes a leadership role, people will soon speak about the reemergence of hegemonic aspirations that are allegedly manifesting themselves in a presumed sphere of influence from the Baltics to the Mediterranean. Even the Clinton team, which is largely focused at domestic policy matters, is beginning to see that the United States cannot dodge its leadership obligations in foreign policy. It is true that at the NATO summit Clinton corroborated the presence of 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe. But, given the reserved attitude regarding their mission, it remains an open question whether these U.S. forces can be assigned a European defense task. What is certain is the fact that U.S. leadership is indispensable for solving global problems, just as European problems cannot be solved without Germany. Washington's divided attitude toward its partner Germany is also reflected by the fact that 50 years after D-Day, the victor powers still consider it necessary to exclude the former enemy from ceremonies intended to mark reconciliation and solidarity. With the argument that there is "no magic formula" for the assessment of national interests and no ready solution to many regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts, Clinton is seeking to stress the difference between the world war generation fighting for democracy and freedom and the challenges to policymakers today. The U.S. President is still trying to prove his leadership claim through steadfastness and efforts to define clear goals.
