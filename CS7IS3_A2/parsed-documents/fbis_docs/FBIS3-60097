Over the course of the investigation, the police have held 85 persons for questioning and charged 20 with smuggling and distributing narcotics. On Tuesday [23 November], the case came up for trial in Helsinki Municipal Court, where the prosecutor read an indictment for aggravated narcotics violations against a 25-year-old man from Kervo. Further indictments are expected against the other members of the gang. The gang has been operating in the Helsinki region, the Turku area, and [other places] on the west coast. It is suspected of having distributed and sold tens of kilograms of hashish, much heroin and amphetamines, as well as the drugs LSD and ecstasy, both of which have rarely been found in Finland. The police seized a little over 1 kg of hashish and around 100 kg of amphetamines, as well as small amounts of other drugs. Gang members are between age 17 and 35 and most have never had prior involvement with the police. The suspected gang leader worked full time on narcotics trafficking. The gang has been operating for approximately one year, and has constantly grown by recruiting new members. The police believe the organization has spun off a number of smaller subgroups, which remained loosely tied to each other. The police got on the gang's trail last spring. The full extent of the case is still not known. The police will still not say from where the drug ring originated. This drug ring is not the same one confirmed a short time ago of distributing "superheroin."
