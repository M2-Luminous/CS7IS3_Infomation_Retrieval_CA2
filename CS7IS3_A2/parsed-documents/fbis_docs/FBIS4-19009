At a meeting with the Executive Committee of the Bundeswehr Association, Kinkel was quoted by the FDP press office as saying that "permanently playing around with figures" regarding the strength of the Bundeswehr is wrong. Kinkel clearly rejected the reasoning that the size, structure, and efficiency of the Bundeswehr should mainly be determined by the availablity of state funds. In the meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer emphasized that the Armed Forces are "not light switches that can be turned on or off according to short-term fluctuations in demand."
