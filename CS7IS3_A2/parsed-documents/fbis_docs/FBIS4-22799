Loginov: "In a Financial Trap: Where the Orenburg Locomotive Repair Plant Has Found Itself"] [Text] Many enterprises which were only recently the pride of domestic industry, having found themselves in a difficult situation, are suspending or cutting back production and converting to the output of new products. Transport enterprises, which are the connecting link between the sectors of the country's national economic complex, have not survived this ordeal. Indeed, it can be no other way: the continuing recession in industrial and agricultural production inevitably leads to a reduction in the volumes of transport along the steel mainlines, to losses of revenue and to the difficulties attendant on these processes. While the railroads and their divisions, with structural subdivisions at the sites, directly connected with the customers with freight and passenger transport, still somehow manage to "get out of their difficulties," however, the repair plants for transport have found themselves in a more complex, two-sided situation. On the one hand, located on the territories of specific railroads, but independent of them, they work according to the plans of the former plant main administration, converted into the Roszheldorremmash AO [Joint-Stock Company] and Vagonremmash, for all the mainlines of Russia and the CIS. On the other hand, these enterprises, specialized at one time to repair specific types of rolling stock, depend directly on the railroads: will the necessary number of diesel locomotives, for example, be planned and supplied to them, or will the railroads prefer to put them in good order under depot conditions, thus saving funds and trying to maintain the corps of repairmen? The second point of dependence is whether they will be paid on time for the equipment repaired at the plant shops or, pleading the absence of "real" money, will the railroads "dawdle," literally bringing the plant workers to their knees. It is in this precise situation that the Orenburg Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant has found itself. When I prepared for an out-of-town assignment to the South Urals Railroad, I never supposed that I would hear there an SOS signal in the literal sense of the words. In conversations with workers of various ranks in Chelyabinsk, and after that in Orenburg, the last point on my trip, however, I heard that the locomotive repair plant here is on the brink of a complete (!) shutdown, and that some of its shops and plant management departments have already been forced to work only four, three and even two days a week... and that the last wages here had been paid only for November of last year. I found out about this from a conversation with A. Sinyanskiy, chairman of the rayon trade union of the Orenburg Division of the road. In complaining about the deterioration in the social situation of the railroad workers of his "agricultural" division, as compared with the neighboring "industrial" divisions, where such giants as the Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk and Orsk-Khalilovo metallurgy enterprises, and their attendant machine-building enterprises, still provide an opportunity to turn the wheels, he told me about the fewer possibilities for building housing and social-cultural facilities. They were threatened, he said, by a triple pull -- the Orenburg Division, the Orenburgtransstroy Trust and the locomotive repair plant -- to rebuild the school camp, to get away from the dilapidated temporary structures, so that the children could go there in the summer for recreation, and the rest of the time -- the adults. They were not up to it. Particularly the locomotive repair plant, which had already found that it was in no condition to maintain its own Palace of Culture (this would cost a lot!) and had transferred it to the balance of the local organs of authority. They had similarly "given up" a shop with an area of 6,000 square meters, built with no small effort (incidentally, on the eve of the perestroyka which had begun in the country). Of the 3,200 people working at the plant three years ago, only 1,860 are left today. The eternal Russian question arises: "What is to be done?" Or: "Where did we go and what have we come to?" I had a slightly difficult talk about that with Vladimir Nikolayevich Pankov, director of the Orenburg Locomotive Repair Plant, and after that back in Moscow, with Anatoliy Ivanovich Chumachenko, former director of this plant. He headed the enterprise at the end of 1984, coming from the post of chief engineer at the Ufa Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, led it from break-down to prosperity, and in 1990 was appointed chief engineer of the Plant Main Administration of the MPS [Ministry of Railways] -- now the Roszheldorremmash AO. So the plant, which had come from being among those lagging behind to being one of the foremost plants, from the steam locomotive age to the diesel locomotive age, and had now begun to master the repair of electric locomotives at the same time, suddenly finds itself a beggar hero at the crossroads. It has slipped from the yearly repair of 400 diesel locomotive sections (its capacities made even 600 possible) to 112 last year. They were slated to issue over two dozen electric sections from repair -- they only managed 18. It was not their fault: last year they received only 20 percent of the funds which had been slated for allocation to the plant to re-equip the sections. This year they planned to put 50 electric locomotives in good working order, have succeeded in concluding contracts with the roads for only 5, and not a penny has been allocated so far for this in the first quarter. All the same, in January they issued two, the same number in February, and in March -- one, the last one. What lies ahead? They concluded a contract with the neighboring Tselina Railroad (since the Russian ones are in no hurry) to repair 35 diesel locomotives. Not a bad order for these days. A misunderstanding arose with the clearing accounts, though: the leaping Russian Ruble finds no meeting point with the Kazakh Tenga. What could the neighbors use to settle accounts -- metal? Because of customs and other twists, however, it turned out to be over 1.5-fold more expensive. They have had to suspend the repair, setting the locomotives aside on spare tracks until things are cleared up -- although this is unprofitable for both parties. There is a similar situation with Ukraine. Even though (once again!) an intergovernment agreement was signed, and an inter-railroad and interbank.... The Poltava Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, to which the Orenburg plant supplied a substantial number of cylinders, piston rings, etc., took on the repair of passenger TEP60 diesel locomotives for the Russian railroads. It would seem to be mutually advantageous: work for them, work for us. Again, however, there are financial-economic and other sorts of obstacles. "Machines came from Poltava twice," Pankov told me. "Realizing the situation, we issued what they needed on credit (it reached 64 million rubles [R]). They came a third time, cursing, and said they had transferred R120 million. But this got bogged down somewhere." "We have as many debts as a dog has fleas," Vladimir Nikolayevich got excited and opened up his financial sheets. "We owe R209 million for electric power, R195 million for heat, R170 million for gas and R49 million for water." He further cites the millions in budget withholdings, every possible compulsory fund, taxes, and for this item alone the sum jumps beyond a billion. The result: the plant owes R3.7 billion, and it is owed R4.3 billion. It would seem that there is a plus of R600 million in their favor, but how do they claim it? The railroads for which they are repairing equipment and supplying spare parts cannot get cash from their customers either, and are most often satisfied with barter. Take this example. Last December the plant shipped commodity output worth R1,409 million to the roads, but these transferred only R501 million (one-third) to its current account: in January, respectively R1,507 million and R386 million (approximately one-fourth). What is more, accounts with their clients were partially settled by barter in payment of the debt, in December by R475 million and in January -- by R670 million. The arithmetic was similar in February. For the rest -- just wait. The plant workers, in order to survive and stay afloat somehow, are taking out a loan at the Orenburg Industrial Bank at 215 percent annual interest. But they have to pay off their accounts -- and from nothing, if everything to the last drop is taken from the current account? The plant is in an upheaval. How many times has its director (don't envy Pankov!) appealed for help to his own ministry, his own Roszheldorremmash AO. I cannot say that they do not listen to the voice crying in the wilderness there. They listen, advise and try to help (voices and requests of this sort, though, are also heard from other enterprises). They telephone and send plenipotentiaries to the roads, in order to force their directors to pay up, to compensate the plant workers in some way for what they owe. I ask the present director and the former director the same "seditious" question: about sanctions against the railroads, which for months have not transferred payments for the locomotives the plant has repaired and the spare parts it has supplied. After all, they are charging their own customers two-percent fines for each day (!) and if even this does not work, they can stop feeding the railcars needed to ship the products of the debtor-enterprises. "No," I hear the same answer from both Pankov and Chumachenko, "we are not applying this sort of sanction against the railroads. Otherwise, we would get no orders at all from them for equipment repair (and so they fell to the limit)." One could probably dispute this "truism." If today we are making practically no orders and are buying no new locomotives (just like railcars), are writing them off by the thousands, and are dismantling for spare parts the ones that have served out their lifetime, do we still have to repair the ones that are in operation and keep them in good working order?! It is right here that you can not make do with depot repair, however much it is considered cheaper and more advantageous for the railroads than plant repair. This is the subject of a special conversation -- and we will continue it. For the time being, Roszheldorremmash helped the sinking plant "beat" the scheduled crumbs of debts out of the roads and obtain from one of the banks in the capital an R500 million loan at 230 percent interest. I say: "But this is the regular financial noose, into which the plant falls without having got out of the first one." I hear, in answer: "How else can it be?" In reality -- how else can it be? At the plant, for four months, from November to the beginning of March, the telephones were silent (the communications workers disconnected them for non-payment of a R25 million debt). After all, now they can cut off electric power, heat, gas.... Therefore, in drawing up the loan, the tough condition of the plant was presented -- the money will go to pay off debts, for supplies of metal and other things for a repair facility.... Not a ruble for wages.... "I am ashamed to look the people in the eye," Pankov said bitterly. In a little over 15 years at the plant, he has gone from foreman to shop chief, deputy chief engineer and head technologist of the enterprise, and has done everything to make work and living conditions better. "And what have we come to now?" Pankov takes from the table a heavy stack of applications and requests. "It is indeed a disgrace when people, as a favor, ask for an allotment from what they have earned but has not been paid them! For one -- for a trip to a wedding, another asks to be issued leave pay for December (and this is -- in February!) to repair his house.... A single mother: her son is a student in a technical school that requires payment, allot R120,000.... Petr Nikitovich Kondratyev, a veteran (46 years of labor service, 37 of them at the plant) writes: I am ashamed, as they say, to `beg,' but the heating unit in my home is out of order. Before, I could have bought one for half of my monthly pension, but now half a year's is not enough -- it costs R535,000." All right, the director thinks, we can send an experienced mechanic to the old man, he can do something to help. For the rest, though, where can we get money "to live on?" We used to be able to release part of the receipts from the plant dining hall for this, but now, when we have "frozen" the wages for the workers, we have been forced to introduce the coupon system. The plant has stopped updating equipment and rebuilding shops and sections. Because of a lack of funds to maintain the facilities for social purposes, as has already been noted, it has been deprived of its Palace of Culture, and has stopped rebuilding the camp for the school children. It is increasingly difficult to maintain the housing fund, and this means 55 houses with an area of over 100,000 square meters. Kindergartens.... Whereas before the plant workers were provided with free catering there, and the plant repaired them and equipped them with modern services and utilities, now it just might allot a bucket of paint for cosmetic repair. Medicine.... A branch of the railroad hospital, a polyclinic, and also dispensaries, which took prizes in their day, are located on the territory of the plant microrayon. The polyclinic has been under repair for three years -- there is still a lack of funds. There are simply not enough of them for the very expensive maintenance. The base PTU-12 [vocational-technical school]. At one time its graduates were guaranteed work places at the plant. They worked out a program for mastering vocations in a broad range of specialties: a lathe operator, so that he could work at a boring machine or a jig-boring machine with programmed control; a welder, for both electric and gas welding. "So if we give up the PTU, where teenagers are given dormitory housing, and instruction in good classes and workshops," asks Pankov, "will they go out on the street? Into business? Or earn their living doing something else. It is a pity, after all, most of the kids in the school used to live in children's homes. Does this mean condemning them to homelessness?" When meeting directors of various ranks at the South Urals and chatting about their present difficulties, I asked about the plant that was suffering the misfortune. I heard: "If the plant shuts down -- it is bad, of course. But if this happens to the railroad -- everything will go away." This is probably true. We must not forget, though: it is a question not simply of one of the repair plants, but also of an enterprise which supplies a broad products list of spare parts for the railroads of Russia and the CIS. This can have an effect on their work. It is not yet too late, this growing disintegration must be stopped.
