Viktor Shevaldin, Ignalina director, said the reactor will start to operate at a minimum output Friday and should reach its previous 750-megawatt output by Monday. Shevaldin said a thorough examination of the crack in the emergency cooling system confirmed preliminary forecasts that the stoppage should be rated zero on the International Atomic Energy Agency scale and can be regarded as "a minor incident." The Lithuanian State Atomic Energy Inspection gave permission to start the reactor when the defect was repaired.
