Kakizawa told a press conference that Japan and the U.S. basically agreed to resume the stalled trade framework talks and not to use numerical targets as "objective criteria" for measuring foreign market access. "Both sides also agreed to introduce `qualitative and quantitative' criteria (to measure the progress of imports in penetrating Japanese markets) and not to use a single criterion to judge (the openness of Japan's markets), so we're convinced that sanctions will not be implemented," Kakizawa said. The trade talks collapsed in February because of differences over the definition of "objective criteria." Tokyo rejected U.S. demands for what Japanese officials criticized as "numerical targets" for specifying market shares of U.S. products in the Japanese market. Kakizawa said Tuesday's accord on resumption of the framework talks brought Tokyo and Washington to the "starting line, not the goal." The schedules for negotiations over specific areas are to be worked out in later consultations with the U.S., Kakizawa said, adding he hopes negotiations for each working group will be carried out simultaneously. Japan will compile a second package of market-opening measures by the end of June or early July. Kakizawa said he will study whether or not to visit the U.S. when Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi returns to Japan, taking into account Diet schedules. Kakizawa also told reporters he held talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on the phone prior to the news conference. In the talks, the two sides agreed to maintain close contact in the course of the resumed framework negotiations, Kakizawa said. They agreed that it was good for both sides that they were able to reach agreement on resuming the talks and were able to deepen mutual understandings and create common understanding, he said. He said Japan and the U.S. were able to reach the accord to resume the talks because both sides took a "realistic approach" by putting an end to "theological" discussions. Both Tokyo and Washington were also concerned that the unstable economic relations between the two nations would have a negative influence on overall bilateral relations, he said.
