On the evening of 1 March the results will be announced of the secret vote by Belarus parliamentarians, with named voting slips, for or against introducing the institution of a presidency. And although officially the voting will end only at 1800 on 1 March, the BELINFORM correspondents have learned from confidential sources that 230 voting slips have already been deposited in the ballot boxes and 210 deputies have voted in favor of introducing the post of president as the head of state and executive authority. For this decision to receive the force of law it needs to gather another 22 votes. About 100 parliamentarians have not yet received their voting slips. And even taking into account that 40 deputies have said that they will not vote, one can predict today with 99.9 percent certainty that Belarus will have a new state structure.
