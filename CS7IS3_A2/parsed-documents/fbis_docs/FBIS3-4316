Please examine the report. I. The Main Projects Accomplished in the Past Year The Eighth NPC Standing Committee's five-year term is an important period for China to speed up building a socialist market economic system and achieve the second-step modernization goal. In accordance with the state's overall situation and tasks, the Standing Committee has laid down the main points of work for this term as well as these guidelines: Upholding the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the guidance of the party's basic line, we should regard the strengthening of socialist democracy and the legal system as the basic task, continue to improve the people's congress institution, safeguard the implementation of the Constitution and laws, and actively promote the development of the socialist market economy. Over the past year, the Standing Committee, in the light of this guiding thought, has earnestly discharged its constitutional responsibilities and made new headway in intensifying economic legislation, improving supervisory mechanisms, promoting reform and development, and safeguarding social stability. (1) We Have Given First Priority to Economic Legislation and Achieved Remarkable Legislative Successes The constitutional amendment adopted by the First Session of the Eighth NPC clearly provides that "the state shall institute a socialist market economy," and that the "state shall intensify economic legislation." In light of this constitutional requirement, the Standing Committee has given first priority to economic legislation and strove to build a basic legal framework governing the socialist market economy. The pace of legislation has accelerated noticeably over the past year. The Standing Committee has drawn up and revised and adopted decisions on legal issues on 21 laws, including 13 relevant to the socialist market economy. The Standing Committee has also approved 17 treaties, conventions, and agreements. To guide, promote, and safeguard the healthy development of the socialist market economy, the Standing Committee has drawn up some important laws for controlling the market, maintaining market order, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. The provisions in the Company Law on the establishment, organization, and property-related responsibilities of limited liability companies and incorporated companies have been helpful for controlling the main market components, establishing a modern enterprise system, and promoting the development of the socialist market economy. The Law of Opposing Illegitimate Competition, the Law for Protecting Consumers' Rights and Interests, and the Law for Registered Accountants, as well as the Decision on Punishing the Crime of Producing and Selling Counterfeit and Inferior Commodities and the Decision on Interim Regulations Governing the Collection of Value- Added Tax, Consumption Tax, and Business Tax from Foreign Enterprises and Enterprises with Foreign Investment are playing an important role in maintaining market order, stopping illegitimate competition, improving macroeconomic regulation and control, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of parties of economic activities. The Agricultural Law has summed up China's experiences in carrying out rural reform and codified the state's responsibility systems dominated by contracts linked to family output, a system which has stabilized the rural areas. The law has also improved the two-tiered system which integrates unified management and separate management; and it has safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of agricultural organizations and farmers. The Law on Protecting Taiwan Countrymen's Investment was drawn up to protect Taiwan countrymen's investment, encourage them to invest in the mainland, and promote the economic development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. To keep pace with the needs in the development of the socialist market economy, the Standing Committee has also revised the Economic Contract Law, the Personal Income Tax Law, and the Accountancy Law; and it has examined the draft Budget Law, the Securities Law, the Foreign Trade Law, the Labor Law, and decided to present the draft Budget Law to the current NPC session for deliberations. For the sake of promoting scientific-technological and educational development and the development of public health services, the Standing Committee has adopted the Law for Scientific and Technological Advancement, the Teachers Law, the Law Governing the Popularization of Agricultural Technology, and the Law for Red Cross Societies. The Law for Scientific and Technological Advancement has provided the legal basis for the state's basic policy that economic construction and social development must count on science and technology -- which in turn should be geared to the needs of economic construction and social development -- and has safeguarded the strategy that priority must be given to scientific and technological development. The formulation of the Teachers Law is conducive to safeguarding teachers' legitimate rights and interests; to building a contingent of ideologically, ethically, and professionally acceptable teachers; and to promoting the development of socialist education. Moreover, the Standing Committee has also adopted supplementary regulations for harshly punishing the crime of organizing and delivering people across the national borders, and it has examined the drafts of the State Compensation Law and the State Law on Conferring Medals and Honorary Titles. The task of drawing up laws relevant to the socialist market economy is an urgent and formidable one. During the course of legislation, the Standing Committee has paid attention to: 1) approaching and dealing with issues and problems encountered in legislation, in following the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the basic party line, and on the basis of the Constitution; 2) carrying out the comprehensive investigation and study of socialist market economic laws, and drawing up legislative plans according to needs and feasibilities so that legislative affairs can proceed in a well- planned and selective manner; 3) fully mobilizing the initiatives of all quarters and giving scope to the role played by experts and scholars and the coordination between actual workers and theoretical workers; 4) improving organization, guidance, and coordination when laws were being drafted, urging the drafting units to complete their assignments on time, and ensuring the quality of the drafts; 5) proceeding from China's actual situation and bravely assimilating and emulating foreign countries' experiences, and making sure that our laws are in line with the features and rules of the development of the socialist market economy; that they are fair, impartial, open, and effective; and that they can further emancipate and develop productive forces. (2) Strive To Improve and Strengthen Supervision, and Continue To Improve Supervisory Mechanisms While speeding up the reform and opening up process and replacing the old economic system with a new one, the Standing Committee has intensified its supervision over legislative and other work. Over the past year, the Standing Committee and special committees, in centering around the state's priority projects and major issues about which the people are concerned, dispatched 37 inspection groups to inspect the implementation of 18 laws. At the same time, the Standing Committee has also heard and examined reports submitted by the State Council and its departments as well as by the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the work in eight respects, including finance, foreign trade, education, administrative ethics, and civil aviation. The special committees were also briefed at regular intervals on the work of relevant departments. The Standing Committee paid attention to actual performance while inspecting law enforcement. In view of the fact that people have responded strongly to public security problems, the Standing Committee has inspected the implementation of the Decision on Intensifying the Comprehensive Management of Public Security, underscored the need to be firm on promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same time, intensified the work of special organs, mobilized and organize all social sectors to deal with public offense, and exercised comprehensive management through various ways and means, thus harshly cracking down on railway and highway robberies, drug trafficking, the use of narcotics, prostitution, and other crimes and thus protecting the people's lives and property. In view of the rampancy of the crime of producing and selling bogus and inferior commodities, the Standing Committee has organized inspections of the implementation of the Decision on Punishing the Crime of Producing and Selling Bogus and Inferior Commodities, stressing the need to educate the people about the law until producers and traders understand that the quality of their goods must be accountable to society, and until consumers know how to protect their own rights and interests through the law as well as the need to reinforce law enforcement authorities, combat local protectionism, and ban the practice of paying fines in lieu of serving prison terms. To meet the need of establishing a modern enterprise system, the Standing Committee has also come up with views and suggestions on implementing the Enterprise Law, replacing enterprises' operating mechanisms, and making sure enterprises are able to enjoy their autonomy. Relevant special committees have also carried out extensive and deep-going inspections of the implementation of laws for environmental protection, and the media has achieved fairly good results with its continual reports which have prompted certain departments and regions to take measures to deal with pollution. Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control was an important measure adopted by the state last year. The Standing Committee heard and deliberated on the "Report on the Current Financial Situation and Financial Policies and Measures" delivered by State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. The Standing Committee members endorsed the series of measures adopted by the State Council to improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify the financial order, and they made suggestions on deepening the reform of the financial system. The Standing Committee heard and deliberated on the reports of the State Planning Commission and the Finance Ministry on the implementation of the state plan and the state budget and examined and approved the 1992 state final accounts. To promote the deepening of the struggle against corruption, the Standing Committee heard and deliberated on the Supreme People's Procuratorate's "Report on the Investigation and Handling of Major Cases by Procuratorial Organs in the Struggle Against Corruption," affirmed the achievements of procuratorial organs in handling major cases to deal with corruption according to the law, and expressed strong support for law-enforcement organs' handling cases according to the law. The Standing Committee members hold that strengthening the building of a clean government and the fight against corruption is an important guarantee for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and that this has a bearing on the success or failure of the reform and the destiny of the state. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this work constantly and unremittingly and see to it that it yields results. In carrying out its supervisory work, the Standing Committee has paid attention to improving the supervisory mechanism and has exercised supervision according to the law. On the basis of summing up experiences in overseeing law enforcement in the past few years, the Standing Committee drew up "Some Provisions on Strengthening the Examination and Supervision of Law Enforcement," thus further institutionalizing this work and improving the procedures for carrying it out. To maintain a unified legal system for the state, the Standing Committee has examined the local laws and regulations submitted to it for the record and rectified the provisions that were in conflict with the laws. The Standing Committee's offices have also carefully studied and answered questions raised by local authorities on the implementation of laws. (3) Deal Seriously With the Deputies' Motions and Proposals and Maintain Close Ties With the Masses The raising of motions and proposals by deputies at the NPC session constitutes an important forum in which they exercise their right to administer the affairs of the state. This is conducive to putting state organs under the supervision of the masses and will help state organs improve their work. At the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the deputies raised 611 motions, of which the motion raised by the Guangdong delegation on the establishment of the Preparatory Work Subcommittee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was listed on the agenda of the session. Authorized by the NPC session, the Standing Committee decided to establish the preparatory work subcommittee, which has begun work. This is very important to ensure that China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, to realize the smooth transfer of power in 1997, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity. Ninety-three motions were examined by specialized committees. Most of these motions concerned legislation. In making laws, the Standing Committee has fully considered and adopted the deputies' opinions. The other 517 motions were regard as proposals, criticisms, and opinions. These, as well as 2,325 proposals put forward by the deputies, have been transferred by the General Office of the Standing Committee to the relevant units for study and handling. All of them have been answered. With the efforts of the units handling them, the motions and proposals have been handled more quickly than before, and the quality of their being handled has improved. Inspections are an important way for the deputies to maintain ties with the masses, to understand the situation, and to reflect the masses' opinions and demands. Before the current session was convened, the NPC Standing Committee and the provincial-level people's congress standing committees jointly organized in 1993 NPC deputies to carry out inspections concerning the implementation of the development plan and budget, the transformation of the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, the reduction of peasants' burdens, the efforts to improve public security, and the fight against corruption. They also organized the deputies from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Province to inspect some areas in Heilongjiang, Guangdong, and Fujian Provinces. During their inspection tours, they were serious about trying to understand the actual situation and offered some important opinions. The results were fairly good. Good attention was paid to people's visits and letters. Over the past year, the Standing Committee handled 60,907 letters and received 13,248 people. Through handling letters and receiving visitors, the Standing Committee urged concerned departments and locales to solve a number of urgent problems and thus promoted closer ties between state organs and the masses. We have strengthened efforts to guide the work of standing committees of local people's congresses and to support local people's congresses in exercising their power according to the law. We have held discussion meetings attended by responsible comrades of standing committees of people's congresses at the provincial level to hear their opinions, exchange experiences with them, and study ways to further improve the work of people's congresses. The chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee made inspection trips to investigate situations in various places, to understand the work of local people's congresses, and to guide and assist local people's congresses in legislative work and the supervision of government work. The special committees and working departments of the NPC Standing Committee jointly held discussion meetings and symposiums with local people's congresses, and they have thus maintained closer ties. (4) Actively Develop Contacts With Foreign Parliaments, Create a Favorable International Environment for China's Reform, Opening Up, and Modernization Drive Making contacts with foreign parliaments is an important task of the Standing Committee and is also a component part of the state's foreign affairs. Over the past year, NPC delegations led by the chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee visited 26 countries. The NPC Standing Committee sent delegations to take part in six international conferences and received 37 delegations of foreign parliaments and international organizations. The special committees of the Standing Committee sent 12 delegations to visit 23 countries and to take part in 20 related international meetings. Those committees received 59 parliamentary committees and international organizations. The NPC Standing Committee adjusted or established 35 bilateral friendship teams between the NPC and foreign parliaments. The NPC Standing Committee also invited responsible persons of standing committees of people's congresses at the provincial level and NPC deputies to take part in the NPC's foreign affairs activities. Chairman Qiao Shi's visit to the five ASEAN member countries has promoted exchanges between the Chinese NPC and the five countries' parliaments, strengthened contacts with the leaders of those countries, and consolidated and developed friendship and cooperation between China and those countries. His visit was of great significance to maintaining stability and prosperity in the Asia- Pacific region. Chairman Qiao Shi's visits to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria not only promoted exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and parliaments of the three countries but were also, through extensive contacts with the leaders of the three countries, conducive to increasing China's influence and promoting the development of China's relations with the three countries. His visits have strengthened cooperation and promoted the further improvement of relations between West European countries and China. The NPC delegations also visited the DPRK, the ROK, five Central Asian countries, three North European countries, and several other countries. Through those multilevel and multichannel foreign affairs activities, we have enhanced mutual understanding and trust with those countries, increased the influence of our country's reform and opening policy, and promoted the development of state relations. Through parliamentary diplomacy, we have promoted cooperation in economic, trade, scientific affairs and technology, education, culture, and other fields. Meanwhile, we have also paid attention to understanding and borrowing foreign experiences in legislation and economic construction. The change in the international situation and the development of the domestic situation all require us to further strengthen the NPC's foreign affairs to expand our influence, make friends, promote friendship and cooperation with foreign parliaments and people, and create a favorable international environment for China's socialist modernization, reform, and opening up. From now on, we will continue to implement our country's foreign policy, give full play to the role of parliamentary diplomacy, and further improve the NPC's conduct of foreign affairs. (5) Strengthen the Building of the Standing Committee's Organizational Structure and Bring the Special Committees Into Play In light of the new situation's demands on the People's Congress, the Standing Committee has given strategic importance to strengthening its own construction, particularly the building of its organizational structure. It has drawn up the "Rules for NPC Standing Committee Members," which urge Standing Committee members to study hard the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Constitution and laws, to maintain close ties with the masses, to be honest, and to obey the institution of the congress and its work disciplines, and to discharge their responsibilities strictly according to the law. It has revised and perfected such work regulations as the "Rules of Procedure for the Chairmanship Meeting" and the "Work Regulations for the Secretariat" so that the Standing Committee has some regulations to follow in carrying out its routine work. Each special committee has also formulated or revised work regulations and rules of procedure and has stipulated rules on Standing Committee members' responsibilities, the institution of the congress, and its work procedures. The special committees are the NPC's permanent organizations. When the congress is not in session, they are under the Standing Committee's leadership. Its work is characterized by regularity and specifics. Giving full play to the special committees is crucial to the Standing Committee in carrying out such tasks as legislation and supervision. Last year, the Standing Committee held two discussion meetings for persons in charge of the special committees to study issues such as strengthening the construction of the special committees and to help carry out the special committees' work. Over the past year, each special committee has actively discharged its responsibilities, has helped the Standing Committee exercise its authority, and has done a great deal and scored marked achievements in studying, deliberating, and working out legal and other motions; in monitoring law enforcement, in hearing reports from the departments concerned, and in carrying out special investigations and activities related to foreigners. The Standing Committee attaches importance to strengthening organizational construction. Its chairman and vice chairmen have held many meetings of public functionaries in calling for organizational construction. Over the past year, public functionaries have earnestly studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Constitution and laws and have improved cadres' political integrity and professional level. Various departments and units have instituted the responsibility system to accelerate the pace of work, to improve work efficiency, and to ensure the completion of various tasks. Over the past year, with the support of all its deputies and local people's congresses, the Standing Committee has made new progress and scored greater achievements in various tasks. In the meantime, we must also note that there are some imperfections in our work. They are mainly: Legislation does not completely meet the needs of reform, opening up, and economic development; supervision is still weak, particularly the checking and supervising of law enforcement; and the building of the Standing Committee itself does not meet the new situation's demands on the People's Congress. We should adopt effective measures to overcome these shortcomings step by step. II. The Main Tasks for the Coming Year The year 1994 will be a crucial year for China to accelerate the establishment of a market economic structure and to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. Under the guidance of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Standing Committee will fully implement the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, make the construction of socialist democracy and legality its fundamental task, and earnestly carry out the functions vested in it by the Constitution and other laws. We should go deeply into the realities of life and mingle with the masses, carry out research and investigations, solicit the views of the masses, pay constant attention to and understand the new problems that crop up in the course of economic development, assess various situations that may affect social stability and the smooth implementation of reform, offer constructive suggestions, and properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. We should speed up the drafting of economic laws and exercise efficient supervision over law enforcement and the implementation of reform measures. All the Standing Committee's work must be subject to and serve the overall tasks of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and preserving stability. (1) Continue To Give Top Priority to Economic Legislation To Meet the Needs of Developing a Socialist Market Economy. This will be a year in which relatively more reform measures will be announced. Therefore, laws are needed to guide, promote, and ensure reform. This presents a rather urgent demand for speeding up the pace of legislation, and economic legislation in particular. We will continue to give top priority to economic legislation and develop, step by step, a system of laws that meets the needs of developing a socialist market economy. The Standing Committee has adopted a five-year legislative program. At the top of the legislative agenda are major laws that standardize market practices, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and perfect the social security system. Also on the agenda are laws that are designed to promote socialist democracy, strengthen the organizational system of state organs, punish crimes, safeguard public order, promote the development of science, education, and culture; protect the environment, and strengthen the national defense buildup. When the program is accomplished, a general framework of laws governing the socialist market economy will have come into being and laws governing other areas will have been strengthened. The Standing Committee should provide more effective guidance, coordination, and supervision over the implementation of the legislative program. In addition to fulfilling their own law-drafting tasks, the NPC special committees should step up coordination with other law-drafting units. All units with law-drafting responsibilities must assign personnel and set a schedule to ensure that their law-drafting tasks are completed on time with high quality. According to the legislative program, quite a number of laws will be formulated this year. We should draw up a plan on the basis of their importance and urgency so that urgently needed laws will be formulated first. It is necessary to sum up in a timely fashion the experience gained from reform measures being implemented and, wherever possible, to standardize and codify into laws what has been learned. We should step up the formulation of the central bank law, the commercial bank law, the auditing law, the foreign trade law, the futures trade law, the real estate law, the securities law, the instruments law, the guarantor law, the trust law, the insurance law, the arbitration law, and the labor law. We must also speed up the drafting of laws in other areas whenever conditions are ripe. We should embrace new ideas in regard to the socialist market economy, be bold in exploring new ways, dare to experiment, and increase the pace and quality of legislative work to meet the needs of reform and development. (2) We Must Successfully Carry Out Inspections of and Supervision Over Law Enforcement To Promote the Implementation of Various Reform Measures. Reform is an undertaking of all the people across the country and is in their greatest interests. The Standing Committee must proceed from the fundamental interests of the people, bring every positive factor into full play, and give full support to and promote the smooth implementation of various reform measures. On the basis of the duties and powers prescribed by the Constitution, the Standing Committee must represent the will of the people to further carry out inspections of and supervision over law enforcement and strengthen its supervision over administrative, judicial, and procuratorial work by making its efforts revolve around the major issues of reform and construction. The Standing Committee must place the inspection of and supervision over law enforcement at the top of its work agenda, conscientiously carry out "Certain Regulations on Strengthening the Inspection of and Supervision Over Law Enforcement," and step up supervision to produce more concrete results therefrom. This year, it must focus its inspection and supervision on the enforcement of the laws on the market economy, and in particular it must organize a force to carry out in-depth inspections of the enforcement of the newly adopted laws on maintaining order in the market and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control in a bid to promote the healthy development of the socialist market economy. It must continue to successfully conduct inspections of and supervision over the enforcement of the laws on maintaining public security and cracking down on various criminal activities so as to maintain social order, protect social stability, and promote the building of spiritual civilization. To promote the development of economic construction as well as reform and opening up, the Standing Committee must hear in a time manner work reports by the State Council and its relevant departments, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate; supervise the implementation of various reform measures; and support and urge them to do a good job. It must strengthen supervision over the implementation of the national economic and social development plan as well as the state budget, and it must guarantee the smooth implementation of the plan and budget approved by the NPC session. The Standing Committee must intensify its supervision over the work ethics of elected and appointed personnel of the NPC and the Standing Committee itself. Whenever corrupt personnel who have committed graft or have accepted bribes are discovered, those deserving dismissal should be dismissed, and those who have broken the law shall have their criminal responsibilities investigated according to the law. We must support and urge law-enforcement authorities to enforce the law strictly and we must intensify their efforts in handling major cases. We must seriously handle the masses' appeals, accusations, and reports. We must also constantly sum up the experiences that we have gained while exercising supervision so that our supervision will be even more standardized and institutionalized. (3) We Must Create a Good, Law-Conscious Environment by Heightening the Entire Society's Sense of Law. Heightening the entire society's sense of law is an important aspect in building our socialist system and an essential requirement for the modernization drive to move forward smoothly. The development of reform, opening up, and modernization requires people in society, especially leading cadres at all levels, to have a higher sense of the law. China's feudal society had a several- thousand-year history, and we do not have a tradition of democracy and law. Because of this, as well as the fact that we have become used to, over a long period of time, managing and handling economic and social affairs simply by means of administrative measures, some cadres and people have only a faint sense of the law, and they do not do things according to the law. Some cadres approach laws with a pragmatic attitude and do not enforce those which are not in their favor. Some have even abused their authority and openly violated laws to protect the interests of their own regions, departments, and units. This situation is incongruous with the development of the socialist market economy. Solving this problem is an urgent, protracted, and formidable mission which must be accomplished earnestly by making persistent and untiring efforts. To heighten society's sense of the law, the most fundamental measure is to educate the people. The Standing Committee must consider it a routine but important task to publicize the knowledge of the law and to educate the public about the legal system. It should fully utilize the media, such as television and radio stations and the press, to create a powerful momentum for the propagation of the law. We must see to it that all departments and local authorities make continual efforts in educating the people about the law, publicizing the Constitution, and popularizing legal knowledge about the market economy so that the masses will understand the law, obey it, and know how to use it to protect their legitimate rights and interests. We must uphold the authority of the Constitution and other laws. All organizations and individuals must consider the Constitution to be their fundamental code of conduct, and no one has the privilege of overstepping the Constitution or other laws. Personnel of all state organs, especially those in leading positions, must take the initiative in studying and understanding the law, in setting the example of observing the law, and in knowing how to handle all affairs using legal measures. While electing or dismissing cadres, the NPC and its Standing Committee should consider whether the cadres have the necessary knowledge of the law and whether they are earnest in enforcing the law as a yardstick of their competence. We must build a stronger contingent of law enforcers, improve their quality and competence, and make sure that all laws are strictly enforced and that whoever violates the law is punished. In short, in order to create a good legal system facilitating reform and construction, we must take all effective measures to gradually correct the situation under which people are unaware of the existence of the law or do not strictly enforce laws if they are aware of their existence, and to help the public understand that it is an honor to obey the law and shameful to break it, and that things should be done according to the law. (4) The Standing Committee Should Strengthen Itself by Creating a Strong Contingent of NPC Cadres. Under the new situation, the tasks confronting the Standing Committee are arduous, and it must build itself into a stronger organ. Members of the Standing Committee and cadres of all its organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works and arm their minds and guide their work with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must fully understand that building a socialist democratic legal system is an important part of modernization and that the NPC works at the forefront of building the democratic legal system. We must concentrate our efforts, work cautiously, and earnestly discharge our responsibilities so as to live up to the people's high expectations. The Standing Committee must continue to reform and improve its organizational and operational systems and rationalize the relationships between various departments so that its discussion of state affairs can be even more efficient. NPC organs must proceed with their structural reform in order to become more consolidated, streamlined, and efficient. To adapt to the needs caused by increasingly arduous legislative and supervisory projects, we must have stronger legislative organs and research and consultative organs. To this end, we must improve the mix of cadres, improve cadres' proficiency, reinforce these organs with specialists and experienced personnel, and intensify the training of cadres so that the NPC will gradually have a contingent of dedicated cadres who are armed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, who are knowledgeable about the Constitution and other laws, who have established close ties with the masses, and who discharge their duties earnestly and honestly. Fellow deputies! The people's congress system is a basic political system of China. Upholding and improving this system has extremely important significance for ensuring the people's role as masters of their own house, for consolidating the political power characterized by the people's democratic dictatorship, for fully arousing the people's enthusiasm to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, for safeguarding the state's long-term peace and stability, and for expediting the progress of reform, opening up, and modernization. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the NPC's founding. We should commemorate this anniversary by focusing on the brilliant course which the NPC has traversed in its development, by broadly publicizing the superiority of the NPC system, and by heightening people's understanding of the importance of making the NPC more efficient under the new situation so that the NPC and its Standing Committee can play their parts more effectively. Under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's basic line, we must explore actively, press forward, and work hard to do an even better job so as to play our parts in seizing even greater victories in reform and construction!
