Virsis evaded from saying concretely whether Latvia will accept the Russian-proposed rent of 2 million U.S. dollars per year. Russian chief negotiator Sergey Zotov told reporters today that Russia would be forced to extend the deadline of troop withdrawal if Latvia wanted more than 2 million dollars a year for the radar's operation. On the one hand, Virsis said, Latvia was aware of Russia's economic problems but, on the other hand, the sum could also be regarded as too small. In addition, Russia initially wanted to keep 900-member personnel in the station. During the negotiations, Russia agreed to cut the number of military personnel by a third if the civil staff is respectively increased. Commenting on the dismantling of a newly-built installation in the territory of the Skrunda compound, Virsis said Russia "in principle agreed to pull it down but said it had no money to accomplish the task." Russia wouldn't mind if Latvia helped it dismantle the installation, Virsis said. Virsis abstained from predicting on the outcome of the talks. As reported, Russia proposed Latvia to complete troop withdrawal by the end of August if Latvia allowed it keep the Skrunda radar for four years and dismantle it in 18 months. The Latvian cabinet is expected to accept the proposal.
