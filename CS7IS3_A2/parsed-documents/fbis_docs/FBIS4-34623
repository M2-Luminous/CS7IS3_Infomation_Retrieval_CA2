[EL NACIONAL] The Defense Ministry said it has information. [Escovar] The Interior Ministry has plenty of information, but I have nothing to disclose at this time. [EL NACIONAL] Do you fear public disorder due to the bank interventions? [Escovar] Let's wait and see how things unfold. So far we have reports of only small incidents, of which you are all aware. Right now--it is a little past 1400--I know of no demonstrations in Caracas or anywhere else in the country. There has been gossip on the street here and there, but nothing to be concerned about. There are, however, many rumors. There is a rumor factory. [EL NACIONAL] Coming from whom? [Escovar] The rumors come from groups which have an interest in spreading them. I have said I will make a statement on that particular issue and I will, but not at this time. [end Escovar] Referring to the decree issued by former President Carlos Andres Perez granting Venezuelan citizenship to the children of illegal aliens, the minister stated: [Escovar] The decree that is in effect is one of the most important documents handed down by former President Velasquez. Decree 1,911, issued by President Perez, was an irresponsible act against Venezuela of historic proportions because it granted more privileges to illegal aliens that Venezuelans have themselves. When I was prosecutor general, I opposed the decree right from the start. I have no doubt whatsoever that the Supreme Court of Justice will revoke the decree. When the time comes for the Supreme Court to make its decision, the prosecutor general will present his case with the arguments he deems best at the appropriate time. [EL NACIONAL] Do you believe there are sufficient arguments to sustain his case? [Escovar] Of course, more than enough. [EL NACIONAL] Will you participate? [Escovar] No, I will not participate because that is no longer within my realm of responsibility. President Velasquez's position was supported by 80 percent of the Venezuelan people, and President Perez's position was rejected by 80 percent. [end Escovar] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas spoke of the recently concluded fourth Ibero-American conference in Cartagena (Colombia), which was attended by President Rafael Caldera. The discussion included integration, trade, and development, but from the beginning it was obvious that politics would, in a casuistical manner, be worked into the agenda, as is the case with Cuba. [EL NACIONAL] What did you think of Fidel Castro's statements? [Escovar] First I would say that Castro's speech, his formal speech at the inauguration, was an age-old speech that predated the end of the Cold War. It was a memorandum of offenses, of the embargo, and against the United States. More important, however, was what happened next: First President Caldera, and then several other presidents, invited Castro to join the inter-American system from the political and legal viewpoint. In other words, he was asked to accept the rules of the game of a community such as that which exists in this hemisphere; that is, rules based on democracy and human rights. As for the achievements (?) of the Castro regime, Burelli Rivas said: My opinion is like that of any individual who has the democratic conviction that there is no substitute for freedom and that social development is not incompatible with the exercise of freedom. [EL NACIONAL] What about his statement that he will hold elections in Cuba when Cuba is integrated into Latin America? [Escovar] When he was asked to have changes made in Cuba with him instead of against him, his final statement was, in essence, what had been suggested to him. He asked to be allowed to join this community whenever there is a broad Latin American integration. Well, Latin American integration is moving quickly through various channels, and now we are trying to unify all our projects. One of the states at the summit offered to host the unification meeting, organize all the integration projects, and expedite efforts for our countries to join NAFTA and the EU earlier than scheduled, which, of course, is not this afternoon or tomorrow. [EL NACIONAL] Who suggested that? [Escovar] The president of Paraguay offered Asuncion as host city for a unification conference to discuss various projects that are in progress and should be consolidated. I think the OAS could do a lot in that sense as well. It could serve as the focal point for all integration plans that are currently spread out and which seek the same goal. [EL NACIONAL] Is it true that the Cuban president was invited to Venezuela? [Escovar] No, it is not true.
