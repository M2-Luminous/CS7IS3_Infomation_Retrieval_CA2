Politics Is Not A Weather Forecast. There Must Be No Mistake"] [Excerpt] The situation in the Crimea remains rather complex. Let us recall that the political situation here has exacerbated in recent days in connection with the adoption by the Republic of Crimea parliament of a law on the restoration of the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, which provides for great autonomy for the peninsula in relations with Ukraine. This step has been assessed in official Kiev as separatism and a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity. A number of pretty hard-hitting statements ensued. A "war of edicts" has begun, whereby Kiev revokes the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions and the Crimean parliamentarians react "appropriately" to Kiev's decisions. On the morning of 23 May General Major Valeriy Kuznetsov, minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Crimea, commented on the situation for KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as follows: "The outward situation is calm, but people are tense in view of the ambiguity of the situation. What is needed is for everything to be decided at a political level, for us, a power structure, not to get dragged into political squabbles, and for the opinion of the people to be heeded, including that of officers of the internal affairs organs. The national guard's forces are continuing to grow in the Crimea." It has become known that at 2300 hours on 22 May, 12 railroad flatcars arrived in Simferopol carrying 29 Ukrainian Army armored personnel carriers. The armored vehicles were dispersed in various parts of the city. A report to this effect was made by Petr Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser on military questions. In his words, on the same day yet another attempt was made to get into the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] building by a group of Ukrainian MVD officers who, according to the directive of their minister, had been appointed to various leading posts in place of their Crimean colleagues. However, the building's guards prevented this. [passage omitted]
