FBIS4-51853 "dreas086_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea ROK `Arms Buildup Maneuvers' Denounced ROK `Arms Buildup Maneuvers' Denounced SK0405034394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0820 GMT 3 May 94 SK0405034394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0820 GMT 3 May 94 Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "Arms Buildup Maneuvers Aimed at an Northward Invasion"] [Text] The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor, who is maneuvering, together with foreign forces, to inflict by any means [kioi] nuclear disasters on the heads of the nation has recently been running amok to introduce numerous modern weapons from the United States. At the talks held between U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry, who visited Seoul not long ago, and the puppet military leaders, the issue of purchasing U.S. military equipment was emphasized, and, in particular, the South Korean puppets begged the United States to deploy ultramodern military equipment at an early date. This is a well-known fact to the world. The Kim Yong-sam ring, the U.S. war servant who dons a civilian cloak, has recently been doing the dirtiest and most vicious acts, in an indiscreet way, to ignite the fuse of war aimed at annihilating [myolsal] its compatriots, talking about the introduction of Patriot missiles, artillery pieces, and tanks and the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise. As it has also been reported recently, the Kim Yong-sam nation- selling, treacherous clique has agreed with the United States to purchase more ultramodern weapons, including Apache assault helicopters and anti-tank missiles which it has already introduced from the United States. In this connection, the puppets will soon begin to purchase weapons. If such weapons are introduced into South Korea, the puppet Army's arms buildup plan, which is now being materialized, will reportedly be finalized ahead of schedule. This is an extremely dangerous military act. As is known, the United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique have not long ago introduced Patriot missiles--weapons of mass destruction--and deployed them in a central area of the frontline. What is ridiculous is the fact that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warlovers are babbling that the deployment of Patriot missiles is for shoring up anti-air defense capability and this serves as an effective defense means against someone's surprise attack. But, this is nothing but a poor excuse aimed at covering up their aggressive attempt. According to what they have owned up themselves, the missiles, which have been deployed in South Korea recently, are the ones for which the Patriot missiles--used during the last Persian Gulf war-- have been improved and their capacity has been upgraded to a higher level. The Patriot missiles are not interceptor missiles used simply for defense, but ultramodern war means which can be used also as attack weapons aimed at striking the other side. There is no need for a long-winded explanation as to the fact that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are trying to attack us with the Patriot missiles, while igniting the fuse of war. Not satisfied with the introduction and deployment of lethal equipment, including Patriot missiles and Apache assault helicopters, in the areas of the Military Demarcation Line, they are trying to introduce more ultramodern war means. This suggests that the maneuvers of provoking a northward war of aggression by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are reaching an extreme. The Kim Yong-sam ring has unilaterally ruptured the hard-won contacts of working-level delegates for the preparation of exchange of North-South special envoys. Following this, it is openly inciting a war fever while spreading a rumor of someone's provocation of a southward invasion. In the meantime, it has made public even the plan for a northward war of invasion called "New Operational Plan 5027," which it has thus far kept as a secret, and it is introducing U.S.-made lethal weapons on a large scale into South Korea. This can never be overlooked. As long as the traitor like the nation-seller Kim Yong-sam remains in power in South Korea, it is now clear to everyone that disasters of a nuclear war cannot be avoided. History has shown how miserable the end of traitors running counter to the current of the times has been. If the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula by all means [kutnae], turning their faces away from the aspirations of the times and the demands of the nation and continuing to build up aggressive armed forces, the provokers will surely be burned to death by the fire they have ignited.
