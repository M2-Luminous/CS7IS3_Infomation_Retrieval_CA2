FR941212-0-00091 FR941212-0-00019 (v) Dispositive motions (identify and list). (b) Personnel Claims memorandum. See §536.168 for instructions on preparing a Personnel Claims memorandum. (c) Case abstract for malpractice claims. On all dental and medical malpractice claims, claims JAs will attach DD Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims) to all memoranda prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and forward to USARCS. Claims JAs will also submit this form to USARCS on all dental and medical malpractice claims settled or denied within their local authority. When a claim is transferred to USARCS without a forwarding memorandum prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, DD Form 2526 must still be completed and forwarded within 60 days after the medical records are available for review by the MTF/DTF risk manager (RM). (1) Claims JAs/MCJAs will coordinate the completion of the form pertaining to the Standard of Care, Diagnoses, and Procedures with the MTF/DTF RM or the RM's designee. If the RM does not provide this information, claims JAs/MCJAs will note the reason and submit the form to USARCS. The sections pertaining to Provider Information and Type of Provider and Specialty of DD Form 2526 will not be completed on the form submitted to USARCS. OTSG will task subordinate commands to forward provider information on settled claims. (2) Claims JAs are required to submit one DD Form 2526 for each incident (course of treatment or nontreatment that results in an injury) for which a claim has been filed. Derivative claims do not require a separate report. However, separate reports are required when claimants allege physical injury to more than one claimant (for example, an infant's claim for brain damage as a result of birth trauma and a mother's claim for physical injury caused by the delivery would require two reports). When a claimant alleges negligent medical care at more than one MTF/DTF, USARCS will designate the claims JA who will complete the DD Form 2526. (d) Subsequent action. It is not necessary for each claims authority who considers the claim to write a separate memorandum. If a claims approval or settlement authority agrees with the memorandum of opinion written by another authority, he or she can adopt the earlier memorandum by merely stating that he or she concurs in the adopted memorandum and stating the nature of the action. If there is disagreement, in whole or in part, with the earlier memorandum, such disagreement should be stated and reasons therefor set forth in a separate memorandum or in an addendum. The approval or settlement authority will personally sign the action, indicating position title. §536.23 Actions. The following actions may be taken as appropriate: (a) Transmittal of the claim to the appropriate claims office for proposed disposition. (b) Disapproval of the claim provided the person signing the action is a settlement authority. (See appendix B to this part). (c) Final offer. (See appendix B to this part). (d) Approval and certification of the claim for payment. (1) SF 1034 (Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal) will be used on all claims settled under this part except claims settled under subpart D which will be paid utilizing an SF 1145 (Voucher for Payment Under the Federal Tort Claims Act). (See §536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) (2) When an SF 1034 is to be paid by the GAO, the certification block of the SF 1034 will not be signed by Army Officials. GAO officials will certify any payment made by that agency. (See §536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.) (3) Payment of a claim under subpart D in excess of $2,500 is obtained by forwarding necessary documentation to the GAO. Complete information on the requirements to effect such payments are set forth in §536.35(b). Note that the approval or settlement authority signs only the approval block (lower left) of the SF 1145 before submitting a claim to the GAO for payment. (e) Subsequent action. See §536.22(d). Liability and Quantum Determinations §536.24 General considerations. (a) Liability. In the adjudication of tort claims arising in the United States, the liability of the United States generally is determined in accordance with the law of the state or country where the act or omission occurred, except that any conflict between local law and an applicable United States statute will be resolved in favor of the latter. However, in claims arising in foreign countries, liability may be based in whole or in part on local law or as otherwise provided in subpart C for settlements of claims of United States inhabitants arising overseas under the Military Claims Act. (See §536.55(c).) Where liability is not clear or other issues exist, settlements should truly reflect the uncertainties in the adjudication of such issues. Compromise settlements are encouraged provided agreement can be reached that reflects the reduced value of the damages as measured against the full value or range of value if such uncertainties or issues did not exist and were it possible for the claimant to successfully litigate the claim. (b) Quantum exclusion. The costs of filing a claim and similar costs (for example, court costs, bail, interest, inconvenience expenses, or costs of long distance telephone calls or transportation in connection with the preparation of a claim) are not proper quantum elements and will not be allowed. (c) Property damage. Property damage compensable under the tort claims provisions of this part means damage to tangible real or personal property (see glossary). It does not include mere diminution of value of real property unless there is some corresponding physical damage to the property, nor does it include damage to reputation, employment rights or constitutional rights. Other remedies may be available for such injuries but they are generally not cognizable under the FTCA, MCA, FCA or the Maritime Claims Settlement Act. §536.25 Incident to service exclusionary rule. (a) General. A claim for personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a civilian employee of the United States that accrued incident to his or her service is not payable under this part. A property damage claim that accrued incident to the service of a member of the Armed Forces may be payable under 31 U.S.C. 3721 (subpart K) or the MCA (subpart C), depending on the facts. (b) Property damage claims. A claim for damage to or loss of personal property of a claimant who is within one of the categories of proper party claimants listed in §536.163, which is otherwise cognizable under §536.164, must first be considered thereunder. If a claim is not clearly compensable under subpart K, and it arises incident to a noncombat activity of the DA or was caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission of military personnel or civilian employees of DOD, it may be cognizable under either the MCA or the FTCA. The claim, if meritorious in fact, will probably be payable under one authorization or another regardless of whether the claim accrued incident to the service of the claimant. (c) Personal injury and death claims. (1) Only after the death or personal injury has been determined to have not been incurred incident to the member's service should subparts C and D be studied to determine which, if either, provides a proper basis for settlement of the claim. In any event, the rule in U.S. v. Brooks , 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949) requiring setoff of amounts obtained though military or veterans' compensation systems against amounts otherwise recoverable will be followed. Other Government benefits funded by general Treasury revenues, not by the claimant's contributions, may also be used as a setoff against the settlement, for example, Overton v. United States , 619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1980). (2) As the incident to service issue is determinative as to whether this type of claim may be processed administratively, the applicable law and facts should be carefully considered before deciding that injury or death was not incident to service. Such claims also are often difficult to settle on the issue of quantum and thus more likely to end in litigation. Moreover, the United States may well elect to defend the lawsuit on the basis of the incident to service exclusion and this defense could be prejudiced by a contrary administrative determination that a service member's personal injuries or death were not incident to service. Doubtful cases will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS without action along with sufficient factual information to permit a determination of the incident to service question. §536.26 Property damage appraisers. (a) Appraisers will be used as follows: (1) Appraisers should be used in all claims where an appraisal is reasonably necessary and useful in effectuating the administrative settlement of the claim. Appraisals may not be economically feasible in some cases involving property damage of less than $100 per item and the extent of damage may be determined by personal inspection and agreement with the claimant. (2) Where an appraisal is considered necessary, the claims officer and claimant should mutually agree, whenever possible, upon a disinterested appraiser after determining the approximate cost of the appraisal. The method of payment should be agreed upon in advance. (i) If the claimant pays for the appraisal and can substantiate payment thereof by a paid bill or canceled check, such cost is a reimbursable element of damage.
