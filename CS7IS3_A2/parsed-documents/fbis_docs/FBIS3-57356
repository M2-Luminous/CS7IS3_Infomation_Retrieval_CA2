This policy should be the core of government actions," Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told a government meeting here today. The meeting focused on 1993 social and economic results of Kazakhstan and outlined actions for the immediate future. "We have been stating production recession, deterioration of financial situation and drop in the living standards for three years. The only reason we cited was breaking of economic relations between former Soviet republics accompanied with payment crisis and increase of the inflation. Generally, it is so, but internal processes in the economy and society testify to much more," added the president. In his opinion, their quality "gives rise to more profound consideration and slightly different conclusions". Last year three fourth of enterprises improved their work against the background of general production recession. Labor collectives of these plants have turned into genuine owners, adopted market laws and display independence and business-like attitudes. Those who still count on state support are not very successful, said the president. He called for more active reforms, denationalization and privatization of property. Kazakhstan failed to achieve economic stabilization in 1993. Production recession in all material productions and drop in the living standards are underway. The gross domestic product reduced by 12.9 per cent as compared to 1992. The production output decreased by 16.1 per cent, agricultural output by 9.8 per cent and construction works - by 25 per cent. Price liberalization without tough financial-budget and credit policy did not change much the economic recession tendency but resulted in uncontrolled price rise. Prices have went up most in the fuel and energy complex, metallurgy, the chemical and petrochemical industries. Consumer prices and tariffs increased by 23 times. The enormous increase of consumer prices resulted in a drop in the living standards. Their 1993 index is 2,265 per cent. Foodstuff prices increased by 23 times, prices on consumer goods - by 18 times and service tariffs - by 41 times. Stratification of the population goes on. Four fifth of the population are on the verge of poverty. The government plan for 1994 is expected to help overcome the economic crisis, said the meeting.
