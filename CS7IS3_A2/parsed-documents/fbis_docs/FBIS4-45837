Seven hundred and fifty-five drug users and 102 spouses of HIV infected IDU's were interviewed. Nine samples among 54 from 89 IDU's in cohort were tested as seroconversion. The seroconversion rate (incidence rate) in IDU's (per hundred person years) in Ruili, Longchuan, and Luxi as well were 40.0, 12.2 and 0, respectively in 1993, comparing to 43.2, 12.2 and 0 in 1992. Thirty-eight were tested as positive among 108 samples from 116 newly recruited IDU's. The seroprevalence rates in these three counties were 85.7 percent, 40.0 percent and 0 in 1993, comparing to 81.8 percent, 44.6 percent and 5.1 percent in 1992. A coordination of the level between seroconversion and seroprevalence was observed. An increasing trend of seroprevalence among the spouses of HIV positive IDU's was found, the seroprevalence rate were 3.1 percent in 1990, 9.8 percent in 1992 and 7.4 percent in 1993. More attention should be paid to Luxi where the ratio of intravenous drug user increased rapidly, although fewer positives and later starting of drug using was found in this county.
