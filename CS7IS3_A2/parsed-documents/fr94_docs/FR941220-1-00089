FR941220-1-00089 FR941220-1-00013 The proposed rule also implements the 1992 amendments to Section 202. These amendments limited a suspension issued by the Board to not more than one year, unless extended for not more than six additional months, to protect the public interest, or unless extended with the mortgagee's agreement. The amendments also clarified that the term ``mortgagee'' included lenders or loan correspondents approved under the National Housing Act. The proposed rule also would make conforming changes to HUD's regulations governing hearing officers, consistent with the proposed revisions both to the Board's regulations and to 24 CFR part 24, published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. No hearing will be conducted with respect to this proposed rule. Findings and Other Matters Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331) is unnecessary since the rule addresses administrative decisions whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of a project area or building. The Regulatory Flexibility Act Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary by his approval of this rule certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would implement statutory authority that is intended to protect the Department's programs from abusive practices, but it should have no adverse or disproportionate economic impact on small businesses. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant rule, as this term is defined in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes to the rule as a result of that review are contained in the public file for the rule in the Department's Office of the Rules Docket Clerk. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule alters the administrative procedures associated with the prosecution of abuses of HUD programs, but it has no impact on family-related concerns. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects are on individuals and businesses. Semiannual Agenda of Regulations This rule was listed as sequence number 1718 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on November 14, 1994 (59 FR 57632, 57640) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
