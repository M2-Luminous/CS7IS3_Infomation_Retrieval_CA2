[Begin Shevardnadze recording]] This will be a demonstration of what our troops are, what guarantees we have to defend our statehood if needed. [passage omitted] I would like to ask the organizers of the festivities to pay specil heed to refugees in Tbilisi as well in other places. Unfortunately, we are not rich but a kind word and basic concern can be spared in order that the refugees can feel that this is their celebration and their festival and that the Georgian state is concerned with their interest and is ready to protect each of its citizen and every family. [passage indistinct] We have taken an immense commitment. I request everyone to get to work. If our intentions do not come true and we fail to justify all hopes and redeem a promise given to our people and refugees in the first instance, a day will come when we will have to answer to these people for everything. That is why posing any obstacles is inadmissible today. The authorities must be given an opportunity to bring their endeavor to an end. The aim of all of us, including parties and political forces who are raging a battle against the authorities, is to secure a positive completion of the cause. Their target is the same. I do not believe that they are fighting to overthrow the government. They are fighting for a safe return of refugees, for getting guarantees of security. They doubt that ours is the right way. But only time can show whether the way is right or wrong. Therefore, while discussing this issue today, I have regarded it necessary to say a few words about this. I request all political parties, their leaders, members of parliament and leaders of public organizations to participate in these festive arrangements actively. [passage omitted] Lack of hope can drive the country to destruction. Our whole history has been a struggle for freedom, for independence, for hope. The hope saved Georgia. I appeal to all political parties to establish this hope on 26 May and let us all try to demonstrate unity and integrity for the sake of the country.
