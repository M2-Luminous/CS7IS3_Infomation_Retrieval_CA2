What is your opinion about Mr. Binder's generous declaration, according to which he would gladly pump water into the Szigetkoz area? [Rozsa] Mr. Binder also made such spectacular declarations before, as if he could solve the problem. These proposals would only be a patchwork because they do not change the basic problems. The basic problem is that, if the two states recognize the fact that the Danube is a border river, they have to also jointly bear its blessings, consequences, and threats. It is impossible to divide water; it is only possible to do something in this direction if one of the sides gives up his share by common agreement. When Julius Binder made his proposals, he did so for the benefit of the common property, but even if his plan succeeded, it would only be a sham solution. [Balazs] The Bos-Nagymaros issue disturbs Hungarian-Slovak relations considerably. However, the Hungarian Green Party is urging the construction of the power stations at Dunakiliti and Nagymaros. What is your opinion of this, as chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee and a member of the Coexistence Movement? [Rozsa] The recognition of differences is one of the major principles of Coexistence. A given country is trying to make use of this within its legal system for the benefit of the recognition of national minorities. Therefore, allow me not to interfere in the party struggles and the party concepts of another country. We will only get the guarantee of national minority recognition if we find the proper tone with the government at the given time and the given moment. If I speak about any of the political parties in Hungary, I will reopen the alleged or real wounds that threaten the constitutional guarantees of recognition of the ethnic Hungarians living here because we would again be accused of looking at Hungary and being led by Hungary. We could achieve results in the current political situation by not mentioning the facts and events outside the country. We are now preparing a law according to which large-scale projects cannot be carried out without the opinion of the public. The Slovak and Hungarian citizens living in the proximity of the dams should be the ones to express their opinions about the construction projects at Dunakiliti and Nagymaros, and, according to these opinions, one could say whether the project is good or bad. I detect a slight lack of responsibility in the fact that the Hungarian Green Party made declarations without being aware of these opinions. [Balazs] What are the harmful environmental effects of the Bos power station on the Csallokoz area? [Rozsa] Opinions differ on the level of the ground water at Csallokoz. Some people say that the level has increased; others say it has decreased. It is impossible to find this out in such a short time. [Balazs] Do you find it unfair that, while the drinking water of 47,000 people in the Szigetkoz area is endangered, no noticeable damage whatsoever has emerged at the Csallokoz? [Rozsa] We warned the Hungarians in time that the Slovaks would carry out the C version of the power station. You did not believe us at the time. The Slovak leadership made an issue of prestige out of this and mobilized all of its power to carry out this plan. With the construction of the power station at Dunakiliti, the distribution of water would have been in the Hungarians' hands. But the Hungarians rejected the idea and thus are now at the mercy of the Slovak side. [Balazs] What chances of a joint solution do you see in the current situation? [Rozsa] The basic concept of a broad coalition on this issue is that we must settle the conflict with our neighbors. We must negotiate. You must understand that our broad coalition is so diverse that it will be difficult to carry out this process. It is not easy for the right and the left to come to a consensus. The solution can only be found in something similar to what was recently said in Prague, with the participation of the environmental protection committees of nine Central European countries. National parks should be set up in natural areas divided by borders, and the affected countries would share the responsibility for them.
