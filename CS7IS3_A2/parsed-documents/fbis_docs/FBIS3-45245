The Xiang Shan Conference, an annual high-level scientific meeting held in the Xiang Shan (Fragrant Hills) outside Beijing, will organize about 20 seminars this year compared with eight last year when it was first initiated and sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences for discussing the direction of scientific research. "The conference aims at foreseeing the development of frontier sciences, especially cross-discipline sciences," said Cao Xiaoye, of the organizing committee. Cao said the organizing committee is requesting suggestions on seminar subjects nationwide. The first seminar this year is expected to be held in April. Any Chinese scientists can apply to host or attend the conference. "Foreign scientists and Chinese scientists working or studying abroad are also eligible to apply," Cao said. Meanwhile, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is considering inviting some Nobel Prize winners to address the conference this year or next year. The conference is part of the effort to make China one of the scientific powerhouses in the world. Cao said that China has many good scientists, but needs some leading scientists who are capable of guiding the country's scientific research. "Our conference is targeted at opening the minds of scientists and nurturing a group of leading scientists," he said.
