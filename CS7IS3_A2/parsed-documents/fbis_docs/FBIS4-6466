The Amnesty International recently called on the world people and human rights organisations to launch a campaign for his release. The Central Committee of the Malian Red Cross in a statement of March 25 noted that though An Hak-sop was arrested while discharging his military duty, he was kept in South Korean prison for more than 40 years on a "spy" charge. The statement strongly urged the South Korean authorities to immediately release An Hak-sop and other prisoners of war and political prisoners. The Senegalese organisation for friendship with the fraternal Korean people in a statement of April 6 branded the persecution of An Hak-sop as a wanton violation of human rights and affirmatively appraised the appeal of the Amnesty International for his release.
