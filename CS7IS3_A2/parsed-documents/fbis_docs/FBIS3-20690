This time it was over the article "Are Stipe Mesic, Josip Manolic, and Gojko Susak Leaving Office?," which analyzes the dramatic crescendo in the second round of conflicts in the leadership of the HDZ. Supporting its story with a top-level source (in the previous case the regime's newspapers accused Josip Manolic of leaking state secrets), GLOBUS explicitly claims that 20 days ago President Tudjman proposed that Mesic, chairman of the parliament, resign, which Mesic refused. GLOBUS's source further claims that, with regard to Mesic's reluctance to resign, the change is not certain for the time being, because the power structure in parliament is such that Mesic has the full support of HDZ deputies, and most probably among the opposition. Strategic Differences in Opinions As for Manolic, the chairman of the parliament's Chamber of Counties, Tudjman has not yet recommended that he resign, which does not mean that such a request might not be made soon. Manolic, at one time a very close Tudjman aide and the second most powerful man in Croatia, today disagrees with the president over the majority of strategic issues. Everything that they argued about before the 2d General Convention of the HDZ has recently escalated: in the first place on the policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the attitude toward that legal state. Furthermore, they disagree about the further political orientation of the HDZ, as well as about the choice of the party's leadership. The depth of that breach is clearly shown in an interview with Manolic, where he asks: "And why should the HDZ exist at all?" Manolic's view is that the HDZ's work is, actually, at an end, that is to say, it took power from the communists, but he obviously disagrees that the HDZ should remain in power at any price, particularly not by straying into a dangerous, right-wing direction, to put it mildly. Similar views are also held by Mesic, who at this moment has been pushed to the margins, just like the entire parliament after all. However, since he, according to the Constitution, potentially holds the second most important position in Croatia, because as the chairman of parliament he is also the president's deputy, it is quite logical for pressures to be put on him to resign, but he is also doing everything to avoid that. As for the strongest representative of the right wing, Defense Minister Gojko Susak, who is very close to President Tudjman, but also has strong connections with Herceg-Bosna, actually his real base, he can also no longer boast of Tudjman's trust as much as he was able to until recently. There are two major charges against him: Susak is reproached for the catastrophic situation in Herceg-Bosna, and blamed for the tragedy of the Croats in central Bosnia, while he is also considered responsible for the underdevelopment of the Croatian military-industrial complex. Of course, Susak's name is inseparable from Mate Boban, who again failed to appear in Geneva, sending Mile Akmadzic as a replacement, who actually signed the agreement with [Bosnian Serb] Nikola Koljevic. Tudjman had already explained earlier that Boban had not been suspended, but the issue has to do with a concession to the Muslims, who directly accuse Boban of initiating the Croat-Muslim war. The Time Factor Manolic, who again gave an interview to GLOBUS, says, commenting on Tudjman's explanation: "Perhaps that answer may satisfy some people, but not necessarily all people." However, he has also gone a step further in making accusations at the expense of Boban and Susak. He claims that "Boban called on the citizens of central Bosnia many times to leave their homes, offering them vast and fertile pieces of land on the Adriatic coast, in Istria, and on the islands. This was a strategic error of Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the Croats were being called on to leave the land where their roots are. Such a policy would mean the Serbs crossing the Drina River and joining Knin to greater Serbia. The architects of Croatian policy in Bosnia, who are largely influenced by Herzegovinian reality, are unacceptably sensitive to any critical view, still considering their policy to be the best. However, the results have invalidated their view and led them into ever greater isolation." Manolic disagrees with Susak that Croatia should intervene militarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because "anybody who makes such statements must know what they mean for the Croatian state." Manolic does not even try to hide the fact that he is in open conflict with the defense minister, but he is uncertain what the conclusion will be: Whether one of them will have to leave, or if the entire issue will be left to the drift of time. However, what he most frequently argues about with his opponents, who call him a former agent of UDBA [State Security Administration, the former Yugoslav secret police] and a communist, is his assessment in one word of the effectiveness of the lawful state: Catastrophic! "Murders, violence, evictions, frame-ups, smuggling -- all these have become everyday occurrences. Still, the worst thing is that a very small number of cases are investigated, and a very small number come to court. The war explains the increased violence, but independently of the war, the authorities must not tolerate murder, or let the murderers get away with it." However, that something is going on has been confirmed by an article by a minor journalist (Ante Gugo) in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, which should be read only because that newspaper customarily expresses the attitudes of the authorities. Which is to say, this journalistic apprentice, who became the chief of NEDJELJNA DALMACIJA correspondent's bureau overnight, claims that the story about Mesic's suspension has been carefully safeguarded, and that is only 45 days old. According to Gugo, the removal of Vice Vukojevic, "the man who most openly opposed the desired and badly needed reconciliation of the Croatian people within itself," demanded a sacrifice to be made by the other side as well. A scapegoat was found in Mesic, because his open confrontation with Tudjman's policy makes his departure even less curious, whereas the chances that Manolic will be suspended, as well as that Susak's position as defense minister will be taken over by Franjo Greguric, are less likely. According to this interpretation, Manolic is one of the most active cofounders of the party, a relentlessly cunning and lucid man, who can be counted upon in critical situations, while representing no danger, because he has only a honorary function. As for Susak, he is to be given the greatest credit "for the implementation of many things in the army and the system of defense," and thanks to him, Croatian soldiers "are eating the same food as NATO soldiers, and smoking Marlboro cigarettes in crush-proof packs." Disagreements Although it is completely clear that the conflict within the HDZ is still not over, and that all the disagreements and differences of concepts have only now come to light (it was noticed that at the latest session of the Presidential Defense Council Manolic, Mesic, and Vrdoljak were all absent, while at the same time Ivan Bobetko stated that he would be extending his membership in the HDZ, because the stream of former UDBA agents had definitely lost the battle; he also said that if they had won power, it would have completely ruined Croatia, which it is still doing under the wing of Glavas in Osijek), the party's Council states that "the misinformation about the rifts in the leadership are not true and quite malicious. Furthermore, speculation about the suspensions of some top officials, particularly Mssrs. Mesic, Manolic, and Susak is also false. It is not true that the president of the republic has demanded Mesic's resignation, while the only truth is that Mesic is having his annual vacation, and he will be staying abroad for a while." (By the way, to journalists who asked why Mesic took a month's vacation in the middle of winter and on the eve of the parliamentary session scheduled for 25 January, Manolic wittily answered: "Well, he probably likes skiing!") However, the HDZ Council has not remained on the defensive, as it also says that "some moves and demands by some opposition parties aimed at causing a constitutional crisis and prompting early elections obviously do not contribute to the consolidation of internal stability and the international status of Croatia, but are quite probably aimed at the destabilization of the democratic process. Their goal is to stir up dissatisfaction among the people, even social disorder by encouraging strikes, and also, as they themselves say, cooperation with a sane part of the HDZ, in order to cause a constitutional crisis and a change of administration." Where The Problem Lies And then there comes probably the most significant part of the statement, that sounds as if it had been rewritten from not so old [Communist] Party documents: "All of this is to be viewed in the context of speculations disseminated by the opposition and certain foreign circles about the need to find acceptable successors to the current leaders in Croatia, as well as in other states that came about with the collapse of former Yugoslavia." In addition to the fact that it was the first time that the HDZ, although indirectly, had defended its greatest enemy, namely Milosevic, the further course of events has shown where the problem lies. The government has passed the Law on Internal Affairs, where one clause says that "the president of the Republic of Croatia is the supreme commander of all units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs." If we connect this with the statement made by the Council of the HDZ, and thereafter with the statement of Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general and head of the Cabinet of the President of the Republic, that "papers have already been circulating throughout Croatia for many months, which actually come from abroad, containing instructions on how to destabilize the authorities," then it is clear that more and more arguments are being invented for the current semipresidential system, called superpresidential by many people, to strengthen itself even further. Under the pretext of conspiracies at home and abroad, Tudjman is trying to strengthen and legalize his self-governing even more, which is made through the ever greater marginalization of the parliament, as well as of the HDZ, which has been reduced to a bureaucratic apparatus full of anonymous people. It seems that Tudjman, as well as Manolic, understand that the HDZ has played out its role -- it won the elections and came to power -- but since it is gradually turning into something like the former Socialist Association, that supports only one policy, it will be used merely as a voting machine for as long as possible. The question is how long things will work that way, and whether the steps like the Geneva agreement with the FRY will help the plan or frustrate it. When, and if, it comes to disorder, one knows what ought to be done. Of course, there is no chance that early elections might be announced, because, according to the opinion polls, a third of the population supports early elections. The reason is that, although the HDZ still leads with 33.8 percent, with the Croatian Social Liberal Party led by Drazen Budisa are at its heels with 33.1 percent, in early elections the HDZ could hardly win such a large parliamentary majority as it has now. Which is to say, all this has to do with the most typical power struggle, and now one can see how truthful the statement by one of the more prominent HDZ officials was: "Now it is our turn to rule for the next 45 years!" Only then might it happen that the ruling party changes its name into HDZ -- the Party of Democratic Changes.
