The preceding months were not overly calm ones, but nevertheless it was possible to create a military formation that is viable. Without exaggerating, the changes had an impact not only on the organization itself, but significantly on the lives of people. We spoke about it last week with General Staff Colonel Vaclav Prazak, who commands the brigade. [Stana] What developments immediately preceded the establishment of the brigade? [Prazak] We did not build our organization from scratch. We made use of a portion of our experiences and proven methods of work dating back to the time of the 2d Mechanized Division. But in no case was the introduction of changes a mere paper war involving numbers of soldiers and equipment. We attempted to create a body that will be far more flexible and viable. I believe that we succeeded. Some formations and units disappeared, particularly the larger groupings of troops at Klatovy and Vimperk. Currently, the brigade is deployed in the regions of western and southern Bohemia, specifically within the garrisons at Susice, Janovice nad Uhlavou, Strasice, Klatovy, and Vimperk. [Stana] It is frequently said that the best people have left the Army. Do you hold the same opinion? [Prazak] I would not agree that the best people have left our units. But I also do not claim that we are not concerned about some of those who did leave. There are enough people who, even though they have stopped wearing the uniform, are continuing to work at jobs set aside for civil servants. A lot of people also had to leave on the basis of the results of the extraordinary evaluations. But I say again--the overwhelming majority of those who are serving in our units today are good professionals who were afforded the opportunity to show their capabilities. [Stana] Did senior commanders have the opportunity to decide with whom they wished to cooperate, who would be assigned to functions, let us say, at staff levels and at company levels? [Prazak] This rule was one of the basic principles governing the work of commanders. I can say with a clear conscience that the General Staff truly gave us a certain amount of freedom of action in that direction and that we attempted to make the best use of it. After a long period of the most varied notions and verbal assurances, we were given the opportunity at the brigade level to work independently. I would like to see us have a similar opportunity even with respect to the preparation of training, in the everyday command and control of units. [Stana] Does the same rule also apply to you with respect to the battalions? [Prazak] Anyone who, as a commander, had experienced the previously constant controls and so-called assistance, which, however, did not benefit anyone in any manner, cannot act otherwise. Yes, people at battalion level enjoy the confidence of the brigade command, and our mutual professional relationships have an appropriate form. In my opinion, this is one of the significant and substantial changes. A number of commanders are already saying today that it is far more complicated. But it is one of the first and essential steps along the difficult road to perfection and professionalism. [Stana] What do you expect of the new organizational structure at brigade level? [Prazak] People in all positions, beginning with the brigade commander and ending with the soldiers at company level, should be closer to each other. This could exert a decisive influence not only on mutual relationships, but also on the level of training and, last but not least, on one of the most problematic areas, which is behavior or, if you like, discipline. An improvement in command and control would then follow as a matter of fact. While we have already experienced a little of the command and control in practice, we have a lot more to learn with respect to discipline. [Stana] If the Army lacks anything, it is undoubtedly a professional corps of noncommissioned officers, so-called career soldiers. The situation is not even favorable with respect to platoon commanders. Are you thinking, at brigade level, how to change the currently unfavorable situation? [Prazak] We have a long way to go before we reach the ideal situation, and, in the immediate future, I do not believe that much will change in this direction. We are badly in need of good noncommissioned officers, but interest in service as a noncommissioned officer is minimal for several reasons. One of these is the fact that, even if we have an interested individual, we have nothing specific we can offer him. In brief, appropriate legislation is lacking. And no one will swallow the bait of mere words. For the most part, people ask what is in it for them. It is true that we also have a shortage of platoon commanders. For the present, we will have to staff these positions precisely with the best noncommissioned officers. We are also getting ready to visit military schools to offer future military professionals the prospects of service in our brigade. We would like to have them come to visit our garrisons even before they make a decision. [Stana] Naturally, systems changes also call for certain financial expenditures. Do you have sufficient resources to realize your intentions? [Prazak] We are not bad off. The only thing we are short of are resources for construction and housing services. For example, there is a shortage of funds to complete the facilities at Janovice--the mess hall, the military enterprise kitchen, the dispensary.... The other limits are adequate for the brigade. [Stana] What kind of equipment does the brigade have? [Prazak] Our battalions have T-72 tanks, Models 1 and 2 infantry combat vehicles, and the artillery has D-30 howitzers. The combined arms formations are, of course, equipped with special equipment.
