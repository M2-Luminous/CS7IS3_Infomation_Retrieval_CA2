While delivering a summary speech at one of the study courses, provincial party committee Secretary Xie Fei pointed out: It is a good way of doing things for provincial and city leaders to study theory, discuss major issues, exchange experiences, deepen their understanding, acquire clear line of thinking, and promote work. He stressed: Leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to studying theory by relating major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation; earnestly master Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and master basic knowledge about the market economy, as well as about modern science and technology, so as to apply this knowledge to the solution of practical problems and to open up a new prospect in work. In his summary speech at the completion of the study courses, Huang Huahua, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out: Leaders at all levels must genuinely regard theory study as an important task, and must make unremitting efforts to carry it out.
