[passage omitted] A meeting took place with representatives of the command staff of the peacekeeping forces. A number of important issues were discussed. It was pointed out that the motor bridge over the Inguri River is practically restored. Checkpoints were established at both ends of the bridge and the important location is under complete control of the peacekeeping forces. The Enguri hydroelectric power station and its security and operation were seriously considered. The station as well as other important objects are guarded by units of peacekeeping forces stationed in the area. Thus, the Abkhaz side has no formal reasons to limit power supplies. A common opinion was voiced on ways to prevent the Abkhaz side from resorting to such actions. This is expected to happen in the near future. As for security in the zone, the representatives of the peacekeeping forces said that the number of observation points and checkpoints established there ensures security. It was also mentioned that there is a greater number of checkpoints in Gali Rayon. The Georgian side voiced several considerations, namely, the failure to make an official decision on the participation of all sides in manning the checkpoints. Because of the Abkhazian side's opposition, representatives of the Georgian side have not been involved in the operation of the Sukhumi territorial headquarters of peacekeeping forces.
