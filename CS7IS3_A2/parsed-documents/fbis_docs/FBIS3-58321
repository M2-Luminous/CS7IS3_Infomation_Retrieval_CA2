Government leaders from the Atlantic alliance signed an agreement on Partnership for Peace to this effect in Brussels. President Clinton claimed a second success in Brussels: Ukraine, Russia and the United States will sign an agreement on Friday [14 Janurary] on the removal of all nuclear weapons from Ukraine. Ukraine inherited the world's third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union: 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles with 1,500 atomic warheads. The U.S. President showed some sympathy for the NATO position that military actions in Bosnia, like air strikes against Serbian positions around Sarajevo, could no longer be excluded. "But these warnings must be more than hollow phrases. Those besieging Sarajevo must understand that we are serious," Clinton said. Prime Minister Lubbers spoke in a similar vein. "If it is necessary, you have to do it. In our view, it is really necessary. It would also increase the credibility of the alliance." It was confirmed at the NATO summit that the approval of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was necessary for any military intervention in Bosnia. Still No Perspective of Concerted Action From NATO Member States Despite growing readiness among the NATO member states to take a tougher line in Bosnia, concerted action is still a distant perspective. There are also no signs that Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is giving the UN commanders in the former Yugoslavia a free hand to take actions. In principle, the NATO member states have been in agreement for months about committing more soldiers to protect aid convoys to Sarajevo and the "safe areas" for the civilian population. Air strikes were also said to be a possibility to protect UN troops. But as Foreign Minister Kooijmans indicated, NATO had to be ready to implement its threats. Back in August, it was declared that the member states would supply ground troops and air support. Fifty thousand soldiers were mentioned, half were supposed to come from the United States. But so far nothing has happened, because the NATO countries are divided on how to put decisions into practice. However, Prime Minister Lubbers rejected the existence of two camps in NATO. French President Mitterrand is a strong supporter of intervention, while Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called for supporting the Bosnian government and lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims. The British Prime Minister Major dropped his initial hesitations about maintaining British troops in Bosnia. "They will remain this winter. We will take another look in the spring, depending on the political situation," he said. Canada has the greatest reservations about a large-scale military intervention in Bosnia. Prime Minister Lubbers still believed the presence of Netherlands troops was very useful, but added "the military experts must be listened to properly." He openly admitted that "peace could not be enforced with violence." "For the Netherlands," Lubbers said. "The most important goal remains offering people help on the ground, although it is difficult to decide which means must be used to do so." In the end, peace could only be reached if the warring parties decided to lay down their arms, President Clinton once again emphasized. He clearly showed that the United States did not see much point in repeating in the final declaration what NATO has already threatened in the past -- air strikes against Serbian positions. Safety The United States had been ready to carry out these attacks, but the European partners were against them, because the air strikes would have affected negatively the safety of UN soldiers in Bosnia who accompany UN aid convoys. Now the United States no longer has any inclination to play a leading role, although Clinton made another attempt to break through the impasse. "At stake is not only the safety of the people of Sarajevo and the possibility of bringing this tragedy to an end, but also NATO's credibility," he said. The talks in Bonn between Bosnian President Izetbegovic and his Croatian counterpart Tudjman seemed to be successful yesterday: Bosnian Muslims and Croats were said to be ready to respect a cease-fire in central Bosnia. It is unclear when the cease-fire is to take effect.
