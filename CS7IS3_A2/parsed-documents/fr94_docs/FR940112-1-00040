ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of time. SUMMARY: The Commission extends the time for filing reply comments in its proceeding 58 FR 62085, 11/24/93, proposing to amend the Commission's rules regarding major cable television markets from January 4, 1994 to January 18, 1994. This action is being taken to allow parties additional time to analyze and address numerous issues concerning adjustments to particularly large and complex television markets. DATES: Reply comments are now due on or before January 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Alan E. Aronowitz, Mass Media Bureau, Policy and Rules Division, (202) 632&hyph;7792. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Matter of Amendment of section 76.51 of the Commission's rules to include Newton, New Jersey, and Riverhead, New York, in the New York, New York-Linden-Paterson-Newark, New Jersey, Television Market. ORDER Adopted: January 3, 1994. Released: January 4, 1994. Reply Comment Date: January 18, 1994. By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau: 1. We now consider a Motion for Extension of Time for the filing of reply comments in the above-captioned proceeding filed on December 22, 1993, by WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc. (``WLIG''), licensee of Television Station WLIG&hyph;TV, Riverhead, New York, and proponent of the amendment of section 76.51 of the rules to include Riverhead in the subject market. The deadline for filing comments in this proceeding was December 20, 1993, and reply comments are due January 4, 1994. 2. WLIG states that although comments were all filed on December 20, 1993, copies were not received by counsel until December 21 and 22. Seven sets of comments were filed. WLIG contends that the comments respond to a number of issues raised in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1 which must be studied and addressed. Although WLIG has begun the process, it requests, noting the intervention of two Federal holidays, the press of other year-end responsibilities, and pre-exiting vacation schedules, an additional nine business days, until January 18, 1994, to file its reply comments. Inasmuch as this proceeding was initiated, in part, by WLIG, it urges that the additional time will foster the paramount public interest in the development of a full public record for the Commission's decision. 2 1 8 FCC Rcd 8136 (1993). 2 WLIG states that counsel for Mountain Broadcasting Corporation, the other original petitioner in this proceeding, has indicated no objection to the requested extension. Further, counsel for those filing comments in this proceeding have indicated no objection to WLIG's request. 3. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.46, it is our policy that extensions of time for filing comments in rule making proceedings shall not be routinely granted. However, we note that the Notice of Proposed Rule Making raises numerous issues concerning adjustments to particularly large and complex television markets, and therein we specifically state our desire for additional information to develop a comprehensive record before deciding these matters. Thus, it appears reasonable to provide the commenting parties additional time to analyze and address these issues. Therefore, we will extend the deadline for filing reply comments in this proceeding to January 18, 1994. 4. Accordingly, It is Ordered, that the Motion for Extension of Time filed by WLIG&hyph;TV, Inc. IS GRANTED, and the time for filing reply comments in this proceeding Is Extended to January 18, 1994. 5. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and section 0.204(b), 0.283, and 1.45 of the Commission's rules. Federal Communications Commission Roy J. Stewart, Chief, Mass Media Bureau. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;659 Filed 1&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;&hyph;01&hyph;M
