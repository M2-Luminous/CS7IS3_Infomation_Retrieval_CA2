International wire services have, over the past few hours, reported that the U.S. State Department will no longer cooperate with Colombian justice. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Attorney General, what is the official information or reaction to reports by international wire services that U.S. legal assistance to Colombia has been suspended? [Arrieta] Diego, the information I have from Colombian authorities is that this is not true. [Reporter] Where could this information have originated then? [Arrieta] I do not know. I think there are too many misunderstandings on this topic, too many unverified reports circulating. The truth is that the news could have come from any of these confusing reports. I reiterate, however, that according to the information I have, this is not true. [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, what is the situation right now regarding U.S.-Colombian relations in conjunction with exchanging legal information relating to drug trafficking? [Arrieta] These past few weeks we have talked with the U.S. State Department through the U.S. Embassy and with the support of the Colombian Government. The idea is to bolster this process because we believe that it continues to be fundamental for carrying out surrender policies and legal actions in Colombia. I do not think there is any sense in denying that relations have been tense and difficult, but we are working on this and I hope it turns out well and we will be able to rebuild the judicial cooperation program. [Reporter] Does cooperation continue despite current problems? [Arrieta] Yes, we have received cooperation these past few days. Obviously, the intensity and level has dropped significantly, but I repeat, I believe it will recover. [end recording]
