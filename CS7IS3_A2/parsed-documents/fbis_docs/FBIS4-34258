Figueres arrived at noon aboard an airplane provided by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo in the company of Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, and Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, who continued their journeys to their respective countries this afternoon. Figueres said during a news conference that one of the topics discussed in Colombia was the possibility of negotiating jointly a free trade agreement in the near future, taking private sectors "very much into consideration." Central Americans want Colombia and Venezuela to grant them an asymmetrical preference treatment in terms of value added and place of origin rules, as well as in terms of the time it would take for the agreements to enter into force. On another topic of interest to the region, namely its electricity power grid, Figueres said Spain is willing to finance the first $100 million the project costs, with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing the remaining $350 million. Spain will also contribute $320 million to the financing the IDB will grant for other projects in those countries. According to Figueres, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez pledged to decide on the Central American request to Spain to provide capitalization funds to the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE). For this purpose, Gaviria offered approximately $70 million, Argentine President Carlos Menem, 60 million [currency not specified], and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera talked of the possibility that his country will contribute 122.5 million [currency not specified], an amount similar to that which Mexico had provided to the BCIE. Figueres said he felt "very satisfied" with the results of the Ibero-American summit and the accompanying bilateral and multilateral meetings, where, he said, the participants discussed the topics of democracy, independence of the Judicial Branch, strengthening electoral courts, commercial exchange, human rights, the war on poverty, and the need to boost social investments, among many others.
