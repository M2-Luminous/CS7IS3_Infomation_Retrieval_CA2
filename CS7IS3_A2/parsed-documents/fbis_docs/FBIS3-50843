This was an important meeting between the presidents of political blocs and permanent committees on 6 January at the Legislative Palace. The great majority of the 20 parliamentarians who participated in this meeting supported the idea of holding a national conference in Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the crisis. Chamber of Deputies President Antoine Joseph asserts that the issue of the parliamentarians elected on 18 January was also tackled. Joseph refused to announce the decision on that issue made by the presidents of the political blocs within the Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph: [Begin recording, in Creole] The first point on the agenda was an analysis of the general situation of the country. Then there was an inventory or outline of the legislative works to set up during the seventh ordinary session of the 45th Legislature. Finally, we had questions of general interest. We have not yet gone through the second point, but there was great debate as to the general situation of the country. One of the main ideas that has come out is that all political groups that were present...[rephrases] the presidents of the political groups encourage, on behalf of the groups, the idea that a national conference be held in the country with the participation of all sectors concerned in the Haitian crisis and all those who are examining the country's situation. With the exception of the National Front for Change and Democracy, which says it has a slight reservation, between now and tomorrow [7 January] we will sign a common document in which we will formally encourage the national conference. But it is clear that something has been accomplished. There are four political groups which numerically are a majority within the Chamber of Deputies; we can say the majority of the Chamber of Deputies encourages the idea of a national conference. [end recording] This was Deputy Antoine Joseph, president of the Chamber of Deputies that supports the idea of holding a national conference in Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the Haitian crisis.
