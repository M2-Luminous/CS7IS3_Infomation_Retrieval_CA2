Participants in it will discuss the time for Russian troops withdrawal from Estonia. It's common knowledge that late last year Russia proposed to conclude the withdrawal of its remaining 25 hundred servicemen by August 31, on condition that social guarantees be granted to Russian military retirees living in Estonia. Tallinn views this demand as "overstepping the framework of agreement and running counter to the bill on aliens adopted in Estonia." Lately Estonian diplomacy "discredited itself" in the "Russian direction", a senior Russian diplomat in charge of Baltic problems told Interfax. As he said, realizing the futility of its attempts to "turn the talks held on the level of governmental delegations in its own favor, the Estonian leadership is increasingly active in its efforts to raise them to the level of presidents." "In fact, President Lennart Meri makes no secret of his wish to come to Moscow and meet with Boris Yeltsin. However Russia's attitude to this issue remains unchanged -- a meeting between the two presidents can take place only if the Estonian side agrees to sign the entire package of "military" agreements with Russia. Apart from the main treaty on troops withdrawal, these documents include an agreement on social guarantees for Russian military retirees and their families. To Russia this agreement is no less important than the treaty on troops withdrawal, but Tallinn stubbornly refuses to sign it," the diplomat said. According to him, "it's hard to expect any serious shifts" from the present round of Russian-Estonian talks." "No illusions should be nurtured in this respect. Estonian diplomats drove themselves into a corner, and now they will find it hard to get out of it," said Interfax's interviewee.
