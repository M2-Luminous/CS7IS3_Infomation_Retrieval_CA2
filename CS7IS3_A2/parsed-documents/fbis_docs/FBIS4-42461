Referring to the migration of Kurdish villagers, first brought to public attention earlier this month and which some sources claim has been going on for months, Salim Sakik, deputy for Sirnak from the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP), said on Thursday [26 May] that government allegations on this subject were false. Addressing Parliament Sakik said that he had personally talked to people leaving for Northern Iraq and concluded that they were being forced out of their villages by special security forces operating in the region and by government armed village guards. Sakik said these people numbered around 13,000 and had to be helped. He asked for a Parliamentary delegation to be sent to the region to investigate the matter first-hand and to report back on its findings. Responding to the charges levelled by Sakik, Minister for Interior Nahit Mentese repeated to Parliament his government's view that the whole thing was "a new tactical move by the PKK." "The PKK has induced these people to go to Northern Iraq by making various promises to them" Mentese said, going on to indicate that the Turkish security forces were in the region to protect innocent citizens. Referring to the fight against the PKK Mentese added that the "state was in a condition of self defense" in the region. Mentese also pointed to the fact that Sakik had not condemned the PKK for its recent attacks during which innocent women and children were among those killed. He repeated that the Turkish security forces were trying to protect these people and recalled that the government had called on those who had migrated to return to their country and their homes. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told reporters yesterday that talks had been held in Geneva with U.N. officials about the subject of the migration of villagers from southeast Anatolia to northern Iraq. Ataman refrained from elaborating on this further but merely repeated Ankara's contention that the migration was a "PKK ploy." He also said that these people should not be considered as refugees. Kurdish sources in Diyarbakir have told the Turkish Daily News [TDN] that the migration was taking place because local people had been caught between the PKK and the security forces in what is becoming an increasingly acrimonious and violent war. One of those who has decided to migrate to northern Iraq, Abdullah Yilmaz, the DEP candidate for mayor of Uludere in the March local elections, claimed people had decided to flee from his region because of pressure from the government-appointed local prefect and from the regional security chief. "There is a war raging on between Turkey and the PKK and it is the civilian population which is being harmed in this war. Many villages have been totally evacuated as a result," Yilmaz said. He added that after he had given up his candidacy for mayor of Uludere he had been subjected to great pressure from local officials including "being dragged around the streets." Indicating that such behaviour by the authorities had been instrumental in causing people to flee their homes for northern Iraq, Yilmaz said that around 6,000 had left from 14 villages in the Uludere region alone because some of these villages had been forcefully evacuated by the security forces and others bombed by them. Speaking to the TDN in the Bihere region Yilmaz said the main blame for the mass migration rested with the Turkish Security forces. "The state is pressuring us in every way possible. The PKK is not pressuring us. We came here to get away from it all but they are still firing artillery shells on us. Planes are flying over our heads. We are being subjected to inhuman behaviour. Our children are afraid. We can not make our voices heard in the world. If international organizations do not take this matter in hand many people will die" Yilmaz said. Other sources said that recent village evacuations had been concentrated in the Diyarbakir and Bingol regions. They named Diyarbakir's counties of Kulp and Lica and Bingol's county of Genc as examples. The sources said that these regions were the scenes of intense military activity over the past month and claimed that special security forces were engaging in operations against villages in the region in conjunction with bombing of these villages. Other counties attached to Diyarbakir, such as Hani, Dicle and Silvan have started to be targeted in the past few days in the same way, these sources claimed. Meanwhile some sources are saying that the exodus into northern Iraq is much greater that the figures quoted to date and indicate that up to 30,000 people may be involved. According to some accounts reaching Ankara, villagers from Hakkari's Cukurca region have also started to stream into northern Iraq's Seranish and Sinaht areas.
