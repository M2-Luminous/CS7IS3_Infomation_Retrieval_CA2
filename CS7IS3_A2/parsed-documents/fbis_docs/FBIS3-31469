The resolution of the Greek Government that put a stop to the Greek Consulate's activities in Skopje and blocked the trade of goods from the port of Salonika has certainly indicated that after assuming, more or less, the role of observer the past few months, Greece decided this was the proper time to flex its muscles -- by using the only trumps it has against Macedonia. Of course, we here exclude the possibility of a military threat (after closing the border and withdrawing the diplomats, practically the only thing that can follow is a proclamation of war) and, at least for now, nobody even thinks this is in Papandreou's bag of surprises. Greece has embarked on a course of either losing it all or getting it all, evidently figuring it will get it "all," which can be interpreted as "accomplishing a change in the flag and correction of the Constitution." To Macedonia's constant efforts to reach out, Athens replied in a manner totally inconsistent with the proclaimed stance that "Greece is interested in having a stable and independent country on its northern border." It is also inconsistent with the norms of interstate relations. It is impossible to believe that Papandreou has ignored the fact that he is undertaking such an action during Greece's tenure of the chairmanship the European Union, with all the attendant consequences and blights to its reputation, which will be even more affected now. It is also improbable that Papandreou has not taken into account the statement made by German Spokesman Vogel, who said after the first Greek threats that Greece could not close the border with Macedonia because it was not its own but that of the European Union. Why did Athens, in the middle of this seemingly unfavorable situation for itself, decide to take this step? There are only two possible explanations. It is either a desperate attempt on the part of the insulted, who had expected some concessions on the eve of U.S. recognition, or Papandreou knows a lot! Let us imagine a hypothetical situation in which, for instance, Macedonia and Greece are prepared, or have agreed, to make a barter agreement: Greece will "get" the flag and the correction of the Constitution by adopting the minority rights article from their constitution; in return, Macedonia will be recognized by the United States and Greece will not veto its admission to the CSCE. If that is correct, then Papandreou's move can be seen as a kind of blackmail of the Macedonian Government, pressuring it to fulfill its part in the disputed questions without previous negotiations. And there is more to it. Right or wrong, Athens considers itself outwitted by Macedonia and President Gligorov, whom they consider to be the personification of Macedonian policy. Is this not a "thug's" reply by the unpredictable head of the Greek government, who is giving the ball back to Gligorov when the latter's hands are practically tied with the closure of the border, even if he wanted to make a "gesture of good will." If he does not relent -- the problem will remain, with greater shame and degradation for Greece's reputation in the eyes of the international public. If Gligorov relents -- he himself will be accused of surrendering to Greek pressure, which could engender unpredictable internal political complications. All this written down on paper may look like yet another example of the Balkan inclination to overanalyze things, however, taking into consideration the twists in the dispute thus far, it is not unlikely that Papandreou will try to absolve himself, preparing a "trap for Gligorov" at the same time. If we read the essential part of his statement, we once again see the same hypocrisy as usual. Papandreou said: "So far, Skopje has made absolutely no effort to demonstrate its wisdom and moderation," which is a blatant lie. To begin with, Macedonia uses every possible opportunity to call for discussions on "all outstanding questions." Macedonia continually reiterates its readiness to sign an agreement on respecting borders, friendship, goodneighborly relations, and cooperation.... Has Athens officially asked itself how it looks when someone is constantly demanding something, without an expression of good will or the offer of anything in return. We have yet to note a Greek gesture of rapprochement. It would be difficult to minimize the closing of the borders, but it shouldn't be exaggerated, either. We say -- closing of the border, not -- "a halt to the trade of goods from the Port of Salonika" (as Papandreou whimsically referred to it, avoiding the unpopular phrase), because that is essentially what has been going on since yesterday. If the Greek Consulate is closed down there are no visas, and if there are no visas, nobody can cross the border. If trade is not allowed from Salonika, it means that fuel and all trade from Greece will dry out. Nevertheless, on the other hand, one should not overestimate the effect because it would appear that Macedonia has enough fuel reserves right now. To its constant efforts to reach out to its southern neighbor, Macedonia has experienced a truly incredible reply, outside the realm of good behavior....
