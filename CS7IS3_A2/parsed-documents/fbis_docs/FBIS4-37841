"There are about 26 questions that have been postponed at the Cairo agreement," Sha'th told reporters here, blaming Israel for delays in negotiations. The disputed points in the Israeli-PLO accord mainly centre on the borders of the self-rule enclaves of Jericho and the Gaza Strip, "which Yasir 'Arafat amended on the map on the day of the signing," Sha'th said. He said Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation would resume talks on the extension of self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday, "probably in the occupied territories." He accused Israel of delaying the talks since May 18. "Now we are late in starting to talk about the second phase by two months," he said. "We are ready to start talks, at the head of which is the question of a timetable for the release of prisoners." He added: "The date of the Israeli withdrawal from all West Bank towns and villages is not tied to the Gaza-Jericho (self-rule) experiment but to the agreement, to nine months from the signing of the agreement. "We cannot wait five years to see if Gaza-Jericho is successful or not." Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule enclave of Jericho were put to one side before the May 4 autonomy accord so the signing ceremony could go ahead in Cairo, launching autonomy in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip.
