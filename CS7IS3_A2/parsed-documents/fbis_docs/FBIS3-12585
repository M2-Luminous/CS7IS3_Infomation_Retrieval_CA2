Rabin rejected threats by the Arab parties that they will cease to support the government if Tzomet joins the government coalition. Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv reports that the prime minister was speaking at Kibbutz Ginnosar at the end of a meeting with Beduins from the north on the memorial day for Yig'al Allon. Yitzhaq Rabin says the Palestinians' demand to open up the agreements for renegotiation in the wake of the massacre in Hebron is unacceptable, because if agreements are reopened after two months, what sense will be there to future agreements? Our correspondent adds that the prime minister explained that before the famous handshake with 'Arafat, he turned to the PLO leader and told him in connection with the signing of the agreement that this will be very difficult, and 'Arafat replied: I know.
