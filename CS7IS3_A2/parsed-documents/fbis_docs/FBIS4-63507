The address notes that "Ukrainian mass media backed by Ukrainian officials launched a campaign aimed at discrediting the constitutional bodies of Crimea, disinforming the international community." The Crimean parliament points out that the law "On the restoration of the Constitution in the Republic of Crimea" aims to provide the Crimean people with broad powers in the spheres of economy, education, and culture." The Crimean parliament expressed hope that the international community would prevent the Ukrainian state power bodies from committing illegal actions.
