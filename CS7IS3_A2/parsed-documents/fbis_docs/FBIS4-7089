Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, released a statement of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee at a press conference in Tokyo on April 21. On April 19, gangsters of a Japanese rightwing organisation thronged to the central headquarters of Chongnyon and cried "Koreans, get out of Japan" and "Chongnyon, get out of Japan". On the same day, a similar rowdyism was staged by scores of loudspeaker cars of the rightwing organisation in front of the buildings of the Federation of Korean Credit Associations in Japan and the Tonghae Trading Company. On April 14, a schoolgirl of the Tokyo Korean middle and high school was beaten on the head by an unidentified man in a tramcar. Such cases of violence are frequently reported from various parts of Japan. The statement said the responsibility for these cases rested with the Japanese Government authorities who have pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK and incited hatred for the Korean residents in Japan, while strengthening the "cooperation system" of the United States, Japan and South Korea under the pretext of fictitious "nuclear issue of the North". "The current trend in which they foster persecution of the Korean residents in Japan, spreading unfounded rumours, reminds us of the eve of the great earthquake of 1923 in Kanto district after which Koreans were massacred," the statement said, and added: "We demand that the Japanese Government authorities promptly renounce their hostile policy toward the DPRK and take measures to prevent recurrence of outrages by rightwing gangsters and that some media stop unwarrantable anti-DPRK propaganda and prejudiced reporting that incites chauvinism."
