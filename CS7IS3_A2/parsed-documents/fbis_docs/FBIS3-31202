UD General Secretary Andrzej Machowski said the unification congress would be probably held at the end of April, 1994. Asked to comment on the relations between the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) and the church, Mazowiecki said: "If the church supported the not very reformatory policy of the PSL, it would give rise to concern, and this is everything I can say." Mazowiecki said it was "astounding" he was being compared with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak as far as changes in the posts of governors were concerned. He stressed that people forgot a few years ago he was working in completely different socio-political conditions. "I have a critical opinion on today's personnel policy conducted by the PSL as it is not guided by competence but by party interest," Mazowiecki added.
