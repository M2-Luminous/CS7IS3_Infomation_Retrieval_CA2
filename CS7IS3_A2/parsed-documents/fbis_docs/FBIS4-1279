After the expiration of the ultimatum yesterday at 1800 local time, the possession of about 10 firearms was declared in Rohero Zone, six arms in Ngagara, and one in Bwiza. No arms were declared or surrendered in Musaga, Buyenzi or Nyakabiga. The town's northern zones of Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke, whose leaders we met, remain tense. The head of Kamenge Zone said he no longer has access to his office. The head of Kinama Zone told us that people had left the zone en masse. Only armed elements remain there.
