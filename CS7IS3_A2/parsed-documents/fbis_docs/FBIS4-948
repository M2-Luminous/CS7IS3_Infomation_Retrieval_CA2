We know what you're thinking. The "new" Nats [National Party members] would never get into bed with the ANC, right? Wrong. Because if you read on, you'll see that the Nats have already become the ANC's junior partners. After the rioting in Johannesburg two weeks ago, FW de Klerk's government gave in to an outrageous ANC request not to search their headquarters. (This means the people who shot protesters, or perhaps innocent bystanders, from this building may never be identified.) In the past few months the NP and ANC also agreed to keep Detention without Trail. And their deals go back even further than this. At negotiations last year, the Nats even caved in on the issue of Federalism, so we're now faced with a possible civil war. These examples all show one thing: you can't trust FW and his "new" Nats to be an effective opposition. Make no mistake, if you want your rights and interests to be protected after the election, you'll need a party that will stand up to the ANC, not give in to them. So vote for the Democratic Party. Then when the ANC and the Nats get into bed together, you won't have to take it lying down." DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER.
