The ministry instructed the embassy in Tokyo to find out more about the discovery, especially how such a large quantity of plutonium escaped past IAEA inspections, the official said on condition of anonymity. The plutonium is enough to produce nine nuclear bombs, the official pointed out. He said he believes the plutonium was left in plant facilities during the reprocessing cycle.
