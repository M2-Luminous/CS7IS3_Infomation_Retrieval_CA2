This was stated by the Federal Minister for Interior, Lt Gen (Retd) Naseerllah Babar. He said there was a link between the RAW and Khad which seem to jointly undertake terrorist operations against Pakistan. He was responding to a question from this correspondent on the possibilities of the involvement of the Israeli agency Mossad operating in Afghanistan. The Minister said since most of the former communists trained by KGB, the Russian intelligence agency, had now shifted to India, there was a strong possibility that the Indian and Afghan Intelligence agencies were cooperating. The Minister said Mossad operating in Afghanistan was a bit too far-fetched an idea." To another question the Minister said the government has put the suspected Afghans living in Peshawar under surveillance. He agreed that most of the former communists who have acquired residence in Peshawar were trained by the KGB. The government, he said, had so far not received reports on the hijacking of the school bus from the intelligence agencies. However, he said that during his recent visit to Peshawar he was told about the antecedents of one of the hijackers who he said belonged to Khad. He said his photo was shown to him with other Khad agents. This hijacker he said belonged to Parwan province in Afghanistan. The government the Minister said was not trying to jump to any conclusion on the hijacking incidence and wanted to give full time to the agencies to investigate.
