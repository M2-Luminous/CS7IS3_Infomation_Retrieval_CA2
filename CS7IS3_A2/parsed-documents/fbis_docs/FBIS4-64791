"There is no reason to assume that the members of that Parliament are enlightened by divine grace and can really understand the situation. In fact in this instance they have proven the contrary." This was the comment from Berlusconi, who defended himself by firing point-blank at the European Parliament. And by acting tough with reporters. The journalists who gathered outside his house yesterday morning to ask whether the European Union's "no" will influence his approach, did not receive his usual smile: "How can you talk about something that you know nothing about yet? You are incapable -- most of you, I mean -- of understanding innovation. You think according to the old patterns and cannot even see the innovations that are occurring." The antifascist "Euromotion" has irritated Berlusconi, who referred to Scalfaro ("the president responded very well") and who now has to deal with an institutional and political storm. All senior officials, including Ciampi, are on the president's side. The outgoing prime minister stressed his "full support" for Scalfaro's remarks about "Italy's loyalty to the values and principles that lie at the root of Europe's Constitution." [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Irene Pivetti -- following the example of the Senate speaker's immediate response -- wrote a letter expressing her resentment to European Parliament Speaker Egon Klepsch, condemning "the substantial interference in the delicate constitutional procedures under way in our country." And [Senate Speaker] Scognamiglio announced that yesterday he also telephoned Klepsch, from whom he learned of the latter's "opposition" to the motion approved, which he personally did not vote for. The resolution has split the parties in two, perfectly (or almost) matching the actual alignments, with the pro-Berlusconi front resolutely against and the anti-Berlusconi archipelago in favor. So the progressive forces and the PPI [Italian Popular Party] and Segni's center are pleased: According to [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS Secretary General Achille] Occhetto, the motion expresses "a not unfounded and widespread anxiety in Europe" and Scalfaro was wrong to consider it "on the one hand inevitable and on the other hand undesirable." Forza Italia and the National Alliance are furious, with the Northern League somewhere in between. This is what Bossi had to say: "Never mind Berlusconi and his followers, we have an antifascist past. Fascism, as it was conceived, no longer exists, but we must remain vigilant." Then there is Maroni, who should be number two in the government that will include the ministers that Strasbourg considers fascists and who, according to the news agencies, changed, within the space of half an hour, from complacency to a rejection of the "Euroappeal." His first comment, released at midday: "Does it constitute a problem for us? No. If anything, it is a problem for Berlusconi. We too have been saying these things for some time." Here is his second version, timed at 1230: "The motion was inadvisable, and constitutes pressure on the government that is about to be formed. I have seen the names that are being mentioned for the government, and I do not think they include any fascists or individuals that pose a threat to democracy." The other prospective deputy prime minister, the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] Giuseppe Tatarella, displayed no such inconsistencies and said that the resolution is merely "obsolete, retroactive, and transcended by the people's vote." "Banana republic stuff," was the comment from Mirko Tremaglia, the MSI's candidate for the ministry dealing with expatriate Italians. What about their secretary, Fini? He does not seem very worried: "The issue will die down when the government receives parliament's vote of confidence and can work on behalf of the country's interests." In any case, the resolution "contains no reference to the National Alliance." It is "an attack by all the left-wing forces. Europe will acknowledge that a government including National Alliance members does not constitute a threat but guarantees freedom, democracy, and peace for Europe too." The Left challenged the idea that the European Parliament interfered in Italy's affairs, albeit with differences of emphasis. Thus [PDS number two] D'Alema acknowledged that Scalfaro considered it his duty "to protect our country's sovereignty," but added that this does not alter the fact that "the anxieties remain." Nilde Jotti did not exactly agree, saying that, even if the Italian situation may prompt anxiety, "the resolution, which is unprecedented, is rather heavy-handed." And the former Chamber speaker's criticism of Scalfaro was not for having spoken out ("I would have done so too"), but for his tone: "A response providing guarantees would have been better." There were disagreements in the Center too, but these were more to be expected. Formigoni, former European deputy for the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and now a member of the PPI's pro-Berlusconi wing, did not at all appreciate the excommunication of fascist ministers: "It must have been one of those motions submitted and approved with no debate, under the impetus of a tide of propagandist feeling."
