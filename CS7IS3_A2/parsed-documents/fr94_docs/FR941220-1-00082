ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;355 (the Act). The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is considering amending Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.4, Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility, the clause at 52.209&hyph;6, Protecting the Government's Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment, and provisions in parts 22, 28, and 44, respectively. This includes information required to support the policy of ensuring that suspensions, debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities receive reciprocal Government-wide effect as directed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12689, dated August 16, 1989, and Section 2455, Uniform Suspension and Debarment, of the Act. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before February 21, 1995 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 94&hyph;801 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Julius Rothlein, Ethics Team Leader, at (703) 697&hyph;4349 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 94&hyph;801. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;355 (the Act), provides authorities that streamline the acquisition process and minimize burdensome government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network. In order to promptly achieve the benefits of the provisions of the Act, the Government is issuing implementing regulations on an expedited basis. We believe prompt publication of proposed rules provides the public the opportunity to participate more fully in the process of developing regulations. FAR case 94&hyph;801 originated because Section 2455 of Public Law 103&hyph;355 was enacted to remedy the current situation where suspensions, debarments and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities do not have reciprocal Government-wide effect. The concept of reciprocity for procurement and nonprocurement suspension and debarment actions is not new. Since August 1989 there has been an effort to do by executive order ( i.e. , E.O. 12689), what section 2455 now prescribes by law. That earlier effort was worked on by a committee known as the ``Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension.'' This Interagency Committee is made up of 16 Federal executive agencies that impose nonprocurement suspensions and debarments. By October 1994 the agencies in an ad hoc group reached agreement on the language that would implement the concept of reciprocity and be consistent with the principles of the National Performance Review. The language proposed for FAR 9.401, Applicability, has been coordinated with the ad hoc group of agencies. The proposed changes to the procurement and nonprocurement rules will implement Section 2455 and E.O. 12689 by ensuring that suspensions, debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities have reciprocal Government-wide effect. The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;801) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES caption) on or before January 19, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. Only a very small percentage of Federal contractors are debarred or suspended. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 94&hyph;801 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

Cohen, SC, USN, Project Manager for the Implementation of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.
