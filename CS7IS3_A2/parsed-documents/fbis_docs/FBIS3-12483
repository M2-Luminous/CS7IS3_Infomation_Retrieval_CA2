The massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque committed at dawn last Friday will not be the last, he addded. He said that this brutal massacre came naturally to the Israeli enemy, that it is part of common practices against our people in Palestine--a people who will not be terrorized by all the practices of occupation or by any Israeli military power. Their determination to liberate their occupied homeland will not be harmed, he added. He said: The brutal massacre the Zionist enemy committed against worshipers in the mosque reflects the concessions [made by Yasir 'Arafat], which ignore the Palestinian's blood, dignity, and rights. The massacre is the fruit of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which has made the Zionist enemy's path shorter and given legitimacy to its occupation. He added that what the Ibrahimi Mosque witnessed makes us see that the real killers are those who encouraged the Jews--such as 'Arafat--and extended their hands, which are stained with the bloods of the people and the cause, to shake the hand of the enemy. This enemy found that its interest are served by the concessions offered by the 'Arafat leadership. Meanwhile, 'Abd-al-Jabir Burghul, member of the PFLP-GC Central Committee told AL-BILAD: We in the PFLP-GC were not at all surprised by the massacres committed by the gangs of settlers in the occupied territories. Before these massacres, several massacres were committed by [Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem] Begin and other Zionist gangs such as the massacres in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Nahhalin, and Sabra and Shatila. The history of the Zionist movement is full of massacres against the Palestinian people. He said: We in the PFLP-GC will never halt our Palestinian armed struggle in the occupied territories. The coming days will witness military operations against this entity in the occupied territories, not outside. He said these operations will target the settlers and the gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [not further identified]. He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the Zionist enemy.
