[Reina] A commission has been tasked with regulating the ban we announced. Anyone not abiding by our decision will be punished. [Bonilla] There has also been talk regarding the charges by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms against Former President Rafael Leonardo Callejas. Will the Executive Branch support any action the prosecutor general may take to clarify the matter? [Reina] You are posing two questions. One has to do with the letters the former president and Senator Helms have exchanged, which, as I said, is an interesting and important debate. The other question deals with our support for the prosecutor general; it is absolute. It is not easy to make a moral revolution. I want you to notice how attentive people are to any act of dishonesty. This is putting honesty in vogue. That is taking a step forward and is very positive. As for the former president, I will voice no opinion out of courtesy. [Bonilla] Mr. President, is it true you have a document or that the U.S. Government or Senator Helms has forwarded to you documents outlining the involvement of Former President Callejas in acts of corruption. [Reina] I can clearly tell you that I have not received that document. [Reyes] [Words indistinct] there were reportedly illegal actions? [Reina] Anyone violating the law in this country will be punished. I have announced that in all my speeches. I said I will put an end to impunity. I am asking you to help in that task of making a moral revolution. [passage omitted]
