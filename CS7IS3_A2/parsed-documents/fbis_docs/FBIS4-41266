Commenting the latest changes in provisions for the elections in his interview with INTERFAX, he said that Ukraine's leadership "tries to buy time by any means in order to introduce something else after the presidential elections in Ukraine and to prevent elections of strong leaders in the region. Such leaders present obstacles to Kiev." On June 16 Ukraine's parliament adopted an amendment to the decree on the elections to local power bodies which stipulates that a candidate who collects more than 25 percent of the votes will be considered elected. Earlier it was enough to collect more than 10 percent. In Yermakov's opinion, this decision "disperses the electors' votes." He stressed that earlier voter turnout did not exceed 50 percent and now "it will be difficult to gather people to the elections during the period of summer vacations, especially for a repeated round of voting." "The necessary 25 percent to win actually represents half of those who will come to vote. Meanwhile, as many as 11 people are on the list of candidates," Yermakov declared. Yermakov, who is also chairman of the Union of Prosperity In Unity invited all candidates to negotiate so that everyone would receive a deserved place in the team and would stand in the common row for cooperation for the sake of the city's well-being." "If we do not make these steps together, then an envoy appointed by another Kravchuk from Kiev will guide the city," Yermakov declared. According to Sevastopol's state administration, a total of 34.7 percent of the Sevastopol residents intend to vote for Yermakov; Alexander Penkin, second in command of the Black Sea Fleet -- 13.1 percent; and former commander of the Black Sea Fleet Aleksey Penkin -- 10.1 percent.
