In an article for BILD (Wednesday [12 January] edition) Ruehe writes that the alliance has opened "clear prospects of accession" for the neighbors in East Europe. The minister goes on to say: "On the way toward this, Partnership for Peace makes closer cooperation possible without shutting anyone out. It is in the interest of our country that democracy and prosperity, NATO, and the European Union should not end at Germany's eastern borders. The eastward expansion of NATO means more stability for the whole of Europe." Ruehe emphasizes: "America has once again affirmed its commitment to security in Europe in an impressive way. The alliance has decided on the steps necessary for its reform. America recognizes the European Union as an independent partner within the alliance."
