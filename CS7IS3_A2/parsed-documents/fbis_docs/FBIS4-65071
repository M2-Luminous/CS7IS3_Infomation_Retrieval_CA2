In a prerelease of the speech that he made at lunch, von Weizsaecker spoke in favor of merging German and Russian interests, which would also benefit both countries' neighbors. In connection with German unity, the Russian people have not only shown generosity, but also confidence in a common future of both nations. "The pictures of August 1991, when you risked your life resisting force and speaking out for free human rights, have become historic documents and will serve as a model for future generations, showing what initiative and the convictions of an individual can achieve," Weizsaecker told Yeltsin. German-Russian relations today are no longer a game of changing alliances to realize national or dynastic interests at the expense of third parties. Today's task is conducting a new policy. In spite of its vast area, reaching into Asia, Russia will remain a determining and enriching part of Europe in cultural, historical, and economic terms. "For me it is one of the miracles of history that the suffering that Hitler inflicted on Russia could not destroy the deep inner relationship between the Germans and the Russians," the president said. Both back then and today, the Russian people have shown great human strength and historic power. "Russia is a great nation," Weizsaecker said.
