The Army have had the upper hand for much of this year, but it seems a small group of veterans are not happy about the way they've been treated, and there has been a gun battle in the capital, Djibouti City, from where Christo Farah telexed this report: Yesterday afternoon, an antiterrorist unit attacked a group of about 20 discontented soldiers who have been pressing the government to accept their financial demands. The incident took place in the neighborhood of Belbela on the outskirts of the capital. The interior minister, Idris Harbi Farah, said the mutiny has posed a threat to security, because they had refused to hand in their military uniforms and hand grenades. He said the clashes began when one of the discontented soldiers took the pin out of a grenade, while his colleagues got into combat positions, forcing the police to open fire. Five policemen were wounded in the fighting and unspecified number of mutineers were killed or wounded. Interior minister has described the rebellious soldiers as a handful of demobilized elements from the Army who have been manipulated by the opposition. The police are now looking for another group of about 30 soldiers who were also involved in the mutiny.
