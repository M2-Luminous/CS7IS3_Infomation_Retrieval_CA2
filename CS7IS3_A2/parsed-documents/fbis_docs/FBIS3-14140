What is assuring in this falsification process, he said, is that dubious sources are creating this impression about the LF while the judiciary has not yet spoken. Furthermore, the judiciary sources that have been contacted asserted that all newspaper reports have nothing to do with the investigations. He rejected all detailed reports carried by newspapers and considered them totally untrue. He said: We will give 24-hour notice, after which we will be forced to resort to the normal legal measures against any mass media report harming the reputation of the LF. We will be compelled to resort to this method because the process took on the characteristics of defamation and slander and held the LF responsible for the consequences of acts with which the forces have nothing to do, neither closely nor distantly. In an interview with AL-DIYAR newspaper today, Ja'ja' said: What is happening is that we are being subjected to a political harassment campaign. He noted that every party or any other political faction in Lebanon are subjected to the same campaign and that this is the whole story. On the latest developments in Ghidras [where LF headquarters and Ja'ja's residence are situated], the LF commander said the atmosphere has not changed but the situation gets harder every now and then because the security measures taken around the LF headquarters in Ghidras have been stepped up to the point that all people coming to Ghidras are subjected to thorough inspection. He very strongly urged the Lebanese judiciary and the state's political and military agencies to uncover all the circumstances and details of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing and insisted that the trial of the criminals involved in this tragedy be public and open to all people and mass media. He pointed out that politics should not intervene in legal issues and arrest suspects. He noted that the security agencies say they have arrested the perpetrators of the massacre and thus they will have performed their duty in the best possible way. He said these agencies are supposed to have criminal evidence that should be turned to the judiciary which, in turn, will initiate a trial. He stressed that the investigations and their publication are the responsibility of the judicial authorities, not the duty of dubious sources. Noting that no LF personnel are in detention, he said no LF personnel are held in custody, at least not at present, and that what is happening is false accusation. The LF, he said, are subjected to the largest premeditated campaign of injustice and defamation in their history to contain the LF both politically and at the popular level but the results will surely be counterproductive. He said such methods will lead nowhere and noted that the LF are the victims of a process aimed at curbing political and media freedoms in the country.
