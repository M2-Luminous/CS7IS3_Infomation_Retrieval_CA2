About 15 ambulances completely blocked the entrance. Drivers and other ambulance personnel sat on the curbs nearby. A spokesman, Mr Frank Makalima, said the vehicles had been there since 7.45am. He said the protesters had sent a delegation to King William's Town to speak to the Transitional Executive Council task force, which took over administration of the territory earlier this week. Executive Council member Mr Zam Titus said on Wednesday that council team intended to move into the ministerial offices in the parliamentary complex on Thursday. Near the ambulance drivers, a convoy of South African Defence Force troop carriers, ambulances and armoured vehicles with cannons were parked at the side of the road. The troops appeared to be observing a rally in progress at the Bisho stadium about a kilometre away. There were police roadblocks on the N2 outside King William's Town, and on the road between Bisho and King William's Town.
