FR940512-1-00040 FR940512-1-00010 Proposed §§365.20 and 365.21 would incorporate the requirements in sections 704(e) and (f) and 713 of the Act. As stated previously, section 704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals with a significant disability. Section 704(f) of the Act permits the State to provide these IL services through grants or contracts with third parties. Section 713 of the Act permits the State to use funds received under part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act to provide the resources described in section 705(e) of the Act relating to the SILC and to fund various activities related to IL services and centers. Proposed §365.20(a) would permit the State to use funds received under part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act to provide the IL services required pursuant to section 704(e) of the Act. Proposed §365.21(b) would allow a State to provide information and referral services independent of other IL services. Frequently, individuals without a disability seek information from centers on behalf of an individual with a significant disability. Allowing States to provide information and referral services furthers the dissemination of information and the provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities. Proposed §365.21(b) also would allow a State to provide information and referral services without regard to subpart G of part 366. (Subpart G includes the indicators of what constitutes minimum compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act and was published separately in the October 27, 1993 ``Indicators NPRM'' referred to previously. When these regulations are published in final, subpart G will be included in 34 CFR part 366, along with any changes made to Subpart G as a result of the public comment received on the ``Indicators NPRM.'') Proposed §365.23 identifies the Education Department General Administrative Regulations and requirements that would apply if a State makes a subgrant or enters into a contract. Proposed §365.30 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards and procedures to be applied by the service provider to ensure expeditious and equitable handling of referrals and applications for IL services from individuals with significant disabilities. Proposed §365.31 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards for the provision of IL services to be met by service providers that do not meet the standards and assurances in section 725 of the Act and Subparts F and G of 34 CFR part 366 and that are used by the DSU to provide IL services to individuals with significant disabilities. Proposed §365.31 also would require the DSU to assure that participating service providers meet all applicable State licensure or certification requirements. Providers used by the DSU to provide IL services that meet the requirements of section 725 of the Act and proposed subparts F and G of part 366 would not have to meet the standards developed by the DSU if the standards developed by the DSU are different than the Federal requirements. The requirements for written standards in §§365.30 and 365.31, which existed in the former regulations for the SILS program, provide important protections for consumers of IL services. Part 366 Proposed part 366 contains regulations regarding the CIL program authorized by part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. Under proposed §366.2(b), the expansion of an existing center through the establishment of a physically separate and complete facility at a different geographical location would be considered the same as establishing a new center for purposes of section 722(d) of the Act and proposed §§366.24 and 366.25, which would establish the procedures for making an award to a new center. This proposed provision would facilitate the expansion of the CIL program and the establishment of statewide networks of centers through the use of the expertise of currently existing centers. However, pursuant to proposed §366.22(a)(1), any funds received by an existing center to establish a new center at a different geographical location pursuant to proposed §366.2(b)(2) would not be included in determining the level of funding to the existing center in any fiscal year that the new center applies for and receives funds as a separate center. Proposed §366.3 lists the various activities that the Secretary is authorized by statute to fund under the CIL program. Pursuant to proposed §366.3(a), an eligible agency may use funds awarded under subpart B of this part to carry out training and technical assistance activities described in proposed §366.11(b). Pursuant to proposed §366.3(b), an eligible agency may use funds under Subparts C and D of Part 366 to plan, conduct, administer, and evaluate centers, and to carry out activities that would further a center's compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act and with the assurances in section 725(c) of the Act. Pursuant to proposed §366.14, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed §366.15 to evaluate applications from entities with experience in the operation of centers for awards to provide training and technical assistance to eligible agencies, centers, and SILCs to plan, develop, conduct, administer, and evaluate centers. The selection criteria are based on section 721(b) of the Act and §75.210 of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). Proposed §§366.20 through 366.28 would incorporate the statutory requirements that apply if the amount of Federal funds allotted to the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act to support the general operation of centers is greater than the amount of State funds earmarked for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed §§366.30 and 366.31, or that apply even if this condition is met but the Director of the DSU (Director) does not submit to the Secretary and obtain approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed §366.32.
