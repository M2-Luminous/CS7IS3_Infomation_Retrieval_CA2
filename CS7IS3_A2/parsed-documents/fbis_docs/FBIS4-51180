In response to Comrade Jiang Zemin's call, many journalists have studied hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the other hand, they have gone deep into the realities of life for interviews and investigations and have written a number of good press reports portraying new achievements and experiences in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as the valuable mental attitude of the laborers. An inspiring trend has appeared in "using correct public opinion to guide the people." To undertake the heavy task entrusted by the party and the people in a more proper manner, journalists should make further efforts to "go deep." Into what should they "go deep?" First, they should go deep into the realities of life. In other words, they should leave their offices and confront the fiery realities of life, instead of just sitting in the editorial room listening to feedback reports, reading material, or editing manuscripts. Second, they should go to the grass roots, namely the rural areas, factories, shops, schools, armed forces units, neighborhoods, and other basic-level units, instead of only visiting leadership institutions. Third, they should stay among the masses. In other words, they should frequently contact or interview ordinary workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, as well as officers and soldiers at the grass-roots level, to know if they are happy or sad and to listen to their appeals, instead of only reporting on local or departmental leaders, factory directors, or managers. Filing anecdotes about singing or film stars is even less recommended. Fourth, they should go deep into the "focus" of society. In other words, they should meticulously investigate crucial problems involving reform, development, and the stability of the situation, as well as hot issues in society about which the masses have complained strongly; they should make penetrating judgments instead of filing commonplace reports. "Going deep" is an essential demand of our party in exercising leadership over socialist journalism. Only by "going deep," can journalists: Accurately find out about the real situation at every social stratum; promptly grip the pulse of the era; provide valuable information for leading institutions to formulate up correct policies; form links with the masses and serve them; file excellent reports and help foster talented people; and only by "going deep," can our journalism take deep root in the fertile soil of the people, yield good results, and last for a long time. In short, only by "going deep," can our journalists make due contributions to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In "going deep," not only must journalists make a "physical appearance" but, more importantly, they should also be "mentally engaged." They should cherish a genuine intention to and a strong demand on "going deep." If they make a physical appearance in the grass roots and among the masses without their minds being engaged, this type of "going deep" does not mean much, nor will it produce good results. To be "mentally engaged," first, they should solidly cultivate the idea of serving the people and socialism. Which people to serve is a fundamental question, the settlement of which will provide a basis for "going deep." Second, journalists should have the spirit of hard struggle. Conditions are generally arduous in grass-roots units, particularly in some remote regions, old revolutionary base areas, ethnic areas, and poor areas. Before going to these places, journalists should be mentally prepared for a tough life. Third, they should resolutely oppose and resist the temptation of "compensatory press reports." For a time in the past, "compensatory press reports" were prevalent and corrupted the minds of some journalists. How could they go deep into the realities of life or stay among the masses? This was a tragedy for the journalists. Greater efforts should be made to stop this evil practice from recurring. In the last few months, many fraternal press units have used their brains and worked out ideas on "going deep" and they have introduced many good columns and programs and published many good articles. RENMIN RIBAO and RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION have also made some efforts in this respect and achieved certain results, which have been confirmed by the readers. But there is still room for improvement. Facts prove that to do a better and more brilliant job in "going deep," the crux is that press unit leaders should have a strong sense of "going deep," draw up an excellent plan regarding "going deep," and work out practical measures for "going deep." Moreover, they should act as a good example in "going deep." Of course, press agency directors and chief editors are not like ordinary editors or reporters. Their main task is to give consideration to the overall work and drawing up an overall plan, instead of filing press reports. However, when necessary, they should also "play an exemplary role." This is quite beneficial. Comrade Jiang Zemin proposed the following to journalists: "Study, study, and study further; go deep, go deep, and go deeper." These 14-character instructions point out the path for journalists to grow healthily and should thus become a motto for editors and reporters. We should take the achievements already made in our study and going deep as a new departure point to exert ourselves and blaze a new trail in journalism!
