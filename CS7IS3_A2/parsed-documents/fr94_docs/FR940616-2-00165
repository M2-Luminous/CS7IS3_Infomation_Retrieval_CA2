FR940616-2-00165 FR940616-2-00102 (7) A description of the fair housing benefits that successful completion of the project will produce, and the indicators by which these benefits are to be measured. These possible benefits can include changes in racial, ethnic and income-related housing patterns that may have taken place during the testing period, increases in awareness and changes in lending, or sales and rental practices which result in fairer treatment for persons protected by civil rights statutes. Particular emphasis must be placed on measuring and comparing the costs and the benefits of the present system of HUD AFHM Plan processing and the clearinghouse concept being tested under this NOFA. (8) A description of how the clearinghouse will be of continuing use in dealing with housing discrimination after the completion of the demonstration. In this section, the proposer shall explain how the clearinghouse plans to continue its existence after the expiration of this grant, describing the public and private sources of financing and the services which are both similar to and different from the services to be offered during the period of this grant. (9) HUD Form 2880, Applicant Disclosures. (10) The applicant must submit a certification and disclosure in accordance with the requirements of section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121, approved October 23, 1989), as implemented in HUD's interim final rule at 24 CFR part 87, published in the Federal Register on February 26, 1990 (55 FR 6736). This statute generally prohibits recipients and subrecipients of federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive and Legislative Branches of the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. If warranted, the applicant should include the Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form (SF&hyph;LLL). V. Corrections to Deficient Applications Applicants will not be disqualified from being considered for funding because of technical deficiencies in their application submission, e.g., an omission of information such as regulatory/program certifications, inadequate budget data, or incomplete signatory requirements for application submission. HUD will notify an applicant in writing of any technical deficiencies in the application. The applicant must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency. The 14-day correction period pertains only to non-substantive, technical deficiencies or errors. Technical deficiencies relate to items that: (a) Are not necessary for HUD review under selection criteria/ranking factors; and (b) Would not improve the substantive quality of the proposal.
