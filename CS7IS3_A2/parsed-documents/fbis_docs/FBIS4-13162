So far Amman has not formally reacted to the warning issued yesterday by Prime Minister Rabin, but Jerusalem is convinced that Husayn will take steps against Hamas. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has more: [Begin recording] [Rosen] [passage omitted] The news conference held by Rabin and Peres close to midnight last night was deliberately dramatic. Jerusalem believes that such a public onslaught will deal King Husayn a hard blow and force him to take action. The decision to act publicly, which Rabin made yesterday afternoon, was preceded by a series of secret messages. Elyaqim Rubinstein spoke with Jordanian Ambassador in Washington Fayiz al-Tarawinah. Senior U.S. elements also spoke with Amman. Jordan has not yet reacted officially. Unofficial elements said today: There is not much we can do. Rabin says Jordan is running the risk of being placed on the U.S. list of terror-supporting countries; the Jordanians must choose between good relations with Washington and good relations with Hamas. [Rabin] Not only does the Israeli Government take a grave view of this, but it will be unable to continue as if nothing has happened if this situation continues. [Rosen] A military operation? asked journalists. No comment, replied Rabin. It is safe to assume that he was not referring to that. [end recording] [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 1730 GMT on 15 April carries an announcer-read report adding that "Israel refuses to accept the Jordanian reaction conveyed by a senior official, rejecting the prime minister's warning with regard to Hamas. Israeli political elements said that Jordan will be given some more time so that it can be determined whether the Jordanians are genuinely curbing the freedom of movement of the Hamas office in Amman."]
