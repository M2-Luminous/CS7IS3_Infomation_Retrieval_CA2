Legislators from the rightist Social Christian Party (which holds a majority in Congress), other progovernment parties, and independent parties voiced satisfaction over the reforms, which they described as "very important and justified." During a special session of Congress last night, a group of legislators promoted the constitutional reforms that will become effective in 1996. Congress approved increasing the number of deputies (from 77 to 113), the participation of independent candidates (except for the posts of president and vice president of the Republic), and the elimination of mid-term elections. The next step is to turn over the reforms to President Sixto Duran-Ballen for final approval. Fernando Rosero, leader of the Ecuadoran Roldosist Party, announced his parliamentary faction will strive to abolish the reforms because they are the product of a "spurious" session. Deputies from minority parties -- the Democratic Left (ID), Popular Democracy Party, and Democratic People's Movement -- voiced their opposition and agreed that the approval of the reforms "showed some serious irregularities." ID Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said increasing the number of deputies would imply a heavy allotment from the state budget. He added that President Duran-Ballen's ruling will allow knowing if his policy of reducing the state and exercising fiscal austerity is authentic. Minority deputies noted that the reforms had been approved in a very hasty manner, adding that these reforms were useful for "certain smug attitudes of the Social Christians."
