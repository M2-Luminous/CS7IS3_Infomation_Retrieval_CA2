The leaders told reporters here on Thursday that 6,000 houses in the Valley belonging to the Pandits had been burnt down by militants. They said that it was the government's responsibility to protect the remaining 80,000 houses as also the Hindu shrines and demanded adequate compensation for any loss or damage to their property. They said 1,200 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed in the Valley in militancy-related incidents but the government had not been able to provide adequate compensation to the affected families. Their other demands included pucca accomodation, better education facilities and job opportunities. The leaders said that the talk of a homeland for them was premature. They said conditions had to be created first for their return to the Valley. They said the only policy the Centre had on the Kashmiris since 1947 was one of "appeasement" of Kashmiri Muslims. They said that Pakistan had almost succeeded in making the Valley "Hinduless." No political process in the Valley would be deemed as complete without the involvement of representatives of Jammu, Ladakh and "migrant" Pandit community, they said.
