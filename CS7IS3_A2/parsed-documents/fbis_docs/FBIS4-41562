The grounds for the arrest were documents found by the police after the arrest of Haritonovs, during a search that caused such discontent on the part of his lawyer. The documents were discovered at various companies -- TESS AB, TESS Petroleum, Brih, ABB, and Amstrig. The investigation group is in possession of documents that prove that the company TESS Petroleum (which is a hundred percent Swedish TESS Petroleum's subsidiary in Latvia) has participated in illegal deals connected with the purchase and delivery of oil and oil products to Latvia. The essence of the deal was: the oil products were bought in Russia at cost, then sent supposedly to Kaliningrad, but in reality sold in Latvia, without paying customs duties. The geographic area of the illegal operations of the "oil syndicate" was rather large -- it included Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Russia (including the Kaliningrad region), and, of course, Latvia. As the Police Department inspectors reported, the police now has documents proving the participation of 19 Russian oil-processing enterprises in the chain of deals. Among them, there are such gigantic oil-industry plants as Grozniy, Volgograd, and Jaroslavl oil refineries. The bosses of these plants, taking advantage of their position, sold the oil to TESS Petroleum at cost, instead of at world prices as should have been done when selling oil to Latvia. According to the documents in possession by the police, the amount TESS Petroleum has paid for the oil products supplied from Russia amounts to $28,603,176 (in Russian currency, the sum is 22,882,541 Russian rubles). [passage omitted] The deliveries were addressed to a recipient in Russia -- usually a company in the Kalinigrad Oblast, which as a rule refused to accept them. This way, the deliveries found their way to Latvia. In the documents, discovered in the search, about 10 such Kaliningrad companies are mentioned, that have never received any of the deliveries allegedly sent to their address. In addition, this provided the opportunity to operate without a license for the purchase, securing additional profit. At present, I do not have precise information as to what is the total consumption of any of the oil products, for example petrol, in Latvia, and what is the amount of their declared import. One of the experts on economic crimes from the Ministry of Internal Affairs is of the opinion that less than one hundredth of the imported petrol is being declared at the border. In the case of TESS Petroleum, petrol was purchased for 10 cents (approximately 5.5 santims). As is known, in Riga petrol is being sold for 17 - 19 santims. The profit came from unpaid customs duties. As was explained by our customs officers, for every liter of petrol one has to pay 4 santims in excise tax, and from the total amount an additional 18 percent state tax is to be paid. The customs papers were sealed with forged stamps, and the signatures were also forged. As a result, Latvia has lost millions that have omitted the Treasury. Now a little background about the "family tree". TESS Petroleum is a company established two years ago. Its initial capital has come entirely from TESS AB -- a Swedish company (please do not mistake it for the Latvian TESS AB). The president of the TESS Petroleum is Patricia Korotejeva, the widow of Rustem Kadirovs' brother. Mr. Kadirovs, a former inhabitant of Riga, currently a Swedish citizen, is the founder and co-owner -- along with Magnus Visland -- of the Swedish TESS AB. The task of TESS Petroleum in this oil business was to control the movement of freight-cars loaded with oil on their way from Russia to Latvia. The currency payments were conducted through an Estonian bank. TESS AB is also the founder of another Latvian company -- TES AB. On the list of its founders is -- together with the Swedish company with its 80 shares of capital -- also Ivans Haritonovs (40 shares), Grigoriy Bobovich, and Boris Yelisejev (40 shares each). In the company "Brih," the names of the founders are to be seen in a different combination, but they are the same -- they include Bobovich, Haritonovs, and the Swedish citizen Visland as well. Grigoriy Bobovich, a rather little known and quiet person, is at the same time the president of TESS AB. [passage omitted]
