Fedorov himself declined to give any information concerning his own plans. It's not clear whether Fedorov will join the number of the new deputy premiers or remain as finance minister. In the meantime Interfax learned from Russia's prominent banking circles that for them Fedorov symbolizes reforms in Russia, and that his withdrawal from the highest government echelons may come to be viewed as a symptom of the possibility that the direction of economic reforms in Russia might change.
