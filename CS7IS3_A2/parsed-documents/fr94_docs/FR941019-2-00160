FR941019-2-00160 FR941019-2-00085 Based upon a review of the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirement to conduct an exercise of the Vogtle emergency plan in 1994, the NRC staff finds that the underlying purpose of the regulation will not be adversely affected by the rescheduling of the July 27, 1994, exercise to January 11, 1995. The effective response capability demonstrated by the licensee during the 1993 emergency preparedness exercise, the activities in preparation for the 1994 exercise, including a table top exercise with the States and counties and the readiness of the licensee's emergency preparedness program as reflected in its SALP rating and the most recent inspection report, provide assurance that the resources and personnel necessary for proper emergency response are in place to respond to a nuclear emergency at the Vogtle site. Thus, an exercise in 1994 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule, and the requested exemption from the requirement in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F, to defer the performance of an exercise of the Vogtle emergency plan until January 11, 1995, will not adversely affect the overall state of emergency preparedness at the Vogtle site. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed exemption is needed because the Georgia Emergency management Agency (GEMA) was required to respond to a federally-declared flood disaster in South Georgia at the time of the scheduled annual emergency exercise. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The NRC staff evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Section IV. F.2, indicates that the granting of the proposed exemption will not involve any measurable environmental impacts since the exemption deals with the exercise of the licensee's emergency plan. Plant configuration and operations are not changed. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result in diversion of plant resources from addressing important health and safety issues. Alternative Use of Resources This exemption from the scheduled exercise on July 27, 1994, does not reduce the use of resources since the schedule for future exercises will not be affected by this exemption. The licensee has stated it will conduct the previously scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. Thus, the requested exemption would provide only temporary relief from the requirement to conduct an annual exercise. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff consulted with the Georgia State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The State official had no comments. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action. For further details with respect to the proposed exemption, see the licensee's letter dated July 21, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Burke County Library, 412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. Dated at Rockville, this 13th day of October 1994. Herbert N. Berkow, Director, Project Directorate II&hyph;3, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
