Speaking to CTK after his return from an unofficial visit to the USA, he was reacting to the weekend congress of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft. Klaus said that well-known demands were pronounced at the congress, which require no "new activities or counter-offensive" from the Czech Republic. "I believe that after the German elections there will be scope for us to tell our neighbours some things more clearly and distinctly. Not (more distinctly) than we are saying them now, but than they are heard there (in Germany)," Klaus said. At the congress in Nuremberg, the Sudeten Germans again called for the abolition of the decrees issued by Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes after the war and approved by the Potsdam conference of the victorious powers. Under the decrees some 2.5 Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia and their property was expropriated. Klaus said that unlike Daniel Kroupa, deputy chairman of the coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), he did not think that it was up to the Czech Government coalition to take "a coalition" stand. Kroupa said at the weekend that he was missing a joint coalition stand on the Sudeten German issue and recalled the ODA's unsuccessful initiative last year to set up a commission to clearly state the coalition's stand. "I don't think that anything of this sort is our task. It is not at all a coalition question. We have a Foreign Ministry which is functioning normally and which formulates our stand," Klaus said.
