One of the biggest cooperative programs between the Chinese Government and international organizations ever, the program started in 1990 has witnessed remarkable progress in improving the health and nutrition of pregnant women and little children. Some 120 million people, nearly one-ninth of the country's population, in about 300 poverty-stricken counties all over China have benefited from the program. Official sources said that by the end of this year, the death rates of pregnant women and little children in those counties will have been reduced by some 20 percent from rates in 1990. A 1990 survey showed that the death rate for children in 108 of those 300 counties reached more than 68.02 per thousand, and the maternal mortality rate was even higher in some half of the project counties. According to the survey, in those poor counties, pneumonia, diarrhea and asphyxia are the main killers of little children, while two-thirds of the pregnant women die of puerperal infection and ante partum hemorrhage. Scheduled to conclude in 1995, the program is aimed at reducing death rates of mothers and children by improving and expanding primary health care services in the remote and poor districts. With the help of the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization, Chinese Governments at all levels have trained more than 120,000 village and county doctors in the latest practical methods of treating deadly diseases and in preventive health care. According to statistics offered by the Ministry of Public Health, from 1990 to 1993, those international organizations have invested some 24 million U.S. dollars to improve the village and county health care centers as well as anti-epidemic institutes in the 300 project counties. Meanwhile, governments at all levels in those districts have poured some 47 million yuan into buying medical instruments for those grassroots health care centers. Official sources said that at the beginning of this year, the international organizations had decided to prolong the program for a few years more and had increased the number of the project counties to 305. Though China has a large population living in poverty-stricken areas, officials from the international organizations said that they believed that the program will be able to realize its objective of `everyone enjoying free health care from the year 2000' through continued hard work.
