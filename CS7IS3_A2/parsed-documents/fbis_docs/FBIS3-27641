The appraisal group consisted of experts from the State Planning Commission, the state anti-flood headquarters and the Ministry of Water Conservancy. The first phase construction started in 1986; the second is due to start this year and to be completed in 2000. The Dongting Lake area, known as a natural granary, has been extended to create a center for major farm products in central China's Hunan Province. The total farm production value of the area is over 50 billion yuan (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) annually, one third of the Hunan Province total. Dongting, one of the country's largest freshwater lakes, is a main channel and storage lake for floods from the Chang Jiang River and other rivers in Hunan. The project is aimed to strengthen anti-flood capacity of the area and promote local economic development. After eight years of the first phase construction of the project, the anti-flood capacity has been improved. But because of long-time high water levels in the flood season, floods have left heavy layers of mud in the lake which have narrowed the flood channel and water areas of the lake. The second phase construction will consist of seven projects, including consolidating and building the lake embankment higher, clearing the flood channels, flood storage facilities, and township anti-flood facilities and flood warning telecommunications system, as well as work on prevention of snail fever. The second phase will cost nearly 6 billion yuan (about 700 million U.S. dollars).
