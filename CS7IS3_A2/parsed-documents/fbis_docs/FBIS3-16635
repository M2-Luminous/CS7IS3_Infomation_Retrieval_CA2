"In view of the acuteness and complexity of the situation in Angola it would be expedient for the U.N. secretary-general to submit to the Security Council a report on the course of the negotiations in Lusaka early in April. This would enable the Security Council to respond adequately and timely to the development of the peacemaking process in Angola," Karasin said. Russian representatives are prepared to continue to meet with participants in the negotiating process in Luanda, Lusaka and, if needed, in Moscow, Karasin said.
