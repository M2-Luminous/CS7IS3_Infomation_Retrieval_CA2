This is the result of a report made to the Cabinet this week by Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom, who chaired a commission to investigate the implications of the Ingonyama Trust Act. The Act, which makes the king a trustee over about three-million hectares, was singed by former State President F.W. de Klerk two days before the April 27 elections. The Act came under wide criticism because neither the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) nor the ANC had been consulted before it was passed. Hanekom said that the Act would need to be amended or substituted to clarify that as a trustee, the king is not the sole owner of the land, nor is he able to act in any governing capacity over the affairs of the people living on it. For example, issues of tribal disputes would not be decided by the King purely because he is the trustee. Hanekom also said that the Act would be amended to ensure that amenities for public use as well as urban areas that fall under the territory will not be under the control of the King, but will instead be governed by the provincial government. Furthermore, the people living on the land will be guaranteed security of tenure, and will be able to convert that tenure to ownership if need be. Land Affairs spokesperson Helmuth Schlenther said that although the King was vested with "thousands" of hereditary powers as King, he would not, as the trustee, be able to use these powers over the Trust land. He stressed that all of the people living on the land were the official beneficiaries of the Trust, and could thus veto any decision made by the King concerning the land or its inhabitants. "Basically, the King can't do anything without the consent of the people living on the land," Schlenther said. This erases concern by some sectors that the King, as trustee, would be able to appoint or remove chiefs if they fell in or out of favour. It also means that because of the King's lack of control, other than ceremonial, over the land, attempts by the Inkatha Freedom Party-dominated provincial government to use the King's power over the land and its people to gain political support will be unlikely.
