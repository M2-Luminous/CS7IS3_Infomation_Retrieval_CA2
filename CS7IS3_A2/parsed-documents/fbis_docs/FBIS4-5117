The deputy prime minister, concurrently the NUB minister, should head the coordination council for a meeting more than once a week and the meeting should be immediately held at a request from any member of the council, Kim ordered in a security-related cabinet meeting on Thursday morning. The coordination meeting will ensure more cooperative and ready response to security issues, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said afterward. At Kim's instruction, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok is expected to detail out operations of the council. Because the soon-to-be-formed coordination meetings will be held regularly at least more than once a week unlike the existing high-level strategic meetings headed by the president or prime minister that opens when necessary, they will prove more productive and practical, Chu said. Depending on the significance of the agenda, President Kim will personally chair the meetings, he said. Developments in North Korea and other major countries were discussed in Thursday's breakfast discussion, Chu said. It was concluded at the meeting that there was no solid evidence that North Korea owns nuclear weapons at present, he said. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported that there was no conspicuous military movement in North Korea.
