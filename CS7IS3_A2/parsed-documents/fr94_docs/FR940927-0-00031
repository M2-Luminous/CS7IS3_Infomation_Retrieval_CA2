FR940927-0-00031 FR940927-0-00003 (E) On which the cotton stalks are destroyed in violation of section 10; (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with subsection: (A) 11.(d) and (e) if it is mature ELS cotton; or (B) 11.(f) if it is AUP cotton insured under these crop provisions); and (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached: (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provided sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count.); or (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including any mature cotton retrieved from the ground. (d) Mature ELS cotton production may be adjusted for quality when production has been damaged by insured causes. Such production to count will be reduced if the price quotation for ELS cotton of like quality (price quotation ``A'') is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.'' Price quotation ``B'' will be the price quotation for ELS cotton of the grade, staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose. The price quotations for prices ``A'' and ``B'' will be the price quotations contained in the Weekly Cotton Market Review published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service the week the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale is classed is not available, the price quotations will be determined the week the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse as shown on the producer's account summary obtained from the gin. In the absence of either price quotation for the applicable week, the price quotations for the nearest prior week for which an ELS cotton price quotation was listed for both prices will be used. If eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to be counted will be determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor derived from dividing price quotation ``A'' by seventy-five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.'' (e) For ELS cotton to be eligible for quality adjustment as shown in subsection 11.(d), ginning must have been completed at a gin using roller equipment. (f) Any AUP cotton harvested or appraised from acreage originally planted to ELS cotton in the same growing season will be reduced by the factor obtained by dividing the price per pound of the AUP cotton by the price quotation for ELS cotton of the grade, staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose. The price used for the ELS cotton will be the price contained in the Weekly Cotton Market Review published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service the week the last bale from the unit is classed. The price used for the AUP cotton will be the price contained in the Daily Spot Cotton Quotations published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service the day the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale is classed is not available, the price quotations will be determined when the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, as shown on the producers account summary obtained from the gin. If either price quotation is unavailable for the dates stated above, the price quotations for the nearest prior date for which price quotations for both the AUP and ELS cotton are available will be used. If prices are not yet available for the insured crop year, the previous season's average prices will be used. 12. Prevented Planting (a) In lieu of paragraph 8.(b)(2) and subsection 1.(aa) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), insurance will be provided for acreage you were prevented from planting (see subsections 12.(b) through (g)). This coverage provides a reduced production guarantee. The reduced guarantee will be combined with the production guarantee for timely planted acreage for each unit. The premium amount for eligible prevented planting acreage will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our subsidy) for prevented planting acreage exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage). (For example, assume you insure one unit in which you have a 100 percent (100%) share. The unit consists of 100 acres, of which 50 acres were planted by the final planting date and 50 acres are unplanted and eligible for prevented planting coverage. To calculate the amount of any indemnity which may be due to you, the production guarantee for the unit will be computed as follows: (1) For timely planted acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 50 acres planted; and (2) For prevented planting acreage, multiply the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by thirty-five percent (0.35) and multiply the result by the 50 acres eligible for prevented planting coverage. The total of the two calculations will be the production guarantee for the unit. Your premium will be based on the result of multiplying the per acre production guarantee for timely planted acreage by the 100 acres in the unit). (b) If you were prevented from planting ELS cotton (see subsection 1.(l)), you may elect: (1) Not to plant this acreage to any crop that is intended for harvest in the same crop year, (The production guarantee for such acreage will be thirty-five percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 600 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 210 pounds per acre (600 pounds multiplied by 0.35). This paragraph does not prohibit the preparation and care of the acreage for conservation practices, such as planting a cover crop, as long as such crop is not intended for harvest.); or (2) To plant ELS cotton after the final planting date (The production guarantee for such acreage will be thirty-five percent (0.35) of the production guarantee for timely planted acres. For example, if your production guarantee for timely planted acreage is 600 pounds per acre, your prevented planting production guarantee would be equivalent to 210 pounds per acre (600 pounds multiplied by 0.35). Production to count for such acreage will be determined in accordance with subsections 11.(c) through (e)). (c) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8), the insurance period for prevented planting coverage beginning on the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county. (d) You must provide written notice to us if you were prevented from planting (see subsection 1.(l)). This notice must be given not later than three (3) days after the final planting date if you have unplanted acreage that may be eligible for prevented planting coverage. (e) The acreage to which prevented planting coverage applies will be limited as follows:
