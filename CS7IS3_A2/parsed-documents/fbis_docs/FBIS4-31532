The problem has mainly been that there has been no chance to reach a technological and organizational level that would allow them to compete on the Polish and foreign markets with the well-known foreign manufacturers. To illustrate this point, let us compare the potential of the Polish telecommunications industry to that of foreign manufacturers. The combined sales of five Polish enterprises covered by the privatization policy--i.e., "Telfy" SA [Incorporated], "Teletry" SA, PZT SA, ZWUT SA, and "Elwro" SA (this group is not fully devoted to telecommunications)--amounted to just under $60 million per year (in 1992). Sales in 1991 of public telecommunications systems (to include only exchanges and transmission units) amounted to almost $8 billion for Alcatel, $6 billion for AT&T, and only slightly less for Siemens. For all of these companies, this accounted for only a portion of their overall sales, which amounted to approximately $20 billion (Alcatel), about $14 billion (AT&T), and $44 billion (Siemens). Because of these production volumes, these companies are able to allocate $3-5 billion annually to research and development. As we see, this amount exceeds the value of the sales of the entire Polish telecommunications industry by several orders of magnitude. Financial Problems Polish companies that produce telecommunications equipment and, in particular, exchanges for the public net have found themselves in serious financial straits. An example of this is Warszawskie Zaklady Wytworcze Urzadzen Telekomunikacyjnych, ZWUT [Warsaw Telecommunications Equipment Production Plants], a company with roots in the sector that extend very far back and that has a considerable share of the market. In 1992, its losses amounted to 41 billion zloty [Z], and for the first half of 1993 to Z81 billion. Faced with scant prospects for developing and selling its main product, the Pentaconta analog exchange, ZWUT quickly approached the brink of bankruptcy. A total of 2,600 workers were laid off. The losses of the "Elwro" enterprise amounted to Z185 billion in 1992, and to Z90 billion over the first six months of 1993. The enterprise found itself in a similar situation, which meant layoffs for 1,200 people. The "Telfa" enterprise, which was sold previously, also racked up losses. During the last half of the year before "Telfa" was sold, losses amounted to Z20 billion. Only PZT and "Teletra" were operating near the breakeven point, but even they have few prospects of surviving on the market. At the same time, the domestic demand in this area is, as we know, tremendous. The poor state of Polish telecommunications is not only a source of daily frustration but also by itself one of the most serious barriers to attracting foreign capital to Poland. It is estimated that, by the year 2000, an average of 600,000 new lines will be installed per year, at an average cost of $1,500 per line. This means that the value of telecommunications deliveries to the Polish market will be approximately $900 million per year, of which about $240 million will be for exchanges, transmission equipment, and related services. This last group is a market segment covered by regulations that are to be introduced. Auction Card Everything seemed to indicate that the benefits of the rapid modernization and development of the Polish communications system would go to foreign companies, while the Polish ones would not survive. In addition, the uncontrolled proliferation of foreign suppliers on the Polish market would create the danger of introducing too many switching systems offered by the respective manufacturers. In Western Europe, there are two or three systems in operation in each country. In these countries, this equipment has resulted from many years of natural selection. It should be emphasized that the situation of Polish companies that manufacture exchanges for the public network has not attracted a great deal of interest from foreign capital. True, partnerships with foreign capital interests have been active in some of them, but the foreign shareholders have not been interested in expanding their investments under the existing conditions. Assuming correctly that the powerful auction card the Polish side has to play is the opportunity to sell equipment on an eager Polish market, two solutions present themselves that would allow foreign companies to profit from access to this market, provided conditions are ensured for Polish manufacturers to develop. First, the order from the Minister of Communications requires that deliveries of switching equipment for the public network have a 50-percent national content. Second, a decision made by KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers] in October 1992 directs that the number of installed remote switching systems, as well as the number of suppliers, be limited to three. These suppliers, according to the KERM decision, are to be selected during the course of the privatization of the group of Polish telecommunications enterprises that is to be carried out in three transactions. What has been accomplished in the natural course of events in many countries has, in Poland, had to be carried out in a way that is regulated and makes it possible to avoid "creative chaos." The solution that has been adopted has assured foreign companies access to the Polish market by putting it up for auction in connection with the acquisition of Polish enterprises. Investment commitments that investors have given in a buy-sell agreement, as well as the requirement for national content, ensure that the access gained to the market will be turned into a way of guaranteeing the development of production in Poland. Theory and Practice Let us take a look at the first of the tools utilized in this connection: the requirement for 50-percent national content. In this regard, it was assumed that each of the three suppliers would capture one-third of the Polish market--i.e., would sell the equipment that is needed for the installation of 200,000 lines per year. It would then be necessary to answer the question of how much of the production volume could be handled effectively in Poland. It would also be necessary to outline the possibilities for contributing to deliveries of equipment to the national market. Finally, it would be necessary to estimate the impact of Polish price realities on the altered cost structure in relation to the altered structure of the same costs abroad. Of course, all of this research required consideration of the time factor for estimating when the pledged level of national content could be achieved. As a result of the research based on the methodology outlined above (the research, a portion of which is presented here, was carried out by Bain & Co. at the request of the MPW [Ministry of Privatization]), it was found that achieving the target national content of 50 percent would not be possible from the technical standpoint unless the investors were allowed to include in the shipping cost to Poland the price paid for the shares of the Polish telecommunications enterprises acquired. This is, in fact, the solution that was adopted in the order from the Minister of Telecommunications. The order also allowed a period of three years for the required level of national content to be reached. At the expiration of this period, fulfillment of this requirement will be verified by an independent unit on behalf of the Ministry of Communications. The equipment suppliers are also obliged to file annual reports. As we know, requiring a specified national content is a protectionist tool. Consequently, in theory, it would lead to an increase in the costs of production and the prices for the equipment. It turns out, however, that, in the situation in question, the risk is not so great. First, it should be emphasized that the commitment for the successful suppliers to capture one-third of the market does not mean that access to this much of the market is awarded to them. On the contrary, all suppliers who emerge during the course of privatization are entitled to the same access to the market, not just a certain share allocated to them. This means that they will be obliged to compete in auctions organized by the operators (Telekomunikacje Polska, SA). This will undoubtedly put strong downward pressure on prices. Next, we should recall that, in outlining the extent of national content, consideration was given to how much of the equipment could be produced effectively (i.e., at competitive prices) in Poland at the intended scale of production. The requirement for national content is not supposed to become a pretext for obsolete and expensive local products because it applies to manufacturers who are world leaders in terms of the development of technology in the telecommunications area. Finally, it should be emphasized that the order from the Minister of Communications calls for controls on supplier pricing practices, as well as on technology transfer. The second of the solutions implemented (linking market access to the acquisition of Polish enterprises that produce telecommunications equipment) is certainly better known because it was the subject of press items that appeared at the time the regular transactions were completed. Just remember that the right of exclusive access to the market was granted for a term of six years to the suppliers whose systems have already been adopted in Poland and who made the purchases within the framework of one of the three proposed transactions. The objects of these purchases were packages of 80 percent of the shares of "Telfa" in Bydgoszcz, "Teletra" in Poznan, and PZT and ZWUT in Warsaw, to which "Elwro" in Wroclaw was also added by decision of KERM. The buyers were, respectively, the U.S. concern AT&T, Alcatel SESA from Spain, and Siemens from Germany. All of these firms are world leaders in the field of telecommunications. In discussing the results of the three transactions together, we note that the sale of 80 percent of the shares of the five enterprises funneled $70 million into the state budget, and the buyers pledged to invest $162 million over six years, subject to agreed-upon penalties [for failing to do so] and to raise the paid-in capital by a total of $70 million over two years. They also guaranteed jobs for 5,600 workers for 18 months. These transactions do not, of course, encompass the entire telecommunications industry. Additional privatization transactions are also slated for this sector of industry. The most important decision that will have to be made, however, pertains to the fate of the main operator in Poland, Telekomunikacja Polska SA, which holds a monopoly position.
