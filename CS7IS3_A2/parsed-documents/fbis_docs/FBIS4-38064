The flights took place in an East European country about six months ago, BIT'ON HEYL HA'AVIR reveals in this week's issue. The pilots flew the MiG-29 -- the Arab countries' most advanced aircraft -- four times, with each flight lasting approximately 20 minutes at a temperature under 0 degrees centigrade. This unique opportunity to inspect the plane yielded several distinct conclusions. According to one of the pilots, the MiG-29 is easy to operate and maneuver and is energetic and well equipped. It has excellent radar, a very advanced detection system, and a more sophisticated throttle than that of the F-16. As for its aerodynamic performance, it definitely belongs to the state-of-the- art aircraft in the category of the F-15 and F-16. The most important conclusion for us: The MiG-29 is incapable of reaching Israeli borders from either Iraq or Iran, although it certainly can pose a threat to Israeli aircraft attempting to reach those countries. The Air Force division head summed up: We have a clear advantage over this aircraft, but if we are forced to confront it, we may run a certain risk.
