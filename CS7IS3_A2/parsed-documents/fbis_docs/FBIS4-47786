Musuleng-Cooper, in the transitional government. Local press reports in Monrovia itself are calling on the Council of State to immediately accept Mrs. Cooper's appointment, to accelerate the peace process. In its yesterday's editorial, the independent EYE newspaper said it is frankly not in agreement with the decision of the Council of State to appoint a neutral person to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EYE newspaper said any attempt to do so by the Council of State would be in contravention of the Cotonou Accord, which gives the parties the right to distribute cabinet posts after consultation among themselves. The EYE editorial said it is of the belief that the council can be forceful in pinning down the parties to reach an agreement on the issue, instead of circumventing the accord. The newspaper then asked if the Council of State feels it has the power to appoint cabinet minister -- then why didn't it do so ever since. The EYE editorial continued: If it is true that such a thing were agreed to have prompted the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] to withdraw Counselor Momolu Sirleaf and replace him with Mrs. Musuleng-Cooper, then it is fair enough to accept the conditions agreed upon. Doing otherwise will only show bad intention, which will certainly create problems for the peace process, the paper said. The EYE newspaper said it suspects problems will develop if attempts are made to outmaneuver others on what has been negotiated and agreed. The paper then implored the Council of State to be bold and act without committing itself to consciously breech the Cotonou Accord. Meanwhile, the man representing the NPFL in the Council of State, Vice Chairman Isaac Musa, has asserted that Mrs. D.Musuleng-Cooper will not be changed by the Council of State. Vice Chairman Musa said the Cotonou Agreement does not give any right to the council to reject any nominee from the party. On the question of appointing a neutral person to the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Musa repeated that, directly or in directly, all Liberians took part in the war, and will therefore not go along with the council's decision to reject the NPFL nominee. Vice Chairman Musa noted that our people have suffered too long, saying the council should try to find means of ending the war and see how displaced people and the refugee problem can be solved. He said the council is wasting time on issues that have been dealt with. Vice Chairman Musa said prices of local commodities on the local market are very high, noting that the council should do something to handle such problems. Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL says any drift in the Cotonou peace accord could lead to a total breakdown on the peace process. The NPFL says Council Chairman David Kpomakpor should stop making decisions without the knowledge of other members of the council, saying this is unacceptable. The leader of the NPFL, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has repeatedly asserted that the council has no dismissing or firing powers.
