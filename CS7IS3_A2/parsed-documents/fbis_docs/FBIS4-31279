Kolodko under the "Answers and Questions" rubric: "Situation Used To Be Worse"] [Text] As it is opening up to the world, Poland is proceeding on its road to democracy, to a social market economy, and to the free enterprise of sectors with equal rights. To strengthen this process, we now need a strategic concept of long-term economic development. We have lacked such a concept for years; the economic policy, especially the financial policy, which was supposed to resolve only short-term problems, in fact resolved only some problems, while at the same time creating new ones. Today these problems are stacking up so much that we need a new complex approach. Otherwise, the achievements of the transformation made so far will be seriously jeopardized. One might pretend that it is still possible to increase unemployment or the internal public debt, that all foreign credit can easily be accepted, and that the present system of social insurances does not have to be changed. It might be assumed that economic growth will be maintained without reinforcing the people's tendency to save money, that simply giving state property to people is the road to an efficiency-oriented privatization, that there are not very many poor people, and that all the rich people are doing nothing but trying to get hold of the finance minister to pay him their taxes. Things were and still are different from that. This is why we need an active economic and social policy that would provide a foundation for the creative work that will have to be done by all of us. The directions of this policy are presented in the Strategy for Poland, which will find its way to the Sejm this week. We are entering a new phase of transformations. Its main characteristics are: lowering the social costs of the reforms, adding dynamism to the economy, and effecting systemic stabilization. An economic strategy is also necessary to make the growth trends lasting and balanced. To achieve this, it is indispensable to lengthen the period during which the economic policy is carried out. Transforming work relationships, reforming the social insurance system, mobilizing the country's savings, granting equal rights to all ownership sectors, establishing a higher level of international competitiveness, improving the security of the economic turnover--these are the key elements of such a strategy. It stresses the establishment and development of institutions supporting a modern and functional market economy. So far we have reached a paradoxical situation in which public opinion places greater trust in "Solidarity '80" and "Self-Defense" than... in private banks. The people feel lost. This is because the reality is changing from the vision that appeared five years ago. The people still do not have a clear picture of their future and do not know the path that leads to it. Statements concerning the lack of a so-called third road (actually, there are more than a dozen) suggest only a sharp alternative: either a return to the rejected past or simple continuation, ostensibly leading to capitalism at the cost of humility and subordination to the wisdom of those who call the shots in both politics and finance. Therefore, the people need an even more credible strategy of development over a longer period. When one wants to resolve problems that have piled up over generations, he cannot rely on short-term programs. The lack of a strategic approach in the past is one of the reasons for the current difficulties. However, the people, who have for some time now been most frequently called "the electorate," which should make them protest, can make evaluations. Exactly five years ago they proved this in the elections, which, along with the results of the Roundtable, gave rise to a new stage in history. It seems that we were able to draw the right conclusions from that--not only in Poland. We should bear in mind, however, that government policies have already been evaluated several times since that breakthrough--in the following elections. Such a perception of the Polish process of transformations will probably be seen in the coming self-government elections as well. This is what this means, particularly in the context of economic and social policies: First, it proves a lack of approval for the method of transforming the economy, the excessive costs of this process, and the distribution of these costs. One cannot try to persuade oneself and others that social dissatisfaction is caused by a wrong perception of the people, who cannot see that the situation is already better. Even if that were the case, what counts here is the state of social awareness, and it cannot be underestimated. The conviction that the situation has deteriorated emerges in this awareness only now, which is a clear delay. In other words, even though the real incomes and the level of consumption have been on the increase recently, the people are still comparing their living standards over a longer period. It is with a certain delay that they respond to the deterioration or improvement of those standards. Second, the process of transformations is accompanied by an enormous redistribution of incomes and reserves. For most people this means poverty, for the minority--wealth. However, everyone is complaining, including the greatest material beneficiaries of the transformations. Recently only 7 percent of the people have admitted that their material situation has improved over the past year, whereas more than 50 percent claim that it is worse than it used to be. Material and social facts, unlike pieces of bad luck, do not happen at the same time. Third, the state of dissatisfaction is caused by comparing reality with excessively aroused expectations. Today it turns out that even considerable economic growth--close to 10 percent in 1993 and 1994--and good prospects for the future are not only unable to offset the nearly 20-percent decrease in the GDP between 1989 and 1991 but also unable to wipe out the bad impression that was given by false declarations concerning the prospect of growth after only a six-month recession, or by empty promises, made several times, about lowering monthly inflation to less than 1 percent. The authors of these irresponsible declarations pretend that they have not been made at all; however, the people have not forgotten them. One cannot forget that, between September 1989 and September 1993, prices increased 40 times, and particularly that enormous redistribution was made by mechanisms that have still not been accepted and that for many people are not even understandable. Only now have we been able to make a decision on decreasing the face value of the Polish zloty at the beginning of next year. This is an expression of the conviction that we will not swerve from the path of lowering inflation. The view that in the transformations made so far it was possible to achieve more at a smaller cost no longer raises any serious doubts among independent observers and experts. The argument that in some other countries of the region the situation is worse than in Poland does not change either this evaluation or the conclusions resulting from it. If somewhere else the situation is worse, it is because the conditions are and were different there, and primarily because even more mistakes were made there, which is not a great comfort for us. Frankly, I do not fully understand why those who should be praised for their achievements and criticized for their mistakes keep rejecting this obvious conclusion. One must go hand in hand with the other, also in the future. Subjecting oneself to constructive criticism is an indispensable condition that offers a chance to avoid some potential mistakes in the future. I would like my presence on the hospitable pages of POLITYKA to serve this purpose.
