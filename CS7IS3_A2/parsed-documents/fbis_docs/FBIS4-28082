Speaking at the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reiterated his hope that China will use its power of influence over North Korea to resolve the problem. [Begin Hata recording] China is a country with very close friendly relations with North Korea, and their economic ties are very strong too. That being the case, China holds a lot of influence over that country. In addition, China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. And while we would like to learn more about China's views, we would certainly like it to use its power of influence. [end recording] Prime Minister Hata added that although Japan wanted a solution through dialogue, government offices were, of course, exchanging information among themselves about contingencies that might arise. He said the government would take appropriate action to fulfill its role in the international community. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also spoke at the session. He is due to visit South Korea and China on 11 and 12 June respectively. He said that in Seoul he wanted an exchange of views so that South Korea and Japan could cooperate in taking efficient action. In China, he said, he wanted to ask that Beijing make efforts to persuade North Korea to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. [passage omitted]
