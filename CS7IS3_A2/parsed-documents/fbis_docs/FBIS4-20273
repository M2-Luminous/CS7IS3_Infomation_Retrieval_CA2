Denktas said: If the Greek Cypriots had remained loyal to the original package and if the UN Secretariat General had not agreed to any changes, as demanded of us, then these difficulties would probably not have arisen. Denktas held a news conference this afternoon following the announcement by Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy in Cyprus, that the negotiating process with regard to the implementation of the confidence-building measures package has broken down, after a meeting with Denktas. Explaining that the Greek Cypriots asked for a change, were granted this wish, and did their utmost to undermine the package, Denktas said: They can rejoice that they have succeeded in doing this. Anyway, no Greek Cypriot leader was in favor of this package in the beginning. Kliridhis himself had accepted the package, because it suited his tactics. The change introduced to the package allows planes from Greek Cypriot airlines to use the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport, while the use of the airport by Turkish Cypriot planes is based on the condition that all writings and logos be removed from the planes, Denktas remarked. He noted that Kliridhis is pretending to accept the package, knowing that it will be rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side and this will make it easier for the Greek Cypriots to become a member of the European Union [EU]. Expressing the hope that the EU will approach the Cyprus issue in a more positive light in the future, Denktas said that if the matter is approached in a realistic way, the Greek Cypriots will resort to every possible maneuver to remain the legitimate Cyprus government on the island and will continue to deceive the world. Denktas declared: We displayed a sensitive and constructive stand, but the Greek Cypriots' tactics led this matter into an impasse.
