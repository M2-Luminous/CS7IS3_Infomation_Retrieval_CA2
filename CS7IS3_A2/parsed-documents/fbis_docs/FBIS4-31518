Slovak Blue Helmets deployed in the area also took part in this mission. The reopening of the route means that the link between the Dalmatian coast and the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, has been reestablished. A floating bridge has been installed on the Bijela River to replace the one destroyed during the fighting between Croats and Muslims. The UK's Michael Rose, commander of the Blue Helmets in the area, was at the bridge-opening ceremony where a plaque was unveiled in honor of the Blue Helmets, among whom are the Spaniards belonging to the Cordoba Group.
