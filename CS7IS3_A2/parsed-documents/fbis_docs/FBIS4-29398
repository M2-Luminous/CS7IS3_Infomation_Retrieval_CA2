"Kim II-song is my best friend," Sihanouk said, "He told me this: `please tell your American friends, brother Sihanouk, for my part I will not be the aggressor in a possible war . . . but if the Americans or others start the war we are ready to respond. We are prepared to face a big war and it will not be victorious. We will be able to resist and avoid defeat. They will be able to destroy the infrastructure of Korea, but we have our underground equipment and we will be able to resist even an atomic war'." Sihanouk quoted Kim as telling him: "We do not need to negotiate with the UN or others, but we need direct negotiations with the United States of America." According to Sihanouk, Kim said: "The reason we refuse inspection in depth is just this: we only have secret defence systems and organisations and the Americans know, perhaps, that we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what exactly our defence system with conventional weapons is. That is the reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in depth. We cannot accept that. Besides the question of our sovereignty and national dignity and pride, we have our secrets." Kim told Sihanouk: "Please compare us to a man: They want us to take off our shirt, our coat, and now our trousers, and after that we will be nude, absolutely naked. What they want us to be is a man without defence secrets, just a naked man. We cannot accept that. We would rather accept a war. If they decide to make war, we accept the war, the challenge we are prepared for." Sihanouk told the REVIEW: "I think the warning should be taken seriously. On the one hand, Kim II-song wants me to say a few words to America. So I have a golden opportunity with you to tell America . . . the words were not hostile at all. But he says `we are prepared, and if America wants a war with us, OK, we accept' . . . on the other hand, Washington more or less despises Sihanouk .... He (Kim) prefers negotiations--even without positive results--the continuation of negotiations . . . he said tell your American friends, but I have had no opportunity to tell the officials. No, I don't, need to tell the officials, as I have been telling you; (anyway) they despise me."
