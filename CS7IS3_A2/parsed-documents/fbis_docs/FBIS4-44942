Seshan, could take action for alleged breach of the code of conduct after the issuance of the by-election notification... A Division Bench comprising Mr Justice J.S. Verma and Mr Justice S.P. Bharucha, said: - The court made it clear that its interim order of April 4, 1994, was made and intended to operate only till the time of issuance of the statutory notification. - As such notification was expected shortly, the CEC had sought modification of the April 4 order. - From the submission of the CEC, it seems that it was merely for the clarification of the said order. - The only dispute raised by the writ petition of the Andhra Government was regarding the enforceability of the Model Code of Conduct prior to the issue of the poll notification under the RPA which commenced with the election process. - The petition also pertained to the question whether the code had legal sanction in case of a breach, of the code prior to the issue of the statutory notification calling for the by-elections 31 days from the actual poll date. - The petition by the Andhra Pradesh Government did not raise the dispute regarding the desirability and enforceability of the model code from the time of issuance of the poll notification. That order had come on a petition by the Andhra Pradesh Government seeking a restraint on the CEC from stopping the State from going ahead with certain schemes in the Kurnool Lok Sabha seat, where by-elections are due next month, with effect from the date of announcement of the poll instead of the notification date.
