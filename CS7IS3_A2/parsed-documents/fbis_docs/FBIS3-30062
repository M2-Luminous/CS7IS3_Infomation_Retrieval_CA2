Generally speaking, our people are still very poor. We are a lot better now in comparison with the era under French domination. We, however, are still far behind if we compare our people's standard of living with people in other countries. As a result, we must strive to improve our socioeconomic development. Our party has set lines and policies to firmly maintain national independence and called all people to integrate efforts to build the nation, strive to extricate the nation from poverty and backwardness; work hard to make our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and civilized. We must strive to ensure happiness and a better life for all people including ethnic minorities and religious groups throughout the country. To fulfill this task, first of all, we must strive to enhance the people's intelligence, provide them with better education, and enhance their background and capability. Moreover, we must strive to practice thrift and work hard to amass wealth while enhancing unity to ensure our happiness. Uncle Ho taught us: Unity, unity, great unity; success, success, great success. As a result, we must strive to enhance unity among people of various nationalities, religious groups, and within the entire party for the sake of national independence, freedom, and happiness of the people so as to write new pages of our glorious history. I hope that Nam Ha Province will be able to overcome all difficulties, extricate itself from poverty, and soon enjoy prosperity. On the new year occasion, I wish all comrades and countrymen in the province a happy and prosperous new year and success in building the party."
