Cetin and Papoulias met at the Ciragan Palace this afternoon. Papoulias said that it is necessary to create `a good atmosphere' in order to overcome the problems in Turkish-Greek relations. He added, however, that this can only be achieved through the efforts of both sides. Cetin stated that mutual cooperation is needed to overcome misunderstandings. In a statement after his meeting with Cetin, Papoulias said that `the meeting had gone well and that the results would be good.' Pointing out that the two ministers decided to establish `habitual relations' to be attended by officials from their respective ministries, Papoulias further `welcomed' the statement made by Cetin on relations with Greece at his news conference yesterday. Papoulias said: It is my personal view that this meeting was positive and that it will yield good results. Also making a statement after the meeting, Cetin described his meeting with Papoulias as a `beneficial' one. Noting that at the meeting they dwelt on the need to cooperate in order to prevent mutual misunderstandings, Cetin added: At the meeting we discussed the statements and comments made by the Turkish and Greek publics from time to time. It was very beneficial. We discussed refraining from behavior that might incite the public, that both sides should be careful on the issue and that there should be cooperation to prevent misunderstandings. Cetin said that at the meeting Papoulias noted that Greece also suffers from terror and added: He told me that they are, therefore, ready to discuss the issue if there is any information on it, that they are ready to assess it and that they categorically do not and will not support terror. We also dwelt upon the fact that it will be beneficial to get together more frequently in order to develop relations. Cetin later met with Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs.
