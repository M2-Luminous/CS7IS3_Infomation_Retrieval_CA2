Good evening Cavada. We are ready whenever you are. [Cavada] Yes, thank you very much. Good evening, people of Cuba. Once again, Cuba's Foreign Ministry has presented to (?the world) the true architect of its diplomacy: the Cuban people. This evening, over 40 chiefs of mission -- ambassadors, consuls, military attaches -- left the Cuban capital to learn in detail about all the things that the men and women of the Escambray Mountain areas accomplish daily. The first stop on this work tour was the Integrated Military Enterprise of the Che Guevara Center in Manicaragua Municipality, Villa Clara Province, very near the community of La Campana, where the visitors were informed about the possibilities the medical industry brings to the nation's life. There, Brigadier General Luis Perez, an engineer and director of the Military Enterprises Union, confirmed that over 40 factories, in addition to making and repairing all the military material for the Revolutionary Armed Forces, are collaborating with tourism, the nickel industry, and petroleum. In this way, the alleged (?veils) that have always existed regarding military information were lifted because, as Foreign Minister Robaina said, at home, there are no hidden truths, and truth is precisely the distinctive sign of Cuba's foreign policy, which arises, without a doubt, from the interior of the country. The following is the opinion of the Colombian ambassador to Cuba: [Begin recording] Well, as for me, I must say that [words indistinct], because our idea is to bring businessmen, bring people linked (?to) businesses in Colombia; and this way we can identify the kinds of opportunities, the kind of exchange agreements that can be realized. Thus, it is particularly useful for the ambassadors and for me to begin learning from within how industry is doing, how the Cuban economy is doing. [end recording] [Cavada] These have been exclusive details of the working tour that began today in central Cuba for the diplomatic corps accredited to Cuba, led by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. People of Cluba, Roberto Cavada wishes you a good night. [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT on 18 February, in a similar report, add, to conclude their report: Tomorrow, the group is scheduled to tour the Topes de Collantes area and a number of Escambray Mountain areas. This tour is part of a new offensive by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. It is undoubtedly a way of meeting with the true protagonists of the foreign policy on the island: our people.]
