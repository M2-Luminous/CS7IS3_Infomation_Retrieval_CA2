Today, our people are accelerating the struggle to implement the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song at the 21st plenary session of the sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the letter he sent to the historic national agricultural meeting. They are also effecting a new great upsurge in the major fronts of economic construction, including agriculture and light industry. Enhancing the genuine appearance of our society's single-hearted unity firmly rallied around the party and the leader [suryong] and their beautiful communist virtues which show our people's noble ideological and mental features, all of our working people are vigorously advancing, while breaking through all sorts of difficulties and the challenge of enemies, and the whole country is filled an unprecedented upsurge in the popular masses' revolutionary zeal. We should strengthen the country's might and further exalt the superiority of the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style by successfully executing the immense tasks of economic construction that we are facing and this year's state budget on the strength of our masses' surging revolutionary zeal. By the authority of the Government of the Republic I will now present a report on the settlement of the execution of the state budget for 1993 and the state budget for 1994. Comrade deputies: Last year our people won a great victory in socialist construction by surmounting the grim trials laid before the fatherland and the revolution and by fighting heroically under the party's leadership. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Winning successive victories in political and military confrontation with enemies under the party's leadership, our people vigorously accelerated socialist economic construction with surging revolutionary zeal last year and, as a result, adorned the last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan as a brilliant year. Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries perpetrated offensives and aggression manuevers designed to oppose our republic, a fortress of socialism, and to crush our socialist cause more adventurously and viciously. However, they could not frighten our people, nor could they block our people's advance. Our party took a stern self-defensive measure of placing the whole country, all the people, and all the Army in a semi-war state to cope with the extremely acute situation which was created due to the Team Spirit joint military exercise staged by the U.S. imperialists and, thus, vigorously inspired all the people throughout the country into a struggle to defend the sovereignty aof the country and the gains of the revolution. Brave officers and men of our People's Army and all of the working people who are infinitely loyal to the party and the leader [suryong] bravely rose up with a do-or-die determination in response to the party's call and heroically braved the enemies' offensives, holding aloft the banner of socialism to thus honorably defended the fatherland's dignity and security. [applause] Upholding our party's call, our people waged a vigorous and continuous battle of loyalty, maintaining the spirit of general mobilization heightened during the period of a semi-war state, registered great labor exploits, and grandly celebrated the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War. Through this, they strongly demonstrated the heroic spirit of our people vigorously advancing firmly rallied around the party and the leader and the might of chuche Korea. [applause] In the forceful blaze of the external struggle and of the socialist general onward march which was vigorously waged greeting the 40th anniversary of the war victory, the revolutionary ranks of our wholehearted unity were solidified more firmly into an invincible force, and a great upsurge was brought forth in socialist economic construction. By so doing, a great victory was won in the battle for the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan. In connection with the conclusion of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central Committee held last year proudly summed up the great advance our people had achieved in all sectors of socialist construction under our party's great leadership despite grave trials and difficulties during this period when the situation at home and abroad was most complex and acute. By so doing, the plenary meeting highly demonstrated again the heroic spirit of the chuche Korea and the might of our-style socialism which is firmly maintained in a corner of the Orient and is victoriously advancing. All the victories our people achieved in acute confrontation with enemies last year were a great victory of the ever-victorious strength of our party's iron will and tested leadership and independent, self-reliant, and self-defending revolutionary line. They were the victory of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. They were the powerful demonstration of the superiority and invincibility of our-style socialism centered on the popular masses. [applause] In the all-people general onward march last year, our people brought forth great upsurges in socialist economic construction, thus successfully executing the state budget as well. The total state budget revenue last year was 40.5712 billion won. This represents our overfulfilling the plan by 0.3 percent. Because our people vigorously waged a mass campaign to increase the financial revenue by effecting production upsurge in all sectors of the people's economy and effectively utilizing the existing economic base, the budget revenue scored an increase of 2.6 percent over the previous year. The total state budget expenditure last year was 40.24297 billion won. This represents an execution of 99.5 percent of the planned amount and an increase of 2.4 percent over the previous year. The state budget last year satisfactorily ensured the increasing financial demands in various domains of socialist construction based on the increased budged revenue, and was successfully summed up with financial reserves of 328.23 million won. During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan which was embroidered with great creation and construction, state budget income in our country increased with a rapid average speed of 5.2 percent per year and the total scale of budget income increased 1.4 times. As a result, the state budget in our country excellently contributed to strengthening the might of the self-reliant socialist economy, to promoting and developing a socialist national culture, to promoting the people's material and cultural welfare, and to highly displaying the superiority of our own-style socialism. This clearly demonstrates incomparable superiority and firmness of the state budget of our country, which is developing in a planned manner based on independent financial foundations, as well as the justness of our party's financial policy. [applause] Last year, the government of the republic increased disbursement of funds to the national economy 2.5 percent over the previous year with a view to accelerating socialist economic construction and to further promoting the people's living standard. Of the funds, the investment in precedent sectors of national economy, in light industry, and in rural economy was drastically increased. Last year the state budget increased the investment in coal industry, mining industry, electric power industry, and metal industry, by 3.5 percent over the previous year, and ensured production conditions with priority. Thus, it directed great efforts to effecting a production upsurge in these domains. By cherishing ardent loyalty to the party and the leader, the working class of the coal industry domain effected collective innovations last year, and completed construction of Hwapung mine in Anju district mine complex; the project of in-pit belt-conveyer transport line in Namyang mine, Pukchang district mine complex, and first and second-phase construction project of long-range conveyor-belt transport line in Yongdae mine. The working class in this domain vigorously pushed ahead with construction of new mines and new pits, and expansion project of existing pits, and accelerated modernization of in-pit transport means and coal mining facilities, thus drastically increasing coal production capacity. Last year, the mining industry sector completed construction of No. 12 pit and No.24 vertical pit in Komdok mine complex; ore dressing site in (Taeduri) mine; ore dressing site in Changsang mine, and [word indistinct] in Munmuri mine. The mining industry sector further expanded mines with bright prospects and drastically increased production of various types of ore including lead, zinc, and copper. Construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations and thermoelectric power stations, Kumgangsan power station, and Yongwon power station was vigorously pushed ahead last year, thanks to the devoted labor struggle of the working class of the electric power industry sector which is endlessly loyal to the party and the leader, and of the builders of the power stations. In addition, the No. 1 generator in Namgang power station and No. 2 generator in Tongpyongyang thermoelectric power station began operation, and a large number of small and medium-size hydroelectric power stations were built in many places. Last year in the metal industry sector, the construction project of the steel plate [words indistinct] in the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex, the construction project of the [word indistinct] in the Chollima Steel Complex, and the expansion work of the ferroalloy workshop in the Puryong Ferroalloy Complex were completed because of the strength of the state's vast investments and steel workers' creative efforts and struggle. The processes of steel and rolling steel manufacturing were readjusted and strengthened, and, as a result, metal plants were more firmly built into a chuche-oriented and modern metallurgical base. Last year, our party and the government of the republic concentrated great efforts on developing the light industry. The state budget allocated a large amount of funds--which increased 4 percent over the previous year--to the light industry sector in accordance with our party's revolutionary policy of increasing investments in the light industry and of thoroughly carrying out the revolution in the light industry sector. Thanks to our party's active measures and the devoted labor struggle by the working class in the light industry sector, a great innovation was effected in the production of various kinds of daily necessities urgently required in improving the people's living. Along with this, the expansion work of the Kusong textile plant, the construction of the 4 March plant, the construction of the Nanam clothing plant, and the construction projects of various other modern textile and clothing plants, shoes plants, and food processing plants were completed and put into operation. Thus, the modernization of light industry plant facilities were vigorously carried out. Last year, the government of the republic also allocated a large amount of funds--which increased 4 percent over the previous year--to the railway transport sector. The working class and builders in the railway transport sector readjusted and strengthened major trunk lines into heavy-duty rails by accelerating the modernization of railway transport and the introduction of heavy-duty railways, upholding the party's policy of carrying out the revolution in the transport sector. They also actively carried out the work for technological innovation and completed the electrification of the Yongkwang-Saju line, the construction of the turning line [tollimson] railway construction between Kowon and Kurae, and other railway electrification projects and new railway construction in many areas. Thus, they further increased the railway transport capabilities. Last year, the rural economy sector vigorously waged the struggle to implement the demands of the socialist rural theses and the chuche farm methods and, as a result, achieved a great progress in agricultural production. Last year, the state sharply increased its investment in agriculture--2.8 percent over the previous year--in an effort to strengthen the material and technological foundation of the rural economy by carrying out the rural technological revolution. Last year, on the strength of the vigorous support from the people throughout the country, our agricultural working people completed the construction of the Sohae lockgate (Haesan)-Ongjin waterway and, thus, more smoothly resolved the water supply problem in our country's plain areas. They also built 1,000 water pumping stations and drainage facilities and more of water reservoirs and underground water supply facilities in various areas. Thus, they more properly perfected the irrigation system in our rural areas. Thanks to our party's active measures to achieve the use of chemicals in the rural economy, last year more of various kinds of chemical fertilizer were produced and supplied in the rural areas, and, as a result, the amount of chemical fertilizers applied on fields across the country increased by far. Last year, a large number of tractors, trucks, and various types of modern farm machines were produced and supplied to cooperative farms. By vigorously carrying out the huge nature remaking project to build a tideland towards the West Sea, our brave tideland builders have registered a brilliant feat of reclaiming vast areas of tidal land by completing construction on Kumsong and Chongsudo tidelands. Under the banner of the socialist rural theses, irrigation and electrification have already been completed at a high level in our country's rural areas, and new progress has also been made in mechanizing and scientizing rural areas. Thus, a significant [kyolchongjogin] victory has been achieved in implementing a technological revolution in rural areas. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historic letter to the national agricultural meeting held on the 30th anniversary of the publication of the theses on our country's socialist rural problems. In the letter, summing up the great victory achieved by our party and people in the struggle to implement the rural theses, he announced proudly that the historic task of implementing the technological revolution in rural areas, which is presented in the socialist rural theses, has basically been completed [kibonjogurowansong toeodda] with the realization of irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and scientization in our country's rural areas. [applause] This is the change of the century made in our country's rural areas and the most brilliant victory achieved in the course of the struggle to realize the rural theses. [applause] Because of the technological revolution realized in rural areas under the brilliant rays of the socialist rural theses, the material and technological basis of agriculture has been strengthened further than ever, and we could achieve a bumper crop last year despite unfavorable weather by completely observing the chuche farming method. The brilliant result achieved in the rural economic development under our party's leadership clearly demonstrates the great vitality of the socialist rural theses, which has opened the broad way to solve rural problems, and the superiority of our country's socialist rural economic system, which has been consolidated and developed under the banner of the rural theses. [applause] The republic's government appropriated an enormous fund, 1.5 percent up from last year, to build more houses and to further develop cities and other territories of the country. Upholding our party's intent to build a grand capital, builders and supporters in Pyongyang built the Kwangbok and Tong-il streets and 50,000 modern houses and completed the huge and difficult construction in the short space of one and half years by continuously effecting mass innovations. Last year, they registered another brilliant feat of completing the construction of an additional 30,000 modern houses. The newly built magnificent, luxurious modern houses in the capital are proud creations whose construction was due to the great benevolence of our party, which has led builders to create an unprecedented speed of construction with a high goal to arrange better living conditions for our people. Last year, in Pyongyang city, greeting the 40th anniversary of the war victory, the commemorative tower of the victory of the Fatherland Liberation War was built reflecting our party's lofty will and farsighted plan to hand down the heroic exploits of our People's Army and our people who honorably defended the freedom and sovereignty of the fatherland to the next generations forever. Along with this, the three revolutions exhibition newly opened; a hotel for (?scientists), Pyongyang cold noodle restaurant equipped with 5,000 seats in modern facilities, the road between Pyongyang and Kangdong, the (Munsong) (?playground), and Pyongyang bowling hall--which reflects the patriotic spirit of the industrialists of the General Association of Koreans residing in Japan and their families--were outstandingly built. As a result of this, Pyongyang has been turned into a more splendid, modern city. Numerous monumental edifices which have been built in Pyongyang in succession very year and the grand appearance of Pyongyang which is being changed clearly shows the dignified appearance of chuche Korea which is enjoying infinite grandeur and prosperity and the wisdom and heroic mettle of our people who are glorifying the era of the Workers Party. Last year, the state built many modern houses not only in local cities such as Sinuiju, Haesan, Haeju, and Kaesong, but also in rural areas and, thus, provided more cultural living conditions to the people. Last year, the government of the republic further increased social, cultural, and housing expenses to further develop all fields of socialist cultural construction. Last year, the state further increased scientific and technological development work expenses 7 percent over the previous year. Our scientists and technicians fully demonstrated their creative ability and wisdom with infinite loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] and outstandingly solved various valuable scientific and technological problems arising in making the national economy chuche-oriented, modernized, and scientific. Thus, they actively contributed to the country's scientific and technological development. Last year, the government of the republic raised expenditures for educational work 3.5 percent over the previous year and built anew some additional 20 colleges, including engineering colleges, agricultural colleges, and physical culture colleges, in provinces. It also built some 1,000 classrooms in various schools and provided schools with modern educational equipment and facilities. Thus, it has provided a firmer foundation for education for the next generations and for the training of national cadres. Last year, the government of the republic also raised expenditures for cultural work, public health work, and sports work in an effort to smoothly guarantee the development of literary and arts, public health, and sports. Last year, not only the (Namdaebong) secret camp and the (Pukdaebong) secret camp--which were founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song during his anti-Japanese armed struggle in the area of central Korea as strong points for his local leadership--were rebuilt as they were, but also various historical battlefields of the revolution and historical sites of the revolution which will glorify the immortal revolutionary achievements of the party and the leader forever were more outstandingly rebuilt as strongpoints for the indoctrination in the revolutionary traditions. At the same time, last year, thanks to the policy of correctly inheriting and developing national cultural relics elucidated by the great leader and thanks to the wise leadership of our party, the royal tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder king of Koguryo, which was a powerful big country in the Orient, and the royal tomb of King Wanggon, the founder king of Koryo, were outstandingly rebuilt. With the unearthing of Tangun's tomb we could discover again the founder king of our nation and the 5,000 year history of our nation, and the work of rebuilding the tomb was vigorously carried out, thus, making the hearts of all fellow countrymen filled with national dignity and honor. Thanks to the measures taken by our party--which ceaselessly gives unsparing love and concern to bring our children up well culturally and emotionally, and promote their health--the Songdokwon International Children's Union Members Camp has sprang up magnificently. The first stage of construction for the Hamhung Municipal Children's Union Members Camp has been finished, enabling it to open to the republic. In addition, thanks to young compatriots' patriot devotion, the splendid Aeguk Preventives Manufacturing Plant has been newly built, greatly contributing to implementing the party's lines of preventive medicine. Last year, the state offered additional benefits to our people by increasing various popular [word indistinct] to promote the people's welfare. Not long ago, our people observed the 20th anniversary of the proclamation of the historic law on totally abolishing the tax system. Without collecting a penny for taxes, our country last year supplied food to workers and office employees almost free of charge at state expense, and implemented the systems of overall free education and free comprehensive medical care. In addition, our country provided well-furnished houses to workers, office employees, and peasants, and electricity, service water, and even fuel were supplied free of charge. In this way, the state last year envisaged a great amount of funds worth billions of won to implement these policies alone. Amid the rapidly changing situation and difficulties during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, Our party and the government of the republic invariably carried out all sorts of popular communist policies for the people without trimming a penny from the state's huge financial expenditure even under a difficult condition in which many things had to diverted economically to the defense due to stern situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula. During the same period, our party and the government of the republic drastically raised the wages [saenghwalbi] of all workers, technicians, and office employees to 43.4 percent on the average, and sharply increased social security funds for welfare recipients [sahoebojangja] and scholarships to students in each school. Our party and the government of the republic implemented the epoch-making policy to increase the income of peasants of cooperative farms by increasing the purchase price of paddy rice, maize, and other agricultural products. Our country, in which the most powerful socialist self-reliant economy has been established as a result of the brilliant embodiment of the great chuche idea, grants the most advanced social, cultural policies and popular policies. Thus, all of our people are firmly guaranteed with a stable life and fully enjoy a self-reliant political life and a happy material and cultural life. These clearly show the superiority of popular-mass centered socialism of our own style, which cannot be compared with others, in which the party and the state not only practically ensure the people's political rights and freedom, but also do everything for the people's welfare and assume total responsibility for their life. Last year, the government of the republic earmarked 12.5 percent of the total state budgetary expenditures for defense spending to thoroughly implement our party's military line of self-defense and to firmly defend the socialist fatherland's security and the gains of the revolution. Today, our military might has been further solidified enough for us to be able to beat the enemy's any provocation and surprise invasion. Our one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary forces are dependably defending the country's defense line with high vigilance. The state budget last year smoothly met with the financial needs for the enormous tasks to accelerate socialist economic construction and cultural construction, to enhance the people's living standard, and to firmly solidify the country's defense capability, thus actively contributing to strengthening the country's might and defending, adhering to, and further adding luster to our style socialism. The proud summation of the execution of the state budget last year clearly demonstrates the justness of our party's financial policy, our state budget's people-oriented nature which embodies the popular masses' independent demands and aspirations and serves the people's welfare thoroughly, and the solidity and superiority of the socialist finance of our country. All the successes we attained last year in socialist construction and in the execution of state budget is a noble fruition of the revolutionary guideline for socialist economic construction and the direction of the socialist finance elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of the struggle of all the people exerting boundless devotion and spirit of sacrifice under the leadership of our party with wholehearted unity around the party. [applause] Comrade deputies: Today we have a rewarding task to attain new greater success in socialist construction by thoroughly implementing the strategic guideline of economic construction which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth in the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central Committee. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In socialist economic construction, we will set aside a period of adjustment for three years from now as decided by the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party Central Committee. During this period, we must thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policies. At the same time, we should give definite priority to coal mining industry, power industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of the people's economy--and continuously develop the metal industry. The revolutionary economic strategy put forth by our party is to thoroughly implement, during the period of adjustment, the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policies and to give priority to the coal mining industry, power industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of the people's economy--and continuously develop metal the industry. The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a revolutionary guideline for economic construction to solidify the country's self-reliant economic base as firm as a rock in conformity with the demand of the new stage of development of our country's socialist construction, to drastically improve the people's living standard, and to firmly solidify the springboard to bring forth a new leap forward in all fronts of socialist construction. The 1994 state budget has been compiled in order to implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policies according to the revolutionary economic strategy put forth by our party, to concentrate the country's financial resources on giving priority to the leading sectors of the people's economy, and to further strengthen the might of our country's socialist self-reliant economy. The total revenue and expenditure of the state budget for 1994 amount to 41.52519 billio won each, up 2.4 percent in revenue and 3.2 percent in expenditure from last year. The state budget for this year will firmly achieve an increase of the budgetary revenue based on the creative zeal of our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of socialism, and the great potential of our country's socialist, self-reliant national economy. It is an invariable policy of our party and the Republic government to make the state budget put great emphasis on expenditure for the national economy in order to enhance the national economic strength and to improve the people's living standard. The government of the republic will increase expenditure for the national economy by 3.2 percent from last year, and a huge state fund will be appropriated for developing agriculture, light industry, and trade with foreign countries. In order to consolidate and develop the achieved result in the course of the struggle to implement the socialist rural theses, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter to the national agricultural meeting, the state will drastically [hoekkijoguro] increase investment in the agricultural sector by 6 percent from last year and will continue to accelerate the socialist rural construction. The government of the republic will consolidate the result that has been achieved basically in the technological revolution in our country's rural areas and let it demonstrate its might. In particular, the government will concentrate its effort to expand and develop the result of mechanization and scientization under the condition that irrigation and electrification has been completed at a high level. Our party has recently sent 500 tractors 250 automobiles, all at the same time, to rural areas in Chongdan, Yanan, and Taechon counties to elevate the level of general mechanization of rural economy and to accelerate the industrialization and modernization of agriculture. According to the party policy, the state will send more tractors, automobiles, and various modern farming machines to rural areas by normalizing the production by farming machinery plants at a high level. The state will also concentrate efforts to increase the fertilizer production by chemical fertilizer plants and will supply well-assorted chemical fertilizer to rural areas more than before. All agricultural working people and supporters will make all valuable results achieved in the course of implementing the technological revolution in rural areas take effect, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter to the national agricultural meeting and upholding the banner of the socialist rural theses. They will also carry out all farming work tenaciously and methodically in a scientific and technological way while thoroughly implementing the chuche farming method. By doing so, they will make another great upsurge in grain production and all other areas of agricultural production. This year, the government of the republic will increase investment in light industry by 5.4 percent from last year and will vigorously accelerate the light industrial revolution. The state will also concentrate its efforts to actively modernize facilities and processing lines of existing central light industrial plants and local industrial plants, to expand and develop branch plants, workshops, and work teams that produce 3 August people's consumer goods, to increase the production by synthetic fiber and synthetic resin chemical plants, and to supply various light industrial materials. With a high sense of loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong], all workers in light industry this year will highly display their positive creativity to operate the light industrial plants at full capability, normalize production on a high level, and greatly increase the production of textile goods of various sorts, daily necessities, and processed foodstuffs and decisively improve their qualities. In this way, we will make decisive turns in the production of people's consumer goods. The state budget for this year foresees massive expenditures for increasing exports to thoroughly implement the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's instruction on developing foreign trade to comply with the changed environment and our party's policy toward that end. The government of the republic will increase the state investments for expanding and strengthening the existing production bases 4.2 percent this year compared to last year, establish more plants, shops, and work teams for producing export goods and further strengthen their technological basis in production, and build more bases for processing trade [kagong muyok kiji]. All sectors of the people's economy and all regions will thoroughly implement our party's trade policy, find more sources for exports, positively advance into foreign markets, thoroughly maintain their credit [sinyongul cholchohui chikigo], and vigorously carry out trade-related activities. In this way, they will make new progress in foreign trade. Giving top priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway transportation, and developing the metallurgical industry is an important task to implement the plan on the agriculture-, light industry-, and foreign trade-first principle and vigorously accelerate the country's overall economic construction. The state budget for this year foresees an increase of 3 percent in investments in the coal industry, the power industry, and railway transportation compared to last year. The government of the republic will accelerate drilling and the construction of pits in all coal mines and exert efforts to build more [word indistinct] and coal pits and modernize coal mining equipment. In the power industry, it will accelerate the construction of large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal power stations and build many small and medium-size power stations everywhere, thus strongly consolidating the country's resource and power bases. Also, in the railway transportation sector, the government of the republic will improve railway systems strong enough for heavy-duty trains [choldo chungnyanghwa] in the Pyongyang-Chongjin railway line and other major railway lines, electrify more and more railway lines, and accelerate the modernization of means of transportation, thus further increasing the railway system's transportation capability. This year, the state will increase its investment in the metallurgical industry 2.6 percent compared to last year, better repair and maintain facilities in metallurgical plants, positively realize the chuche-orientation of the metallurgical industry, and, thus, further strengthen the production basis of steel products. According to our party's [word indistinct] economic strategy, we will score new gains in important fronts of economic construction; have all people in a few years [kakkaun yongange] fulfill our people's earnest desire to eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house in a few years; and further consolidate the self-reliant basis for the economy of popular masses-centered socialism of our own style like a rock. Accelerating the cultural revolution and making socialist culture bloom and develop is an important task to highly display the superiority of socialism of our own style and complete the socialist cause. This year the government of the republic will increase expenditure for practicing its socialist cultural policy by 2.8 percent compared to last year to further develop all areas of our socialist cultural construction. The state will increase expenditure for (?science activities) by 4 percent and education by 2 percent compared to last year so as to arrange better conditions for educational organizations intensifying scientific research and improving the quality of education in conformity with the demand of developing realities. At the same time, the state will also increase expenditure for culture, public health, and sports to advance the socialist national culture and art, to strengthen medical service for the people, and to implement the policy of popularizing sports so that working people's health can improve. The government of the republic will increase expenditure for its people-oriented policy this year so that various state benefits, such as free education, free medical care, the nurturing and indoctrination of children at state expense, socialist insurance, and socialist security, can be well granted to the people. The government of the republic has provided a huge amount of educational aid and stipends every year for the development of democratic, national education for Korean children in Japan. This year, too, the government of the republic will send a huge amount of educational aid and stipends to Korean children in Japan. This great, repeated benevolent care granted by our party and state under the respected and beloved leader's consideration will vigorously encourage the democratic national education of the General Association of Koreans Residents in Japan and will greatly encourage patriotic activities of Korean compatriots in Japan who are devoting their all to achieving the fatherland's independent and peaceful reunification. The government of the republic envisages 11.6 percent of the total state budgetary expenditure as defense appropriations this year to firmly deepen the country's defense capabilities in coping with the enemies' provocation maneuvers. By thoroughly implementing the party's self-defensive military line, we will iron-tightly harden the military strength of the People's Army and the all-state- and all-people-oriented party system. Also, by advancing the beautiful virtue of unity between the Army and the people, we will firmly make every preparation to cope with any unexpected situation on our own initiative [chudongjoguro]. This year's state budget submitted to the Supreme People's Assembly for deliberation is a chuche-based solid budget that guarantees financial support for the huge tasks of economic construction presented by the party, with our own financial resources on the firm foundation of the self-reliant socialist economy. It also a people-oriented, revolutionary budget that will improve the people's material and cultural living conditions, strengthen the country's might, and enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style. [applause] Comrade deputies: Successfully executing this year's state budget is an honorable task to add luster to the popular masses-oriented socialism of our country by making a new change and a greater victory in socialist construction. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Upholding the party's militant slogans, all functionaries, party members, and working people should continue to innovate and advance in the spirit of Chollima plus the nineties' speed, so that they can make the new year 1994 a historic changeover in the revolution and construction in our country. In order to successfully execute this year's state budget while implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategies, all domains and units of the national economy should vigorously carry out the struggle for increased production and economization as a mass movement. To vigorously carry out the struggle for the maximum increased production and economy is an important principle to be firmly adhered to in the whole course of socialist economic construction. To do so is also an important task to demonstrate the substantial superiority of our country's socialism and is a sublime duty of all the working people who are masters of the country and the society. Intensifying the produce-more and save-more campaign is a basic way to vigorously push ahead with economic construction under the present situation. It is a decisive guarantee for increasing the revenue sources in conformity with the socialist state budget's people-oriented nature and for successfully executing this year's budget. The functionaries and working people of all the sectors and units of the people's economy should place themselves into general mobilization, according to our party's call, with high revolutionary self-awareness and with an attitude befitting masters, and wage an all-people struggle to produce and save to the maximum degree. The functionaries and all the working people at plants and enterprises of all sectors of the people's economy should exert high creative wisdom and positive attitude, find all sorts of production reserve and potential, operate all the facilities at full capacity, and wage a vigorous struggle to increase production to the maximum degree. All sectors and units should wage an active struggle to save as much as possible fuel, energy, and various kinds of raw materials and facilities and to mobilize all sorts of reserves. At the same time, they should highly exert such an attitude befitting masters as producing more with available materials and facilities and managing the state's economic life assiduously and methodically. The best wisdom in producing more and saving more at the present time lies in vigorously conducting the technological innovation campaign. All sectors of the people's economy should have the scientists, technicians, and producing masses give full play to their talents and creativity and wage a vigorous campaign of mass technological innovation, thus developing new technology and apply advanced technology actively to the production. To successfully execute this year's state budget, we should properly implement the independent economic accounting system [tongnip chaesanje] in conformity with the demand of the great Taean work system, intensify the local budgetary system [chibang yesanje], and further improve and intensify the financial management work. To properly implement the independent economic accounting system in conformity with the Taean work system is our party's consistent policy. It is also an important requisite to improving and intensifying managerial activities and financial management. The independent economic accounting system is a planned and rational managerial and operational method of the socialist state-run enterprises in which the plants and enterprises make both ends meet and give benefit to the state while engaging in managerial activities with relative managerial independence under the state's central guidance. All the plants and enterprises should work more scrupulously to properly implement the independent economic accounting system in conformity with the demand of the Taean work system in order to have the working people give full play to their political self-awareness, revolutionary enthusiasm, and collectivism. In so doing, they should rationalize their production and managerial activities, making both ends meet and increasing profit, so that they can give greater profit to the state. The local budgetary system which the great leader founded is a new-type budgetary system of our-style socialism which makes it possible to manage the overall economic life of both local area and the state well by enhancing the local area's responsibility and creativity while firmly ensuring the state's central guidance. The local budgetary system has displayed great vitality in the management of the state's economic life over the last 20 years. Giving full play to the superiority of the local budgetary system, all the local areas today are increasing the local budget revenue every year and turning over much funds to the state after smoothly appropriating the funds necessary for the development of the local area's economy and culture and for the local area's economic life. The basic unit of the local budgetary system is county. In order to develop the local budgetary system, we should thoroughly implement our party's consistent policy to enhance the function and role of the county--the base of the local area's economic and cultural development. All counties should make exceptional efforts to develop agriculture and local industry in conformity with the party's policy and the county's own special characteristic. At the same time, they should carry out good work of earning foreign currency and actively conduct service activities in order to earn more money, so that they can keep their local area in better shape and further enhance the people's standard of living. Intensifying the system of daily summing up production and finance put forth by our party is an urgent demand to improve and reinforce financial management, as well as production management, by having the producing masses give full play to their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity. Plants and enterprises of all sectors of the people's economy should more properly organize production and finance management by further strengthening the summing system of production and finance and by organizing and proceeding the system in a normal and orderly manner. In order to improve finance management and correctly execute the national budget, the role of finance management organizations should be enhanced. The finance management organizations should thoroughly establish the principle of the unitary management of the nation's finance and the principle of planned agreement, utilize funds in a well-planned manner in accordance with the national financial plan, strictly follow the financial regulation, and strengthen financial control to make sure no national funds are wasted. Organizing economic organizational work and production command and making a new turn in the business ethos of functionaries are fundamental methods for thoroughly implementing our party's economic strategy and executing our national budget in a phased manner. Functionaries should conduct economic operations for implementing the economic strategies and policy presented by the party and properly carry out planning work and material supply work in conformity with the demands of new economic strategies, and establish strongly disciplined regulations of economic works. With a high spirit of revolution, all economic guidance functionaries should work in a militant and revolutionary manner filled with confidence and optimism, and volunteer to open a breakthrough in difficult and tough works. All functionaries should ceaselessly make themselves revolutionary upholding the great leader's philosophy of taking the people as heaven and our party's slogan of serving the people, and should become true people's servants who always involve themselves with the masses, share joy and sorrow with them, and dedicate their all for the people. To achieve brilliant victory in the combat of this year's economic construction, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude should be highly displayed. Self-reliance is the traditional revolutionary spirit of our party which has always won in the long and arduous revolutionary struggles, the party's revolutionary slogan which should be upheld more than ever in today's situation, and a victorious banner which firmly guarantees the result of this year's combat. All functionaries and working people should vigorously advance with the same struggle spirit, which effected the Chollima upsurge amid postwar dust and dirts with the strong spirit of self-reliance that filled the Paektu secret camp, so that another revolutionary great upsurge may be effected in all fores of this year's socialist construction. Strengthening our revolutionary rank's single-minded unity upholding our party's leadership is a decisive guarantee for the victory of this year's advancement. Our party is the heart of our single-heartedly united society, the party's leadership is the lifeline of the socialist cause. It is our people's unequaled desire and honor to carry out the sacred revolutionary cause while following the great leadership of the party. All functionaries and working people should uphold our party's leadership, be endlessly faithful to the party's cause, and thoroughly implement our party's line and policy in all domains and sectors. We should defend the single-hearted unity of the party and our revolutionary ranks as if we were the rulers, safeguard our party with our lives, and achieve a new brilliant victory in this year combat with the might of single-hearted unity. Our people, who are following the leadership of the great leader and the great party and vigorously fighting on with revolutionary optimism and confidence, are ever-victorious and indomitable. [applause] Let us all firmly unite around the party central committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song and vigorously fight on for the victory of chuche revolutionary cause and socialist cause. [applause]
