The President and First Lady were met by John Major and his wife Norma after landing at RAF [Royal Air Force base] Mildenhall, Suffolk. Mr Clinton will attend a remembrance service at the American Military Cemetery in Madingley, near Cambridge, later today. During his stay in Britain -- his first since he became President -- Mr Clinton will have talks with the Prime Minister at Chequers and also meet acting Labour leader Margaret Beckett at Hartwell House, near Aylesbury, Bucks. Tonight Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary will attend a State dinner in Portsmouth as guests of the Queen. Tomorrow they will meet U.S. D-Day veterans and then watch an international flotilla before going to Normandy. Mr Clinton, the first post-war U.S. commander-in-chief without military experience, returns from France on Wednesday [8 June] for a nostalgic visit to Oxford University where he will receive an honorary doctorate. He spent a year at University College as a Rhodes scholar in the late 1960's.
