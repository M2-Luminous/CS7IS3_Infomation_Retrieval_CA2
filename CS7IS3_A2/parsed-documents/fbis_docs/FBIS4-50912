The China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (first called the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission, later called the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, now called the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission; hereafter referred to as the Arbitration Commission, for short) independently and impartially solves, through arbitration, the disputes arising from international or foreign-related contractual or non-contractual economic matters and trade, including those between foreign legal entities and/or natural persons, on the one hand, and Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons on the other; between foreign legal entities and/or natural persons; and between Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons; so as to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of those involved and to promote the development of domestic and foreign economic activities and trade. Article 3. The Arbitration Commission handles cases in accordance with either the arbitration agreement reached by the parties involved -- before or after the dispute occurs -- that their disputes are to be submitted to the Arbitration Commission for arbitration, or with a written application presented by one of the parties involved. The arbitration agreement refers to the arbitration clauses specified in the contract made by the parties involved, or to the written agreement reached in a certain way that any disputes are to be presented to the Arbitration Commission for arbitration. Article 4. The Arbitration Commission is entitled to make decisions about the existence and validity of arbitration agreements and the authority [guan xia quan 4619 6561 2938] of arbitration cases.

The arbitration clauses in a contract should be regarded as independent of other clauses in the contract, and the arbitration agreement attached to the contract also should be taken as a part that is independent of other clauses in the contract. When the contract is changed, dissolved, annulled, or ceases to be effective or becomes invalid, the effectiveness of the arbitration clauses or arbitration agreements will not be affected. Article 6. The authority over the arbitration agreement and/or the arbitration cases is not to be challenged after the accused gives the first substantial reply. The argument against the authority over the countercharge is not to be advanced after the party to whom the countercharge is addressed gives the first substantial reply to the countercharge.

Section Two: Organization Article 8. The Arbitration Commission is to appoint an honorary chairman and several advisers. Article 9.

In settling disputes by arbitration, the chairman and secretariat of the branch perform the duties of the chairman and the secretarial bureau of the Arbitration Commission, as stipulated in the rules. Article 12. The two parties involved, by agreement, may submit their disputes for arbitration in Beijing, Shenzhen, or Shanghai. If they do not make an agreement about this, it is up to the declarant to make a choice, and the first choice prevails if there is more than one. The Arbitration Commission is to make a decision about the dispute, if any, arising therefrom. Chapter Two -- Arbitration Procedure Section One: Application for Arbitration, Reply, and Countercharge Article 13. The arbitration procedure begins the day the accused receives an arbitration notice from the Arbitration Commission; if the accused party is composed of more than one person, the procedure begins the day the last person accused receives his notice.

Article 18. The accused must submit his written countercharge, if any, to the Arbitration Commission's secretarial bureau within 60 days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice. Article 19. The declarant may amend his request for making complaints and the accused may amend his request for making countercomplaints, but the arbitration tribunal is to reject the amendment if it considers the amendment came too late and thus would affect the arbitration procedure. Article 20.

Section Two: Composition of the Arbitration Tribunal Article 24. When either party involved has chosen -- or has asked the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators, the Arbitration Commission must immediately choose a third arbitrator as the chief arbitrator so that the three will form an arbitration tribunal to hear the case. Article 25. The two parties involved may jointly choose -- or jointly ask the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators as a single arbitrator, who is to set up an arbitration tribunal to hear the case on his own. If the two parties involved have intended that their case be heard by a single arbitrator, but fail to reach agreement on the choice of the arbitrator within 20 days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice by the accused, the Arbitration Commission is to appoint one. Article 26. If the accused fails to appoint -- or fails to ask the chairman of the Arbitration Committee to appoint -- an arbitrator, as required by Article 16 of these arbitration rules, the chairman of the Arbitration Commission is to appoint one for him. Article 27. If there are two or more declarants and/or two or more defendants, the two parties must, after consultation, separately choose an arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators. If the declarants fail to jointly appoint an arbitrator when they submit the arbitration application and/or the defendants fail to jointly appoint an arbitrator within 20 days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice by the last defendant, the Arbitration Committee is to appoint one arbitrator for either of them. Article 28. If the appointed arbitrator has been involved in the case, he must inform the Arbitration Commission of that and ask for permission to stand clear of the case. Article 29. If the party involved has any reasonable doubt concerning the fairness and independence of the appointed arbitrator, he is to give the Arbitration Committee a written request for the arbitrator to stand clear of the case, stating the specific facts and reasons supporting the request. The written request is to be advanced 15 days before the first hearing of the case; if the reason for the arbitrator to stand clear of the case is available only after the first hearing is held, the request is to be advanced before the last session of the first hearing closes. Article 30. Whether the arbitrator should stand clear of the case is decided by the Arbitration Commission. Article 31. If an appointed arbitrator stands clear of the case or fails to discharge his duties for other reasons, a new arbitrator must be appointed according to the procedures by which the defunct arbitrator is appointed. When a new arbitrator is appointed, the arbitration tribunal must decide whether the previously held hearing must be repeated in part or in full. Section Three: Hearing Article 32. The arbitration tribunal should try cases in court, but on the application of the two parties involved -- or their agreement -- and on condition that the arbitration tribunal also considers it unnecessary to try the case in court, the arbitration tribunal is to try the case and give a verdict on the basis of written documents. Article 33. When the arbitration tribunal has assigned the date for the first hearing, after having consulted with the Arbitration Commission secretarial bureau, the secretarial bureau must give notice to the two parties involved 30 days before the hearing is held. The parties involved may seek a postponement of the hearing, but must submit a written request to the secretarial bureau 30 days before the hearing, stating the reason. Whether the hearing will be put off is decided by the arbitration tribunal. Article 34. The notices of the dates for subsequent court sessions following the first hearing are not subject to 30-day time limit. Article 35. The cases accepted by the Arbitration Commission are to be heard in Beijing; they may be heard in other localities with approval of the chairman of the Arbitration Commission. The cases accepted by the branches of the Arbitration Commission are to be heard locally; they may be heard in other localities with approval of branch chairmen. Article 36. The arbitration tribunal is not to hold an open hearing of cases; if the two parties involved ask for a public hearing, the arbitration tribunal is to make a decision concerning the request. Article 37. If a case is not heard openly, the two parties involved and their agents -- as well as the witnesses, arbitrators, experts whose expertise is called upon by the arbitration tribunal, appointed appraisers, and members of the Arbitration Commission and its secretarial bureau -- are not allowed to divulge the actual situation and relevant procedures. Article 38. The parties involved are to provide evidence supporting their complaints, replies, and countercharges. The arbitration tribunal is to conduct investigations to collect evidence on its own, as necessary. When conducting investigations to collect evidence on its own, the arbitration tribunal is to ask the two parties involved to turn up in time if it considers their presence necessary. The investigations are not affected by the absence of either or both of the parties involved. Article 39. The arbitration tribunal is to call on the expertise of experts on special issues in the case or to assign a appraiser to give an appraisal. Either Chinese or foreign organizations or citizens may act as experts or appraisers. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to ask the parties involved to provide relevant materials, documents, assets, or goods to experts/appraisers for inspection and/or assessment, and the parties involved are duty-bound to act as requested. Article 40. Copies of reports by experts and/or appraisers must be sent to the two parties involved, and the two parties involved must be given opportunities to express their opinions on the reports. If any party involved asks the expert/appraiser to attend the court session, the latter may do so with approval of the arbitration tribunal and give a explanation on the report if the arbitration tribunal considers it necessary and appropriate. Article 41. The evidence provided by the parties involved is examined and approved by the arbitration tribunal; whether the reports made by experts and/or appraisers is acceptable will be decided by the arbitration tribunal. Article 42. When either party involved fails to attend the court session, the arbitration tribunal is to conduct the trial and give judgment by default. Article 43. The secretarial bureau is allowed to take notes on and/or record the court session. The arbitration tribunal is to make a statement of the key points of the court session, and ask the parties involved and/or their agents, witnesses, and/or other relevant personnel to sign the statement, when necessary. The notes and/or recording made by the secretarial bureau are for the arbitration tribunal's reference only. Article 44. If the two parties involved effect a reconciliation out of court, they are to ask the arbitration tribunal to give a verdict on the basis of the contents of the reconciliation agreement and then close the case; they also are to apply to withdraw the case. The chairman of the Arbitration Committee is to make a decision on the case if the two parties involved apply to withdraw the case before the arbitration tribunal is set up; the arbitration tribunal makes a decision on the case if the two parties involved apply to withdraw the case after the arbitration tribunal is set up. If a party involved applies for arbitration after the case has been withdrawn, it is up to the chairman of the Arbitration Committee to make a decision whether or not the case will be heard. Article 45. If a party involved knows -- or is supposed to know -- that any articles laid down in these arbitration rules or in the arbitration agreement are not being observed, but still participates in the arbitration or continues with the arbitration rather than raising a timely and clear objection, he is regarded as waiving his right to raise an objection. Article 46. If both parties involved desire to make peace, or only one party desires to do so and succeeds in securing an agreement with the other party through the arbitration tribunal, the arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the dispute on trial when the arbitration procedure is in progress. Article 47. The arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the way it considers appropriate. Article 48. If one party involved proposes to suspend mediation, or if the arbitration tribunal considers that its mediation will not go anywhere, the arbitration tribunal is to suspend the mediation and continue to settle the dispute by arbitration. Article 49. If the two parties involved reach a compromise out of the arbitration court while the court is mediating in the dispute, the compromise should be regarded as having been reached through the mediation by the arbitration tribunal. Article 50. If the two parties reach a compromise through the mediation of the arbitration tribunal, the two parties must sign a written compromise agreement; unless the two parties make a separate agreement, the arbitration tribunal is to close the case by giving a verdict in light of the compromise agreement. Article 51. If the mediation proves unsuccessful, then in support of his complaint, reply, and/or countercharge neither party involved is -- in the arbitration procedure, or the judicial or any other procedures thereafter -- to quote any opinion, viewpoint, suggestion, or fact the other party or the arbitration tribunal has expressed, advanced, proposed, admitted, shown willingness to accept, or rejected in the course of the mediation process. Section Four: Handing Down a Ruling Article 52. The arbitration tribunal must give a written ruling within nine months of the date of its formation. On the demand of the arbitration tribunal, the Arbitration Committee is to extend the time limit if it considers this necessary and reasonable. Article 53. The arbitration tribunal must give an impartial verdict on its own, according to the facts, the law, the contract, and international practice, and in line with fair and reasonable principles. Article 54. The arbitration tribunal must give the reasons for its verdict, except for a verdict given according to the content of the compromise agreement reached by the two parties involved. All or most members of the arbitration tribunal must sign the written verdict and the Arbitration Committee must affix its seal to it. The date and place of the verdict's delivery must be given. The date when the verdict is given is the date when the verdict comes into effect. Article 55. The majority of the three-member arbitration tribunal is to decide on the verdict, but the minority opinion may be noted down and attached to the verdict. The arbitrator who holds a dissenting opinion may or may not sign the verdict. Article 56. If the arbitration tribunal fails to reach a majority decision, the verdict is to be based on the chief arbitrator's opinion. Article 57. The arbitration tribunal is to give an intermediate or partial ruling on any issue in the case if it considers this necessary or if the parties involved -- with approval of the arbitration tribunal -- propose to do so. Any relevant party's failure to accept the ruling is not to affect the arbitration procedure or the final verdict given by the arbitration tribunal. Article 58. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide on arbitration charges and other expenses the two parties involved must pay to the Arbitration Committee. Article 59. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide on the amount the losing party should pay to the prevailing party to cover a part of reasonable expenses the prevailing party incurs in filing the case, but the damages must not be more than 10 percent of the amount recovered by the prevailing party.

Article 61. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written verdict, any of the parties involved may send a written application to the arbitration tribunal asking it to correct errors in writing, printing, calculation, and other errors of similar nature in the written verdict. If there really are any errors, the arbitration tribunal must make written corrections within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written application. The arbitration tribunal also is allowed to make written corrections itself within 30 days of the date of issue of the written verdict. The correction in writing is an inseparable part of the verdict. Article 62. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written judgment, if the arbitration tribunal is found to have left some issues unjudged in its written judgment, any of the parties involved is entitled to send a written application to the arbitration tribunal asking it to give rulings on such unjudged issues. If certain issues really are left unjudged, the arbitration tribunal must deliver rulings on the unjudged issues within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written application. The arbitration tribunal is also allowed to give rulings on such unjudged issues of its own accord within 30 days of the date of issue of the written judgment. The additional judgment is an inseparable part of the original judgment. Article 63. The party involved must fulfill the verdict of his own accord within the time limit set by the written judgment; if a time limit is not set in the written judgment, the verdict must be fulfilled immediately. If a party refuses to fulfill the verdict, the other party is allowed to apply to the Chinese court for fulfillment of the verdict in accordance with Chinese law, or he may apply to a relevant foreign court, which carries authority, for fulfillment of the verdict in accordance with the 1958 "Convention on Acknowledging and Implementing Arbitration Verdicts Given by Foreign Countries" or with other international conventions to which China is a signatory state or to which China has acceded. Chapter Three -- Simple Procedures Article 64. Unless the two parties involved have a separate agreement, the simple procedures apply to a case involving a sum less than 500,000 yuan, or a case involving a sum over 500,000 yuan on condition that a party has sent in a written application for arbitration and has secured the another party's written approval for the application. Article 65. If a party involved has applied to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration and the Arbitration Committee -- after examination -- has agreed to handle the case, the chairman of the Arbitration Committee must immediately choose a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of the Arbitration Committee to set up an arbitration tribunal to hear the case, unless the two parties involved have jointly chosen a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of the Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau must immediately serve an arbitration notice to the other party. Article 66. A party involved must supply the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau with his reply and relevant certificates within 30 days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice; if he has any countercharge, he must supply the written countercharge and relevant certificates within the same time period. Article 67. The arbitration tribunal is to hear the case in a way it considers appropriate.

Article 72. The procedure will not be affected by a change in the application for arbitration or by the presentation of a countercharge, unless this contradicts Article 64. Article 73. The arbitration tribunal must pass a written judgment within 30 days of the date it begins hearing a case; if the case is heard in a written form, the arbitration tribunal must give a written verdict within 90 days of the date it is set up. If necessary, the Arbitration Committee is to extend these time limits. Article 74. Relevant provisions in other chapters of these rules apply to matters not covered in this chapter. Chapter Four -- Supplementary Articles Article 75. The Arbitration Committee uses Chinese as its formal language. If the parties involved have a separate agreement on the language to be used, the agreement will prevail. If any party involved -- or his agent or witness -- needs an interpreter when the arbitration tribunal is hearing a case in court, the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau will provide one; the party involved also is to provide an interpreter himself. The Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau is to ask the parties involved to supply Chinese versions or versions in other languages of various written materials or documentary evidence submitted, if it considers this necessary. Article 76. Unless the parties involved have a separate agreement or the arbitration tribunal has made a separate decision, all documents, notices, and other materials are to be sent to the parties involved and/or their agents by hand, registered mail, express delivery, fax, telex, telegraph, or in other means the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau considers appropriate. Article 77. If any written correspondence has been delivered to the recipient in person; or has been sent to the recipient's business address, regular dwelling place, or communication address; or has been sent -- when any of the above three addresses is unavailable, despite reasonable inquiry -- to the recipient's latest known business address, regular dwelling place, or communication address by registered mail or other means by which it can be proved that the written correspondence was sent, the written correspondence is regarded as having been sent. Article 78. Apart from collecting arbitration charges from the parties involved according to the tariff set by the Arbitration Committee, the Arbitration Committee is to collect from them any additional and reasonable charges, including the special rewards and travel and boarding expenses for the arbitrators, as well as expenses for engaging experts, appraisers, and interpreters by the arbitration tribunal. The Arbitration Committee is to charge the two parties involved a fee if they apply to withdraw the case after reaching a compromise on their own; the amount of the fee will be determined by the workload involved and the money actually spent. Article 79. If the arbitration provisions in the arbitration agreement or in the contract make it clear that any disputes are to be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee or its branches or its predecessors -- the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission or the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission -- the two parties involved are regarded as having unanimously agreed that their disputes be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee and its branches. Article 80. These rules come into effect 1 June 1994. The arbitration rules which came into force 1 January 1989 apply to cases handled by the Arbitration Committee and its branches before 1 June 1994. These rules will apply to the above cases, subject to approval of the two parties involved. Article 81. The power of interpretation of these rules is vested in the Arbitration Committee.
