The Serbian and Croatian bombings are considered to be a "sort of challenge" to the United Nations, which has declared the skies over Bosnia a no-fly zone. The bombings may result in the international community's intervention and the escalation of the civil war. Everything depends on how NATO and the United Nations, which have recently warned that they would bomb Serbian areas, will respond to the bombings. The skies over Bosnia has been declared a no-fly zone since last April: On 31 March, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution No. 816 declaring that no aircraft of the Serbian, Croatian, and Muslim groups, except for approved aircraft, can fly into the Bosnian airspace in an effort to prevent the civil war from spreading. According to this resolution, NATO daily conducted reconnaissance in the no-fly zone. There have been approximately 7,000 flights so far, approximately 20 flights a day. UN Security Council Resolution No. 816 says: "All Necessary measures can be taken against any aircraft illegally flying in the no-fly zone." This virtually means it is possible to shoot down such aircraft. The center of this reconnaissance mission code-named "Deny Flight" is the Vicenza U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy. Ten NATO member countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, have participated in the reconnaissance mission. Fighters and reconnaissance planes based in the Vicenza base and other U.S. military bases and aircraft carriers have reportedly been flown for this mission, and a total of 4,000 personnel, including pilots and technicians, are participating in this mission. There have been approximately 250 violations of the no-fly zone. Serbs violated the zone most of the time, and this was the first time fighters violated the zone. The downing of the Serbian fighters developed into a fierce exchange of fire between the Serbian army and the Muslim army of Bosnia, which took place a few hours later. This diminishes the prospects of a peaceful resolution of the Bosnian situation.
