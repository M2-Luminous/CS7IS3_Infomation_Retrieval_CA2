Robaina is seeking support for the Cuban regime. Uruguay's President Luis Alberto Lacalle received Robaina for half an hour on 4 April, but made no comments on the meeting. Sources close to the president confirmed to EFE that one of the things the two officials discussed was the democratization of the Cuban regime. Deputies from various parties also made comments in that regard. The Congressional International Affairs Committee held a one-hour meeting with the Cuban foreign minister behind closed doors. Deputies who attended the meeting, as well as members who did not, commented on the matter. Out of a total of 12 committee members, three did not attend. The three said "they did not want to meet with the representative of a dictatorial regime." The three legislators absent were Broad Front (leftist coalition) Deputy Francisco Rodriguez Camusso; committee chairman Oscar Magurno of the Colorado Party of former president and new presidential candidate Julio Maria Sanguinetti; and Colorado Party Deputy Daniel Garcia Pintos. Among the deputies who attended the meeting, Hector Lezcano, of the Christian Democratic Party, said he told Robaina that the Cuban Government should "embark on a democratic opening program leading, in the near future, to the establishment of a multiparty system in the country." Committee member and Colorado Party Deputy Guillermo Stirling said he attended the meeting because "talking is the best way to show leftist and right-wing radicals which is the best path." Robaina answered that Cuba respects human rights, does not have political prisoners, and the government is willing to preserve the essential characteristics of what was achieved during the 34-year period that started on the date of the revolution. Robaina admitted that the economic inefficiencies of the Cuban system have forced them to open their market to foreign investments, adding that economic changes on the island "continue day by day," and that today 100 companies already have investments in Cuba. It was known that President Lacalle asked Robaina today about the debt of $33 million the Cuban Government has owed to Uruguayan entrepreneurs since 1986. The Cuban foreign minister said that his country does not have the cash to pay back that debt, adding that Cuba could cancel the debt with pharmaceutical and sanitary products. Robaina will be received today by his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu. The Uruguayan foreign minister has also publicly mentioned that he intends to remind Robaina about the need to repay the debt. Robaina will stay in Montevideo until tomorrow, and will then visit Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Argentina within the framework of his government's "Latin American offensive." This initiative seeks to obtain regional countries' support against the U.S. "blockade" and private investments in the island. The Cuban foreign minister's youth and dynamism has prompted various communication centers to consider him as "President Fidel Castro's probable successor."
