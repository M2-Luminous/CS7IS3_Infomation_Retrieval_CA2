This shows the Chinese side's sincerity. The Chinese side has been in favor of building a new airport in Hong Kong on the condition that the relevant financial package complies with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The meeting will help the two sides exchange information, study the feasibility of the newly proposed financial package, and ensure that the financial package agrees with the airport MOU. The Chinese side has not been given all the materials on the project or detailed data on the financial package and cannot afford to hire experts to carry out studies like the Hong Kong Government, which has great financial strength due to its enormous revenue. Given this situation, an airport panel meeting, at which the Chinese side can directly put questions to the British side and the latter can summit documents and materials on the feasibility studies, will certainly help judge whether the fourth financial package follows the principle of cost efficiency and whether it will leave a heavy financial burden to Hong Kong people. Nevertheless, there are still quite a few unclear areas in the fourth financial package tabled by the Hong Kong Government, which places obstacles before the meeting. After announcing that it had formulated the fourth airport financial package before the Spring Festival, the British side has launched a propaganda offensive over the last few days, repeatedly insisting that the debts of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation are not government debts and that, as the British Hong Kong authorities had met the demands of the MOU by increasing investment, the Chinese side should reach an agreement with the British side on the "new financial package." According to press reports, under the new financial package, the British will increase investment by HK$15 billion [Hong Kong dollars], but the PAA and the MTR Corporation will still run up debts as high as HK$28 billion, approximately six times the HK$5 billion stipulated in the MOU. With such a large debt, how can the new financial package be said to have "complied with MOU requirements"? The British side continued to falsely allege that the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation are not part of the government debt, but such an argument is untenable. Since the MOU has stipulated that the British Hong Kong Government is responsible for the airport's core projects, how can the British side defect responsibility onto the two institutions? Again, the two institutions are wholly owned by the government, so their debts must be undertaken and paid by the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government after 1997. Just as a senior Hong Kong Bank economic researcher pointed out: For the two institutions to take on loans is a matter concerning the Sino-British agreement. Without sufficient guarantee, the two institutions are unlikely to get the money they need. Even if banks agree to extend the loans, they would increase the annual interest rate to over 10 percent, because the two institutions would not be able to give security for their debts. Such a high interest rate would make it impossible for the borrowers to pay off their debts--though they might be willing to pay the high interest due to the lack of a sufficient guarantee--and accordingly would increase the banks' risk. The result would be that no banks would lend money to the two institutions. This analysis also reveals that borrowing money in the name of the MTR Corporation and the new Airport Corporation instead of the Hong Kong Government contravenes the principle of commercial operation and also deviates from the principle laid down in the MOU. If the two sides fail to reach agreement on the financial arrangements for the new airport, will the PAA and the MTR Corporation be able to get the money they need? The British side described the fourth financial package as the best choice because of the increase in investment, termed it a generous gift for the Chinese side, and urged the Chinese side to rapidly accept the offer. This argument is not supported by facts. As long as one compares the sharp increase in the construction costs with the small and slow increase in the British Hong Kong Government's investment, one will realize that the most important concern is for the airport financial package to follow the principle of cost effectiveness. If construction costs are not capped and get out of control, the debt will continue to grow much faster than investment. In 1991, the construction costs of the new airport were HK$98 billion. In March 1992, they increased to 120 billion, and today have reached 175 billion -- and still no cap has been set on them. In the first airport financial package, there was an unexpected "callable equity [huo you fu zhai 2057 2589 6298 0280]" of HK$21 billion and the combined debt of $73 billion to be owed by the PAA and the MTR Corporation, totaling HK$94 billion. A financial package with such huge debt was naturally opposed by the large numbers of Hong Kong people and the Chinese side. Then the British side, forced to change its tactics, put forward the second financial package in September 1992. In this package, the British side demanded that 50 percent of the proceeds from selling the 62 hectares of land above the airport railway due the SAR government be injected into the rail plan in an attempt to use the SAR government's money to help pay the debt. Even so, the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation were still as staggering as HK$22.9 billion. As the British side's attempt to appropriate the land premium due the SAR government was strongly criticized, the British side tabled the third airport financial package in June 1993. In this financial package, the British side agreed to plow into the railway plan its 50 percent share of the land premium from the sale of the 62 hectares and to allocate HK$5 billion from the Hong Kong government's financial surplus to symbolically increase the investment, but the debts of the PAA and the MTR Corporation soared to HK$45 billion, nine times the figure set in the MOU. In the meantime, the British side was busy providing appropriations and parceling away the airport project in an attempt to create a situation of high cost and low returns, and a huge debt in the future which China would be forced to take over. In view of this attempt, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office made a firm four-point statement. Sensing that its coy plan was not going to work, Britain pulled another trick -- the fourth package. From the zany growth of the airport's construction costs and the Hong Kong government's symbolic increase in funding, we can see that the most crucial point in the airport package is the principle of cost efficiency. If prices keep rising with no end in sight, the only thing that will happen is that actual debt will rise alongside the cost. This will happen despite any agreement between China and Britain on the financial arrangements. There is no guarantee that the debt will not keep increasing. China has always supported the construction of a new airport to ensure and develop Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and has consistently insisted that the airport project observe the principles of cost efficiency and not saddling the future SAR government with a financial burden. If Britain had followed the provisions of the MOU, there would have been a financial arrangement agreement. Britain should have the sincerity to act in accordance with the MOU and stop its stalling tactics, for that is the only correct way to solve the airport problem.
