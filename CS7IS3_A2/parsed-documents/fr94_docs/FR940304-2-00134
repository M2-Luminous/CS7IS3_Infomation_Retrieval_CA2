FR940304-2-00134 FR940304-2-00064 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION [Notice 94&hyph;015] National Environmental Policy Act; Lidar In-space Technology Experiment AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq,), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR part 1216 Subpart 1216.3), NASA has made a Funding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the proposed Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) be managed by the NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. LITE involves testing the capabilities of a lidar (LIght Detection And Ranging) system to monitor atmospheric conditions from space. LITE hardware would be carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. DATES: Comments on the FONSI must be provided in writing to NASA on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to Tricia Romanowski, Environmental Engineer, Environmental Engineering Branch, SSQRD, M/S 429, 5 Hunsaker Loop, NASA/Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681. The Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared for the proposed LITE which supports this FONSI may be examined by contacting the Freedom of Information Act Office at any of the following locations: (a) NASA, Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546 (202&hyph;358&hyph;1764).
