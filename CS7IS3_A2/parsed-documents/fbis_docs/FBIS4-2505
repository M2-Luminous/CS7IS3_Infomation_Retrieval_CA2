This verdict was given in the final ruling by the Beijing Higher People's Court. Li, 53, successively held posts of division chief, bureau director, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Commission of Science and Technology, president and editor-in-chief of THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY and vice-minister. When the Beijing-based Changcheng (Great Wall) Machinery and Electronics Scientific and Technological Industry Company began its illegal fund raising activities last year, Li made an immediate positive written comment and instructed his staffers to support the activities. Li immediately went to the Changcheng Company himself, and left with a note of encouragement. Li's words were later made use of by Shen Taifu, then president of the Changcheng Company, for his illegal fund raising. Li kept advertising for Shen Taifu in similar ways on many public occasions. Shen was also eager to reward him for his "service." On March 4, 1993, a SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY reporter signed a 40,000 yuan contract on technology development with the Changcheng Company in the name of Li Xiaoshi's son and gave the money to Li Xiaoshi. Li kept the money and took the contract to his office, locking it in an iron safe. After Shen Taifu was arrested, Li realized the predicament he was in and asked the reporter to take away the contract. When he was inquired about this matter by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission of the Communist Party, Li denied involvement. Li reached an agreement with his wife that she shoulder all the responsibilities in further inquiries. More clues implicating Li in other criminal practices were also discovered during the investigation. Li became acquainted with a Hong Kong couple in Guangdong three years ago and offered business opportunities to them. Li received 5,000 Hong Kong dollars and 1,000 U.S. dollars in bribes for his offer. In 1991, Li used his position to help a Beijing Refrigeration Equipment Company. The next year, Li asked the company to install an air conditioner worth 3,500 yuan for him without paying a cent. In 1990, a unit published a full page advertisement in the newspaper at 20,000 yuan when Li was its president and editor-in-chief. The money was pocketed by Li. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court issued its first ruling on March 4 this year after a long and careful trial. The court ruled that Li was found guilty and should be sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment with his political rights deprived for three years and part of his personal property confiscated for taking bribes; and seven years in prison with his political rights deprived for one year for embezzlement. Li lodged an appeal afterwards to the Beijing Higher People's Court, which rejected his appeal and upheld the original sentence.
