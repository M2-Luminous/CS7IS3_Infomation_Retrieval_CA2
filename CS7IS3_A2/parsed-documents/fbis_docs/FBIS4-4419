With regard to the United States, the draft report criticizes its trade policy of setting numerical targets and expresses serious concern about the unilateral measures it takes, such as those based on the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices). It suggests that Japan should make full use of GATT conflict settlement procedures to resist such U.S. actions. It also points out that to dissuade the United States from adopting such policies, Japan needs to promote the introduction of more transparency into government procurement procedures, the abolition of nontariff barriers, and the easing of regulations. This report, which will be issued in May, is the Japanese version of the "Global Trade Barriers" report issued by the U.S. trade representative on 31 March. Since Japan-U.S. economic frictions have been intensifying recently, the United States is expected to react strongly to the Japanese report. The report is divided into two sections, the first part is an overview and the second part goes into specific issues. The overview discusses: 1) what constitutes unfair trade policy; 2) major trade partners; 3) a general discussion of each trade partner; and 4) responses to unfair trade policies. The report determines unfairness based on the Uruguay Round general agreement to be signed by participating nations in Marakkech, Morocco, in mid-April and the basic principles of international law. The section on major trade partners includes the United States, the European Union (EU), ROK, Hong Kong, Australia, and five other countries and areas with which Japan conducts most of its trading activities. The second section deals with 13 unfair policies and measures--such as quotas, antidumping measures, and subsidies, respectively--pointing out the problems and the countries adopting those policies. According to the draft report, the United States is guilty of unfair practices in nine of the 13 areas, repeating its record in fiscal 1993. The EU is brought to task in four areas (six in 1993) and the ROK, five (six in 1993). In the case of the United States, the report stresses that it takes unilateral measures, abuses antidumping measures, and gives priority to U.S. products in government procurement. In particular, the paper takes issue with such unilateral measures as the revival of the Super 301 provision and the financial retaliation bill. The report also takes up the U.S. trade policy of setting numerical targets, which the United States strongly demanded at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, expressing strong criticism. It states that setting numerical targets for the future to ask Japan to increase imports "is not only lacking in economic rationality, but also runs counter to the spirit of GATT." Apart from the 10 major countries and areas, the report also discusses China and Taiwan, which are preparing for GATT membership, for the first time, pointing out "barriers to be rectified." For China, the report asks for consistency and more transparency in its systems and improvement in the areas of high tariffs and import and export quotas. In the case of Taiwan, high tariffs, the service trade, and subsidies are cited, with the request that it take timely measures.
