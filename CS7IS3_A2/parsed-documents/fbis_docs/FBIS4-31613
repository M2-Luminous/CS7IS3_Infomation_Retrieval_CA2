[passage omitted] The enemy was again shelling civilan targets, mostly residential buildings, inflicting extensive damage, and only rain, which has forced most people off the streets, kept the number of casualties as low as it was. This was the eighth artillery shelling of Brcko in the last month, and fifth from the direction of Croatia. A total of seven people were killed and 46 others were wounded in the attacks. The local U.N. observer team has duly informed the Tuzla-based command of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for northeastern Bosnia and the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo of each incident, lodging protests.
