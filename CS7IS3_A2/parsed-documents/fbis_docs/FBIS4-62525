At the beginning of the intercept Kavsadze presents a clause-by-clause interpretation of the Georgian-Abkhaz agreement signed in Moscow 14 May. He says that, unlike previous agreements, the only signatories to this deal are the Georgian and Abkhaz sides. The Moscow agreement has not been signed by either Russia or the United Nations, he says, and continues: "The first article of the cease-fire and disengagement agreement says that the sides bind themselves to stop hostilities and not to use force against each other. This was also mentioned in other documents signed since December last year. However, this time we have an agreement, rather than a statement, a memorandum of understanding, or some other document. It is an agreement signed by two sides -- the Georgian and the Abkhaz sides. ``The second article says that the armed forces should be disengaged from each other. It also outlines the disengagement principle. The reason why I am not paying too much attention to the absence of disengagement charts is that only a principle of disengagement was formulated, rather than an entire procedure. Under this principle, the sides are to be separated and the buffer zone is to be filled by a peace-keeping force. That is what the principle is. ``The third article is about who should be deployed and how. It says: The precise marking of the lines of disengagement and a detailed chart for the disengagement of forces is to be drawn up by the sides within the framework of a stage-by-stage full-scale settlement. [Preceeding sentence spoken in Russian] In this connection, a working group is to be formed, which will clarify these issues, draw up a chart, which will show who should be deployed where in order to maintain peace. ``The fourth article outlines in general terms the mandate of this force. The aims and purposes of this peacekeeping force are still to be finalized. Its main function should be to maintain peace and create conditions for the return of refugees. ``The agreement also includes articles five, six, and seven. ``The fifth article says that full-scale negotiations on conflict settlement are to be continued. ``The sixth article requests the UN and its Security Council to renew and broaden the mandate of UN military observers in Abkhazia, so that their involvement can be more active and efficient.'' After further remarks which are indistinct owing to poor reception, Kavsadze concludes by saying that this agreement alone only lays the foundation for the return of ethnic Georgian refugees to Abkhazia and that another deal is needed for the actual process to get started.
