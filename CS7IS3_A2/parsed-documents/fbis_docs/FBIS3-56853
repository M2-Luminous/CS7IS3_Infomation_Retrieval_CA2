"The thin thread that connected the Chernomyrdin Government and reformers over the past months," the IZVESTIYA newspaper writes, "snapped after Viktor Chernomyrdin left the Kremlin following a six-hour tete-a-tete conversation with the president on January 18. "The premier broke this thread, vitally important for Russia's revival, with his own hand, dismissing Gaydar as if a servant and predetermining the same lot for Boris Fedorov (eds: finance minister). Thus, the reformist wing in the government has been virtually cut off. "The reformer president is forced to agree with the premier due to the fact that he has no right to ignore the results of the parliamentary elections. From now on, the government of reforms ceased to exist in Russia." In an interview with the same newspaper, Gaydar said that he had only one alternative: "Either to stay, using possibilities offered by the post of first vice-premier and at the same time to serve as a cover for a policy with which he disagrees, or to achieve complete political clarity, losing the post. "Real political space for me in the cabinet considerably shrank over the past few weeks." According to Gaydar, "our state now cannot be regarded as democratic. Bureaucracy again starts ossifying. The departure of the state with its apparatus from the people again sharply intensified". "After Gaydar's resignation," the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper writes, "another vice-premier, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov turned to be in the political limelight. No matter who and what is said, but the country's line in the credit and monetary policy and the fight against inflation is linked (in Russia and abroad) to actions of the `iron' finance minister. "The appearance of a new notion in Russian political life -- the joining of a government in the process of reorganisation under definite conditions -- is linked with the name of Fedorov. "These facts can be treated in different ways, but they cannot be dismissed. This means work in a federal body on conditions of a political and moral contract." The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper tries to examine reasons for a sharp fall of the rouble against the U.S. dollar. "The resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov do not exactly coincide with the start of the dollar's vigorous growth," the newspaper writes. "However, Gaydar's resignation is nearly nothing for the artificially pent-up dollar. Fedorov is another pair of shoes. Rumours about his resignation started circulating from January 10 when the rouble nosedived." The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov who writes: "There are no clear-cut rules of game in the field of economic reforms, as before. Rules are being changed every day without agreeing them with those who directly participate in these reforms. "There is no reasonable programme either. If we are to speak about the efficiency of moves made spontaneously, we are skidding downward all the time, spending what was created by others." Skokov says that he has no aim of becoming Russian president "at present". The same newspaper writes in anotehr article that "a turn for the better evidently set in in relations between Moscow and Tbilisi. This is at least the opinion of Russian Ambassador to Georgia Vladimir Zemskiy. He says in an interview with the newspaper that the sides managed to turn to a dialogue and mutual tolerance from tension and even confrontation caused by the events at first in South Ossetia and then in Abkhazia. According to the ambassador, the improvement of relations will be crowned with a visit to Tbilisi by Russian President Boris Yeltsin scheduled for February 3-4 and the long-awaited signing of a treaty of friendship, good-neighbourly relations and cooperation. The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with Lieutenant-General Viktor Yesin from the Chief Staff of Russian Strategic Forces who writes: "The reached mutually acceptable understanding on non-targeting of missiles (eds: of Russia and the United States at each other) means for us that they will have `zero' flight assignment. "Every-day control over nuclear vehicles of delivery will be exercised, proceeding from the fact that Russia, as it is recorded in its military doctrine, does not regard any state as its enemy. "We shall not threaten anybody, but this does not preclude in any way a possibility under a contingency to set targets in the missile control systems on orders from the Russian president who is supreme commander-in-chief." The PRAVDA newspaper runs an article by lower house member Viktor Shevelukha who says that the reason for the decline of the Russian countryside lies "in the long-standing economic pillage of peasants and agriculture as a whole and in the exaction of nearly all added value of the Gross National Product without its return, at least partially, to agriculture". The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features "statement by the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party", "warning of a new round of `witch-hunt', a drive against dissidents in some former Soviet republics". "Former Soviet republics carry out anticommunist actions with surprising orchestration and consistency," the document says. "The trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is followed by trials of party members and leaders of its organisations."
