The so-called Civilian Society Board has its headquarters in Zocalo, Mexico City's urban and political center, and is expected to continue operating until 10 April, the anniversary of the murder of revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata, the name the guerrillas decided to adopt during their 1 January insurrection. The discussion is somewhat similar to what the EZLN is already doing in the Laconda jungle and Altos de Chiapas communities. It is aimed at obtaining approval or disapproval of the agreements signed on 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas, located 780 km southeast of Mexico City. In the capital city, the Judicial Commission of the Civic Action National Coordinator for National Liberation (CONAC-LN), founded by Benito Miron, former official of the Federal Labor Board, and Ricardo Barco, leader of the Proletariat Independent Movement (MPI), organized the consultation. Both said they have documents signed by EZLN military leader Subcommander Marcos where the military leader acknowledges them as his legal representatives in Mexico City. They both said that during the consultation they expect to learn society's opinion on whether or not the government's answers satisfy the demands that prompted the EZLN to take up arms. The consultation also seeks to establish society's opinion on whether or not the agreement between the government and the guerrillas will allow peace with dignity, which is one of the Zapatists' main demands. In addition, the discussion tables will receive general proposals to be included in a "list of proposals by the civilian society which will be sent to the EZLN and the Mexican Government to be taken into account in possible future dialogues." The CONAC-LN foresees the establishment of similar discussion tables in other cities, according to Miron and Barco, who disclosed the results of a legal study on the previous agreements between the Zapatist guerrillas and the government. According to analysts, the official responses to the Zapatists were made "in a confusing, evasive language void of concrete proposals." In February, the EZLN offered to present all the agreements reached by the 19 delegates of the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee with Camacho Solis in a referendum. The encounter that lasted 10 days took place at the more than 100-year-old San Cristobal de las Casa cathedral, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, dioceses official, was the mediator. The Zapatist delegates presented 34 demands, 32 on the social and economic situation of 1 million Indians in Chiapas to which Camacho Soils offered, in the government's behalf, 34 solutions. After that meeting, the Zapatists discussed each of the agreements with the communities under their influence in Altos de Chiapas and the Laconada Jungle, where allegedly approximately 300,000 persons live. The government refused to discuss national policies with the EZLN. The EZLN had demanded Carlos Salinas de Gortari's resignation or a change in the electoral legislation to guarantee impartiality of the 21 August presidential elections.
