Furthermore, it has given itself up to 1 April to decide on the appeals for cancellation filed against seven other deputies from the opposition coalition formed by the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. The CAR with 36 deputies and UTD with seven have won the absolute majority of the 81 seats of the National Assembly. Under the Constitution, this situation forces the head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, to appoint the future prime minister from within this majority. The election of Bemba Bahissa, a UTD member who won in the second constituency in Oti, 470 km northwestern Lome, was invalidated, because "his alternate did not meet the conditions concerning residence in Togo as provided for by the electoral laws," the source added. Bahissa defeated the CAR candidate in the constituency during the second round of the elections. Under the electoral laws, a new election is to be held within one month following the Court's decision. The discussions for the appointment of the prime minister have been going on since 15 March between President Eyadema and the two opposition leaders, namely Yaovi Agboyibor of CAR and UTD of Edem Kodjo. The two leaders agreed to propose the candidacy of Agboyibor, but yesterday, Gen. Eyadema announced that he would prefer to choose among many personalities, claiming that the prime minister should not be "appointed by the parliamentary majority," but by himself "from within" it.
