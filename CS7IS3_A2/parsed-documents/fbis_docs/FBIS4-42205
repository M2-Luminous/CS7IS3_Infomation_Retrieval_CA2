The number of MP's present in the chamber could at times be counted on the fingers of one hand. The debate on Rwanda was conducted entirely in Dutch -- with the exception of one unintentionally absurd intervention by Jean-Pierre de Clippele of the PRL [French-speaking Liberal Party]. He argued for a geographic separation of Hutus and Tutsis -- who share the same language and culture and who have lived together for centuries -- "naturally allowing for the maintenance of a form of central authority in Kigali, to manage the railways for example." A Rwandan observer in the press gallery gulped in disbelief: railways in the land of a thousand hills? Shortly after the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda, DE MORGEN was able to report -- on the authority of a member of the government -- that cooperation in the field between French and Belgian paratroopers was faltering. This was accompanied by political differences of opinion: The French supported/support the Hutu extremists who took over the government. The Belgians are keeping their distance from the so-called interim government -- which is slandering the Belgians -- and also the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] rebels. Magda Aelvoet of AGALEV [Alternative Lifestyle] wanted to know from Claes whether our report was right. "Pure invention," Claes replied without flinching, "on the contrary, we must thank Paris for the help they provided. I have no knowledge of French paratroopers refusing to rescue even one of our fellow countrymen. People should refrain from spreading such rumors and present concrete facts." Aelvoet, followed by Marc Van Peel of the CVP [Flemish Christian Democratic Party], then denounced the UN for not doing enough to stop the bloodshed. She also argued that Belgium too is keeping its head down. A misconception, stated Claes: "It would be difficult for Belgium to take the lead: The anti-Belgian campaign extends to the refugee camps." But that is not stopping Belgium from trying to set up a regional peace conference -- "and in this connection I must refute any suggestion that we would oppose the presence of Zaire at such a conference. Quite the opposite in fact, although we do not believe that Zaire can play a leading role due to the major transfer of weapons and ammunition from Zaire to Rwandan troops." In any event, Claes does not consider any large-scale UN intervention in Kigali to be realistic. Belgium continues to support "the spirit of Arusha" based on national reconciliation, respect for human rights, and democratization. And Belgium is already providing several hundred million francs in aid. "We remain prepared to contribute to the reconstruction of the country and to relieving the enormous human needs." A final subject of dispute was Belgium's visa policy. Belgian embassies in neighboring countries are only granting visas to Rwandan refugees who can establish that they have close links with Belgium, while other countries are being more generous, stated Aelvoet. "Be careful," replied Claes, "our embassies obviously take the necessary precautions in order to prevent those responsible for the killings from finding refuge in our country." Aelvoet remained unconvinced. The minister: "And of course our embassies also consider where these refugees could go when they arrive here, without having to immediately turn to welfare."
