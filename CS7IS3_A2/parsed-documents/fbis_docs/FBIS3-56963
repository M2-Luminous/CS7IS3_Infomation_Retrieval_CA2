For two years now, decisions have been adopted on the need for closer integration within the CIS framework and the creation of an economic union, which remain nothing more than good intentions. As a result of a series of bilateral agreements being signed in August-October 1992, as well as the multilateral Agreement "On a Unified Monetary System and Coordinated Monetary, Credit, and Currency Policy of States Retaining the Ruble As Legal Tender," the creation of a ruble zone incorporating nine states was proclaimed. They were: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The ruble was acknowledged to be the only legal tender in states within the ruble zone. In January 1993, heads of state adopted the decision to set up the Interstate Ruble Zone Bank, of which all countries in the ruble zone were founders. It was to carry out multilateral transactions on a clearing basis. However, agreement was not reached on two fundamental issues when drafting the bank's statute: Which ruble would be the common currency -- the Russian ruble or a supranational ruble -- and how decisions would be made in the bank's council. Another agreement -- on practical measures to set up a new type of ruble zone -- was signed in September 1993 by six states: In addition to Russia, the signatories were Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan. In practice, however, Russia's commitment -- declared at summit level interstate meetings -- to strengthening integration processes within the CIS framework amounts to transferring economic relations with the former Soviet republics to its general system of foreign economic relations. To a certain extent, these actions by the Russian authorities have objective foundation, as the newly independent states are trying quite hard to obtain raw materials and energy on preferential terms within the framework of closer economic cooperation; they are also endeavoring to resolve the problem of clearing the debt facing Russia in a way that is advantageous to themselves. This kind of simplified approach is a breeding ground for negative attitudes to reintegration in a number of Russian federal departments, which take an equally simplified view of protecting Russia's interests, bringing the problem of equivalent commodity exchange to the fore. The majority of economists admit that, from the point of view of Russia's strategic state interests, in the long term the policy of reintegration within the CIS framework is the only right policy to follow, for a whole number of objective reasons. The most important of these is the need to smooth over the consequences of the breakup of the USSR in the economic sphere, as they have considerably aggravated the crisis in all the states concerned. Russia has gradually taken an increasingly tough stand on the question of the ruble zone. Its terms for those wishing to remain in this zone have become increasingly unacceptable to them, and this has in fact forced the states which originally signed the agreements on setting up a new type of ruble zone to introduce their own currencies. The explanation for Russia's tough policy given by those who support it is that it must protect its own economic interests, as combining the monetary systems of Russia and the other five states could cause a surge of inflation and an increase in Russia's trade deficit with these countries; it would also make it practically impossible for Russia to retrieve debts from these countries. There is no doubt that the newly independent states' different levels of development, supply of natural resources, and pace of transformations are an objective impediment to the reintegration of their economies. However, this has never been a secret to the Russian leadership. Nevertheless, it has not prevented it from concluding treaties and agreements on economic integration within the CIS framework.... A fairly recent session of the CIS Coordination and Consultation Committee essentially announced that the idea of a ruble zone has been abandoned and that the CIS countries now recognize each other's national currency. The transition to multicurrency conditions of operation in the CIS is being broadly publicized: a free trade zone; a customs union; a common market of goods, labor, and capital; and a currency and economic union. But in the absence of a real money and currency market, the CIS countries' national currency exchange rates can be for transfer purposes only and do not in themselves signify the restoration of equivalent exchange. Unfortunately, we are seeing a repetition of the old practice whereby agreements are signed -- and only then do the parties involved begin to try to develop a mechanism to implement those agreements. For example, it has been announced that a payments union between Russia and Kazakhstan will be formed in the near future, although no decision has been made regarding a key issue in the formation of this union: Namely, the question of tying quotations for Kazakhstan's currency to the dollar or some other freely convertible currency. Despite the fact that it is acquiring fundamental importance. The introduction of national currencies to payment relations cannot in itself solve the serious problem of balancing mutual payments and nonpayments. We can hardly expect Russian enterprises to be interested in obtaining their partners' som or tenge, with which they certainly will not always be able to acquire the goods they need in these or in other former Soviet republics. Consequently, there is a visible prospect of transactions remaining bilateral in nature and barter being employed everywhere, which will still further reduce the market's capacity and make enterprises' activity even more difficult. Failure to solve this problem could make mutual payments for supplies of goods still more complicated and ultimately lead to a further reduction in commodity exchange. This would mean that Russia would not receive raw materials and components from the former republics and at the same time experience difficulties with the sale of its own products, which, in turn, would lead to a further decline in Russia's output and, as a consequence of this, an increase in unemployment and social tension. A policy of "economic pressure" on Russia's partners in the former Soviet republics, as some Russian leaders suggest, would hardly help in this respect. We must also take into account that, if Russia were to pursue a very tough economic policy in relation to its partners, sooner or later its place would be taken by other countries. Moreover, in order to effectively protect Russia's economy against negative influences from the former Soviet republics (the transfer of large amounts of rubles, the reexport of Russian goods, and so forth), we must urgently equip our borders with every facility, which seems an unrealistic prospect at present. So, the new type of ruble zone has been left behind in the past. However, the problems in relations between the newly independent states still remain and are intensifying. The course of setting up an economic union is now being pursued, although implementation has been put off for quite some time. One factor of considerable importance in this respect is that our CIS partners' confidence in Russian policy has been undermined as a result of its vagueness and inconsistency.
