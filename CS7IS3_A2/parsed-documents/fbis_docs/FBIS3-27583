Medium-sized and small enterprises with less than desirable management and profits are being sold, transferred or merged with others, said Jia Heting, deputy director for the Production System Department under the State Commission for Economic Restructuring (SCER). He said 10,000 enterprises in the country underwent such reforms last year. Two thousand nine hundred medium-sized and small enterprises in China's 16 large cities were sold or merged, and property rights worth 6 billion yuan (about 1 billion U.S. dollars then) were effectively made productive. More than 400,000 employees were offered other jobs, according to Jia. These cities include Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Shenzhen. "Such property rights reform helps to optimize the allocation of state assets in the socialist market economy," said Jia Heting. More and more enterprises from different regions or trades are being merged, instead of only those from within the same regions or trades, Jia said, adding that enterprises in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing are taking over others by buying up their stock. To transfer property rights, some enterprises agree to shoulder old debts, or pay in cash immediately, he said. The SCER official said a major move in the property rights reform--the share-holding system--is gaining ground in China. More and more pilot companies are going public, and nine enterprises have been chosen to issue stocks in Hong Kong. There are 3,800 pilot stock companies in China, Jia said. China has promulgated a series of laws and regulations to govern property rights reform, which include the Bankruptcy Law, the Corporate Law, and the provisional regulations on enterprise mergers, on management of state assets, on selling the property rights of small enterprises and the assessing of state assets. Economists expect large and medium-sized state enterprises to be transformed into stockholding enterprises, while small state enterprises will be turned into non-state but publicly owned enterprises through auctions or rental arrangements. The large state enterprises will absorb non-state funds from the market, and new state assets can be formed through stock issues and creating income through investing in weak points of the national economy, experts said.
