Feng answered a number of questions raised by our staff reporter concerning China's economic system reform. QUESTION: What influence will the 1994 reform measures exert on China's economy and social stability? ANSWER: This year will be crucial for China's economic system reform, and a series of reform measures for the finance, taxation, banking, foreign trade, enterprise and social security systems have been published and put into practice. The difficulty, complexity and importance of the work have in no way been underestimated. The programs per se and the influence which may be exerted by the reform measures have been comprehensively considered and countermeasures have been worked out by relevant departments. For instance, implementation of the system whereby tax revenues are shared by central and local authorities will undoubtedly be of great importance for bringing about a better balance in the distribution relations between the central and local authorities. It will also promote the rational growth of government revenue and properly strengthen the financial might and macro-economic control ability of the central government. The reform fully considers the interests of both local governments and enterprises. The existing interest pattern of local governments will be maintained and the goal of reform will be gradually reached. The amount of tax revenues to be returned to the local governments by the central authorities will be based on 1993 figures. Subsidies of the central authorities, the amount of tax revenues turned over to the higher authorities by the local governments and the settlement of accounts involved in the original systems will temporarily remain unchanged following implementation of the new revenue sharing system. After a period of time, the items will gradually be standardized and supplemented by other auxiliary measures to ensure smooth implementation of the new system. Implementation of a unified 33 percent income tax rate for domestic enterprises will naturally have a positive impact on fair tax burdens and opportunities for equal competition among enterprises, and will bring about orderly competition and stable growth of the Chinese economy. In consideration of the actual situation in regard to the low profits earned by some enterprises, various appropriate transitional and preferential measures have been adopted. In terms of other reform measures, transitional measures for the continuity of policies have been planned and special consideration has been given to vested interests. The reform will furnish a relatively stable interest mechanism for the smooth establishment of the new system. In short, following 10-odd years of economic system reform, the psychological tolerance of the Chinese people has been greatly enhanced. In terms of the relative advantages or scientific nature of the new system, consideration contained in the reform measures for vested interests and appropriate transitional arrangements provide ample conditions for implementing the new system. Necessary measures will be adopted to overcome certain problems that may surface, such as the latent losses of enterprises becoming open losses, low profits turning into losses, and enterprises finding it difficult to raise funds. The measures will also ensure the smooth establishment of the new system. Q: What is the role of China's public economy, and what is the target for reform of public ownership? A: China is a socialist society, and the essence of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces, eradicate exploitation, remove polarization and in the end to attain the goal of common prosperity. The establishment of socialist public ownership is designed to liberate productive forces and attain the goal of common prosperity. Whether or not the superiority can be brought into full play depends on the flexibility of the allocation of resources and efficiency. Prior to reform and opening to the outside world, China basically implemented a system based on a planned economy, and the system was characterized by a high degree of centralism and a rejection of the functions of market mechanisms. The system led to the irrational allocation of resources and low economic returns which seriously hampered the enhancement of the comprehensive might of the state and the vitality of enterprises. Practice of reform and opening over the past decade and more has proved that the substitution of the market economy for the planned economy signifies the further liberation of productive forces. This aspect, plus the effective macro-economic control of the government, will further bring the superiority of the socialist public economy into play. Socialist public ownership is indeed harmonious with the market economy. The orientation of reform is to enable socialist public ownership to better suit the demands of the market economy and to meet the objective demands of market competition. China's market economic structure has merged with the basic system of socialism. Along with the deepening of reform and continued improvement of the socialist market economy, in terms of the structure of ownership, a pattern will be shaped which features the long-term common development of various economic sectors, with public ownership serving as the main body and the national economy as the leading factor and which is supplemented by the individual, private and foreign-funded economies. Different economic sectors can voluntarily engage in various forms of associated operations, and state-owned, collective and other enterprises can enter into the market. State-owned enterprises will play a leading role in the practice of equal competition. Q: What measures will China take to reduce the imbalance in development between different regions, and how will China solve any negative impact which may arise? A: The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure has, in a sense, offered various avenues and real possibilities for narrowing the imbalance between various regions throughout the country. At present, most of the vast economically underdeveloped regions in China are sparsely populated and are rich in natural resources. In line with the goals of reform, development of the basic role of market mechanisms in the allocation of resources will help the regions have access to more extensive and fair earnings and gain compensation through market exchanges. The central government will, as always, place top priority on the economic and social development of these regions. For example, during the financial and tax system reform, the financial payment ability of various localities has been appropriately balanced by using the methods of the financial transfer payments. By instituting tax regulation, the establishment of a social security system and various other social redistribution means, central authorities have solved problems related to extensive gaps caused by the preliminary distribution. In terms of price system reform, prices of a few products such as the means of production, coal, crude oil and natural gas covered by the state plans have been gradually decontrolled, and have in turn benefited inland regions. Through the investment system reform, the government has mainly implemented preferential industrial policies and steered domestic and foreign funds toward investments in infrastructure facilities and basic industries, particularly those related to improving the transport and telecommunications sectors and strengthening energy production in the central and western regions. With regard to opening to the outside world and to supporting economic development in various remote border regions, preferential policies common in international practice that suit market economic demands will be adopted toward these regions. Fundamentally speaking, however, development of the central and western regions will be realized through market competition. They will gradually attain common prosperity by relying on their own efforts and enhancing efficiency. The government encourages developed regions to cooperate with less developed regions. Each will supply the needs of the other, bring their advantages into play, and in the unified market, compete and support each other for common progress and prosperity. Q: China's economic reform has been successful and the country has adopted numerous other major measures for economic reform in 1994. However, will China coordinate political restructuring with economic reform? A: Over the past 15 years, China has not only scored remarkable achievements in economic reform, but has also made great headway in restructuring the political system and strengthening construction of the democratic and legal system. For instance, we have formulated and promulgated more than 140 important laws and regulations and have continuously improved the people's congress system. People's congresses at all levels are playing an increasingly important role in legislation, supervision, and decision-making on important matters, as well as the appointment and removal of personnel. The Communist Party of China, the ruling party, has implemented a system of multiparty cooperation and democratic consultations with the country's eight democratic parties, which have also taken part in discussions of state affairs. The system has constantly been improved in recent years. We are restructuring the government administration, separating the functions of the government from those of enterprises, and implementing the public service system. Success in these areas is inseparable from our economic reform. Economic reforms have indeed brought changes in both the political and social structure. Along with the deepening of the economic reform, we will continue to promote reform of the political system. Our unswerving goal is to implement democratic politics and we will continue to vigorously promote the construction of democratic politics. At the same time, we hold that China's political restructuring can only be conducted in light of China's specific conditions. In terms of democratic and legal construction, we will use the experience of other countries for reference, but will refrain from indiscriminately copying the patterns of other countries.
