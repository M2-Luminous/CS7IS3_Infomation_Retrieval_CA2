Developing the food industry is an important measure for guaranteeing the basic living demands of the urban people and enabling peasants to become better-off with moderate prosperity and an important component for developing the export-oriented economy. This was repeatedly stressed by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, when he listened to Shijiazhuang city's briefings on development of the vegetable basket project today. Today, the production line for producing 10,000 tonnes of Guangbei Brand cook meat products under the Shijiazhuang city meat packing plant, which is one of the key items of Shijiazhuang city's vegetable basket project, was completed and put into production. Provincial leaders, including Cheng Weigao, Li Bingliang, Zhao Jinduo, Guo Hongqi, Gu Eerxiong, Song Shuhua, and Zhang Runshen, and former provincial leaders, such as Xie Feng and Hong Yi, travelled to the plant to extend congratulations. After that, they listened to briefings given by the Shiajiazhuang city government on the vegetable basket project. Cheng Weigao said: The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have been concerned about this vegetable basket project. Whether we can enrich the vegetable basket in the course of deepening reform will affect economic and political stability. Foodstuffs are an important aspect to the vegetable basket project. Our province has rich resources for the development of the food industry which should become a pillar industry along with steel, iron, machinery, and textile industries. On the one hand, we should do a good job in local market supply; and on the other hand, we should make food industry serve the domestic and international markets. At present, people have failed to fully understand this point. The development of food industry may lead the processing industry and aquaculture forward, make a number of peasants rich, arrange jobs for a batch of labor force, and enrich the vegetable basket and market supply. It is necessary to regard this work as an important measure for enabling peasants to become well-off and developing the export-oriented economy. Cheng Weigao said: To grasp the vegetable basket, first of all, we must do a good job in production and supply; and second, strengthen market management and price management, deal blows to unlawful acts, such as manipulation of markets, mixing up good and inferior products, selling fake products, forcing the prices up, and giving short measurements, protect the interests of consumers, and keep the prices at a rational level. He expressed hope that Shijiazhuang city will pay attention to the four matters in the course of carrying out the vegetable basket project: First, Shijiazhuang city should attend to hog raising, accelerate the development of the meat processing industry, and exert efforts to raise the product quality and increase product varieties; second, actively carry out the work of raising cattle with straw; third, accelerate the development of vegetables within plastic sheet coverings and select several vegetable varieties for intensive processing or for sale within small packages; and fourth, develop the intensive processing of grain products.
