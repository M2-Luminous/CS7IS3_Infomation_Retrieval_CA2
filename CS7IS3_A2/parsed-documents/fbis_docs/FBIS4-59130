In an attempt to spread panic among secure civilians and draw attention to its suspect aims; on the pretext of talking about military posts in populated civilian areas; and in implementation of the policy of confronting all those who oppose the agreements that seek to liquidate our Palestinian cause, the Zionist enemy aircraft have launched new raids at 1720 today, thus raising the total number of raids to 11. As usual, the Zionist enemy has claimed that it has inflicted casualties within the ranks of the PFLP-GC. This was reported by other news media. We in the PFLP-GC deny sustaining any casualties within the ranks of our fighters. We reassert that the locations targeted by the air raids are civilian institutions that provide free humanitarian aid. We stress that the Zionist political and military raids will not prevent us from sticking to our objectives and jihad positions and our confrontation of the conspiracy of surrender. We pledge to pursue the march until the liberation of land and man. [Signed] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
