The long-awaited day in which we will participate in our civic duty has arrived. The TSE respectfully expresses its confidence that we will carry out this electoral process with the same order and enthusiasm we have shown in previous elections. Our only request to the members of the Vote-Counting Boards is that they strictly follow the instructions they received from the TSE. Political parties have supervisors at the Vote-Counting Boards, whose only function will be supervising those boards. They cannot engage in any other activities. The TSE is receiving messages from all across the country. People are already voting, the polling stations are open, and there is a good turnout at the various polls. As we have done in the past, we will place our homeland very high on the list of privileged democratic countries. I urge the TSE members to do their job. The TSE assures you that we are doing everything and have done everything possible to ensure you can vote without any problems. You can rest assured that your vote will be respected. Costa Ricans: Democracy needs your vote. Go out and vote.
