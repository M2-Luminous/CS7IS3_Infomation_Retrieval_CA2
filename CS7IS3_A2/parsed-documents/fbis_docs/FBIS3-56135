In Connection with This Event We Are Publishing Comments on Russia by Well-Known American Political and Public Figures"] [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen: Difficulties in the course of the reforms are no reason to slow them down. The fact that the Russian population is encountering serious difficulties in the transition to the market economy is not unexpected. However, this is happening not because the reforms are moving too quickly but because they are developing too slowly. That opinion was expressed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen at a meeting with a group of journalists organized by USA TODAY. The United States maintains relations with Russia at many levels, L. Bentsen said. We are discussing not only nuclear or military questions. We are also concerned about bilateral economic relations. And we are trying to help Russia make the transition to the market economy easier. One of the most difficult tasks during such a transformation is to reduce inflation, the high level of which in Russia is partly due to the continuation of subsidies to some state enterprises on which the whole social structure in some regions depends. They are continuing to produce goods which are not wanted and whose production is not in the interests of consumers. The progress in this sphere is quite slow. Nevertheless, Russia has managed to reduce inflation somewhat. It has made "astonishing progress" in the privatization of small enterprises, too. "In this sphere the situation is heartening," L. Bentsen noted. The United States is interested in creating more favorable conditions for U.S. business investments in Russia. One such sphere is the oil industry. The participation of U.S. companies in its modernization could give Russia a speedy benefit in the form of hard currency. The treasury secretary stressed that Russia should work more quickly to elaborate clear rules for the conclusion of contracts with foreign companies. Then American firms would have greater confidence in the legality of their investments and a clear idea what they can expect when contracts are being concluded. "Some progress has already been made in this regard. But even more remains to be made," L. Bentsen stressed. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what he expects from the discussion of economic problems during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow, the treasury secretary said: "I believe that the U.S. Administration will insist on further progress in relations between international financial institutions and the Russian Government." Efforts must be made by both sides, L. Bentsen remarked. They must establish closer contact and discuss Russia's observance of the terms for granting loans. The United States is also urging the World Bank to take measures to help Russia to resolve its social problems connected with the dismissal of workers in major industrial sectors. The World Bank can grant loans to help rectify the situation. I hope that the bank will study these opportunities together with the Russian Government, the U.S. treasury secretary said.
