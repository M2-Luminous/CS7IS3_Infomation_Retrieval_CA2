What are these conditions? Are they sufficient to reassure the Palestinian people in the territories about their security and restore their confidence in the possibility of attaining peace? [Qaddumi] Following the Hebron al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which was perpetrated by the Israeli settlers, it has become essential that protection be provided for our people in the occupied territories. The issue of settlements has become an urgent topic that should be discussed today and not tomorrow, that is, not at the end of the transitional period. Secure areas in Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem, which are the friction areas, should have been created. Israel should have adopted firm measures to disarm the settlers. We wonder why the Israeli Army, which is occupying the Palestinian territories, is allowing those settlers to carry weapons if it is not for the sake of attacking the Palestinians? It is quite possible to disarm them. The Security Council should also issue a resolution defining a mechanism according to which the citizens can be protected against the settlers' attacks. Israel should expedite its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho first. Postponing withdrawal on the pretext of Israeli security is a big lie. They should have withdrawn on the fixed date. The international community, which condemned this ugly massacre, should support the Palestinian people and protect our people in the occupied territories. The [Madrid] conference co-sponsors should pressure Israel into adopting the necessary measures to protect the Palestinian people. The Security Council is still discussing this issue. Regrettably, the United States said there is no need for a Security Council resolution and that an official statement by the Security Council president would be sufficient. But this does not commit the concerned parties nor does it serve as a Security Council resolution that is binding on those adopting it. [Na'na'] Do you think that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has endangered the Oslo agreement? [Qaddumi] Yes, this horrendous incident has caused many problems and dealt an almost fatal blow to the Oslo agreement. Israel, particularly Yitzhaq Rabin, is responsible for that. Rabin did not abide by the agreement and tried to exhaust the Palestinian negotiators and dictate his own terms and personal interpretation of this agreement. This robbed the agreement of popular Palestinian support. This was followed by the horrible mosque crime, which drove nails in the coffin of the Oslo agreement and the negotiations. [Na'na'] How responsible is the United States for this? [Qaddumi] The United States bears direct responsibility. It should have taken prompt measures instead of claiming that it, as a big power, is protecting human rights and instead of asking China to respect these rights. Can't it pressure Israel, which it considers more than a friend, into safeguarding human rights? Events have proven that Washington erred when it sought to scrap the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism. It is now clear to the world that we were right when we asked the United Nations to issue this resolution. We will ask it to reevaluate this resolution. Our people have been exposed to a Palestinian "holocaust" by those who say they were slaughtered by Nazism. The United States, which claims to be a big power responsible for peace and security in our region and the world, should adopt the necessary measures to put an end to these serious inhuman practices. [Na'na'] You have been in contact with the U.S. Administration since the massacre. Dennis Ross is expected to visit Tunis before this interview is published, and President Clinton's advisers as well as U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held several contacts with President 'Arafat. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev also visited Tunis and met with the Palestinian leaders. Has a new plan emerged from these contacts? [Qaddumi] I would like to point out the fact that the current U.S. State Department team--Dennis Ross, Martin Indyk, Aaron Miller, Dan Kurtzer, and others--sympathize with Israel and are trying to blackmail the Palestinian people. However, this time they know that they are absolutely incapable of blackmailing us. They should shoulder their international responsibilities and we appeal to President Clinton to personally shoulder this responsibility and impose peace in the region by adopting practical measures that protect our people, impose respect for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, and pressure Israel into withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho without any delay. If Washington really wants to sponsor peace and act as a fair arbiter in this process, that is the way they can help restore momentum to the political settlement process. [Na'na'] In a telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary Christopher and the Palestinian president, the United States threatened the Palestinian leadership. What was the response to this threat? [Qaddumi] It would take a long time to describe the methods the United States is using to impose its conditions on us. At the same time, however, we realize that the United States is a superpower. This does not hold off the fact that we have clear demands that we will not revoke no matter what pressure is exerted on us because these demands are just. The United States must put pressure on Israel and not on the PLO. Such pressure will not serve the peace process because it reflects injustice meted out against the Palestinian people who are in danger. [Na'na'] Let us return to the Russian stand, Moscow's initiatives, and visits by Russian envoys. [Qaddumi] Russia is a friendly country. It is a cosponsor of the peace process. We welcome the Russian friends' initiatives just as we welcome the initiatives of other friendly European countries. Turkey has contacted us. The Turkish foreign minister and Turkish President Sulayman Demirel offered their good offices to help end the crisis. It is not an issue of wagers but an issue of pursuing successful means that maintain our people's security and safety and that push the peace process forward. [Na'na'] Do you have an alternative to continuing the negotiations now that the peace process reached this point? [Qaddumi] There is a wrong notion that signing the Oslo agreement means stopping the Palestinian struggle. This is not true. As long as there is an Israeli soldier inside the Palestinian territories, then the resistance must continue. If the Israeli soldiers get out of our territories, then the intifadah will no longer be justified as it is meant to stand against the occupation and get rid of it. I noted this at the Arab League after the signing of the agreement. I very clearly stated that the intifadah will continue as long as there are Israeli soldiers in our territories. According to international laws and the UN charter, it is our right to resist in order to end the occupation, oppression, and persecution. We are now in a better position because Israel will be politically besieged just as it was during Shamir's days. The world, which condemned the Hebron massacre, realizes that Israel is a racist country and a hotbed of tension in the region. There must be an end to its defiance, which threatens security and peace. We sensed this from statements by countries that are considered Israel's friends. Moreover, the Jewish communities in many countries have announced their condemnation. The Zionist movement is afraid of a return to anti-semitic currents. They are now feeling the pressure because they made a mistake and they themselves have condemned it, as evident in the condemnation issued by the Zionist organization AIPAC [American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] in the United States. It is an admission of the perpetration of a crime against the Palestinian people, the price of which they will have to pay. [Na'na'] Israeli investigations proved the Army's involvement in what took place inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Despite this, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin responded to the massacre by allying himself with a right-wing party. What are your conditions for returning to the negotiations? [Qaddumi] There are different roles in Israel. Peres is playing games in an intelligent way and Yitzhaq Rabin is intelligently taking advantage of Peres' games. We well realize that Israel's basic objective is to absorb the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This is because the West Bank offers Israel four advantages. These are: -- Space for more settlement building. -- It forms natural borders with the river Jordan. -- The Israelis consider the West Bank area and the heritage it contains as historical and sacred. This is where the differences over Jerusalem and holy places come in. -- Subterranean water. The Israelis feel that Gaza is a burden to them. However, this does not mean that they will do away with it without having a foothold in it. As for the settlements, the discussion of which was delayed for two years, they say that the agreement affirms the removal of these settlements as soon as possible without having to discuss the issue for more than the first year or the beginning of the second one. In the end, they wanted us to coexist with these settlements. However, the deal was for us to accept a full withdrawal from Gaza and the Jericho area, defined by the British Mandate for Palestine in 1932, and to postpone the discussion of thorny issues, which we may not be able to solve in a short time. These include the issues of refugees, Jerusalem, and settlements. However, through the negotiations, they insisted on controlling security at crossing points, continuing their presence in and the protection of settlements and expanding them beyond limits. This really means that they will not get out of Gaza and Jericho, they will not implement the agreement, and they will not withdraw as scheduled under the security pretext. This is as if Peres is claiming that Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin does not agree on this and that there are differences between them while, in fact, there are no differences but a distribution of roles. If Israel wants peace, it should fully withdraw from Gaza and the Jericho area that reaches 345 square km. However, we know that they are playing with the time factor and seeking to take advantage of it. Yitzhaq Rabin does not want peace. Through the Army, he is trying to obstruct the negotiations and to open the way for Peres to say: There are problems inside the territories. The PLO must forgive us as we promised the Knesset to keep the settlements and we cannot go back on this. The fact is that we do not accept these claims. As I said from the start, Israel will not implement the Oslo agreement. I opposed the agreement out of this conviction. There has to be an Arab deal because we alone, as Palestinians, cannot stand against this ferocious racist onslaught. [Na'na'] At present, the Palestinian scene is in turmoil. Your people in the occupied territories are concerned and insecure. As Palestinian leaders, can you contain these feelings of concern and insecurity, and provide the necessary solutions to pacify the people under occupation, who constantly feel threatened? [Qaddumi] The Palestinian people expect the PLO and the Palestinian leadership to take a firm position this time, because the event is too colossal to be brushed aside by any leadership, regardless of the credibility it may enjoy or the popular esteem it may command. Physical and practical measures are required. I hope that the United States will understand this fact and promote peace and the peace process. Israel must pay a political price. We feel that enormous wrath is raging within the souls of Palestinian people. The leadership must reflect the sentiments of the people by making the necessary decisions. We must understand the signals given to us by our generous people. We must provide them with the necessary and proper protection. The current international circumstances provide a propitious opportunity for obtaining such protection. We must not let this opportunity slip from our hands. [Na'na'] The Soviets [as published] have proposed the reconvening of the Madrid conference. However, talk of such a development died down after the United States opposed this. Do you believe that a reconvening of the Madrid conference could be useful, in terms of promoting the peace process? [Qaddumi] Before the reconvening of the Madrid conference, or the start of any form of negotiations for that matter, Israel and the United Nations must institute physical measures on the ground, tangible measures the effect of which can be felt by the Palestinian people, to maintain the momentum of the peace process. As for a reconvening of the Madrid conference, it is an important proposal. The proposal is a fine one if it means a meeting held by the big powers to explore the reasons for the procrastination in the peace talks, the developments of the peace process, and its failure to yield results after 22 months. With regard to the current U.S. Administration, it is biased toward Israel. Consequently, the peace process will continue to stumble and falter. The world community must realize that Israel is to blame for these setbacks and difficulties, because it has failed to comply with the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and withdraw [from Gaza Strip and Jericho], it has set new conditions not enshrined in the basic agreement, and also because of its practices, which capitalize on the Palestinians' strong desire for peace. Exploiting this desire, Israel seeks to force its own interpretation of the DOP. Yes, a reconvening of the Madrid conference is a good idea, because it would allow us to draw up new foundations for the peace process. I believe that the current U.S. Administration is not as well-versed in the Palestine question as was the previous administration. President Bush was well-intentioned in his quest for progress in the peace process. Hence, we could use a new conference that should include, not just the United States and Russia, but also France, Britain, and China; that is, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This means the rehabilitation of the UN resolutions that call for the convening of a UN-sponsored conference with effective international participation and with the attendance of the PLO in its capacity as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people on an equal footing with the other parties concerned to promote the peace process on clear bases. [Na'na'] There is strong opposition to the Palestinian leadership, both inside and outside the occupied territories. Several memorandums and petitions opposed to the leadership have been signed. Some of these memorandums have reached the attention of President 'Arafat. Do you not believe that the current phase requires a convening of the Palestine National Council, or of the PLO Central Council, at least? Given the tragedy being experienced by the Palestinian people, is it not proper to call for a national reconciliation conference to be attended by all factions? [Qaddumi] Not all the memorandums submitted to the leadership expressed opposition. Some of these memorandums have expressed criticisms of the results produced by the DOP. Other memorandums demanded the enhancement of national unity, and urged that the Palestinian house be put in order. Some memorandums have urged expedited efforts to put the Palestinian house in order, streamline action, and promote collective leadership within the PLO, and shun single-handedness. Other memorandums noted the unsatisfactory state of affairs plaguing the PLO and inter-factional ties. All in all, we deem this constructive criticism. We welcome this criticism and hope for its continuation, because it promotes construction, organization, and favorable action. For Palestine is not the property of a single leader or faction. It is the property of the whole Palestinian people, with all their factions and leading figures. The policymaking regarding Palestine should not be the monopoly of anybody. I, in my capacity as secretary of the Fatah Central Committee, am saying this in public, to make things clear. Yes, we do make mistakes. We have an abundance of flaws. Who does not? People who work make mistakes. However, we must learn from these mistakes, correct them, listen to people's views, and share with them. Sharing is indispensable. For we cannot reach an understanding with other factions if they do not share with us, in terms of work, decisionmaking, and execution. He who believes that he can make the masses and factions do whatever he likes is mistaken. Future developments will prove this. When ideas and approaches conflict, this should not lead to division. I might oppose some leading figures on many issues. But, it remains to be said that we must be able to work together. They, enjoying a majority vote, want to go through the experience offered them by the DOP. That is fine with me. We must respect democracy and hold free discussions, away from character assassination. We must not muzzle people. At the same time, there should be no division in our ranks. because division results in losing both ourselves and the cause, as well. Nonetheless, when a decision is made, everybody must demonstrate discipline and act within the fold. [Na'na'] Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world has been in a state of imbalance. This adversely reflects on our region and the Third World in general. Can the PLO assume the burden of this crucial stage alone without Arab coordination or Arab solidarity? [Qaddumi] The absence of world conflicts and diverse opinions, which lead to rivalry in sympathizing with and seeking a solution to just fateful causes, has an extremely negative impact on areas of crisis and tension. Nevertheless, we note that special attention is given to the Middle East due to the existence of many material and strategic interests there. Western Europe considers our region its main market, in addition to black Africa. The United States has its oil, commercial, and strategic interests, too. But all this is not being exploited properly by us. What do we note when we take a look at the Arab situation? We find that division, weakness, and lack of solidarity have persisted since the end of the Gulf war. This has adversely reflected on the Palestine question. Had the Maghreb Union not supported the Palestine question before the Madrid conference, the settlement process would have been conducted under more unjust conditions for our people. The PLO has restored relations with Egypt and Syria and has begun to enter the Gulf region. We believe we are on the right track toward Arab reconciliation. This, however, is not easy because the wounds are deep. But there should be a collective Arab security based on Arab terms that are respected by all so that both small and big states will feel safe from injustice. We are now trying to coordinate with the Arab brothers in order to hold a five-member conference in Cairo directly after 'Id al-Fitr. It will be attended by the Jordanian, Syrian, Egyptian, and Lebanese brothers with the aim of establishing full coordination. [Na'na'] Apart from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its outcome, much is being said about economic talks between you and Israel. Some even say economic coordination is taking place at the expense of the future Palestinian relations with Jordan and the Arab states. You visited Jordan and held talks on this subject and you are undoubtedly aware of the outcome of negotiations with Israel. What can you say in this regard? [Qaddumi] We categorically rejected customs union with Israel in our economic talks because it means we will become an Israeli province. They asked that the shekel be our official currency, but we rejected that although we do not object to using it equally with others at a certain stage because necessity knows no laws and we need some time to disengage the Israeli and Palestinian currencies. We told them: When we become independent and sit with you as peers, and when you withdraw your soldiers from our occupied territories, we can strike international agreements with you. The initial stage will be transitional and there will be no customs union or imposition of the shekel as an official currency. Israel is an occupation force that robbed the Palestinian economy of its infrastructure so that it can be absorbed. This is one of their political aims. It is not an issue of cooperation. How can cooperation take place between a state whose national income is 26-28 billion [not further identified] while the national income of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is only 2 million? The individual's annual income in Gaza is $740, in the West Bank $1,470, and in Israel $12,500. Moreover, the economic annexes stipulate cooperation in all these fields. Actually, they aim at getting concessions from us in what concerns them, especially in subterranean water, electricity, energy, agriculture, and industry. Therefore, we say that the first step is economic independence and cooperation comes later when our economy builds a sound infrastructure. Consequently, no agreements can be concluded now because they will not be sound and will certainly be tilted in favor of Israel. The Palestinian-Jordanian relations are brotherly relations between two peoples sharing common interests. These relations should be promoted in the next stage on the political and economic levels, especially since we are witnessing constant changes that require us to bolster these relations in practice and not only in daily statements. Therefore, we struck two agreements with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to serve this fixed target and to enhance cohesion between our two peoples who are linked with distinguished relations.
