Radio Velkaton said that the army of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia is firmly in control of all separation lines and that Izetbegovic's forces "will never make it to Velika Kladusa." The same source said that "the remnants of the 5th Corps" of the Muslim army loyal to Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon continued their fierce attacks against positions and civilian targets in the autonomous province of western Bosnia and added that the heaviest infantry clashes and mortar exchanges are taking place in the Caglica, Todorovo, and Pecigrad areas. According to the radio, these attacks were repelled without loss. Radio Velkaton claims that units of the 5th Corps are regrouping and redeploying, which means that there will be no peace in this region for a long time to come.
