"It solely depends on Prime Minister Hata's decision," said Akira Yamagishi, head of the Japanese Confederation of Labor (Rengo), in referring to an SDP call for resignation of the Hata cabinet or general elections if the prime minister refuses to quit. "There is no possibility of (the Hata government) resigning voluntarily en masse if the decision is left to Sinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader (Ichiro) Ozawa," Yamagishi said in a program on the private Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) television network. Ozawa, chief strategist of the coalition, is regarded as the behind-the-scenes leader of the shaky minority government that toppled four decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Rengo is a main backer of the SDP, which left the coalition in April after former coalition head Morihiro Hosokawa the party supported quit in a dispute over his shady personal financial deals.
