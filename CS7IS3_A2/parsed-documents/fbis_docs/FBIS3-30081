It was outrageous of the traitor to try to justify the kowtowing diplomacy and treacherous diplomacy yielding to the brigandish demands of foreign aggressors and call for accepting it. He openly broke his "election commitment not to open the rice market" when it was still vivid in people's memory. This revealed once again the true color of the poor fellow who has prolonged his life with perfidy and treachery.
