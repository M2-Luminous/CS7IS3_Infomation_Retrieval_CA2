The report of the Australian parliamentary delegation, which visited Bougainville in April, was welcomed by the Australian Government. The report calls for a cease-fire negotiated by Bougainville interim authority, local chiefs, the police and defense forces, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA], and the extra-legal resistant forces. The peace timetable calls for several weeks of consultations and community meetings, agreement on a neutral chairman and agenda, and parallel talks with the Papua New Guinea Government and the BRA. Pacific island neighbors could provide natural observers and they should be a guarantee of safety for all participants. The report said Australia should offer to host and support talks either in Bougainville or in the north Queensland city of Cairns. The Australian parliamentarians strongly recommended that the Papua New Guinea Government authority should allow relief supplies to be delivered to the whole of Bougainville.
