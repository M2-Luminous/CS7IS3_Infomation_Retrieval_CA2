In a statement the party's deputy leader, Dr. Willie Snyman, wanted to know which country in the world would tolerate a foreign superpower interfering with its defense force's internal affairs. He was reacting to an announcement that an American assistant defense secretary, Mr. Charles Freeman, would lead a 10-member Pentagon team to South Africa. The delegation is scheduled to meet representatives of the government, the defense force, the Transitional Executive Council, the ANC [African National Congress] and other organizations.
