FR941103-0-00122 FR941103-0-00016 §178.346&hyph;13 Pressure and leakage tests. * * * * * (c) Leakage test. Cargo tanks equipped with vapor collection equipment may be leakage tested in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's ``Method 27_Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test,'' as set forth in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A. Acceptance criteria are found at 40 CFR 60.501 and 60.601. PART 180_CONTINUING QUALIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PACKAGINGS 29. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 5101&hyph;5127, 49 CFR 1.53. 30. In §180.403, a new definition ``Replacement of a barrel'' is added, in the appropriate alphabetical order, to read as follows: §180.403 Definitions. * * * * * Replacement of a barrel means to replace the existing tank on a motor vehicle chassis with an unused (new) tank. For the definition of tank, see §178.345&hyph;1(c), §178.337&hyph;1, or §178.338&hyph;1 of this subchapter, as applicable. * * * * * 31. In §180.405, paragraph (h) is revised to read as follows: §180.405 Qualification of cargo tanks. * * * * * (h) Pressure relief system. Properly functioning reclosing pressure relief valves and frangible or fusible vents need not be replaced. However, replacement of reclosing pressure relief valves on MC-specification cargo tanks is authorized subject to the following requirements: (1) Until August 31, 1998, the owner of a cargo tank may replace a reclosing pressure relief device with a device which is in compliance with the requirements for pressure relief devices in effect at the time the cargo tank specification became superseded. If the pressure relief device is installed as an integral part of a manhole cover assembly, the manhole cover must comply with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. (2) After August 31, 1998, replacement for any reclosing pressure relief valve must be capable of reseating to a leak-tight condition after a pressure surge, and the volume of lading released may not exceed one liter. Specific performance requirements for these pressure relief valves are set forth in §178.345&hyph;10(b)(3) of this subchapter.
