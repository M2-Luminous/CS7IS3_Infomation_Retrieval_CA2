The date of the seminar is not given. The seminar, which is moderated by AL-JUMHURIYAH Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, hosts Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, several Health Ministry officials, and a number of specialist physicians. The moderator opens the seminar by stating that the Ministry of Health has become the subject of criticism, as people have continued to air their grievances regarding the health services rendered to citizens. He adds that some of these grievances are justified, while others lack accuracy. He acknowledges that there are some loopholes that need to be plugged, and that some individual practices need to be corrected. He maintains that those voicing criticism have forgotten that Iraq is subjected to a medicine embargo that is denying Iraq free access to medical requirements. He then invites the AL-JUMHURIYAH press team to ask their questions and voice their remarks regarding the health situation in the country. One reporter complains of uncleanliness and malnutrition in state-owned hospitals. Another reporter notes the scarcity of children vaccines and medicine shortages at these hospitals. He adds that some medical employees are asking for, and obtaining bribes. He also notes the deterioration in the performance of some high tech medical equipment. Furthermore, he charges that private medical institutions are charging high prices. To corroborate their arguments, reporters cite grievances contained in letters received by the paper. Respsonding to these grievances, Dr. Shawqi Murqus, senior under secretary of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, pays tribute to the Iraqi medical institutions and personnel for protecting Iraq against epidemics in war conditions. Had it not been for the conscientiousness, honesty, and personal integrity of Iraqi medical personnel, epidemics would have spread in Iraq in the aftermath of the Gulf war, Dr. Murqus adds. Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 14 March continues to report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation in Iraq. It publishes on page seven an approximately 4,500-word report on the seminar prepared by Nu'man Sirt and Asma' Muhammad Mustafa. In this report, Dr. Murqus notes the "criminal economic embargo" clamped on Iraq, and its repercussions on the health situation in the country. To show how difficult it is for the Iraqi Ministry of Health to purchase medicines, he cites Britain's "inhumanity", as illustrated by its failure to authorize the shipment to Iraq of medicines for angina pectoris, although Iraq had concluded agreements in this regard with British medicine manufacturers. Dr. Murqus adds: "The British Government has banned the shipment of Angised, a product of Bruce Wellcome, although the British manufacturer had received the cost of the purchases, which totaled $150,000. The British are well aware that this medicine is used by angina pectoris victims, and that the failure to supply patients with it could lead to death." When pressed further, citing Iraq's need for this medicine, the British Government replied that the medicine in question contains small granules of a material called glyceryl trinitrate, and contended that trinitrate is used in the production of explosives. With regard to the services the Iraqi Ministry of Health is rendering to the population, Dr. Murqus says: "The Ministry of Health provides 250,000 patients suffering from chronic illnesses with the necessary medicines throughout the year, without interruption. A one-month or two-month interruption in the supplies of these medicines means inevitable death. These medicines are dispensed to patients through government outlets, namely, popular clinics." Dr. Murqus adds that the ability to provide these patients with medicines throughout the year since the enforcement of the UN sanctions is a "great accomplishment." The Health Ministry official admits that some ministry medicines are sold on the black market. Nevertheless, he claims that Iraqi physicians are conscientious and creative, and that they are conducting sophisticated brain and heart surgery under the tough embargo circumstances. He also commends the efforts made by Iraqi preventive medicine personnel, who have protected Iraq from malaria and cholera. He says that cholera surfaced in the country in 1991 only to disappear in 1992. He also notes the services offered by the private medical institutions in the country, and admits that they charge high prices to patients. He expresses hope that the medical system in Iraq will be refurbished and developed once the embargo is lifted. Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on 21 March continues to report on the seminar held by the paper on the health situation in the country. It publishes on page 7 an approximately 4,000-word report on the seminar. Dr. Murqus comments on remarks made by the reporters regarding the need for a police report before accident victims are admitted to hospital. The moderator cites examples of doctors in state-owned health clinics prescribing medicines without examining patients, underscoring the seriousness of the problem. A Health Ministry official replies by saying that there will be stricter monitoring of medical practice. The moderator argues that the media should assist health institutions by monitoring the health situation in the country, enlightening citizens, and reporting problems and grievances. Concluding the seminar, the moderator says that AL-JUMHURIYAH is ready to dedicate a weekly column to clarifications from the Ministry of Health in order to help the ministry enlighten people and clarify some matters which might have been misunderstood by the public. This appears to be the final report on the seminar, as the paper's 21 March edition does not promise any further reportage. Jordan Bureau does not plan any further processing of the Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH.
