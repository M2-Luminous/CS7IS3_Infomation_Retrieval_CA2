During the session, a few reports were heard and five draft decrees presented by the minister of interior and national security. [passage omitted] The government postponed the examination of the drafts until the next meeting when additional information will be provided. Before rounding up the session, the government made the following clarification: For some time now, groups of demonstrators have decided to systematically sequester cabinet members and senior state officials and have been making (?threatening) statements. The government is aware of the miserable conditions in which the Central African people are living. It is a well-known fact that this situation was inherited from the defunct regime. As everyone knows, the new government is consistently trying to gradually put an end to the pains inflicted by that regime and then to put the country back onto the path to development and social welfare. For this reason, the government maintains that it will not yield to any blackmail or any kind of threat. There are legal procedures that each citizen must follow to exercise his right to make demands, instead of resorting to anarchy. The government once again pledges its openness to dialogue. It however reminds those who prefer violence and blackmail that Ordinance No. 81/027 of 22 May 1981, which punishes acts of violence and vandalism perpetrated by groups, is still in force.
