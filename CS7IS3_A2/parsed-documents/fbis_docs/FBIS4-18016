It Turns Out That Moscow's Services Are Not Needed in Azerbaijan at the Moment"] [Text] Baku -- Deputies were plunged into shock by Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov's speech at the National Assembly on the Russian plan for settling the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The draft peace agreement contains at least 18 articles which are unacceptable to Azerbaijan. First, it is proposed that Baku completely renounce the right to monitor the military potential of the former autonomous republic and recognize the existence of the "armed forces of Nagorno-Karabakh." It is proposed to give Azerbaijan's Lechinskiy Rayon the status of a "corridor" under the full control of the Armenian side, that is, to enshrine de jure what has already existed de facto for two years now. According to the plan the city of Shusha -- the historical and cultural center of Nagorno-Karabakh -- remains under Armenian control. The Armenian forces are to vacate the remaining occupied territories but without monitoring by international observers. According to the plan which has been proposed, Azerbaijan is to lift the blockade on all communication routes leading into Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh even while the negotiation process is going on. But Russia is proposing that the main question -- on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the cause of the six years of bloody war between Armenia and Azerbaijan -- be resolved this way: When the peace agreement is concluded so-called international guarantees of the special ownership of this region will be given, as happened in the case of Cyprus, Nakhichevan, and the state of Kashmir. The Azerbaijan Foreign Minister called the present settlement plan a plan designed to preserve the conflict because if the military potential of Nagorno-Karabakh is maintained there is no guarantee that hostilities will not resume. National Assembly deputies were far harsher in their comments: This is the capitulation of Azerbaijan. In this regard opposition deputies and those deputies loyal to the authorities achieved a rare unanimity: The Russian plan is not even worthy of discussion and amendment. They instructed Gasan Gasanov to prepare an alternative draft, which is to be presented to Russia and Armenia. Meanwhile, anti-Russian feelings have increased sharply in Azerbaijan. Various parties have made a succession of statements to the effect that they will take up arms against the Russian Army if the latter is brought into Azerbaijan even in the capacity of peacemakers. And the Islamic Party has flatly stated that it will declare a jihad (holy war) against the Russian authorities.
