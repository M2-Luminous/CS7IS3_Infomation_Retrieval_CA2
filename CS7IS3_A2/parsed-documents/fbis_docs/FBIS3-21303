In a press conference held yesterday in the city of Surt, al-Muntasir asked the United States, France, and Britain to help his country put an end to the Lockerbie crisis, as the result of the "severe harm" done to its economy. He expressed his consent to a trial of the suspects in the Lockerbie case, 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi and al-Amin Khalifah Fuhaymah, by Scottish judges in any third country (other than the United Kingdom or United States) agreeable to the three countries. He accused the American administration of playing the role of bully in the Security Council. He said that it was putting pressure on all the countries, including France, and not even sparing Dr. Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations. He added that his country had adopted an Egyptian proposal last November that demanded the handing over of the suspects to France through the Arab-Maghreb Union, adding that France had rejected this proposal due to American pressure. "It is not just," he said, "for the Americans to reject our efforts to find a solution." He renewed his refusal to turn over the suspects to the United States or Britain, because they would then "not be able to defend themselves." He said that, if the accused were to surrender themselves voluntarily to these countries, "all they would have to do is to give their names, for them to be found guilty." Al-Muntasir called on Germany and Italy to help Libya in its efforts to find a solution that "respects Libyan sovereignty," given that Germany is a "partner" in the Lockerbie case, as the flight of the Pan American aircraft that blew up over Scotland had begun in Frankfort. Al-Muntasir accused Arab governments of failing to achieve reconciliation, and demanded that their peoples find a way to conciliate, especially as "these governments wasted a basic opportunity to develop" when the price of a barrel of oil was $40. He disclosed that his country is in the process of again reviewing its political relations with the countries of the world, "in line with [Libya's] interests and those of the Arab countries." He said that the peace talks in the Middle East were nothing but "surrender solutions." He said, "We are awaiting the outcome of the contacts of Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid regarding his initiative on [Arab] reconciliation." Addressing President Bill Clinton's threat, two weeks ago, to issue a resolution preventing Libya from exporting its oil, he said, "We are dealing with a bully, and we must face facts. We have a vicious enemy who can do that. But Libya is prepared to live without its oil."
