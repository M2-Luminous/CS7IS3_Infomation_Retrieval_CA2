FR941121-0-00086 FR941121-0-00009 VI. Regulatory Impact Statement Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to be small entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. This final rule provides the Medicare HMO or CMP enrollee with the same administrative review rights and financial protections as are available to beneficiaries in the fee-for-service system. To the extent that current Medicare membership in HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to which this rule will apply is low (approximately 7 percent of the total Medicare population), we do not expect any significant increased costs or savings as a result of this final rule. We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
