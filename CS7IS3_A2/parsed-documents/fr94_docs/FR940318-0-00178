FR940318-0-00178 FR940318-0-00023 Halocarbons represent only a portion of agents available for fire protection, and in fact appear to be a decreasing portion as users more and more are choosing to install ``alternative'' systems. Water, carbon dioxide, foam, and dry chemical are already in widespread use as fire extinguishants and may capture some of the former halon market. Water mist, powdered aerosols and inert gases are new technologies that are also likely to claim part of the former halon market. EPA encourages users to assess their risk management schemes and, where possible, to minimize reliance on chemical agents. Nonchemical alternatives should be seriously evaluated to determine whether they afford the necessary level of protection in any given application. In assessing toxicity of a halocarbon, EPA pays special attention to consumer and worker exposure to discharges during fire emergencies and accidental discharges. In these acute, episodic exposures to the halon substitutes, cardiac sensitization is of particular interest. The term cardiac sensitization refers to an increased susceptibility of the heart to adrenaline (or other catecholamines) which may result in potentially fatal heart arrhythmias. Several studies involving human exposure in a laboratory setting establish the potential significance for human health of animal data on cardiac sensitization. Evaluating the safety of potential halon substitutes requires the measurement of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) of cardiac sensitization in an appropriate species, usually the dog. EPA uses the NOAEL value as the basis to ensure protection of the worker population. The protocols used to determine the cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL concentrations for each agent are conservative. The cardiotoxicity effect levels are measured in animals that have been made more sensitive to these effects by the administration of epinephrine concentrations which are just below the concentrations at which epinephrine alone causes cardiotoxicity. The concentration of epinephrine required to cause this heightened sensitivity is approximately ten times greater than the concentration a human being would be likely to secrete under stress. The determination of the safety of either a flooding or streaming agent substitute is also dependent on a number of other related factors. For total flood systems, the magnitude of exposure will depend on the design concentration of the flooding agent (as determined by the substitute's extinguishing concentration plus 20 percent, as specified by NFPA guidelines) and the length of time it takes a person to evacuate the area in which the agent is released. In assessing exposure and consequent use conditions, the design concentration of a total flood substitute is compared to its cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL levels. Generally, if the design concentration is higher than the agent's LOAEL level, then the agent is not suitable for use in normally occupied areas. EPA is adopting the OSHA standard (29 CFR 1910, subpart L) section 1910.162, which limits the exposure to an agent based upon the length of time it takes to evacuate an area. In addition, EPA makes note that OSHA standard 1910.160 also applies to gaseous total flood systems. In addition, EPA recognizes that agents should not be used at a concentration that significantly displaces oxygen in the lungs. Most of the CFC and halon substitutes are gaseous, heavier-than-air compounds, which following a leak or catastrophic emission may tend to pool near the ground, i.e. in the breathing zone. Since these agents are, in the main, colorless with minimal odor and little toxicity or irritant effect, they can lead to asphyxiation by oxygen displacement if the unwary inadvertently walk into an area of oxygen depletion. The designer of a total flood system should be particularly alert to this possibility during discharge and subsequent dispersion of the agent in the space. For compounds which do not elicit a cardiotoxic effect until very high concentrations have been reached, care should be taken that sufficient oxygen remains in the room so that asphyxiation will not occur. In contrast to total flooding agents, exposure to substitute streaming agents can be expected to vary greatly depending on the amount of agent released, the time needed to extinguish a fire, the size of the room or enclosure in which a fire occurs, the size of the fire, the proximity of the person to the point of discharge of the agent, the rate at which fresh air infiltrates the space, and the air exchange rate near the fire. Assessment of exposure in streaming applications is much more complicated. EPA employs the `box model' to assess consumer exposure, which has been widely used for many years to estimate probable exposures of workers to hazardous airborne materials, and has been described in detail by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and is discussed in detail in the background documents. The box model takes into consideration assumptions on volume of the space in which the extinguishant is used, rate at which fresh air infiltrates the space, amount and rate of agent release, area of the fire, location of the worker, and the air exchange rate in the vicinity of the fire. Values obtained through the box model, compared to cardiotoxic NOAEL/LOAEL values, provide a screen for assessing risk. However, EPA has found that the model often overstates the actual exposure to an agent, and therefore, EPA requires personal monitoring tests be conducted in actual use scenarios in order to complete the assessment.
