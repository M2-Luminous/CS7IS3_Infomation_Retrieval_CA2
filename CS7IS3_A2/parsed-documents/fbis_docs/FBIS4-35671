Most of the government's current and general expenses have been reduced compared to the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. The defense budget was the only section whose increase the Majles did not oppose, increasing it by $850 million to $1.4 billion while decreasing food subsidies from $1.2 billion to $800 million. The first effect of the approved budget came before the beginning of the new year. The "Railroad of the Islamic Republic" increased by 30 to 50 percent ticket prices for various passenger trains during the New Year's holidays on the pretext of the "cutoff in government aid and subsidies." Then in the first days of the new year it announced that the new ticket prices would be permanent.
