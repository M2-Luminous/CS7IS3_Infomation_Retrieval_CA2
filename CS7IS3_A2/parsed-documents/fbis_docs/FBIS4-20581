So, the effects of the additives m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] and t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which was partially stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] addition and stabilized by 12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] addition on mechanical properties of Ti(C,N)- TiB[.sub]2[/]-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics were made clear firstly. As the result, it was found that 40% addition of m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] to Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/] system could increase a fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] from 3.2 to 7.5 MPam[.sup]1/2[/], also addition of t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] which were stabilized by 2mol%Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and 12mol%CeO[.sub]2[/] could increase the fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] from 2.3 to 4.5 and to 4 MPa[.sup]1/2[/], respectively. Next, it was investigated how the amount of m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] affects the mechanical properties of Ti(C,N)-TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO ceramics. As the results, Ti(C,N)- TiB[.sub]2[/]-m-ZrO[.sub]2[/] ceramics containing over 30wt% m- ZrO[.sub]2[/] have higher fracture toughness than 6 MPam[.sup]1/2[/]. It is thought that a high fracture toughness K[.sub]IC[/] caused from t in phase transformation and difference of thermal expansion between ZrO[.sub]2[/] and the matrix of TiB[.sub]2[/] and Ti(C,N).
