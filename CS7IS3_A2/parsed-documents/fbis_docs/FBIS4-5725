The project was undertaken in August 1990 and completed in November 1992 by Hyundai Construction Co. and Chongwoo Construction Co. In the process, Chongwoo President Cho Ki-hyon embezzled part of the payment, prompting the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) to charge that some of the embezzled money may have flowed into the political sector. The DP has formed its own investigative team, led by Rep. Chong Tae-chol who first "exposed" the irregularities. It found that Cho embezzled 22.7 billion won out of the total payment of 65.8 billion won. The DP claims that part of the 22.7 billion won may have been used as political funds by the ruling Democratic Liberal Party during the 1992 presidential campaign. The problem would be simpler if it ended there. But suspicions began to snowball when Cho told the prosecution that he had donated 8 billion won out of the embezzled money to Tonghwa Temple in Taegu and another 4.5 billion won in the form of various contributions to the Chogye Buddhist order. Although the opposition party could not substantiate its claim that part of Cho's donations had seeped into the political sector, it wants to invoke parliament's right to probe the uses of the slush fund. Rep. Chong claimed that out of the 22.7 billion won, Cho had spent only 2 billion won on purchasing a villa. There is a strong possibility, he said, that the rest of the money may have gone to "officials of the present administration as well as those from former President No Tae-u's government." The DP is pointing the finger at one ruling party official, a former Army chief of staff, a former director of the Agency for National Security Planning and the chief of the Presidential Security Service as the men who channelled the money into political funds. The DP has even identified the men by supplying the initials of their last names. In addition, the opposition party claims that during the 1992 presidential campaign, ruling party campaigners visited major Buddhist temples around the country and "handed envelopes stuffed with millions of won" at prayer meetings of a highly political nature. The suspicions have doubled since the Rev. Mukong, chief monk of Tonghwa Temple, said he had not received a penny from Cho, who told authorities he had donated 8 billion won to the temple to build a huge image of Buddha. As a result, the DP believes that most of Cho's embezzled money may have gone to the political circle through officials of the Agency for National Security Planning or then-Army chief of staff Gen. Yi Chin-sam, who was reported Wednesday to have suddenly left the country for the United States last Friday. Alternatively, the money could have been used as bribes by Cho, the DP said. This is what the opposition party wants to find out if the National Assembly invokes its investigation right. It says the initial results of the probe by the prosecution are insufficient and suspicious points remain. The DP also wants to determine the relationship between Cho and the Chogye Buddhist order, whether the order's chief executive, the Rev. So Ui-hyon, was involved in the possible scandal and how Chongwoo Construction Co., which was but a small builder, received a share of the project. The Democratic Liberal Party, however, describes the DP's charge as "a vague suspicion" and says the opposition party only wants to use "the unsubstantiated theory" as a weapon in its political offensive against the ruling party. Yet the DLP is not opposed to a National Assembly investigation into the allegation. "Let us uncover what we can if there is indeed anything," it says. Both the presidential office and the DLP have already pointed out that the Sangmudae project was carried out by the No administration and that Chongwadae has received none of the alleged 8 billion won.
