"As far as military deployment in the former Yugoslavia is concerned, we Germans are the worst advisers," Kinkel told the Erfurt THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE (Wednesday edition). One should await tomorrow's NATO session. Kinkel also appealed to the Social Democratic Party to give up its opposition to changing the Basic Law on the issue of out-of-area deployment of the Bundeswehr. Otherwise, he feared, "Germany would be harmed if we have to carry on behaving as we do now in such crises."
