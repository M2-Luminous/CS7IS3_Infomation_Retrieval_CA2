Potential trouble-makers may have been discouraged by what witnesses said was an extremely heavy security presence throughout the city. "Security in Medan appears to be under control (but) many laborers are still refusing to return to work," said Alamsyah Hamdani, a lawyer for the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid Institute (LBH). Hamdani, speaking by telephone from Medan, said his office had received reports that hundreds of workers were still refusing to return to work and had gathered outside their factory in nearby Binjai town despite efforts by local security personnel to disperse them. He said many workers at the Industrial Zone of Medan, north of the city, had also refused to work, idling their factories. "It seems like most of the factories there have not reopen@d yet," Hamdani said. Another LBH lawyer, Hasbi Ansori, said strikes were also continuing to the east of Medan in Tanjung Morawa town, although shops were reopening under tight security after violent protests there Tuesday. Witnesses said the strikes outside Medan did not appear to have an anti-Chinese element, and were aimed only at backing continued demands for better pay and working conditions [word indistinct] right to organize independent trade unions. In Medan, a retailer confirmed that many shopping centers, independent shops and supermarkets in the downtown area had reopened under tight security after hurriedly closing down Tuesday when a mob looted a major shopping mall owned by a prominent ethnic-Chinese businessman, Tanoto Sukanto. Hamdani said that there had been several other incidents Tuesday besides the attack on Sukanto's downtown Thamrin Plaza, which involved between 1,000 and 2,000 people armed with machetes, iron picks and other weapons. Witnesses said the riot was contained only after security forces sealed off the area. Other shops and offices throughout the area closed. Medan had just quieted down from anti-Chinese riots which followed a mass workers' demonstrations Thursday and Friday and degenerated into violence, leaving one ethnic Chinese businessman dead and scores of Chinese-owned businesses sacked. There is widespread resentment in parts of Indonesia against the country's wealthy ethnic Chinese minority, which constitutes only three percent of the population but controls a disproportionate share of economic activity. Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's mass protest alleged that ethnic Chinese were accumulating wealth to the detriment of other Indonesians, and were still in circulation, witnesses said.
