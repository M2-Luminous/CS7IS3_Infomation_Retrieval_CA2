The statement was made by Defense Minister Fabbio Fabbri, who was speaking about the latest developments in the Bosnian situation. Fabbri stressed that, with UN authorization, air strikes could be directed against the main sources of fire and provide adequate air cover for the peacekeeping forces. The problem which so dramatically confronts our consciences, Fabbri said, is whether it is possible to stop the massacres in Sarajevo.
