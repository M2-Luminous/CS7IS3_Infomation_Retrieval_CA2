Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and secretary general, and responsible comrades of provincial-level departments concerned joined in the inspection tour. Yue Qifeng and his entourage successively traveled to (Lang) Township, and (Guyingzi) and (Nanxia) Districts in Tieli city to inspect more than 10 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, joint-investment enterprises, township enterprises, individual, and private enterprises, visited (Ma Yongshun), a model worker on the forestry front, and (Chen Tongzhi), an outstanding paddy rice grower. In every place they visited, leading comrades of the provincial party committee extensively contacted with cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, and asked in detail about their situations in various aspects, such as production, operation, and living. During his inspection, Comrade Yue Qifeng gave some important views. Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, we have greatly emancipated our minds indeed. However, we must never overestimate this point. Northeast China is the first region that entered the planned economic front but the last one to leave it. At present, it is still in a state of retreating from this front. Many departments, enterprises, and units have still held fast to the planned economic front, and the traditional concepts left over by the planned economy still can be seen everywhere. Therefore, emancipating the mind has remained our major task at present and for some time to come. Only when our minds are emancipated, can we further deepen reform, expand opening up, give full play to the wisdom and ability of the people, and change the advantages of resources into commodity and economic advantages. First of all, leading cadres at all levels should emancipate their minds and so do the masses of people. It is necessary to act in line with the ideology and work realities, combine the emancipation of minds with the specific issues in economic construction, and grasp them conscientiously and firmly. If we do a good job in emancipating the minds, our pace to advance will be rapid and even [words indistinct]. Yue Qifeng pointed out: Heilongjiang is an important industrial base of the state. For a long time, it has made great contributions and sacrifices to the country's socialist construction. At present, to readjust the production set-up, it is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of the state. We must rely on our own efforts. We should regard reform of the property right system as a nucleus and expand the enterprise reform strength. In the past, enterprises used to clasp state-owned enterprises which were considered as the trump cards. Actually, this is the sign of a big common bowl. We should be determined to conduct reform of the property right system in small state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises and lease out or sell what should be leased or sold. We should not continue to sit at home eating away our resources. Yue Qifeng repeatedly stressed the necessity of grasping enterprise management. He said: One of the major reasons for enterprise deficits is lax management and discipline, having no person to assume responsibility, and thus resulting in low economic efficiency. Grasping management needs no investment. But, we must [words indistinct]. Therefore, enterprises should conduct activities on training internal skills, grasping management, tapping potential, and increasing efficiency, raise the management level, and enhance economic returns. Yue Qifeng said: While attending to state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, we should exert efforts to grasp township enterprises, high and new technology industries, tertiary industry, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, neighborhood collective enterprises, and individual and private enterprises in an effort to cultivate new economic growing points. These new economic points need very little investment but have very rapid development rates and can yield economic returns within a short time. At present, we should give a free hand in the development of individual and private economic units. In short, we should develop all types of enterprises and actively support those who can be developed rapidly. Yue Qifeng said: I have traveled to the forestry area to have a look of it and discovered that it is really rich in natural resources and has treasures everywhere. It is necessary to enhance the concept of market and the sense of commodity, protect, cultivate, and develop the natural resources, and transform the resources advantages into commodity and economic advantages. Yue Qifeng fully affirmed the achievements of (Nanxia) District in developing small-scale processing of wood products and pointed out: In this processing work, we may develop many varieties. This work has great prospects. It is necessary to give the people a free hand in running this business and let all households do it. The government should do a good job in market construction and service. As long as we change our minds, we will not lead a poor life when there is a gold mountain nearby. During investigation and study, Yue Qifeng emphatically pointed out on several occasions: We should try by all possible means to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of cadres. He said: When the people are eager to do a thing, they can even move Thai Shan and when the people are not happy and not eager to do it, nothing can be accomplished. Our cadres should strive to make the places where they serve as officials prosperous. This is the full expression of ability of political integrity of cadres. To evaluate cadres, we must pay attention to the achievements in their career and not to any relations. In the course of building the socialist market economic system, as long as we strengthen party building and mobilize the positive factors of all sectors, all difficulties facing us will surely be overcome, and the economic invigoration of Heilongjiang will surely reappear under the socialist market economic conditions.
