Sumi Fujita of the Japanese Communist Party presented to the government a report which said that Zenno (the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Associations) failed to properly return to farmers its profits from sales of such rice. Zenno is entrusted by the government to market non-table use rice. It buys the rice from growers at prices about 40 percent lower than those the government pays them. Fujita said in the report that Zenno spent 28,627 million yen during the eight years from 1984 through 1991 as "costs for boosting demand" and "collection expenses." She said these expenditures are "beyond a level the food agency permits, and should be returned to farmers as sales profits." She also accused the government of neglecting to oversee Zenno's accounting. Admitting that it has not monitored the transport and management costs involved in Zenno's sales activities, the food agency said it will investigate the accusation. Zenno said, meanwhile, the problem has already been resolved and defended its accounting as being appropriate. After a similar complaint made by Fujita in February last year, Zenno was eventually prompted to return 4,281 million yen to farmers.
