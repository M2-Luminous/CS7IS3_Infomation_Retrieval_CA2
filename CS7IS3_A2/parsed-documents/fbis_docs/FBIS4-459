The Renamo leader said he had discussed the matter with President Joaquim Chissano this morning. The two men discussed the peace process, among other things. Dhlakama backed the idea, saying that so far not even a quarter of the men have been trained yet because there are neither good conditions in training camps nor financing. Dhlakama said that countries like Italy had offered to make available instructors, military equipment, and financing, as well as to rehabilitate the training camps, but approval of the idea will depend on the technical proposals to be advanced by government and Renamo generals.
