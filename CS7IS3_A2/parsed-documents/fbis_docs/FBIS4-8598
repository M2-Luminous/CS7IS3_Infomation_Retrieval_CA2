Serb soldiers ordered 30 French troops guarding weapons at Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, to hand over the weapons, said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The arms were placed under UN control following a February 9 accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the capital Sarajevo, in line with a UN and NATO ultimatum. A UN spokesman said a high-ranking UNPROFOR official had telephoned the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale after the encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200 GMT). The tank -- whose presence marked a violation of the exclusion zone -- later withdrew into surrounding woodland but a "tense" stand-off continued, the spokesman said. In Brussels, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation reaffirmed the alliance's determination to enforce the heavy arms exclusion zone. "NATO's mandate to conduct air strikes -- in close coordination with the UN secretary general and upon request of the UN -- on any uncontrolled weapons in a 20 km exclusion zone around Sarajevo, is still in force. "Close air support to UNPROFOR troops in danger can be provided if requested by UNPROFOR commanders and approved by UN special representative Mr. (Yasushi) Akashi," the statement added. Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the Krivoglavci site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their command post in the Serb-held Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica, after it had been contacted by UNPROFOR. Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde, Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.
