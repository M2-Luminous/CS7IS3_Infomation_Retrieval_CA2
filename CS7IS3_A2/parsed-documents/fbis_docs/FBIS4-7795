[passage omitted] They have all been remanded in custody. For several months during 1992 and 1993, the group took part in military training in the village of (Ljabinot Fus), near Elbasan [in Albania], organized by the Tirana office of the self-proclaimed "government" of the phantom "Republic of Kosovo." Albanian Army officers organized military training for the arrested group, in addition to a large number of other persons of the Albanian national minority from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. They were trained how to handle all sorts of infantry weapons, armored vehicles, tanks, explosive devices, and how to carry out sabotage actions. Having completed their training, these future members of the paramilitary formations of the Albanian separatist movement in Kosovo signed declarations saying they would, immediately upon receiving call-ups and after the break up of armed clashes between ethnic-Albanians and Serbs, report to the barracks where they were trained. According to a statement by the deputy district public prosecutor in Pristina, Jovica Jovanovic, representatives of an "office" of the self-styled "Republic of Kosovo" in Tirana, Ali Alija, Mehmet Kraja, and Zumber Berisa, mediated the sending of this group to be trained in Albania. They subsequently visited them in the training center and instructed them on the goals of these activities. One of the arrested, Nedzmedin Sadriju, completed his intelligence training which is being carried out in the Albanian center of Ljac. Our bodies of prosecution, Prosecutor Jovanovic says, are in possession of indisputable details about several dozen ethnic-Albanians from Kosovo and Metohija who completed military training in Albania. A group of eight people who were arrested and sentenced in mid-1992, after completing their military training in the village of Surela near Tirana, smuggled into Kosovo and Metohija 74 automatic rifles with 14,000 bullets and a large quantity of military equipment.
