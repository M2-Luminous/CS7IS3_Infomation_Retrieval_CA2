T. Sarkisyan, president of Armenian National Academy of Sciences, by Z. Arevshatyan: "Academy of Sciences 50 Years Old"] [Text] "The most urgent cultural-historical task of the Armenian Academy is raising the self-awareness of the Armenian people . . . developing in them a conscious love for their homeland, language, and culture and strengthening their faith in a bright future. The Academy should be an object of pride for our people. It should become the acme of our culture," said Avetik Isaakyan at a ceremonial gathering dedicated to the inauguration of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR. Since then, 50 years have passed, and during these spring days we are marking the half-century anniversary of what is now the Armenian National Academy of Sciences [NAN]. The history of its creation, the people thanks to whose scientific activity Armenia today is and always will take a place of honor in the world of science not only of the former USSR but of the world, and also the present day of the NAN will be the subject of our conversation with its president, Fadey Tachatovich Sarkisyan. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] An anniversary is always an occasion for remembering the founders once again, for looking back on the past from the standpoint of that constructive charge that it nonetheless bore, thanks to vivid, outstanding individuals. [Sarkisyan] To be precise, our reckoning should begin with 1935, when at the initiative of the USSR Academy of Sciences, a branch of it was created in Yerevan, headed by the famous geologist and scholar, Academician F. Yu. Levinson-Lesing. In 1938, the outstanding academician Iosif Orbeli took over the leadership of this scientific institution. Its obvious successes and the high level of its scientific personnel made it obvious that an independent academy of sciences should be created in Armenia. In November 1943, a founding council of 23 academicians was approved. Here are the names of these outstanding scholars: Manuk Abegyan (literary criticism), Abraam Alikhanyan (physics), Artem Alikhanyan (physics), Pachiya Acharyan (linguistics), Vardan Gulkanyan (genetics), Ivan Yegiazarov (hydroenergy), Mikayel Tumanyan (agriculture), Avetik Isaakyan (literature), Saak Karapetyan (physiology), Khachatur Koshtoyants (physiology), Aleksandr Akopyan (thermodynamics), Viktor Ambartsumyan (astrophysics), Levon Ovanisyan (medicine), Gongor Kapandzhyan (linguistics), Stepan Malkhasyan (philology), Akop Manandyan (history), Konstantin Paffengolts (geology), Arsin Terteryan (literary criticism), Iosif Orbeli [illegible], Levon Orbeli (physiology). Iosif Orbeli was elected the first president of our academy; the vice-presidents were Viktor Ambartsumyan and Vardan Gulkanyan. During the difficult days of the war, specifically on 29 November 1943, the ceremonial opening of the Armenian Academy of Sciences was held. The year 1947 also became a notable landmark in the history of our academy, when it was newly headed up by and in the course of 46 years had as its constant president Viktor Ambartsumyan. Under his leadership the Armenian Academy of Sciences was formed, following a fruitful scientific path of development and receiving world recognition in several spheres of science. Today Viktor Amazaspovich, as NAN's honorary president, is taking an active part in the Academy's activities. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] So, in the first year of the academy's creation, its 23 members decided the basic path of its development. And since at an anniversary you are supposed to sum up specific results, what scientific potential does the NAN possess today in figures? [Sarkisyan] Over the last 50 years, the Academy has held 19 elections and elected a total of 103 active members and 161 corresponding members of the Academy, as well as 13 honorary and 24 foreign members of the Academy. At present the NAN has 38 active, 63 corresponding, 10 honorary, and 19 foreign members. Of our 2685 scientific associates, 302 are doctors of science and 1385 are candidates of science. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Every era has its own demands: literally two years ago the issue was raised about the need to reorganize the academy, its structure and activities. Was an optimal solution found? After all, it is no secret that because of the uncertainty of these issues, as well as the difficult social and economic situation, which does not allow for full-fledged professional activity, the republic's scientific potential is decreasing. [Sarkisyan] Actually, there have been many disputes and discussions, and acceptable and unacceptable proposals have been advanced on this subject. And this has happened because under the new conditions, which have posed the Academy with the necessity to refurbish its approach to many branches of knowledge, the Academy's new status has not been approved. [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] The president's edict of 9 March 1993, "On the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia," changed the status of the Academy and the attitude toward it in a fundamental way, thereby preparing a basis for the further development of our country's science. In accordance with the edict, the Academy was renamed the RA [Republic of Armenia] National Academy of Sciences , which, in the first place, distinguishes it in principle from other academies that have opened lately in Armenia. In the second place, the Academy's role and importance have grown significantly: it is now an advisor to the leading organs of the republic, and its recommendations must be considered by the government, with the issue of specific decisions. On 2 May of this year, the RA government approved the new NAN charter, which was passed recently at its general assembly. In it the provisions guaranteeing the monolithic nature of the academic structure, specifying the mechanisms for financing scientific work, and significantly raising and specifying the roles and tasks of the NAN in our complex age were reinforced.
