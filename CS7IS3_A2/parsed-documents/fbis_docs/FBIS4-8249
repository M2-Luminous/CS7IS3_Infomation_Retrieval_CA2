One of the documents refers to debt settlement and is being drafted by financial experts of the two countries, the second regulates payments between the two countries in the national currencies. There are also several other documents on cooperation in nuclear power engineering, in conventional power engineering, in agriculture and health care. Ambassador Avdeyev informed journalists of joint projects he discussed during his three-day visit to Varna: on Russian investment in tourism, on a Bulgarian-Russian ferryboat link and on restoring direct contacts between enterprises of the two countries.
