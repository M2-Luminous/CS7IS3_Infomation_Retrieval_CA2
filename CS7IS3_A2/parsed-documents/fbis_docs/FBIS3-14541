In an editorial today, the newspaper expresses confidence that Iraq, since it is a heavyweight, will be the decisive factor in the balance between supply and demand in the oil markets in a manner that preserves the rights of the exporting countries. The paper focused on the contacts several oil companies and establishments are making with Iraq. It said the ghost of the resumption of Iraqi oil exports is haunting some agent OPEC member states which placed the wealth of their peoples at the service of the imperialist and Zionist circles to prevent the organization from reaching an agreement that secures the interests of its members. It said the objective of the aggression against Iraq was clear from the beginning when the imperialist circles tried to control oil sources and tighten the siege on Iraq. It added that the aggression did not stop, but expanded to include all oil-exporting countries with the aim of preventing them from utilizing their resources in building their development capabilities and improving their economic and social conditions. The newspaper emphasized that the only way to stop aggression against oil states is through fixing a production ceiling by which all OPEC member states abide in order to secure the rights of exporting nations and find the means that secure growth and prosperity for these nations. The newspaper criticized the OPEC ministerial committee's decision to maintain the current output ceiling. It said this decision will seriously harm those who adopted it, and is viewed as serving the interests of imperialism, whose prosperity and might have been realized at the expense of the struggling and developing nations.
