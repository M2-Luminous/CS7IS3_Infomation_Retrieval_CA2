FR941013-1-00058 FR941013-1-00010 4. Surface Impoundment Standards The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing surface impoundments and new surface impoundments. These requirements would not apply to either: a surface impoundment in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; a surface impoundment in which biological treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain conditions specified in the rule; or a surface impoundment designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. For each surface impoundment required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use either: a cover that is connected to a closed-vent system vented to a control device; or a floating membrane cover that is designed and operated in accordance with requirements specified in the rule. 5. Container Standards The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing and new containers. These requirements would not apply to either: a container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons); a container in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; or a container designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. For containers used for storage, treatment, and handling of regulated material, the owner or operator would be required to use either: (1) a container that is equipped with a vapor leak-tight cover; (2) a container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.42 m3 (approximately 110 gallons) that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part 178; or (3) a container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar and that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to be organic HAP vapor tight in accordance with the procedure specified in the rule. For containers in which treatment of regulated material is performed, the owner or operator would be required to place the container inside an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device at all times that the container is completely or partially uncovered during the treatment operation. Transfer of regulated material by pumping into a container having a design capacity greater than 0.42 m3 would be required to be performed using submerged fill loading. 6. Process Vent Standards The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would regulate organic HAP emissions from process vents on enclosed treatment units. Under the proposed rule, an ``enclosed treatment unit'' would be defined as a stationary, enclosed unit used for the purpose of treating or processing a regulated material, and for which all materials only enter or exit the unit through enclosed pipes or process vents while the unit is operating. Examples of an enclosed treatment unit include a distillation pot, distillation column, thin-film evaporator, solvent extraction tower, steam stripping tower, and air stripping tower. The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing units and new units. These requirements would not apply to either: an enclosed treatment unit in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; or an enclosed treatment unit designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. For each enclosed treatment unit required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to connect each process vent on the unit to a closed-vent system vented to a control device.
