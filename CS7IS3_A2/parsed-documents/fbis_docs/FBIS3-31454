Doboj correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports on the situation in the 7-South Operative group operational zone, and says that "this morning the area of Tesanj came under attack, particularly (?Mrkovcici) and Sije. Despite the low temperatures, the Chetniks shelled the villages using tanks, [word indistinct], and 82-mm and 120-mm mortars. Everything implies that the enemy will continue the attacks during the day, particularly along the [word indistinct] communication Doboj-Teslic." Velid Djindo, the Olovo correspondent, reports that "this morning from 0530 [0430 GMT] to 0630, the districts on the southern access points of Olovo were again exposed to fierce howitzer fire. We still have no information on the consequences of the latest bombardment of civilian targets. As I am filing this report, just after 0900, enemy antiaircraft machine gun, antiaircraft gun, and small arms' fire can be heard along the southern parts of the front."
