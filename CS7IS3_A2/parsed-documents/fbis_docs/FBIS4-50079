Hao Fengyin, chairman of the National Research Center of Slurry Engineering and Technology, said that although China has been late in starting research in this field, it has developed its own set of technologies. Slurry, composed of 60-70 percent of coal, 30-40 percent of water, and some one percent of additives to keep the mixture stable and fluid, is believed to be a good substitute for fuel oil. The technology of slurry was born during the world oil crisis in the 1970s. The United States, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the Soviet Union invested large amounts of money and technical force in its research and development. The Chinese Government showed interest in exploiting and using slurry to supplant oil, which was falling short of demand, and listed slurry technology as one of the key projects for research in the three consecutive "five-year plans" starting from 1980. During 1985-90, China succeeded in completing research of slurry, developed a complete set of technologies and built demonstration projects and bases for experimenting with slurry preparation, pipeline transportation and industry-oriented combustion. Since 1990, the state has approved five energy-saving and environmentally sound projects using slurry instead of oil, bringing to a new stage the large-scale, streamlined industrial application of slurry technology. At present, six slurry preparation plants have been built in China, with their annual production capacity totaling one million tons. Specialized workshops can produce 500 to 2,000 tons of slurry additives, with only two-thirds, or even half, the cost of their foreign equivalents. Breakthroughs were also made in slurry combustion for industrial scale boilers and kilns and power plant boilers, slurry storage and transportation and research and development of specific equipment. Hao said China is developing second-generation slurry technology, including preparation of super-low ash slurry and intensified low- sulphur combustion, which has attracted the attention of foreign counterparts. It is estimated that by the end of this century, China's slurry production will replace 10 million tons of fuel oil and the capacity of pipeline transport will reach 30 million tons. Hao said this will not only help ease the congestion of rail transportation, but also greatly reduce the emission of ash and other pollutants into the atmosphere. China is rich in coal deposits as against oil resources, Hao said. Coal accounts for more than 75 percent of the country's consumption of primary sources of energy. "It is imperative to put the slurry technology into full play, so as to attract more clients, domestic and foreign," he added. He proposed that a high-tech coal processing conglomerate be established based on the national research center to undertake large-sized projects in and outside China. He also expressed China's willingness to develop international cooperation, from the pure technological type to an all-around one incorporating technology, industry and trade. This would pave the way for China's slurry technology and products to enter world markets, he added.
