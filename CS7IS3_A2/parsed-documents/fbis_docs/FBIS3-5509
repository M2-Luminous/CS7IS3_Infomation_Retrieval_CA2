Nakamura, 44, a House of Representatives member of the opposition LDP, has refused to comply with a Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office request to submit to questioning regarding his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from major construction contractor Kajima Corp. Diet permission is required for the arrest of parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late January. Responding to reporters at the party's headquarters, Kono said the party's response will "depend on the contents of the request." "We will listen to the request and respond properly," Kono said. Kono said it is "extremely regrettable" that Nakamura is under suspicion for receiving a bribe. The party executive will conduct its own investigation, he added. "We will have to treat this seriously," he said. "The party will have to straighten its collar and have the relevant bodies look into it." Meanwhile, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said the Diet should promptly grant permission to allow prosecutors to arrest Nakamura. "The Diet, if asked, should quickly give the go-ahead in accordance with legal procedures," Murayama told a news conference. Murayama noted he will leave the matter up to the lower house steering committee, adding the SDP, the largest force within the coalition, has no plans to hold an internal discussion on the matter. Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, one of the seven coalition parties, also told a news conference that the Diet should endorse the prosecutors' request for the arrest if the allegation is true as media reports have claimed. Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium chairman of the opposition Japanese Communist Party, told reporters the Diet should approve the request. He said it is natural for the prosecutors to conduct an investigation to probe the scandal. Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), another coalition member, told reporters that the prosecutors' request is unavoidable since Nakamura has refused to submit to questioning. Yonezawa said he regrets the scandal has emerged at a time when politicians are trying to establish higher ethical standards, following enactment of an electoral reform package in late January.
