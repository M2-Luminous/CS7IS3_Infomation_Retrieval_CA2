Small parts such as tails, throats, feet, or backstrips shall be packed in transparent, sealed containers clearly marked with a parts tag. Parts tags shall supply at a minimum the State of origin, species, original hide export tag number, and weight of the parts in the container. (5) American alligator skulls shall be marked as required by State law. This marking shall include, at a minimum, reference to a valid US-CITES tag number. Dated: December 8, 1994. George T.
