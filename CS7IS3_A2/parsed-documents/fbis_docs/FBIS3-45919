Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, gave an account of the trial and judgment of Sun Xianlu's air hijack case at a news briefing today. Sun Xianlu, 25, was a worker of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel Smelting Plant. In July 1993, he started an idea of hijacking an airliner to Taiwan and began to prepare for the criminal act. On 28 November 1993, he boarded a Shanghai-bound plane of the China International Airlines in Tianjin. Soon after the plane took off, he threatened to set off explosives and coerced the crew to fly toward Taiwan. After the crew members took some resolute measures, Sun Xianlu was arrested at the Nanjing airport. After hearing the case, the Nanjing City Intermediate People's Court of Jiangsu Province confirmed that Sun Xianlu carefully plotted the hijacking and hijacked the plane by threatening to set off explosives, and his act was an air hijack crime. On 13 January 1994, the Nanjing City Intermediate People's Court, in accordance with the relevant law, sentenced Sun Xianlu to life imprisonment and deprived him of political rights for life on the charge of air hijacking. After the sentence was pronounced, Sun Xianlu did not appeal, nor did the procuratorial organ lodged any protest within the time prescribed by law. The verdict became legally effective on 25 January. Liu Jiachen pointed out: A criminal who hijacks an airplane with violence, coercion, or other methods is extremely dangerous to the society, seriously disrupts normal air travel order, causes great economic losses to the state, seriously jeopardizes the safety of passengers' lives and property, and yields very bad social effects. All countries and regions regard such an act as a serious crime and impose severe punishment for it. Relevant international conventions have been recognized by more and more countries and regions. This means that air hijackers, particularly those criminals who hijack civil airplanes, will be punished by law no matter where they escape to. According to relevant reports, Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai, criminals who hijacked an airliner to Taiwan on 6 April 1993, have been sentenced to 10-year imprisonment by Taiwan region's judicial organ and they will not be allowed to stay in Taiwan after serving the term. At the same time, a common understanding of the cross- strait hijackers repatriation issue was reached between our country's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation in later part of December 1993. The two sides came to a consensus that hijacking by violence, coercion, or other methods is a serious crime and hijackers should be severely punished, and that in principle, all hijackers will be sent back to where they came from. Liu Jiachen emphasized: Hijackers of aircraft have always been a target to which severe blows will be dealt according to China's Criminal Law. In particular, according to the "Decision on Punishing Hijackers of Aircraft" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on 28 December 1992, hijackers must be severely punished, or sentenced to death if they cause severe injury or death to other people or heavy damages to aircraft, or their crime is extraordinarily serious. Liu Jiachen said that the people's judicial organ will certainly impose harsh punishment on any desperadoes and hijackers who dare to defy the law and make a reckless move.
