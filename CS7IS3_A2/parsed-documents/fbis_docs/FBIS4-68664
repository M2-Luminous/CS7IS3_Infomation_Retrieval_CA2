Discussions about whether the radical reformers will return to their first-place roles in the government, or whether they have definitely yielded the initiative to the moderate conservatives, or perhaps even to the more "drastic" national-patriotic opposition, are not professional exercises engaged in by political experts and journalists, but the completely normal reaction to the indefiniteness and instability of the current political situation in Russia. Forecasting the chances of success by various parties or movements is more purposeful if one relies not upon conjectural findings, but on the analysis of the state of the Russians' public awareness and those priorities toward which that awareness is gravitating. Definite food for thought on this subject is provided by the results of a comprehensive sociological study conducted by the Russian Independent Institute of Social and National Problems in February-March 1994 (a total of 1700 respondents in 10 regions of the country were polled). Most of the persons polled (55.7 percent) state that they are in favor of a socially oriented market economy ("the state must guarantee all citizens a social minimum, and whoever wants to get more must attempt to do so himself"). For purposes of comparison: the ultraliberal economic model ("the state must not interfere in the life of the citizens; each individual must count only on himself") and the more moderate version of the same liberal model ("the state must help only the weak and helpless") are supported, respectively, by 4.2 percent and 13.0 percent of the respondents. A total of 22.4 percent of those polled give their preference to the orthodox communist system of social equalization. Most Russians unambiguously link their hopes of the arising of a new socioeconomic model with the development of entrepreneurship (all told, 63.8 percent of the respondents asserted that they would like personally to engage in that type of activity). Having defined themselves with respect to socioeconomic policy, Russians demonstrate a high degree of mistrust in the authority. This, in particular, manifested itself clearly when they answered the question of what today represents the greatest danger to Russia. A total of 53.9 percent mentioned the increase in crime; 42.8 percent, the impoverishment of the population; 39.4 percent, the impotence of the political authority; and 24.4 percent, unemployment. In other words, most Russians do not believe in the ability of the political establishment to guarantee an acceptable level of social and economic stability in the country or to resolve effectively the tasks that only the state can and must resolve, and therefore they are counting only on their own strengths. At the same time, when evaluating their personal prospects, 55.2 percent of the respondents remarked that their life in the near future will improve or, if worse comes to worst, will remain unchanged. The fairly high indicator of "personal optimism" reflects the population's ability to adapt to the complicated conditions of the current transitional period. Yet another sign of the Russians' distrust of authority is the low rating of the political leaders. G. Yavlinskiy received the support of 23.5 percent of the respondents; B. Yeltsin, 17.2; Ye. Gaydar, 16.7; V. Zhirinovskiy, 9.2; G. Zyuganov, 8.8; S. Shakhray, 6.7; V. Chernomyrdin, 5.9; and A. Rutskoy, 2.2 percent. Incidentally, it is completely possible to link G. Yavlinskiy's relative success with the preponderance of the votes in favor of a socially oriented market economy, because the image of that politician, who proclaimed the slogan "a different reform" is linked by the mass consciousness with his adherence specifically to that path of development. But nevertheless the number of percentage points garnered by the leader of the Yabloko [Apple] block is obviously insufficient for him to lay claim to the role of the expresser of the will of the majority of the population. After becoming acquainted with the figures that have been given, it might seem to certain people that Russians have completely lost their interest in politics, and therefore, for the political leaders in the current situation, it does not make any sense to seek a magic formula for success. However, this is definitely not so. In the opinion of 66.2 percent of those polled, there must exist in the country some kind of commonly held idea that is capable of uniting all segments of society -- the entrepreneurs, workers, intellectuals, the military, and rural inhabitants. The results of the study do not make it possible with sufficient accuracy to understand exactly what that idea is. The range of opinions is extremely broad: 20.8 percent of the respondents feel that the democratic forces are capable of providing a better future for the country; 18.0 percent put their hopes on receiving aid from the West; and 11.5 percent, to one degree or another, are counting on the positive role of the Orthodox church. Nevertheless one is struck by the fact that, all told, more than half those polled (56.6 percent) expressed their sympathies with various public forces and the traditionalist-state orientation. Summing up what has been stated, we take the risk of hypothesizing that in the mass consciousness there is a growing need to have a new social force or leader emerge on the political scene, a force or leader capable of combining in their activity the ideas of a socially oriented market with adherence to traditionalist political and spiritual values. It would seem that, among the current Russian parties and movements, there are a rather large number of people who openly declare their "neoconservatism." Nevertheless, their loud and promising political declarations are not finding the proper support among Russians. The reason for this is the fact that all of them, in one way or another, are linked with the present political establishment, which is responsible, in the population's opinion, for the current woeful state of the country. Therefore, in order to lay claim to the role of a truly influential political force of the neoconservative persuasion, simply the adherence to an ideology that integrates the slogans of market social liberalism and spiritual-political conservatism is obviously insufficient. A leader who attempts to occupy a particular political niche will have to appear in the public's opinion as -- in the full sense of the word -- a new person in Russian politics. In addition, Russians are completely fed up with verbose discussions of ways to bring the country out of its crisis, and they currently are inclined, to a much greater degree than previously, to believe populist promises (we might recall, for example, the recent successes of V. Zhirinovskiy, who currently has already lost a considerable part of his previous popularity because of his unproductive position in the State Duma). Proceeding from this point, one can assume that the leader or party that lays claim to success, while differing only slightly on the basis of world-view position from the views expressed by the current moderate conservatives -- from PRES to DPR -- will attempt to achieve mass support with the aid of slogans that are simple and easy for the rank-and-file voter to understand, while also using untraditional forms of political mobilization. The example of the headlong ascent of S. Berlusconi to the political Olympus in Italy, a country which, throughout the entire twentieth century had seemingly anticipated the changing of the political climate on the European continent, apparently should be viewed as a symptom of these kinds of changes. The catchy motto "Fozze, Italia! ("Forward, Italy!), plus the organizing of an election campaign modeled on clubs made up of fans of the Milan soccer team that is loved by millions of Italians, in addition to the criticism of the First Republic elite that had discredited itself -- those are the basic components of the successful debut of the telecommunications king from the Apennines in the big political games. And, incidentally, talking about criticism. According to our research, the largest number of people polled assume that the following are to blame for Russia's current misfortunes: Communists (34.1 percent); the nomenklatura (26.1 percent); and the Mafia (20.0 percent). Thus, it is not difficult to predict the "critical component" in the program of the Russian Berlusconi. What might be the basis at such time of the untraditional political mobilization -- a game of duckpins, societies of amateur orchard growers or worshippers of the intoxicating amber beverage, people's walks -- remains only a guess. To those, however, who will rush to reproach us for overlooking the possibility that Russian neoconservatism will become fascist, we might note that, all told, only 23.2 percent of the respondents are inclined to see in our current mess the results of intrigues by various "dark forces" -- American imperialism, the Masons, international financial circles, etc. And more than half the people polled (52.2 percent) assume that Russians are the same nation as the other nations of the Russian Federation and should not play any special role.
