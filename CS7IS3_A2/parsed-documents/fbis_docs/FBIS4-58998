In a statement issued today, the House of Representatives said it was satisfied with the French Government's decision to stop its participation in naval inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah. Following is the text of the House of Representatives' statement: The Jordanian House of Representatives received with some satisfaction the statements by the French Foreign Ministry's spokesman on Wednesday, 4 May 1994, which deal with the French Government's decision to stop its participation in naval inspections at the Port of al-'Aqabah. Although the House of Representatives believes that this step is somewhat late, it still considers it a positive step since it shows the French Government's understanding and awareness of Jordan's sound policies, just demands, and firm and principled stands. Moreover, the House of Representatives hopes that the French Government's decision will be the first step, followed by similar steps by other countries participating in the naval inspections, toward lifting the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah and compensating Jordan for the serious losses it has suffered as a result of these inspections. As the Jordanian House of Representatives is fully aware of the international changes and developments and of the fact that only one superpower is imposing its decisions and its own interpretation on others, and it hopes that the French Government will take another step by exerting more effort and playing a more effective role to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy in a just and unbiased manner. At the same time, the Jordanian House of Representatives commended the existing positive and distinguished relations between Jordan and France based on mutual understanding and respect and the House called for the continuous development of these relations.
