The UNITA negotiating team had been in Huambo last week, where it consulted its leadership. However, it has brought nothing new to Lusaka, since it is still demanding 1,100 houses. UNITA wants houses in good condition and does not want to repair them. The government has already told UNITA that it will provide houses only for UNITA high officials. It is said that UNITA needs only 300 houses, including houses for high officials, who number less than 100. The government already has a well defined position: Either UNITA accepts what is offered to it within the government's capabilities, or nothing will be achieved. Today's talks were lengthy and the negotiating teams did not reach any agreement. Tomorrow, the negotiating teams will continue discussing this issue of housing, in the presence of the mediators and observers.
