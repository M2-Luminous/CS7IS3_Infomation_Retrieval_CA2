He said they have such plans, but everything depends on certain circumstances. The prime minister visited Germany a year ago, and all programs the sides agreed on are being fulfilled. A priority of the Russian Government is to create a legal basis for foreign investments, said Chernomyrdin. Russia is closely cooperating with Germany in this sphere. Germany ranks first in Russian-European trade and economic turnover. At the same time, there were some changes and drops in bilateral relations. In the opinion of the premier, these things are temporary, as Russia and Germany have old traditions and many German firms have long been known on the Russian market. Russia has changed, and there is plenty of possibilities to develop economic cooperation. The prime minister called on German businessmen for more active work on the Russian market. He said Russia has eliminated many obstacles on the way of economic cooperation. Asked about the Russian attitude to NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative, Chernomyrdin referred to a recent visit of Russian Defence minister Pavel Grachev to the NATO Headquarters in Brussels. "We have accepted the NATO proposal to participate in the program, and we are ready to cooperate. We are sure we have done right. I am convinced European problems cannot be solved without Russia, and we will participate in the program regardless any opinions about this. We should establish absolutely normal, partner relations between Russia and NATO," he said. Asked to comment on Russian reports claiming the prime minister is writing memoirs and planning to publish them in Germany, Chernomyrdin said he writes no memoirs as he has much other work to do. In conclusion the prime minister thanked German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl for assistance to his Mainz visit.
