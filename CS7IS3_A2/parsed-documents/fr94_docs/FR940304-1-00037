FR940304-1-00037 FR940304-1-00008 §146.97 Approval of other recordkeeping systems. (a) Approval. An operator must seek approval of another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit: (1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented; (2) A mathematical example covering at least two months which shows the amounts attributed, all necessary relative value calculations, the dates of consumption and removal, and the amounts and dates that the transactions are reported to Customs. (b) Failure to comply. Requests received that fail to comply with paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the requester with the defects noted by the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit. (c) Determination by Director. When the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit, determines that the recordkeeping procedures provide an acceptable basis for verifying the admissions and removals from or consumption in a refinery subzone, the Director will issue a written approval to the applicant. Appendix to Subpart H_Examples of Attribution and Relative Value I. Attribution Using Producibility Day 1 Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks to the crude distillation unit: 50,000 pounds privileged foreign (PF) class II crude oil 50,000 pounds PF class III crude oil 50,000 pounds domestic status class III crude oil Day 20 Removal from the refinery subzone for exportation of 50,000 pounds of aviation gasoline. The period of manufacture for the aviation gasoline is Day 1 to Day 20. The refiner must first attribute the designated source of the aviation gasoline. In order to maximize the duty benefit conferred by the zone operation, the refiner chooses to attribute the exported aviation gasoline to the privileged foreign status crude oil. Under the tables for potential production (T.D. 66&hyph;16), class II crude has a 30% potential, and class III has a 40% potential. The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the class II crude oil is 15,000 pounds (50,000 × .30). The maximum aviation gasoline producible from the privileged foreign status class III crude oil is 20,000 pounds (50,000 × .40). The domestic class III crude would also make 20,000 pounds of aviation gasoline. The refiner could attribute 15,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class II crude oil, 20,000 pounds of the privileged foreign class III crude oil, and 15,000 pounds of the domestic class III crude oil as the source of the 50,000 pounds of the aviation gasoline that was exported; 35,000 pounds of class II crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, 30,000 pounds of privileged foreign class III crude oil would be available for further production for other than aviation gasoline, and 35,000 pounds of domestic status class III crude oil would be available for further production, of which up to 5,000 pounds could be attributed to aviation gasoline. Day 21 Transfer, within the refinery subzone, from one or more storage tanks to the crude oil distillation unit: 50,000 pounds PF status class I crude oil 50,000 pounds PF status class IV crude oil Day 30 Removal from the refinery subzone: 30,000 pounds of motor gasoline for consumption 10,000 pounds of jet fuel sold to the US Air Force for use in military aircraft 10,000 pounds of aviation gasoline sold to a U.S. commuter airline for domestic flights 10,000 pounds of kerosene for exportation To the extent that the crude oils that entered production on Day 1 are attributed as the designated sources for the products removed on Day 30, the period of manufacture is Day 1 to Day 30. If the refiner chooses to attribute the crude oils that entered production on Day 21 as the designated sources of the products removed on Day 30 using the production standards published in T.D. 66&hyph;16, the manufacturing period is Day 21 to Day 30. This 30 choice will be important if a relative value calculation on the privileged foreign status crude oil is required, because the law requires the value used for computing the relative value to be the average per unit value of each product for the manufacturing period. Relative value must be calculated if a source feedstock is separated into two or more products that are removed from the subzone refinery. If the average per unit value for each product differs between the manufacturing period from Day 1 to Day 30 and the manufacturing period from Day 21 to Day 30, the correct period must be used in the calculation. In order to minimize duty liability, the refiner would try to attribute the production of the exported kerosene and the sale of the jet fuel to the US Air Force to the privileged foreign crude oils. For the same reason, the refiner would try to attribute the removed motor gasoline and the aviation gasoline for the commuter airline to the domestic crude oil.
