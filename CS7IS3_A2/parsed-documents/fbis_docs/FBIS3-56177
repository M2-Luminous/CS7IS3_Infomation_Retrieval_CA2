The statement, which was made in the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new parliament, on Thursday followed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to cut the number of vice-prime ministers in the government from nine to four. There have also been numerous leaks that Shokhin and vice-premier Sergey Shakhray, both have been elected deputies of the State Duma, will not be offered posts in the new government. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Shokhin disagreed with statements that reductions will be made at the expense of reform-minded ministers. To exemplify his point, Shokhin cited Yeltsin's decision to appoint Anatoliy Chubays who is in charge of privatisation in Russia a fifth vice-prime minister. He added that none of the ministers of the old government has received such an offer yet. Shokhin did not rule out the possibility that the number of vice-prime ministers may increase in the future. According to him, there are two optimum ways to form the government: first to determine the number of vice-prime ministers and then increase it or entrust federal ministers with management functions. In the latter case Shokhin would call for cutting the number of ministries by "establishing such a system under which ministers will have more powers in the government, while vice-prime ministers could substitute the premier in his absence."
