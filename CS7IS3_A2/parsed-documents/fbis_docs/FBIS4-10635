The two parties are charging each other with intolerance and irresponsibility. The clash began on 12 April when the Congressional Constituent Committee cast a tie vote on the opposition's proposal for a fourth set of voting records in addition to the three sets of records that the officials who oversee the balloting normally keep. The fourth set of voting records would not be given to the voting officials or the Armed Forces, which are entrusted by law with keeping all voting records. According to the opposition, this fourth set of records will help oversee the elections and prevent fraud. The opposition also objected to Constituent Committee Chairman Carlos Torres' vote that broke the tie after he had promised to abstain. Incidents cropped up and insults were exchanged in the corridors of the congressional building. Torres said that had the proposal to have a fourth set of records been accepted, "it would have made the electoral process chaotic. What would happen if this fourth set of records revealed something totally different from the other three? Can you imagine the problems this would create?" The opposition threatened to bring charges against Congress Chairman Jaime Yoshiyama for not calling a plenary meeting because the legislative year should have started on 1 April. The opposition also asked Yoshiyama to attend because he has been absent from all seven Congressional Executive Board meetings held so far this year. With one year to go before the general elections in April 1995, nobody knows at this point what organization or organizations will be in charge of organizing and coordinating the elections, which will be held within the framework of the new Constitution. Congress is embroiled in a pointless debate, constantly changing its course that leads nowhere. On the contrary, the disagreements between the pro-government majority and the opposition are getting worse all the time. The core of the problem is the new electoral system outlined in the new Constitution that was ratified by referendum in October 1993. Under the new Constitution, the National Electoral Board has been divided into three separate organizations. It will require a long and complicated process to get these three organizations up and running, and there is little time left for this. The opposition wants the National Electoral Board to handle the 1995 elections as it has done with the three previous elections held in Peru under President Alberto Fujimori's administration. The various opposition parties also disagree among themselves on what steps should be taken to achieve their objective. The Constituent Committee has approved a bill from the Peruvian Bar Association according to which the Constitution does not have to be amended for the National Electoral Court in order to coordinate the 1995 elections. The bill has to be approved by a plenary meeting, which has not been called yet. Experts agree that if the constitutional provisions are followed to the letter there will be no time to set up the appropriate organizations. Certain news organizations have warned that the elections may have to be postponed. The new electoral system is made up of the National Electoral Board, which will establish the rules and regulations; the National Office for Electoral Procedures (ONPE) [Oficina Nacional de Procesos Electorales], which will organize the elections; and the National Identity and Marital Status Registry, which will provide the list of voters. The National Council of Magistrates has to appoint the ONPE head, and this council has not been assembled yet. The election of council members will require a lengthy process that will only further delay the establishment of the new identity registry.
