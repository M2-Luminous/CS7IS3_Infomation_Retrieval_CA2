He took part in the Perekryostok programme, broadcast by Ukrainian TV on Sunday, which highlighted the forthcoming discussion of the agreement by the Ukrainian parliament, due to take place on January 25. The Ukrainian ambassador stressed that Russia had approached the tripartite Moscow agreement realistically, acting as an equal and not senior partner during the settlement of the complicated problem. Kryzhanovskiy said that he supported the tripartite Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament both as a diplomat and a Ukrainian citizen. "Nuclear weapons are not what our people need today. The problem for them is survival. If nuclear disarmament even involves compensation, the Ukrainian parliament should support the Moscow agreement," he said. The same idea was expressed by Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, who also took part in the Perekryostok programme. He stressed that President Kravchuk had acted in Moscow on the basis of the resolution of the Ukrainian parliament in the part, dealing with the ratification of the START-1 Treaty. He pointed out that the participation of the United States in the Moscow treaty is a positive factor and a guarantee, and called attention to the importance for Ukraine of the fact that Russia agreed to provide maintenance to the nuclear warheads, deployed in Ukraine.
