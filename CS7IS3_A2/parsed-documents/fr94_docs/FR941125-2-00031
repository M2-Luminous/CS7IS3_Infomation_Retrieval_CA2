SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority: Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated November 3, 1994, the Governments of the United States and Malaysia agreed to extend and amend their current bilateral textile agreement. The agreement is extended for a one-year period beginning on January 1, 1995 and extending through December 31, 1995. In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish sublimits for Categories 611, 619, 620 in the Fabric Group for the 1994 agreement period and increase the current limits for the Fabric Group and Categories 338/339 and 347/348. The limits for Categories 647/648 and 645/646 are being reduced to account for additional flexibility which was applied as a result of the increases. In addition, the sublimits for Categories 334, 335 and 635 are being eliminated. A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see Federal Register notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 58 FR 65580, published on December 15, 1993. The letter to the Commissioner of Customs and the actions taken pursuant to it are not designed to implement all of the provisions of the MOU, but are designed to assist only in the implementation of certain of its provisions.
