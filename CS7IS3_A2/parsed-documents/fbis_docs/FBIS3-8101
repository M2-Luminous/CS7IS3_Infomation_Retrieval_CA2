The Trilaterale -- Hungary, Poland and the (then) Czechoslovakia -- had already concluded their accords one year before Bucharest. As a result, the Romania-EC negotiations that began in May 1992 were concluded very rapidly by sealing the association accord on 17 November 1992 and its initialing on 1 February 1993 in Brussels. The accord will soon become effective after it is ratified by the parliaments of "the Twelve." The price that had to be paid for such haste is quite high. Romania -- at that time considered "the black sheep" of Eastern Europe -- was compelled to accept less advantageous association terms than the ones offered to the Trilaterale. As far as commerce with agricultural products is concerned -- considered to be the most important hard currency source of East European countries -- Romania was coerced to declare itself satisfied with very little, although in that domain it has the largest potential in the whole area. It might be significant that during the negotiations conducted in view of concluding the accord, Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner in charge of community issues, expressed his "deepest regrets" for the terms imposed on Romania in the agricultural chapter. Being more confident in their own forces, the Trilaterale countries had put up a fierce fight to protect their interests. Dissatisfied with the EC terms, Poland and Hungary in 1991 left the negotiating table, although, as a matter of fact, the offers made to them by the European Community had been much more generous than the ones made to our country. The favorite countries of the West assessed that they could afford to gamble -- and they won. Surprisingly enough, shortly before the accord on Romania's association with the European Union [EU] is to become effective, the latter radically changed its stance, offering our country an unhoped-for present. During the Athens conference of the EU member states' ministers of commerce, EU High Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said that the agricultural terms imposed on Romania have to be adjusted to those offered to Hungary, Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia. Furthermore, Romania should benefit from an even more rapid access to EU markets in order to compensate for its one-year delay compared to "the four." This is a remarkable change in the EU's stance with respect to Romania. This gesture indicates the fact that the West is not prepared to divide East Europe into "first class" and "second class" countries. However, pragmatism should prevail over euphoria in the way Bucharest views this unexpected offer made by the European Union. In other words, it will be easier for us to export agricultural products to EU countries, but the problem is whether Romanian agriculture has sufficient quantities of such products. For the time being, owing to the "priceless" contribution of the Ministry of Agriculture, our country has gained the status of one of the major importers of basic agricultural products (wheat, edible oil, and sugar.) The unexpected chance given to us by the European Union should not be missed because that would cause delays in the transition process, as the country would be deprived of one of its major sources of hard currency. It would be a pity if those general terms offered by the European Union would end up the same way the most-favored-nation status did, namely that we chased that status over almost four years just to realize, after we received it, that Romania's economy is not sufficiently ripe to make any substantial bids on the U.S. market.
