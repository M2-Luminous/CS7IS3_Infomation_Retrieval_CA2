In an interview for the daily TURUN SANOMAT, Visa says that the Navy would first need a new patrol squadron of four to five vessels as well as fixed supervisory equipment so that the supervision of an expanded sea area could be managed properly. Before the end of this month, the government intends to submit to the Eduskunta a proposal to move the territorial waters limit. The move would multiply Finland's territorial water area but the Navy has not been promised any additional equipment or staff. Visa would also like Finland to have its own submarines. He notes that a squadron of submarines for Finland would crucially facilitate supervision and would raise the threshold of frontier violations. According to Visa, nevertheless the submarines are not the top priority on the Navy's list of purchases.
