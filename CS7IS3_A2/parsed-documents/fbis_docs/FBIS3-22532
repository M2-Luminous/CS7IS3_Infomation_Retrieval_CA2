The Surat district collector, Mr. P.V. Trivedi, issued a special notification to the effect late last night under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987, on the advice of the Surat municipal commissioner, Mr. Balwant Singh. Four wards of the city covering different areas namely Rander, Sagrampura, Salabutpura, Inderpura, Navapura, Begumpura, Zanpa Bazaar, Rustompura and Gopi Talao, have been declared jaundice-affected. Over 464 cases of jaundice have been detected from these areas, according to official figures, but the unofficial figure is feared to be around 600. About three deaths have been reported from the city which, however, do not have any official confirmation. With each passing day, the number of jaundice cases have been increasing and the city's hospitals are flooded with jaundice patients. On Monday alone, 13 cases were detected from Randar, eight from Sagrampura, five from Salabatpura and two cases from the Lambe Hanuman Road area. A total of 118 jaundice patients are undergoing treatment at the infectious diseases hospital in the city. The civic authorities have swooped down on a number of hotels, canteens and restaurants and ordered their closure following the detection of contaminated water being supplied to the consumers. It was reported that highly unhygienic conditions prevailed at the 2.5 million gallon water storage tank at Umarwada, the principal source of water supply to the jaundice-affected areas, with people found bathing at the tank, washing clothes and even using the area around it as an open toilet.
