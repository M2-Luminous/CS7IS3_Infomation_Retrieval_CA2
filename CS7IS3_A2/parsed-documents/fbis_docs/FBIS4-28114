The commission's chairman, Kan Kato, however, expressed optimism that public support would be obtained for the tax raise. Representatives of business, consumer and other groups expressed their opinions on tax reforms at the hearings held in Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, Fukuoka and Kumamoto. They generally called for income tax cuts on a continuous basis in and after fiscal 1995 but were split over a raise in the 3 percent consumption tax. Even the proponents of the hike demanded administrative reforms and curbs on government expenditures as prerequisites for the raise. They expressed hope that a hike would be held to the minimum level if it is unavoidable. Kato, who attended a hearing in Osaka, told a news conference most representatives were "cooperative" on the proposed tax raise. He said the commission would like to come up with a concrete plan, including the rate and timing of the tax hike, by the end of June. The commission is planning similar hearings in Tokyo and four other cities Friday.
