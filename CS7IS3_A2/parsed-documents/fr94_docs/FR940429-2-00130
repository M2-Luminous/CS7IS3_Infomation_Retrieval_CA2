FR940429-2-00130 FR940429-2-00089 FmHA applicants must submit an original ``Part A and one or more Part Bs'' to FmHA Headquarters; A copy of each Part A and Part B must be submitted to the appropriate FmHA State offices. An applicant submitting one application for one project only must submit one Part A and one Part B. (For example, the Smalltown Housing and Redevelopment Authority submits one application for one project ``Pleasant Valley Towers'' to the HUD Omaha Field Office. That application must contain one Part A and one Part B.) Applicants submitting applications for multiple projects must submit a separate application for each project, in each jurisdiction in which it is submitting applications. However, for multiple applications from the same applicant in the same jurisdiction, only one copy of Part A is submitted. Thus, an applicant submitting three applications in one jurisdiction must submit one Part A and three Part Bs (e.g., the North Carolina Office on Aging is submitting three applications for three HUD projects to the HUD Greensboro office. It submits one Part A to that office, with a Part B for each of the three separate projects.) However, if an applicant is submitting applications to more than one HUD Field office or FmHA State office or to both HUD and FmHA, it must submit one ``Part A'' and the appropriate number of ``Part Bs'' in EACH jurisdiction. For example, the Ohio Office of Aging is submitting two applications for two HUD projects to the Cleveland HUD Office, one application for one HUD project to the Columbus HUD Office and one FmHA application to the FmHA Columbus State office. An original Part A must be submitted to EACH of the three Offices, with two Part Bs to the Cleveland Office, one Part B to the HUD Columbus office and one Part B to the FmHA Columbus Office. Each Part A and each Part B must be in separate folders. Each Part must be appropriately tabbed and numbered according to the instructions in the Application Package. D. Submission of Applications 1. Submission of Applications to HUD All applicants shall submit an original and THREE copies (a FAX copy of the application is NOT acceptable) of the CHSP application to the Director of Housing Management in the HUD Field Office which has jurisdiction over the project at the address noted in Attachment 1 of the NOFA by 3 p.m., Local Time, on or before July 13, 1994. In the case of IHAs, the submission is to the Director of Housing Management in the HUD Field Office in which is located the Office of Native American Programs which has jurisdiction over that project. The deadline date is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all applicants requesting CHSP funds, HUD will treat as ineligible for consideration any request which is received after the deadline. Applicants making requests for CHSP funds should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of lost eligibility brought about by unanticipated delivery-related problems. Applications received after the date and time stated herein will not be accepted, and will be returned to the applicant. Each application package must be identified on the envelope or wrapper as follows: Director of Housing Management, CHSP FY 1994 Application Package, Due by 3 p.m., Local Time July 13, 1994. Determination whether an application is received in a timely manner is solely the responsibility of the receiving HUD Field Office. 2. Submission of Applications to FmHA All applicants shall submit an original and TWO copies (a FAX copy of the application is NOT acceptable) of the CHSP application to FmHA Headquarters by 3 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on or before July 13, 1994. The deadline date is firm as to date and hour. The Address is: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration, ATTN: Sue M. Harris-Green, South Building, room 5343, 14th and Independence Ave, SW., Washington, DC 20250. One copy of the application must also be submitted to the FmHA State office which has jurisdiction over the project. In the interest of fairness to all applicants requesting CHSP funds, the FmHA will treat as ineligible for consideration any request which is received by FmHA Headquarters after the deadline.
