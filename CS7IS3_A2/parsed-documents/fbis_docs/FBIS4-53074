The leaders will consider economic issues in a formal session on July 9, a day which will also see the release of an economic declaration, as well as separate meetings among the foreign ministers and the finance ministers of the G-7. Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make his first appearance at the Naples summit on the evening of July 9, when he attends a banquet. On July 10, Yeltsin will join in political deliberations among the G-7 leaders on specific topics such as the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

In the case of previous summits, the Kremlin leader only joined the G-7 leaders after their talks were already finished for a special "G-7-plus-one" session. [passage omitted]
