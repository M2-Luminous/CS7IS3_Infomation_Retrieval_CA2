FBIS4-8726 "dreeu074_k_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 CROATIA Notes From the Croatian Press Notes From the Croatian Press 94P20643A 94P20643A CSO [Editorial Report] The following items on political and economic developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from periodicals published in the Republic. HSLS Leader in Slavonia on Bosnia, Croatian Policy The founding assembly of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] municipal branch was held in Semeljci in the presence of HSLS members from Djakovo, Trnava, Koritna, and Kesinci in eastern Slavonia. The Osijek daily GLAS SLAVONIJE on 17 March reports that the assembly was addressed by Ivica Sutalo, a delegate in the Croatian Assembly and president of the Djakovo HSLS branch, who expressed his "satisfaction" at the founding of the first HSLS branch in the eastern part of the Djakovo region. Speaking about the current political situation in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sutalo said that HSLS members welcome the cease-fire in Bosnia between the Croats and the Muslims, but that they are afraid of the rapid conclusion of the agreement on confederation, even before Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have been freed from the "Serbian aggressor." "Croats plunged twice, like geese, into the fog of the Yugoslav union; a third plunge, after all the victims and destruction, could be dangerous," Sutalo warned, adding that Croatian official policy during the last four years had been "consistent in its inconsistency." "This is why the HSLS, as the first opposition party, has the historical duty to present its views in a stronger and more precise way and to start examining the question of responsibility for the events of the last four years," Sutalo concluded according to the daily. Questions Surrounding Privatization of Brewery The story of the privatization of the Karlovac Pivovara [Brewery] and the sale of shares in it point to "irregularities" in the work of the Croatian Privatization Fund, according to the Zagreb weekly DANAS of 22 March. DANAS reports such irregularities were even mentioned by President Franjo Tudjman at a recent news conference when he announced some dismissals of Fund personnel, "which provoked tumultuous applause from those present." The weekly notes that Andronik Luksic, a resident of Chile, "who is said to be one of the richest Croats in the world," is the buyer of the Croatian Privatization Fund's shares of the Karlovac brewery. Luksic, treated as a Croat citizen "thanks to a special interpretation" by the Ministry of Finance, received a discount of 30 percent of the brewery's valuation instead of the 10 percent a noncitizen would have received, so that instead of 15.1 million German marks he paid 10.7 million. Initially, the Fund opened its meetings on the privatization of the brewery to the public, DANAS notes, but after two meetings, "precisely as the privatization story was entering its final phase," the doors were closed. "It became obvious that some of the things discussed were not meant to be heard by everyone, and especially not by journalists," DANAS comments. Many things about the privatization of the brewery remain unclear, DANAS adds, concluding that what took place behind closed doors was politically motivated. Light Metal Factory Privatization Scandal "A big scandal" is about to break out over the privatization of the Light Metals Factory [Tvornica Lakih Metala (TLM)] in Sibenik, which before the war in Croatia was the largest exporter in the Sibenik-Drnis zupanija [parish] and which still accounts for almost all of the parish's industrial production. The 18 March issue of Zagreb GLOBUS reports that the "warnings and cries for help" arriving more and more frequently from the Sibenik TLM indicate that the privatization of this enterprise could become "Croatia's robbery of the century." After three years of "agony," the former aluminum giant, with an annual turnover of over $250 million and 5,000 employees, is threatened with complete collapse. Officially, TLM's total debt amounts to 140 million German marks, while its assessed value is 119 million German marks. Sibenik residents are especially worried about the funds in the TLM's foreign trade office, Comal, established in Munich, Germany, when all links with the former Yugoslav company, Genex, that had conducted TLM's foreign trade, were broken as a result of the war. Comal's basic task was to collect from Genex all funds that belonged to TLM and to prevent the money from ending up in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Between 5 and 7 million German marks just sit in Comal, outside Croatia, while debts to business partners which supply raw materials are being repaid slowly or not at all, GLOBUS notes, adding that Sibenik residents ask: "Is someone trying to bring the factory to total collapse, only to buy it then for next to nothing?" There is no interest in the current Privatization Fund offer of 66 million German marks, but a situation is being created in which TLM could be bought from the state for a maximum of 10 million German marks, GLOBUS concludes. Mate Boban's Life Out of Power Today, when he is no longer president of Herceg-Bosna, when documents about abolishing Herceg-Bosna are being signed, and when he is no longer even mentioned on Croatian television, Mate Boban--now merely the Zagreb Tobacco Factory representative for southern Croatia--sits in a Zagreb apartment reading newspapers and watching television. According to the 22 March issue of the Zagreb weekly DANAS, as he drinks Turkish coffee and smokes three packs of cigarettes daily, he cannot stop wondering about the turnaround by the journalists who until recently supported him, and by the politicians whom "he brought out of anonymity." Not only is he no longer invited to luncheons in the Presidential Office, but he is not being consulted on the Herceg-Bosna negotiations and does not even hear from people who constantly used to seek favors from him. Boban is even more disappointed when he appears on the street, DANAS says, citing his complaint to a friend: "I cannot believe that acquaintances are turning their faces away from me and that they are crossing to the other side of the street. Everyone has abandoned me." DANAS says that his disappointment probably stems from awareness that he is the only politician whom Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has had to renounce. Everyone else, less important figures, even those who publicly opposed the president's views, remain on the team, DANAS notes, nevertheless giving Boban credit for the fact that "Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina will not accept any kind of federation which reduces the rights to which they are entitled as a sovereign people." DANAS adds that it is a shame that Boban, through poor organizational and personnel moves, tolerance of criminals, and "useless" violation of the human rights of the Bosnian Muslims, missed his chance to implement a concept of Herceg-Bosna acceptable to the West. Neither he nor his generation can correct this, but future generations will surely remember it, the weekly concludes.
