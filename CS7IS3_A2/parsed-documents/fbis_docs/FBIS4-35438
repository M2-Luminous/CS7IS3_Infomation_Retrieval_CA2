Have we a ready-made reaction? [Rabinovich] I do not see the point of such a debate. One of the points of symmetry with the Syrians is that their media is official. When TISHRIN publishes a report or a commentary it can be viewed as a sort of official view. Nevertheless, I still do not think we should argue with the Syrian press or argue whether it is right for the so-called Syrian media to attack the prime minister. I believe that if the Syrian leadership has something to say it can do so on its own. [Barqay] Then let us argue with President Mubarak, who said that he has a promise from Yitzhaq Rabin to come down from the Golan Heights. His remarks were taped by journalists who met with him. You know the prime minister's response: It is utter nonsense. [Rabinovich] If you want to bring another element into the issue, then go ahead. In reference to the Egyptian position, the only third element active in the negotiations between us and the Syrians is the United States. You referred to them as a mediator. The U.S. role is not exactly that of a mediator, but rather what they call an intermediary [preceding word in English], because the word mediator implies somebody who makes his own bridging proposals, which is not the case in these negotiations. Egypt is not a mediator between us and Syria, and does not act as an intermediary, therefore the Egyptian Government cannot have a deep knowledge of what is taking place in these negotiations. [Barqay] I understand. Now tell me, are the Syrian negotiations really stuck? [Rabinovich] The negotiations with the Syrians are not moving at this moment. The secretary of state is prepared to come to the region once more, but he is not prepared to come for nothing. The main diplomatic activity in Washington at present is in an attempt to find out if there is any purpose in the secretary coming. The address is first and foremost Damascus. The Syrians must make it clear that there is a point to an additional mission to the region by the secretary of state. The harsh reaction by TISHRIN can be attributed to the Syrian feeling that there is a general conception that the ball is in their court and they are trying any way they can to get it across the net. [Barqay] What will move the negotiations, which are deadlocked, along? What will make one of the sides move forward? [Rabinovich] In reference to the TISHRIN report, it can immediately be discerned that it is a legalistic and formal approach, which states that Israel must first implement the UN resolutions and give its representatives a commitment, etc. That approach is legalistic and formal and not one for political negotiations. Political negotiations are talks between two sides who want to reach a joint purpose, who present their interests and outlooks, and then together -- sometimes with the assistance of a third party, which in this case is the United States -- take note of the points where their outlooks, starting positions, and interests meet. That is the fertile ground where negotiations can progress. What the Syrians must do is move away from the mentality of a legalistic approach and take a practical political approach to the negotiations.
