[Bossi] A decision will be made at the national council tonight. I think that the League will be there. [Vimercati] Independently or together with the ANPI [National Association of Italian Partisans] and other political forces? [Bossi] I only know that Formentini and Pivetti, that is the mayor of Milan and the Chamber of Deputies speaker, could be present. If they are there it will be the celebration of all the Milanese people. [Vimercati] Does it seem worth inconveniencing the public authorities for a celebration that brings old divisions back to mind? [Bossi] We must come to an agreement on words here. It is absurd to divide ourselves on a fascism that has been dead and buried for 50 years now. However, another kind of fascism still lives on and this is represented by the old regime. A clubby-type of regime supported by the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the Left. [Vimercati] Do you want to demonstrate against this kind of fascism? [Bossi] Precisely. The partisans fought for liberty but these ideals have remained on paper, buried under a centrist state that was supported by a diarchy, the DC and the Left. [Vimercati] However, at this moment the Left is relaunching antifascism. [Bossi] This paradox must be overturned. On 25 April [Liberation Day] the gentlemen of the Left should all be out crying because their fascism died at the latest elections. They were the ones who resurrected fascism and led it by the hand to this point. They were the ones who legitimated [National Alliance leader] Fini during the election campaign. And now they dare to chatter about antifascism. [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that the 25 April demonstrations could unleash tension and generate violence, especially if there are counterdemonstrations? [Bossi] I am not afraid of this. We will certainly be on the alert. But if a popular force like the League is out there, the gentlemen who still resort to old methods like bombs to support the old regime will have to retreat. They will not succeed this time. [Vimercati] Who, according to you, would have any reason to launch an attack at this time? [Bossi] I do not know, I do not believe in this hypothesis very much today. It is useless to fly high and to look for contorted solutions. I think that the reason behind what is happening is very simple and for all to see: The defeated Left will not reconcile itself to being defeated and is using antifascism as a means of entering the field again. [Vimercati] Perhaps with the aid of the old DC? [Bossi] The DC does not exist any longer, I think that the antifascist by name, but fascist in practice, reaction is being led by the former communists and their friends. And do you know why? [Vimercati] No, why? [Bossi] For the simple reason that the old regime was leftist, statist, and totalitarian, even though it contained a force like the DC which proclaimed itself a centrist force. In reality, it expected to get votes from all sides, even from the Right, to take them to the Left. [Vimercati] But what do you mean precisely when you talk about fascism? [Bossi] I am thinking of a totalitarian ideology, of the frenzied power of a centralist state in which everything becomes subordinate to its own interests: the desires of the people, liberty, cultural and economic pluralism. In this sense fascism became incarnated in the Mussolini regime and then in the clubby- type DC and PCI [Italian Communist Party] regime. Two sides of the same coin: the first, a dictatorship where cudgels were used, has disappeared; the second, a soft dictatorship, is still insidiously present. The League has launched its successful war of liberation against this. It is an unrelenting war against modern fascism, the basis of party dictatorship. [Vimercati] There is a paradox in what you are saying. This war has placed you in government with the MSI [Italian Social Movement], which has never denied its fascist roots. [Bossi] I repeat, the old fascism is dead and buried. We should not be fighting against ghosts, but against real dangers. In any case, with the League in the government we will be the best guarantee against any totalitarian or fascist temptations. We know very well that some forces are trying to recycle the waste of the party system. They will never succeed as long as we are around. These restorers have the League breathing down their backs. [Vimercati] You say that the DC no longer exists. But there is the PPI [Italian Popular Party. [Bossi] If this is the case, even Forza Italia picked up pieces of the old system. However, at this point the party that once existed, the permanent force that occupied the state, will not return. The League will prevent the fragments from reuniting. [Vimercati] What do you mean? [Bossi] Simple. The PPI will never become part of the government as a political force. We will not permit this. We succeeded in breaking the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] into two and we will not let it reunite. The former DC will remain outside. If Berlusconi wants to take somebody on, he can help himself. But not all the party: the old DC must not rise again. It must not return to the buildings from which we chased it away.
