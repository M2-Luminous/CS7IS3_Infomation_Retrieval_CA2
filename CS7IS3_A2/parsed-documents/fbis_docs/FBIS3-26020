The company raises capital through the issuance of shares (or stock certificates). Stockholders assume limited liability for the company in proportion to their share subscriptions, and the company pledges all its assets in assuming responsibility for its debt. A joint stock limited company's basic traits follow: Its total capital is divided into shares of equal value, with the stockholders assuming limited liability for the company in proportion to their share subscriptions. The company may issue shares to the public, and the shares can be traded or transferred. Although the number of stockholders may not fall short of the specified number, there is no upper limit. Stockholders enjoy the company's rights and assume obligations by virtue of their stock holdings. The company must release its accounting statements, reviewed and verified by a certified public accountant, on schedule. A joint stock limited company is the typical form of a joint stock company. Its first advantage is that it is conducive to attracting capital. It may issue shares to raise capital, and its shares are negotiable. Specifically, it may issue various types of shares to lure investors, as well as shares of small face values to attract some idle, small-sum capital from society. This will expand the sources of capital for the joint stock limited company, which can quickly raise a huge sum of capital for use in large-scale operations. Second, when the company goes into bankruptcy, the stockholders will not be encumbered beyond the scope of their share subscriptions. This is because the company implements a limited liability system. This helps protect stockholders' interests. Third, a joint stock limited company is the typical capital partnership, whose ownership and management are separated. It can be managed by specifically trained and experienced professionals. This helps improve managerial level and efficiency. Moreover, a joint stock limited company's large numbers of shares and stockholders make it easy to control small amounts of capital with large amounts of capital. Nevertheless, a joint stock limited company also has its own shortcomings. First, a joint stock limited company must go through an elaborate process of incorporation. It can ill afford to maintain its confidentiality because it must release information on its financial status on a regular basis. Second, stockholders are highly mobile, and the company can hardly control them. In buying shares, stockholders largely do so for their dividends and lack a sense of responsibility to the company. A joint stock limited company should be incorporated according to the "Company Law." A limited liability company is a business corporation jointly funded by two or more stockholders. Each stockholder assumes limited liability for the company in proportion to his or her capital contributions, whereas the company pledges all its assets in assuming responsibility for its debt. A limited liability company's basic traits follow: The company's assets are composed of several portions but are not divided into shares of equal value. The company issues capital contribution certificates, instead of shares, to stockholders. Stockholders' capital contributions can be transferred, but any transfer must be effected according to specific rules. The number of stockholders may not surpass a certain level. Stockholders enjoy various rights and undertake various obligations by virtue of their capital contributions. Limited liability companies came into existence relatively late. It was only until the mid-19th century that one such company came into being in Britain, in the form of a "private company," and this was approximately 250 years after the world's first joint stock limited company -- the British East India Company -- was established in 1600. Because of its traits as both a capital partnership or a partnership between individuals, a limited liability company is a very suitable form for incorporating small and medium enterprises. A limited liability company cannot issue its shares to the public, and it is known as a "private company" in Britain and a "closed company" in the United States.
