The contact group arrived in Sarajevo at around 2100, following talks with the aggressor Serb side in Pale. Members of the contact group comprising representatives of the United States, Russia, the European Union, Germany, Great Britain, and the United Nations will be staying in our country over the next two days. Following the talks at the Presidency, U.S. President Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman said: We conducted exhaustive and serious talks this evening, and we heard the views of all the participants. Our job now is to study all these ideas and choose those that we will present to our governments and ministers, who will be meeting next week. Let us now hear what Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic said after the talks with the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina: [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We [word indistinct] told the contact group that, in our opinion, the prospects for peace have become more remote compared to the situation of 20 days ago. We believe that the behavior of UN officials--especially Mr. Akashi--has ruined the chances of a speedy restoration of peace that was (?in the offing). In fact, we have noticed that UN officials-- certain officials and especially Mr. Akashi--do not honor UN decisions, and the Serb side does not heed them because they do not respect their own resolutions. That was obvious in the case of Sarajevo, and especially [passage indistinct] where heavy artillery is still within a 20 km range. Especially, (?you know about) the incident today, an absurd incident when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helped chetnik tanks cross the Sarajevo exclusion zone to a new position in order to be able to attack us tomorrow in [word indistinct]. As you know, that was the reason why we demanded Mr. Akashi's resignation, because our government can no longer cooperate with him after all these major mistakes that, let me repeat, we believe have ruined the realistic chances of a speedy restoration of peace. Of course, we stressed once again to the working group--whose efforts we respect because they have come with the best intentions to do what they can here--we repeated that the conditions for peace are very simple: the preservation of a sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, the preservation of its external borders and the return of the occupied areas. We want peace to be restored, and we are therefore open to negotiations under the conditions I have just stated. We do not deny the possibility to restore peace, and we are in favor of it.
