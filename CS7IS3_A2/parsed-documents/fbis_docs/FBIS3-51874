This figure does not include the allocations for flight hours and fuel used by the Air Force for interdiction operations. Among the Upper Huallaga airports that the Air Force began to control in July 1992 are those in Santa Lucia, Tocache, Uchiza, Saposoa, Bellavista, Juanjui, Tarapoto, Yurimaguas, Sion, Palmapampa (Ayacucho), Izcosazin, and Caballococha (Amazonian Trapeze), Puerto Bermudez, and Pucallpa. Concerning the Palmapampa airport, which is located in La Mar Province (Ayacucho), the Air Force has controlled it since 1 November 1993. This airport was very important for drug trafficking in the area, because that area had become a drug trafficking storage center. The drugs were taken from Upper Huallaga to this area, to be loaded in small Colombian planes that took off in Colombia, crossed Brazilian airspace (Cruzeirodo Brasil zone), and arrived in Palmapampa.
