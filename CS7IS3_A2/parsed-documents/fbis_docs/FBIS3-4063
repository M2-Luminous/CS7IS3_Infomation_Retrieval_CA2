The three main problems covering a wide scope needed urgent solutions. First, soaring prices which were already high continued to climb. Commodities seeing greater price rises are mainly food items, especially poultry and their products, aquatic products and vegetables and medical and health care service. The problem is attributed to a change in the operation mechanism, and during this stage it has no effective control over runaway market prices and a price hike resulting from speculation and artificial manipulation. National retail prices increased by 20 percent last January and February over the same period in the previous year. Second, some state-owned enterprises suffered from many difficulties in their production and management with economic results tending to go downwards. Such enterprises' output grew by 1.1 percent in the first two months of this year while profits actually dropped and the scale and amount of losses expanded. Third, investment again showed overheating with new expansion of state-owned fixed assets investment made in the first two months of this year rising to 77.5 percent from the original 74.1 percent registered in the same period in the year before. New items undertaken in localities grew in great number with the proposed investment value increasing by 65 percent over the same period in the previous year while some other areas saw such growth double.
