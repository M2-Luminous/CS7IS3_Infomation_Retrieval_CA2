South Korea plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level officials on June 28 to a three-week group training course for public servants offered by the Chinese Personnel Ministry. China, in turn, will send 15 public officials to South Korea in early September to attend a training course at the central officials training institute here. This exchange is based on an agreement signed last March to expand personnel cooperation between the two countries. The ministry said the exchange is designed to promote friendly cooperation between civil servants by widening their knowledge of the other nation's reform policy.
