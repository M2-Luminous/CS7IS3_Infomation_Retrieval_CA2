FR941028-2-00148 FR941028-2-00105 Petition for Exemption or Waiver of Compliance In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received from the Association of American Railroads (AAR) a request for an interim waiver of compliance with a requirement of Federal rail safety standards. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved and the nature of the relief being requested. Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number RSFC&hyph;94&hyph;2) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before December 1, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Association of American Railroads (AAR)_(Waiver Petition Docket Number RSFC&hyph;94&hyph;2) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) seeks an interim waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards, 49 CFR Part 215. The AAR is requesting an exemption from the requirement of 49 CFR 215.103(h) which requires the removal from service of freight car wheels that show signs of having been overheated as evidenced by reddish brown discoloration, as it is applied to heat-treated curved-plate wheels. As a result of a petition by the AAR (Rulemaking Petition No. 93&hyph;1), the FRA intends to initiate a rulemaking addressing the proposal to revise 49 CFR 215.103(h) as it applies to heat-treated curved-plate (HT&hyph;CP) freight car wheels. AAR indicates that it is filing this petition for an interim waiver to address the situation while the rulemaking process proceeds. AAR requests that FRA issue a waiver providing in substance, that: 49 CFR 215.103 shall not prohibit a railroad from placing or continuing in service a freight car if the only reason for such prohibition is one or more wheels that are discolored as described in 49 CFR 215.103(h), provided: (i) Each such discolored wheel is heat-treated and is of curve-plate design, (ii) Each such wheel is identified as a heat-treated curved-plate wheel in accordance with AAR interchange rules, and (iii) The railroad has submitted to FRA and to AAR a written agreement to participate in the Data Collection Program on Premature Wheel Failure. AAR cites the following justification for the waiver request: 1. HT&hyph;CP wheels are extraordinarily resistant to the development of residual tensile rim stresses which are a precondition for wheel fracture.
