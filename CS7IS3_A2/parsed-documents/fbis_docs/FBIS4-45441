We will take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban delegation? Amat: The meeting of Ibero-American justice ministers is a conference that has been held for several years. As you stated, this is the 10th conference. On this occasion we touched on topics that appear to be permament topics on our agendas. One is the topic of the fight against drug trafficking. This topic does not have the same implication in Cuba as in other countries, because our society does not engage in using, trafficking, or producing drugs. For other countries, however, it does have a serious connotation. Some of those countries are drug producers and are hard hit by the drug trafficking problem. Although we do not have this problem in our country, it is a very useful topic, because the experience of countries that are victims of this situation can always be learned from. They are teachings that benefit us, because Cuba is fighting hard to prevent drug trafficking from invading us. This does not mean, however, that we are immune to it or are exempt from it. It could happen to us. Our duty, therefore, is to prepare technically and to learn about the problem, to be able to wage an anti-drug program if necessary. There are isolated cases, however, involving tourists. However, it is not a problem that affects us to the extent it affects other countries. [passage omitted]
