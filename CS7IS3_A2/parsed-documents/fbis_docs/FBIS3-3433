AFP's Beijing bureau chief, Gilles Campion, filed a verbal protest with the authorities after police seized the camera of photographer Manuel Ceneta and opened it up to expose the film. Witnesses said several hundred people had gathered behind security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch delegates leave the Chinese parliament building. At about 10:45 a.m. (0245 GMT), two protesters stationed at different parts of the square hurled pamphlets at the passing delegates. Uniformed and plainclothed police, who have been controlling access to the square since parliament opened its annual session on March 10, quickly moved to disperse the crowd, seal off the area and destroy the photographer's film. The official news agency Xinhua later issued a dispatch quoting a foreign ministry spokesman, who criticised AFP. It is "improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without going through necessary formalities," the dispatch cited the spokesman, who was not identified, as saying. "The spokesman also said that two Chinese women were stopped by other citizens for disturbing public order this morning," the agency said, without saying whether the two had been arrested or had any connection with the pamphlet incident. Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy protests which were crushed by the army during the night of June 3-4, 1989. Dissidents and intellectuals have made several attempts to put across their pro-democracy and pro-human rights views ever since delegates began arriving from all over China for the parliament session. Three open letters have been sent to delegates, but Monday was the first time dissidents have openly defied the police. Before the session began police launched a massive intimidation campaign with the arrest of some 15 dissidents, forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital while parliament met. Four foreign correspondents were briefly held for questioning by police after they met with dissidents during the visit to Beijing by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher March 11 to 14.
