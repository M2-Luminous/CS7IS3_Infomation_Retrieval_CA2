FBIS4-14124 "drnes082dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs PFLP-GC Leader Announces Split, Forms New Command PFLP-GC Leader Announces Split, Forms New Command JN2704163594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1430 GMT 27 Apr 94 JN2704163594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Text] Following sharp differences within the ranks of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, Mustafa Khamis, a PFLP-GC leader, today decided to split from the PFLP-GC and form what he called the Popular Front-General Islamic Command. Mustafa Khamis, who was a member of the PFLP-GC Central Committee and member of the Palestine National Council, said today in Amman that he has decided, along with a group of the cadres operating in the territories, to split in the wake of severe financial and administrative corruption within PFLP-GC ranks. The group that split from the PFLP-GC, led by Mustafa Khamis, accuses Ahmad Jibril and the PFLP-GC leadership of no longer being able to run the PFLP-GC, saying their fighting is not in the interest of the Palestinian people and its cause. Khamis said Jibril's nationalist attitude and his arrogance have driven him to destroy the PFLP-GC, noting that the decision to split follows the failure of the PFLP-GC leaders to persuade Jibril to change his unilateral conduct during the meetings of the PFLP-GC Central Committee, held in Damascus last month. The PFLP-GC was established in 1968 when Ahmad Jibril split, along with dozens of his supporters, from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, led by George Habash, against the background of personal competition between the two men over the leadership of the front. The PFLP-GC today forms a part of the Damascus-based Palestinian opposition factions.
