Speaking on an evening program of Crimean television, Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev said: "We have repeatedly emphasized that the Crimean Tatars do not recognize the institution of the presidency as set forth in the Crimean Law on the President of the Republic of Crimea." All the more so, Dzhemilev noted, because while adopting the law the Crimean parliament "completely ignored the rights of the Crimean Tatar people -- it dismissed without consideration the draft law On the President of the Crimean Republic." The Crimean Tatars nonetheless decided to take part in the presidential elections in order "to preserve peace and tranquillity in Crimea." Mustafa Dzhemilev recalled that the Crimean Tatars voted against Yuriy Meshkov and said that "any recognition of Meshkov as president is out of the question." The Crimean Tatar leader said further that everyone can see how often Yuriy Meshkov has changed his views: "What filthy epithets he used when speaking about Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, but now he calls him an outstanding politician of our time." The nonrecognition does not mean, however, Dzhemilev pointed out, that we will completely ignore the president. If Meshkov approaches our problems sensibly, we will support him, but, "unfortunately, his policy is aimed at confrontation." The Crimean Tatar leader said that the Assembly will convene on 19 February: "Some events are going to happen in the meantime, and we will definitely determine our stance on the Crimean presidency and personally on Meshkov." Mustafa Dzhemilev called Yuriy Meshkov's demands that the Assembly be registered as groundless and absurd. "This will never happen. We are in for yet another spiral of confrontation," Dzhemilev concluded.
