Top officials of the Japan Gas Association made the pledge during a breakfast meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister. Association chief Hiroshi Watanabe said the industry will make efforts to serve the interest both of customers and regions while enhancing competition under deregulation of government controls. The government panel unveiled a report in late January, calling for flexible price setting for large-lot gas users and new entries into the gas business. The industry will redouble efforts to reinforce its earnings base in order to secure a stable gas supply, said Watanabe, also chairman of Tokyo Gas Co. Referring to a recent spell of explosions and other accidents, MITI chief Kumagai asked the leaders to make the industry safer. The industry will take adequate steps based on the January recommendations, Watanabe said.
