This "willful lack of memory" brings to mind President [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's comments that General [Lino Cesar] Oviedo has nothing to do with the ANR [National Republic Association-Colorado Party]. He uttered these remarks in the wake of a pronouncement by ANR precincts about meddling by this military officer. After a matter of a few short weeks, the president--feigning total ignorance--has no idea what ties the wily old general has with his own party. It is a cardinal error to believe public opinion is blind and deaf. Interference by Gen. Oviedo in partisan politics in support of one ANR faction is conspicuously evident. This is nothing new. He has participated in meetings for months--and while refraining from disclosing the true objectives of his medium- and long-term plan--he has intentionally encouraged his friends and followers. He takes pride in exhibiting his allegiance to the Colorado Party and his adamant intention of keeping it in power for ever. The Colorado Party members who are secretly in love with him still believe it is irrelevant to display democratic behavior or consolidate the electoral majority. They favor the one who has the power that weapons confer on him in order to assure their political preeminence and de facto command. From an elementary civic standpoint, the stance of many Colorado Party members--the most retardative ones--vindicates our fateful past in the style of [General Alfredo] Stroessner and a new takeover of the ANR by a military clique. The opposition, which understandably fears the ambitious general, will try to investigate and punish--if need be--his meddling in politics. This may be a useless charge rather than an appropriate and sensible action. Beside being a somewhat dangerous adventure, confronting a general in our country is just an obdurate waste of breath. While it is true that Oviedo is gaining popularity among many Colorado Party members, many believe it is illogical to continue a false alliance with him. Yet there are those who feel at ease under the protection of this ubiquitous military officer and encourage the romance in spite of all obstacles. After all, one cannot deny he is putting on a good show.
