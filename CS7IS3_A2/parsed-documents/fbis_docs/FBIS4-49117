J. Tzou and Sofia Wu] [Text] Nice, France, May 2 (CNA) -- Taiwan plans to contribute US$15 million this year to the "Asia Development Fund" under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance infrastructure construction plans in less developed Asian countries, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said here Monday [2 May]. Li, heading a 10-member delegation, arrived in Nice Sunday to attend the 27th ADB annual meeting scheduled to open Tuesday. More than 70 percent of the 55 ADB members have agreed to a proposal to double the bank's capitalization to US$48 billion, Li said. Against this background, Li said, Taiwan plans to increase its annual contribution to the bank's US$32 billion six-phase Asia Development Fund to US$15 million this year. Taiwan, an ADB founding member, holds a 1.12 percent stake in the Manila-based bank. Li said all ADB members are required to inform bank management whether they support the proposed bank capital increment by mail before May 22. Li said he will issue a formal statement Wednesday urging the ADB to change Taiwan's designation in the bank to "Taipei China" instead of the current "Taipei, China." Taipei believes that the "Taipei, China" designation relegates Taiwan's government to a local government and not a sovereign political entity. Under Beijing's pressure, the ADB unilaterally changed Taiwan's designation from the "Republic of China [ROC]" to "Taipei, China" in 1986 when Beijing joined the bank. Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in protest of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. It resumed participation in ADB activities in 1988. Taipei has since consistently voiced protests against the name change during the annual ADB meeting. Li said he asked ADB Governor Mitsuo Sato to seriously consider the name issue during this year's meeting. "I told Sato during a meeting Monday that Taiwan wants its designation in the ADB to be changed to `Taipei China,'" he added. In reply, Sato said he understood Taiwan's stance and would pay "special attention" to the issue. The three-day ADB annual meeting will close Thursday.
