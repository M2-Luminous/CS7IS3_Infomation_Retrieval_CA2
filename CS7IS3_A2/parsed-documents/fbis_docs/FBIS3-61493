Pekur, Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics of the Atmosphere] [Abstract] From February 1989 to December 1991 the Institute of Physics of the Atmospphere of the Russian Academy of Sciences conducted regular measurements of concentrations of soot in the air over the city of Moscow. Aerosol samples were collected around the clock by two sampling devices, one located in the center and the other on the outskirts of the city. At the same time sodar observations of the type of stratification of the lower part of the boundary layer of the atmosphere and of the layer of intermingling were conducted, while information on reverse trajectories of the transfer of air masses and on the direction and velocity of the wind were obtained from the Hydrometeorological Center of the USSR. The correlations between these factors and soot concentrations were determined. Results of the monitoring of soot aerosol indicated that concentrations were very similar at both sampling stations. This appeared to be a result of the fact that the sources of soot pollution were evenly distributed throughout the city, and that the circulation of air over the city was such as to cause additional transfer and intermingling of pollutants. As a result of this concentrations tended to be the same over the entire urban area. Conclusions which can be drawn from the results of the monitoring are as follows: 1. Concentrations of soot in Moscow in 1991 were higher than in either of the two preceding years. 2. The soot content in the air over Moscow depends on the output volume of the sources of soot aerosol within the city--(these are mainly related to automobile traffic),--on wind velocity, and on the type of stratification of the boundary layer of the atmosphere. 3. In summer the city is cleared of soot through the arrival of clean Arctic air masses and as a result of convection, while an increase in soot concentration can be observed when surface inversions are present and during the time of the most intense automobile traffic. 4. In winter the highest concentrations of soot occur mainly during surface and raised inversions, and the lowest during uniform stratification and when the intensity of automobile traffic diminishes during the night hours.
