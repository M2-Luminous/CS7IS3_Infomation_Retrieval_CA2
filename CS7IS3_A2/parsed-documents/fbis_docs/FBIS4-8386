Sixty percent of the respondents to the opinion poll carried out by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] a month ago believed that his decisions weakened the state; 17 percent were of the opposite opinion. In another poll carried by CBOS two weeks ago, 5 percent of the respondents pointed at Walesa as the best candidate for president; Kwasniewski received 17 percent and Pawlak 10 percent. Lech Walesa will fight for the electorate. Even if he does not run in the presidential elections, he would certainly like to vacate the post with good ratings. If he manages to increase his popularity quite noticeably, if he has solid reasons to believe that he might win the election, he will run. During his term in office, Walesa plucked up the courage to make unpopular decisions; he probably knew in advance that they would not increase the number of his supporters in the traditional electorate--among dissatisfied people. He might have expected that, instead of that, he would gain new supporters among people advocating market reforms, among those who "took matters into their own hands." It seems that Walesa attempted to "change" his electorate and replace the "negative" electorate with "positive" voters. Now, toward the end of his presidency, it is clear that he has not made it. He lost a lot among the former and did not gain much among the latter. The same holds true of the political sphere: As he lost his rightist electorate, no new leftist supporters appeared. Today, there is no substantial group that, because of its material situation, interests, or views, would be mostly pro-Walesa. Most probably, over a year before the election, Walesa decided to fight for his former electorate--the dissatisfied people. Discussing the budget law, he recently wondered: "The question arises what is more important to the reforms--`mathematical problems' or the understanding of the people." This may mean that he will be less inclined to make decisions this group might not like. The dissatisfied are now favoring the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], the Polish Peasant Party, the Union of Labor, and Solidarity. Many of those people do not define their political preferences and do not go to the polls. Walesa won the sympathy of trade unions by vetoing the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. It is not known, however, to what extent it really reflects the moods of employees. Why is Walesa speaking about the return of communism, about Stalin as Kwasniewski's idol? Among other reasons, because some of the votes supporting the SLD were cast not by staunch supporters of this group but by people who were dissatisfied with the reforms that had been carried out before. Lech Walesa would now like to win them over to his side. The slogan "Down with communism" may still be an effective political weapon. Part of society will forgive a consistent spokesman of such a slogan many mistakes. However, will Walesa manage to achieve that? The people Walesa might win over with this slogan may remember his strengthening of the left pillar; some of them even accuse him of collaborating with the Security Service as an agent named "Bolek." There is still a long way to the election, and Walesa may be retrieving the points he has lost. He is the president and has much greater possibilities than any other candidate will have. On the other hand, this is also a fundamental obstacle. Other candidates will be able to present their voters with a vision of the future without any limitations. Walesa is being carefully observed by the mass media, and he may always be accused of making a populist decision. Such decisions may be more of an obstacle than an advantage for him.
