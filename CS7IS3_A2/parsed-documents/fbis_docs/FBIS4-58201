We realize Nabil Sha'th's need to expedite the achievement of his dream so that the doors will open to his political consultations and his trade companies for his sons and relatives so that they can enter the territories that have been forbidden to them and so that they can inherit the companies, institutions, calculators, and typewriters of the coming authority. But, we wanted Nabil Sha'th and his group to visit, instead, one of the Zionist barriers that prevent our people from reaching the al-Aqsa Mosque to perform their prayers and from reaching the markets so that the defenseless citizens will be able to buy even some of their necessities and find some food for their children. Our correspondents from the West Bank and Gaza Strip report: We wanted Nabil Sha'th to see al-Malha market, which was built by the Zionist enemy, so that he could see how the operation of stabbing two Zionist soldiers yesterday has shown the ineffectiveness of the Zionist siege on Jerusalem and its suburbs. We wanted Sha'th to come to Ya'bad and Barta'ah to see how the soldiers of terrorist Rabin raid our people's homes and wreak havoc and destruction inside them. But, Sha'th insists on staying in Cairo. From there, he can emerge from his seclusion, which has lasted more than 24 hours, to stand in front of cameras and television screens and announce that an agreement has been reached, which he has announced dozens of times. He insists on staying in Cairo so that he can meet with Shulamit Aloni, the Zionist minister who has bragged in front of many Arabs that the doors of the entire world are now open to the Zionist entity. Sha'th insists on seclusion until the signing of the agreement but, of course, he does not hesitate to receive the raven, the godfather [al-ghurab al-'arrab], Christopher, after his U.S.-Zionist administration granted the so-called self-rule policemen cars to be used to protect the Zionist settlers in Gaza and Jericho and to repress our people who stress their rejection of the accord of disgrace and treason. What really counts is not seclusion but the continued heroic actions, like yesterday, which was known as the day of knife war. As we wait for the results of the open session, until the 'Arafat-Zionist agreement is signed, and for the results of Christopher's tour of the region, Zionist terrorism against our people continues, far from the atmosphere of Sha'th's optimism. Moreover, land confiscation continues in order to open more settlement roads and to displace our people. Within this context, terrorist (Gabriash 'Ahahl), the so-called security officer in the settlement council in Hebron, warned about another massacre similar to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It should also be noted that the head of the settlements council in Qiryat Arba' earlier made threats before the Zionist committee investigating the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that a new massacre would be perpetrated in Hebron by a settler using a machine gun against the Arabs. Our kinsfolk in Hebron, who are facing this Zionist threat with more patience and giving, refuted the military spokesman's claims that martyr al-Waridat tried to stab a Zionist soldier. Citing eyewitnesses, the Zionist newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST affirms that these claims are false. The paper notes that these claims are false and that the criminal soldier had been known to be carrying out repressive and barbaric acts against the citizens in Hebron for weeks. At the end of their news report, our correspondents warned against Zionist deception in light of this game of distracting the attention of the Palestinians by preoccupying them with the issue of redeploying Rabin's soldiers in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. It has also been noted that the Zionists are taking advantage of certain gaps in our people's ranks, created by 'Arafat's supporters, in order to strike at their unity and undermine their efforts through secondary issues which, as everyone knows, are nothing more than a cheap Zionist bribe to the pro-'Arafat delegation in order to peddle the accord of treason. Moreover, the our correspondents warned against these meetings that some Palestinian opposition members are holding with representatives of the Zionist Israeli military command, which is not seeking their opinion on the Muslims' position on the Oslo accord inasmuch as they are seeking to drive a wedged into the Palestinian ranks and to break their solidarity for refusing to deal with the Zionists.
