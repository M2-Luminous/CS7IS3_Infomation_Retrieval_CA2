Its main aim is certainly to rapidly free Sarajevo from its mortal stranglehold. From now on, the person carrying out a new blind shot against a civil target in the Bosnian capital has been warned that he is exposing himself to immediate punishment. And in 10 days the main part of the threat should have disappeared. In this respect it can only be regretted that this decision came so late and that last Saturday's [5 February] horrible massacre was necessary for it to be taken. This ultimatum means that the international community has found a burst of new energy, just as it was starting to become tired of its impotence in the Yugoslav conflict and was ready to let go. With this regained will and firmness, this community can start to regain some credibility. In this respect too, it was high time. The determined NATO intervention could also mark a turning point in the Bosnian crisis. "Sarajevo first of all," the French foreign minister said, indicating that there is no question of renouncing the demands of the other besieged enclaves. If it bears fruit, the therapy applied to the Bosnian capital could also be extended to Tuzla and Srebenica, and tomorrow to Mostar or the other towns and regions where the warring parties, be they Serbs, Croats or Muslims, are attacking civilians. For the rest it is hard to imagine that with one of the sides having been brought back to its senses, another could carry out the same exactions with impunity. The Atlantic Alliance is now applying a strategy of dissuasion- persuasion. It does not want to carry out air strikes or increase the level of violence. On the contrary its aim is to avoid them and to exercise military pressure so that negotiations lead to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, then its administration by the United Nations, the first step in the realization of the peace plan proposed by the Europeans. This could be the start of a new dynamic. The threat of reprisals could certainly cause a hostile reaction from the Serbs and lead them into a build-up of violence. However, they know that the relationship of forces is less favorable to them at present and that by engaging themselves against far more sophisticated technology they would risk losing their heavy weapons, which are one of their main advantages. There is no doubt that they will think twice before exposing themselves to Western aviation. By forcing NATO to attack them, they would also remind the world that they are the main aggressors in this conflict which they have virtually won. Russia too is raising its voice, but the message also applies to it. In reality the authors of the ultimatum attach little importance to its protests, but are inviting it to join the peace efforts and put maximum pressure on its Serbian allies so that they will hear reason. NATO's decision is also, in this respect, a sort of answer to Moscow's neo-imperialist temptations, telling it that there is no place for a return of its influence on its former satellites, and that it must make a choice between cooperation or exclusion. Finally the Europeans and Americans have rediscovered the virtues and effectiveness of cooperation. Just as the United Nations and NATO have found a new articulation and complementariness. The lesson is for the West itself, which has displayed its divisions during the 22 months of the Bosnian conflict. Even if NATO's reaction is late, it means that there is a politically operational guarantee of stability in Europe in the uncertain period following the end of the Cold War. Those who could have thought that anything was allowed in Europe now know that there is a limit to the infamy.
