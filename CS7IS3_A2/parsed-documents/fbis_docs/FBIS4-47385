One is the Mark III profiler, produced by NBIS, USA. Katran 04M probes made by the Akvastandard Scientific Production Association in Sevastopol are used at other levels for economic reasons. To obtain fine structure profiles and high-resolution cross sections on the route, scanning is used with an amplitude which provides a certain overlap of levels at a boat speed of 3 m/s. Two scanning modes are available, one which minimizes overlap to increase horizontal resolution, and one which has a large overlap to increase the sounding depth. The Mark III probe is the fourth from the surface in the configuration displayed in the paper. The communication cable length may extend to 3 km without adverse effect. Illustrations show the configuration of the system and the trajectories of the probes in scanning mode. Data is recorded on a IBM PC/AT 386 clone. Profiles may be displayed in real time, but not printed (printing interferes with measurement). Examples of profiles obtained in Gulf Stream research are shown. The probes may be used together, separately, or in any combination. Figures 6; table 1; references 4: 2 Russian, 2 Western.
