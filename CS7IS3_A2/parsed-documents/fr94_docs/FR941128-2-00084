The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in licensing technology. If AHP has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to AHP of the identity of any proposed trustee, AHP shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 2.

Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, AHP shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to enter into the Rotavirus Exclusive License as required by this Order. 4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in Paragraph VI.C.3 to accomplish the Rotavirus Exclusive License required by Paragraph VI of this Order, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve (12) month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of licensing or believes that exclusive licensing can be achieved within a reasonable time, the twelve (12) month period may be extended by the Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend the twelve (12) month period only two (2) times. 5.

Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's ability to accomplish the exclusive licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required by this Order. Any delays in exclusively licensing Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required by this Order caused by Respondent shall extend the time under Paragraph VI.C.4 for accomplishing the exclusive licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required by this Order in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for the court-appointed trustee, by the court.
