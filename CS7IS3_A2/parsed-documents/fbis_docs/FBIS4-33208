It continued discussing the rules and regulations that will govern the Constituent Assembly sessions. Neuquen Grand Front Jaime De Nevares has resigned as a constituent assembly member. The Neuquen bishop emeritus supported his resignation, claiming that the Constituent Assembly "is completely null and void," adding that the Constituent Assembly is "a farce." With De Nevares' departure, the Grand Front loses a seat because vacant seats are not replaced after members have taken the oath. [passage omitted]
