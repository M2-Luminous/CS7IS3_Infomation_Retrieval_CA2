The move also appeared intended to clarify remarks to reporters by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii early Thursday denying any intention of a net tax increase in the new tax plan decided by the government. The plan calls for 6 trillion yen worth of tax cuts, including 5.3 trillion yen in national income and local resident's tax, to be paid for by the new 7 percent tax, to be adopted in April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax. The MOF said the new tax is expected to generate new revenues of some 9.5 billion yen a year, while the tax cuts amount to 6 trillion yen. Regarding the net revenues of 3.5 trillion yen, it cited some 800 billion yen needed in additional welfare spending, about 1.3 trillion yen in increased burdens from the new tax on government purchases of goods and services, and some 1.4 trillion yen in repayments of principal on bonds. The ministry estimates that some 18 trillion yen in short-term government bonds must be issued to cover the three-year period before implementation of the new tax, and over 10 years are needed for principal repayments, or longer if interest is included. Referring to the three-year time lag before adopting the new tax, Fujii told reporters that the government hopes to get the economy on a full-fledged recovery track in fiscal 1994 and into stable growth in fiscal 1995. The extra year is to monitor economic growth, he said. He pledged utmost efforts to win public support for the new tax and stressed that revenues would go to social welfare. Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced by a law stipulating that it is "politically objective," Fujii said. Details are yet to be decided but will include pensions and social infrastructure for welfare primarily in line with a government "welfare vision" to be compiled by March, Fujii said. Meanwhile, Fujii did not rule out the possibility of raising the new tax rate further in future.
