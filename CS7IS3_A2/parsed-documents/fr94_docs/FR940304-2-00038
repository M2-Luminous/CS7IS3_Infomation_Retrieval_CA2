FR940304-2-00038 FR940304-2-00030 [FRL&hyph;4845&hyph;4] Draft Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity Risk Assessment AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of availability of external review draft. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of the external review draft of the ``Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity Risk Assessment'' (EPA/600/AP&hyph;94/001). In 1988, EPA published separate Proposed Guidelines for Assessing Male Reproductive Risk (53 FR 24850&hyph;24869) and Proposed Guidelines for Assessing Female Reproductive Risk (53 FR 24834&hyph;24847). Following public comment, the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed the proposed guidelines and recommended several changes, including combining the two guidelines. These draft guidelines have been prepared in response to the SAB and public comments and have been updated to reflect current scientific thinking in this area. In particular, the female component was expanded substantially but the original basic concepts were retained. Since a number of changes have been made in this version of the guidelines from the original proposed guidelines, and due to the time elapsed since the proposals, EPA is asking for review and comment. This notice makes these draft guidelines available for public comment. Once comments are received, the guidelines will be reviewed by the EPA's Science Advisory Board before final publication. DATES: The Agency will make the external review draft available on or about March 4, 1994. Comments must be submitted in writing and must be postmarked by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: To obtain a single copy of this document, interested parties should contact the ORD publications office, CERI&hyph;FRN, U. S.

This document also will be available for public inspection on the ORD Public Information Shelf of the EPA Headquarters Library, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Library hours are from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. Information submitted in response to this notice may be mailed to Dr. Eric D. Clegg, Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Branch (8602), Human Health Assessment Group, Office of Health and Environmental Assessment, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Harry Teitelbaum, Technical Liaison, Risk Assessment Forum (8101), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, Tel: (202) 260&hyph;6743. (Copies of the document are not available at this address). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is making available for public comment an external review draft of the Guidelines for Reproductive Toxicity Risk Assessment. Changes made based on previous public comment and SAB review include combining the separate guidelines for assessing male and female reproductive risk into a single document, integrating the hazard identification and dose-response sections, assuming as a default that an agent for which sufficient data are available on only one sex may also affect reproductive function in the other sex, expansion of the section on interpretation of female endpoints, and consideration of the benchmark dose approach for quantitative risk assessment. Members of the public have the opportunity to submit written comments within the 45-day comment period. EPA will consider all comments received within that period. Dated: February 23, 1994. Carl R. Gerber, Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4994 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
