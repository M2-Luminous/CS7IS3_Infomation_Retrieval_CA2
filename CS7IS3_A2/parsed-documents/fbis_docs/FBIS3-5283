Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki Kumano told a press conference that it is possible that some parts of the four-point package, originally planned for release by the end of March, will be unveiled toward the July summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Naples. Kumano was referring to remarks earlier in the day by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura indicating a possible delay in the market-opening measures beyond the end of fiscal 1993. Market-opening steps in four areas are being worked out by the government following the breakdown in February of the trade "framework" talks with the United States. The areas are deregulation, import and investment promotion, government procurement systems and competition policy. The Naples summit could become a new deadline for some of the four measures, Kumano said. He declined to comment on which sectors might be delayed.
