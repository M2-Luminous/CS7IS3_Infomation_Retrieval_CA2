The planned move is intended to stem the rate increases in domestic telephone charges, the rent for public housing, taxi fares, tolls for the nation's expressways and fire insurance premiums, the top government spokesman told a news conference. The government will also ask local autonomies to refrain from raising fees charged for their bus and subway services, Kumagai said. The premier ordered Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa on Tuesday to move quickly to carry out the measure. The cabinet will approve the scheme at its regular meeting on Friday, according to Kumagai.
