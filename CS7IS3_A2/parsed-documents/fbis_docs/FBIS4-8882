[Mikelic] After three months, since the second round of elections in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and a little over a month since I have been appointed the prime minister-designate of the republic of Serbian Krajina, now on the eve of the assembly session which will take place on 20 April, we have found possibilities to form the government of national unity for which I have been striving from the very beginning. I must say that really a lot of effort and patience has been invested to coordinate views. [passage omitted] I am glad that Dr. Babic has risen above the signing of the parliamentary coalition and agreed to the formation of the government of national unity. This means that he has placed the national interest and the interest of the people above the advantages of a parliamentary coalition. We have coordinated the approach toward the formation of the government of national unity entirely, be it regarding the ministries or personnel fine-tuning. What is probably the most important for the listeners of Radio Belgrade and Argument Vise [Argument More] program is that I have accomplished full accord on all issues with [word indistinct] Krajina, that is to say, Dr. Milan Babic. [passage omitted] To point out some of the names, I can say that Dr. Milan Babic will be foreign minister, Ilija Price interior minister, and Dr. Rade Tanjga defense minister, while Dr. Branko Petrovic will be economics minister. [Words indistinct] for me to enumerate them here. [Jerotijevic] In any case, thanks a lot. The listeners of Argument Vise program had the opportunity to hear the first, at least, of some of the names of ministers, that is to say, the names of the ministers that seem to be the most important. Have a good trip, Mr. Mikelic. [Mikelic] Thank you!
