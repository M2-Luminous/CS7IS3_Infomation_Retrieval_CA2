This subpart implements a program under which swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock that are retained in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish specified in §630.23(b) must be retained for donation through the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network to the needy. This program is intended to obtain additional information regarding the harvest, mortality, and biological characteristics of swordfish less than the minimum size limit and to avoid waste of swordfish that would otherwise be discarded dead. §630.51 Participation. (a) General. Owners of vessels and dealers permitted under §630.4 may volunteer to participate in the swordfish donation program by contacting the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713&hyph;2347, facsimile (301) 588&hyph;4967. The Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, will select owners of vessels and dealers who may participate in the donation program and will keep selected vessel owners advised of the selected dealers. (1) Factors that will be considered in the selection process include: (i) History of voluntary participation in NMFS cooperative scientific programs; (ii) Whether both vessel and dealer volunteers can be matched in an area throughout the year (including truck routes) to ensure distribution of donated fish; (iii) Representative coverage of the fishery, to the extent possible; and (iv) Compliance record of volunteers. Specifically, any person who has been issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) for violating any provision of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 et seq. ), the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq. ), or the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. ), or who is currently under investigation for such a violation, may be excluded from the program. (2) Selected dealers will also be advised of the selected vessel owners and of authorized Second Harvest recipients of donated swordfish.
