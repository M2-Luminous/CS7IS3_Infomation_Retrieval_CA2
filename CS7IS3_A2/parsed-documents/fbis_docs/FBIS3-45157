He also warned that the re-opening of airport negotiations could be affected by the refusal of the Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, to attend a meeting of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on the Airport Corporation Bill. Speaking in Beijing yesterday, Mr Lu, the Director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, voiced his opposition to granting extra funds to the new airport plan. Mr Lu said China could not agree to the funding request, put to the Legislative Council on Monday [10 January]. He denounced the Government for refusing to make a commitment on financing the airport projects. "To follow the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) the Government's level of debt has to be limited to $5 billion," he said. "There is a surplus of over $100 billion, it can inject a certain amount to the new airport construction." Mr Lu also questioned the Government's claim that it could leave $78 billion in reserves to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government while virtually refusing to make a commitment. In response, a government spokesman said: "We haven't seen the precise report of Mr Lu's comment but we are puzzled to hear suggestions that we are taking a unilateral action and that they were not informed." He said papers on the funding options had been given to the Chinese side of the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee last week. "What we have done is in line with the MOU. We are trying to maintain the momentum of the airport and to complete the projects to the maximum extent possible by mid-1997," he said. The spokesman said if the Chinese side had new proposals which helped reach an agreement, the Government would be happy to hear them. In a paper circulated to Legco members on Monday, the Government proposed two options for taking the airport projects forward. One envisaged a request for a one-off grant of $377 million for the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to allow it to finish works currently underway. The other suggested that on top of the airport body's running cost for the next financial year, funds totalling $1.3 billion should be made available to pay for three urgent construction projects. Mr Lu said: "(The Government) hasn't discussed with us its decision to seek temporary funding from Legco. To this unilateral move we can never give our consent." Under the Sino-British airport accord, which was signed in September 1991, China endorsed the airport proposal provided that Britain agreed to leave $25 billion in reserves for the post 1997 government, as well as to keep the level of government debt below $5 billion. On the disposal of land along the airport railway, Mr Lu rejected the British suggestion that the 58 hectares should be granted in one go. "If the land supply increases suddenly by about 60 hectares, how can one say that this will have no impact on the overall land supply [in the market]?" Mr Lu said there was no way that China would give its consent even though the British Hong Kong authorities had agreed to make concessions on the financial arrangements. Referring to the Airport Corporation Bill, Mr Lu said the Chinese authorities could not share the Government's view that there would be adequate scrutiny of the future airport management body. Despite the fact that the bill outlined that the Government was empowered to act on public interest, Mr Lu said: "When you realise that there are public interests concerned, you probably have to pay compensation (to the other signatories of agreements). "Therefore, we asked the Government to come and explain to the PWC, given it said it would have adequate power to control the corporation. The PWC members are advisers to us." Mr Lu said the PWC had decided to invite Mr Siu to explain the bill, seizing the opportunity of his scheduled visit to Beijing to sign an agreement with the civil aviation authority. "If things carry on like this, it remains doubtful as to when the airport negotiation will resume," he said. In Hong Kong, 14 Hong Kong affairs advisers yesterday told local XINHUA (New China News Agency) officials that China and Britain should try to strike a deal on the airport projects as soon as possible.
