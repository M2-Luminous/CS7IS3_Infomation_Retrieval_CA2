They are called security services, but their area of expertise is somewhat unusual. Apart from protecting shipments, people, and installations, they are called upon to fight terrorism at gas production facilities. They also guard the pipeline that pumps gas abroad. The bulk of the group is made up of former KGB and Internal Affairs Ministry staffers. They all are authorized to carry firearms, which, however, have never been used. Those who do not have the right to carry guns are now completing a crash course to receive a certificate required by the Internal Affairs Ministry authorization department.
