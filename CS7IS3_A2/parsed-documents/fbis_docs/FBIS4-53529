FBIS4-53529 "dreas098_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 North Korea Japan Said Using Nuclear Issue To Expand Military Japan Said Using Nuclear Issue To Expand Military SK2005055094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0529 GMT 20 May 94 SK2005055094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Crafty Ruse"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Ichiro Ozawa and other ultra-rightists of Japan are openly making haste with the completion of legal preparations for military expansion overseas, raising a terrific hue and cry over "a security crisis" with regard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated recently that the government was examining "emergency legislative arrangements" for the reaction of the "self-defense forces" in "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, taking issue with the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. And the general director of the defense agency and the chief cabinet secretary also said that practical preparations for "security emergency legislative arrangements" had been completed by and large. The "security crisis" advertised by the Japanese rulers is a sheer fiction. No one threatens or intends to attack Japan today. Their outcries over "a security crisis" are a sophism for justifying their hostile policy against the DPRK and their scheme to stage a military comeback to Korea. In actuality, the reactionary ruling circles of Japan, peddling the ware of "security crisis," are seeking to establish "an emergency system" and "a wartime mobilisation system" through the "security emergency legislative arrangements" against "an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and legally gratify their desire of military reinvasion. Japan has made all military and material preparations for reinvasion. What remains to be done is to create a legal foundation allowing it. In advertising "a security crisis" over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries also intend to prop up the unstable present government by sidetracking the attention of the Japanese people. The militarists manipulated by the force of Ichiro Ozawa are wringing their own necks in the suicidal act of getting overheated in the reinvasion moves while crying for the establishment of "an emergency system." The Asian people are highly vigilant against the reinvasion moves of the Japanese right-wing reactionaries. The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters should face the reality squarely and give up their foolish attempt to repeat the past crimes.
