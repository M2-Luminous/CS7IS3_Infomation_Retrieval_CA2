Security has been beefed up, particularly around the Argentine Embassy, some 100 meters from the Belgian residence, in Miramar District (western Havana). A special brigade truck and two patrol vehicles are blocking the street by the mission. Also, dozens of security guards, some armed with AK-47 rifles, were seen guarding the area for the first time since the beginning of the crisis. The intense deployment apparently is due to rumors of the imminent departure of would-be emigres to Argentine diplomatic missions. The situation appeared to be at a standstill in the Belgian residence, which has been occupied for 10 days by 68 men, 32 women, and 24 children. Belgian and Cuban representatives have been in daily contact, while Belgian special envoy Willy Verriest is intent on trying to convince the refugees to leave the building.
