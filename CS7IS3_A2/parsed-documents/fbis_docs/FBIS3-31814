This issue is being discussed in our foreign and domestic policy. Let me be frank and leave no holds barred -- why should it want us? President Vaclav Havel has expressed his view on the appropriateness of our incorporation into Western Europe's defense structure. With all due respect for his views, formulated with the brilliant reasoning of a great stylist, I can only say that they were merely a manifestation of an intellectual reasoning with which it is impossible to disagree, but they have no practical effect. However, it is impossible to look at Europe (and all the more so the whole world) only from the perspective of a country that in this century has hardly contributed to the defense of democracy, if we do not count the handful of very courageous people -- including the members of the small domestic resistance movement -- who, during the First and Second World Wars, fought alongside the Allies. The far greater part of the nation -- by its silent loyalty, its elbow grease, and its participation in demonstrations -- supported both the throne of the aged kaiser and the Reich's struggle against Bolshevism and Western plutocracy. The cottage-beerhouse "resistance" during the recent totalitarianism is within living memory: Again, a handful of dissidents and -- apart from them -- the nation. The former marched with their heads against the wall and the latter with their faces turned against the May Day platform. Incidentally, little force was needed to import communism into the Czechoslovak Republic; it is enough to read the proclamation "Forward, Not a Step Back" published in RUDE PRAVO immediately after 25 February 1948. The names that we find there take our breath away: These names had the same significance and same symbolism in the later struggle against communism as do the names we come across, for example, in the list of State Security collaborators. This is not an accusation, it is a statement of the fact that the human disposition is changeable, because it is made up of human experience and sometimes -- sadly -- of human ignorance. They do not want us in NATO for several reasons, which can be divided roughly into three groups: 1. Technical-military reasons; 2. Psychological reasons; 3. Moral reasons. Technical-Military Reasons Even for the Western states it would not -- in the current economic crisis -- be easy to finance the rearmament of the Czech Army, as some of our politicians are hoping. Some of our weapons are so obsolete that the term antediluvian comes to mind. The once state-of-the-art infantry weaponry, the core of which was formed by the type-57 assault rifle, is of a caliber that does not correspond to NATO's 5.56-mm ammunition. The electronic, radar, and radio-technical equipment does not correspond to the parameters for modern warfare and the obsolescence of the Air Force compared with the North Atlantic Alliance's air forces can be equated with the pre-war situation against the Luftwaffe. Our tanks, the main strike force of the armies in World War II, cannot -- even though they are the top of the range of a series of celebrated Soviet T-types -- compete with the German Leopard II's or the U.S. AM-I's. Assuming the financial burden of this rearmament is beyond the current ability of the Western economy and how our budget would take care of it, well, that is written in the stars. Psychological Reasons Relying on the military power of a partner, a power that -- understandably -- does not only consist of the strength of its armaments and the size of its army, would be risky for the NATO forces. This partner has already capitulated without a fight several times, and that with a well-equipped army. It would be all the more risky in view of the fact that, not so long ago, the representatives of the new democratic regime in the velvet euphoria of their first appearance on the international scene suggested to Western statesmen that NATO be abolished as a reciprocal gesture for the abolition of the (disintegrating) Warsaw Pact. The army of a nation and state that has still not come to terms with its previous capitulations and has not accepted them internally cannot be a reliable ally. This nation has not come to terms not only with its communist past, but also with its Nazi past. One phenomenon links these two pasts -- the weakness of the resistance or, at least, the resistance against the totalitarian regime! This is borne out by the fact that our domestic policy is today characterized by quarrels and disputes over whether the Czech Army should fight for "someone else's" interests. The strong left wing, and mainly its international communist militant part, are always trying to undermine any involvement by the Czech Army on the side of the Western democracies, which only yesterday were its mortal enemy. (It is possible to ask Comrade Ortman or Comrade Grebenicek if they still are today.) In our evaluation by the West, the meager psychological ability or inability to put up real resistance to violence and totalitarianism is -- perhaps -- our biggest failing. I can imagine what the outburst would be in parliament and the individual political parties (and, subsequently, among the public) if a request to dispatch our expeditionary force, for example, to Yugoslavia were to come up on the agenda. Moral Reasons If what was written in CESKY DENIK about General Nekvasil, chief of the Czech Army General Staff, is true, then it is unnecessary to write more: We really have no business being in NATO. Here even Vaclav Havel's most effective reasoning loses its meaning. Even if it were not true, however, it is an incontestable fact that our generals studied in the USSR. There is no need to write that no one knows about the list of KGB agents. It would be illogical to ask the people now enthusing about democracy (for generals' and colonels' salaries, of course), people immersed in communist indoctrination, whose medal ribbons are overwhelmingly red and whose uniforms still glitter with stars, really to fight for this democracy or even fight for the democracy of Western countries. They are aware of this in the FRG, where former East German generals and colonels today command companies and squadrons as warrant officers and squadron leaders, if they are still in the army. An army that, despite all the screenings and performance reviews, has not been able to purge itself and from which hundreds of young officers, the least affected by communist indoctrination (whom no one promoted or appointed to responsible posts in place of the "most orthodox") have resigned in disillusion cannot enjoy the confidence of NATO and cannot be its loyal partner -- all the more so in view of the fact that, long after the anti-communist revolution, this army was commanded by a general who had previously served as the nomenklatura supremo of the communist army and later as the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia's camp spokesman. If our army is not to play the role of a fifth column in the future struggle for the interests of civilization and democracy, many things will still have to change not only in Europe and the Czech Republic, but -- first and foremost -- in its corps of commanders. The issue involves making sure that the slogan of a fallen Soviet soldier in World War II, written in blood where he fell, also applies to it: "There is nowhere to withdraw to, Moscow is behind us." Our army still has somewhere to withdraw to -- to its communist past or to its post-communist present.
