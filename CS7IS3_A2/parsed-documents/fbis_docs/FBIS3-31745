We asked him on this occasion, shortly before Prime Minister Peter Boross's official visit to Paris, to assess our relations with France. [Martin] How do relations with France fit into the system of Hungarian foreign politics? [Martonyi] We continue to see French relations as a cardinal element of Hungary's foreign relations. I could also phrase it this way: Paris has two dimensions from Budapest's point of view, one is bilateral relations, and the other is that France is one of the determining factors in our Europe policy. As for bilateral relations, it has been said many times that, throughout history, Hungarian-French relations have never been as good as now. And these relations are constantly improving. Consulting with the general secretary of the Foreign Ministry a few days ago, we established that our views are identical on most issues, although some differences of approach exist on certain issues. Therefore, in my view, we cannot do much more in the area of bilateral relations, except encouraging more capital investment by French investors, and we try to improve domestic conditions for this. We continue to try to strengthen the French presence in Hungary from the economic, financial, trade, cultural, political, and psychological points of view equally. I believe that there is also much improvement in the public view in our societies: The French image in Hungary has never been as good as now, and I trust that Hungary's image is also good in France, apart from some minor disturbing factors. However, the latter apply to all Central Eastern Europe, not specifically to Hungary. [passage omitted] [Martin] For many decades, Hungary was not France's chosen state in Central Eastern Europe. Bucharest was France's number one partner. Can you see any change in this area? [Martonyi] In my view, Hungarian-French relations have gone through a qualitative improvement in the past three to four years. We have never made it our goal to improve these relations to the detriment of other countries. To the contrary, in our view, French politics that are much more balanced than in the past can contribute with increasing efficiency in resolving our problems. We saw this in the Balladur plan from the first moment, this is why we still support this proposal. In other words, we do not want to improve our relations with France by worsening relations with others, and I do not even wish to evaluate the way Paris assesses the current situation in Romania and the most recent change of government in Bucharest. Our interest is that views on Central Europe generally improve. [passage omitted] [Martin] From the implementation of the Balladur plan, Hungarian diplomacy expects the improvement of the life of national minorities living in the neighboring countries. However, it seems that a number of Western European countries and institutions would prefer to step back in granting national minority rights. Is there a danger that a document will again be prepared that is not adhered to? [Martonyi] Risks do exist, but we can exclude the possibility of the situation becoming worse after an initiative like this. We have to seize all opportunities, in the Council of Europe and in other places. We trust that, even if slowly and with difficulties, progress can be made: This is Hungarian diplomacy's basic strategic goal. We need to be very industrious. As regards the final outcome of the European Union plan that is launched from the French prime minister's proposal, I might be more optimistic than the average European. In my view, this is a correct idea that wants to make up for a deficiency and it can take us closer to the solution. Naturally, if the necessary willingness to cooperate is completely missing from the participants, there is a risk that we will not be able to make any progress. However, this cannot mean that we will not try. [passage omitted]
