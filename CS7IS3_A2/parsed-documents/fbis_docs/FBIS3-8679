The participants, who chanted slogans supporting Vladimir Meciar and calling on Michal Kovac to resign, gathered in Slovak National Uprising Square. Thinking that the president was holding talks with the opposition on the forming of a new government, they transferred to in front of the Primacialny Palace, which is Kovac's residence. According to Jozef Sitko, director of the Presidential Office press department, the republican leadership of the Movement for a Demcratic Slovakia is holding a meeting in Spisska Nova Ves. According to previous statements, President Michal Kovac intended to ask the strongest group in the parliament, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, to form a new cabinet. He is likely to hold talks with the representatives of parliamentary parties on Monday [14 March], when we can expect bigger rallies in support of Vladimir Meciar.
