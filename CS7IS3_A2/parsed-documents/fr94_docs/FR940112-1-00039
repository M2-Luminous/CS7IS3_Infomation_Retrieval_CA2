Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 3E4269 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer when used as an inert ingredient (encapsulating agent) in pesticide formulations for application to animals. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in support of the current exemption and also the data submitted in this petition have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described below, normally required to support cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below. In the case of certain chemical substances which are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects. In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer conforms to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria which are used to identify low risk polymers: 1. The minimum average molecular weight of the above-mentioned polymer is 5 X 10 13 . Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not readily absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through the skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response. 2. The above-mentioned polymer is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment. 3. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon. 4. The above-mentioned polymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. 5. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii). 6. The above-mentioned polymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact. 7. The above-mentioned polymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups. 8. The above-mentioned polymer does not contain reactive functional groups that are intended or reasonably anticipated to undergo further reaction. 9. The above-mentioned polymer is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300137]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Dated: December 23, 1993. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1001(e) is amended by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredient, to read as follows: §180.1001 Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* 1Inert ingredients 1Limits 1Uses ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* Cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer ␣ Encapsulating agent ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* [FR Doc. 94&hyph;764 Filed 1&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
