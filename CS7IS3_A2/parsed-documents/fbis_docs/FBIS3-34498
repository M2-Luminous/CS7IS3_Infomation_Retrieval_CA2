Nobody differs on that. But there have been complaints against these policemen which must be mentioned. We have received many complaints about their behavior and maltreatment of certain innocent individuals. Despite the fact these individuals carried documents proving their correct status, the military policemen treated them as wrongdoers or deserters. The complaints include one sent by citizen (J-'A), from Madinat al-Hurriyah who was apprehended by a military police detachment and remanded for five days despite the fact that he carried an end of service document which was issued by the Ministry of Defense. Still, they did not recognize it! [passage omitted]
