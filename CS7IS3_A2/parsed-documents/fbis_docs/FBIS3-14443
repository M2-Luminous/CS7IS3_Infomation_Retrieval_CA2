According to this agreement the daily production level of the 12 member countries is 24.52 million barrels, which is really the same as the present ceiling production level. Thus oil experts believe the approved OPEC ceiling not only fails to support the present low oil prices, it will aggravate the process of their reduction. It should be noted that the OPEC secretariat had earlier warned that the failure of the member countries to reduce daily oil production by about one million barrels would lead to further price cuts. But despite the interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the majority of the members, obstructionism by the largest OPEC producer forced the session to an unrealistic agreement which was in turn accompanied by greater dissatisfaction of the OPEC members. Oil market fluctuation in the past six months -- which led to oil price reductions and a subsequent upset in the oil income of the oil exporting countries -- forced the OPEC members to seek a solution, through diplomacy and discussions with other non-OPEC producers, to control production and strengthen oil prices. And eight non-OPEC oil exporting countries said they were prepared to reduce a maximum of 250,000 barrels from their daily production. Considering the surplus oil supply and in particular with the coming of spring and summer when demand generally decreases due to warmer weather, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed that the present production ceiling should be reduced by six percent. This would have strengthened the oil market and experts believe oil prices would have increased by four dollars. The OPEC general secretary and some other member countries also thought reduction of production ceiling was a necessary realistic measure and the only means of improving prices in the present conditions. However due to the opposition of Saudi Arabia, the opportunity for success was lost and in the view of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other OPEC members, the responsibility for the process of oil price reduction lies with those who did not wish for a reasonable OPEC understanding and agreement. But our country, despite its dissatisfaction with the continuation of the previous production ceiling for the next nine months, will continue to respect OPEC regulations and will adhere to the new agreement and calls on all other member countries for commitment to the approved quotas and the need for strong political will towards the improvement of the oil market.
