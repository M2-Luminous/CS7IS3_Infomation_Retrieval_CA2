"The Vatican is alway raising the issue of humanitarian intervention," the pope said in a written statement during his weekly audience. "That doesn't necessarily mean military intervention, but rather undertaking any action aimed at `disarming' the aggressor." He did not elaborate on which party he meant by `aggressor' and what sort of action should be taken to stop the war in Bosnia. "According to the moral teachings of the Church, any military aggression is considered morally wrong," he said. "But legitimate defense is, on the contrary, considered acceptable and even a duty at times." Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said that the pontiff believes that the international community is currently in a position to apply self defense in dealing with the Balkan war but that all other peaceful possibilities must be exhausted before resorting to military force. He stressed that the pope's written opinion on the matter was drafted prior to the two-day NATO summit held in Brussels earlier this week. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said at the end of the summit Tuesday that they were ready to use air power in support of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina but appeared in agreement on applying such power only in two small Moslem enclaves where Serb forces have obstructed the United Nations. In his statement Wednesday, the pope also condemned the warring parties in the Bosnian conflict, saying that they were openly violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. "These rights are being violated in a frightening and tragic manner and those responsible have resorted to justifying their actions by saying they are obeying orders and certain ideologies," the pope said. On Tuesday the Vatican also condemned the international community's inaction in Bosnia, saying it was acting in a criminally negligent manner.
