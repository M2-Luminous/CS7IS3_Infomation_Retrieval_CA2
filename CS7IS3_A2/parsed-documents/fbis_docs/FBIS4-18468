A hero to Italians the world over for his lead role in the Clean Hands anti-corruption probe, Di Pietro arrived in Sydney Thursday with his wife and a friend, for a nine-day tour of Italian emigrant communities in Australia's major cities. Asked about press reports that he might be tapped for the job of interior minister, he said this was just an April Fool's joke played by journalists. It was only while he was reading the newspapers aboard the flight taking him "down under" that he learned that Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi had allegedly offered him a cabinet post, Di Pietro said. "No one held out such a prospect and, in any case, I cannot and do not want to hold any government spot," he insisted. The prosecutor went on to say that he had enough on his plate with his present duties and that were he to accept a political post he would not be able to complete the job he is doing and which is still far from completion. Moreover, the government soon to be formed will not be a constitutional government in need of technicians, but a government sanctioned by the votes of the electorate, a political government which has no room for technicians, he said.
