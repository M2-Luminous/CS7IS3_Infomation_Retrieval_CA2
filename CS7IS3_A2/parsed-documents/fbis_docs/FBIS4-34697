Entrepreneurs are decisive actors in our country's growth and in achieving social equality. They must understand that looking after the needs of the poorest groups of society seeking a juster distribution of wealth is intimately linked to authentic development and the ideal of democracy. The Feprinco chairman's 17 June message broadly agrees with the official speech, particularly in saying that some government initiatives are steps in the right direction; in stressing that Congress is laying obstacles to economic reform and blocking the approval of bills submitted by the executive branch, particularly on privatization; and in emphasizing that the labor unions are not supporting the plan of economic stability with their demands for inappropriate salary adjustments and calls for strikes. This way of seeing reality refers directly to the "machine for prevention," which is frequently cited by President Wasmosy when people point out his scant economic achievements and his even less successful policy in solving social problems. The entrepreneurial leadership is obviously concerned by the invasion and plundering of rural properties, which in Feprinco's opinion is part of a plan to destabilize the government. But entrepreneurs do not deny that the real problem is a very unequal land distribution, and that rural development or any significant increase in agricultural productivity will not be possible as long as the current land distribution scheme persists. Feprinco is seriously concerned about the fact that demographic pressure on employment "is exploited by some labor leaders opposed to changes leading to improved production and labor conditions." We, however, must also consider that real salary levels cannot be sustained or contribute to encouraging productive or commercial activities without regulations because of labor market structural conditions and the large and growing labor supply. Besides, entrepreneurs continue to link salary increases with inflation. They call attention to "public company labor leaders' insistence in demanding salary increases over and beyond the budgetary possibilities." Feprinco, however, is satisfied because "steps are being taken to dismantle the inherited state interventionist role," because the government is controlling inflation, and because the executive branch has produced very important bills, which are almost indispensable, to introduce needed changes in the state apparatus in order to liberate the economy. The entrepreneurs' speech superficially mentions the need to diversify agricultural production and to create an adequate legal framework for industrial investments, but it does not mention the wish for a deep productive transformation with substantial social equality.
