In a report to President Ramos, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito said the assistance will go to the preservation of natural parks, integrated protected areas and industrial pollution abatement. Habito said EC assistance will not only boost the government's environmental protection program but also enhance institutional linkages, investment promotion, agrarian reform implementation and coconut processing. He reported to the president that a high-level business conference is expected to be held in Europe in September or October this year. "This will explore possible business opportunities between the Philippines and EC countries," Habito said. "Hopefully, the conference will bear fruitful results in upgrading Philippine-EC trade relations." The EC infused a total of $75.37 million in the country last year which mostly financed rural development projects in Western Samar, Catanduanes, Aurora, Guimaras, Biliran, Bantayan, Camotes and Pitogo. "The private sector also received grant financing for a packaging center and assistance to the computer software industry, which reflected greater private sector access to official development assistance," Habito said. Habito informed the president that the EC has expressed interest in initiating regular high-level consultations to review pipeline projects as well as its ongoing projects. The first consultation might be held this May, he said.
