[passage omitted] "NATO is since last night an international terrorist organisation and we will consider it as such until it changes its stance with regard to us," spokesman Miroslav Toholj told AFP. "From the first air strikes, war will spread throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina and degenerate into World War III," he added, threatening to use weapons "never before used by the Serbs." "We won't manage to shoot down 20 planes, but five, yes. That will be enough for people to understand that the others are not safe," he added. Meanwhile the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' representation in Sarajevo said Thursday that it had recalled to Zagreb or Belgrade two thirds of its staff stationed in Serb-held areas of Bosnia. UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said the move involved 10 of the 16 or so UNHCR employees stationed in Pale, near Sarajevo, and in the northwestern region of Banja Luka. Janowski would not confirm earlier reports that the recall was part of an order to withdraw all UNHCR employees from the field or that some of these employees were being prevented from leaving by the Serbs. "We are having problems at the checkpoints but they are not hostages," he said. In Belgrade, the new Serbian parliament Thursday put the ultimatum issued by the 16 nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on the agenda for its constituent session. The proposal to discuss Wednesday's ultimatum came from ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party deputy Tomislav Nikolic, who proposed to write to all countries with which the rump Yugoslavia maintains diplomatic ties "that ultimatums do not settle wars."
