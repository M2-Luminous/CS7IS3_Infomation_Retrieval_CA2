Commodity Producers Federation Chairman Strengthens His Position at State Duma"] [Text] The Russian Federation of Commodity Producers [RFCP] and the State Duma's second largest faction, the New Regional Policy, represented by their leaders, Yuriy Skokov and Vladimir Medvedev respectively, have signed an agreement on a wide-ranging coordination of their efforts in devising common approaches to political and economic areas, defining the main areas of legislative activity, and joint work on resolving urgent problems at the federal and regional level. Before the agreement was signed, Skokov and Medvedev had lengthy meetings and conversations with Boris Yeltsin, who, according to available reports, approved of this far-reaching alliance. It is worth noting that neither the RFCP nor the New Regional Policy Faction have signed the Treaty on Social Accord in the belief that without resolving the most acute economic and social problems it will end up being yet another declaration of good intentions. Yuriy Skokov, who is a serious candidate for top government posts, is clearly strengthening his position and acquiring new opportunities to influence the State Duma and the regions. The formalization of this alliance will be undoubtedly a shot in the arm for Vladimir Medvedev himself and his faction at the State Duma, which can now rely on direct support from one of Russia's most promising and experienced politicians. In that regard, a question arises as to whether Sergey Shakhray's removal from the post of minister for nationalities and regional policy was prompted by the carte blanche Yuriy Skokov apparently received from the Russian president to pursue a new political line toward the federation components. It cannot be ruled out that the RFCP chief's flurry of activity also stems from the president's harsh criticism of the government's performance and the signing of a package of edicts aimed at stabilizing the economy and streamlining market-oriented reform. In that context, the following question will be only logical: What will happen after the Chernomyrdin government is yet again unable to enforce President Yeltsin's strict instructions and to hold up the avalanche-like production slump? The situation will apparently require that a new prime minister be appointed who must have not only the experience of a large-scale economic manager, but also a serious, thought-out, and, most important, realistic program of lifting the Russian economy out of its deepest crisis.
