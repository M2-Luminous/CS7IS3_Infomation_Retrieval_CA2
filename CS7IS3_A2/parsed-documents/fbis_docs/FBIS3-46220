During the current provincial meeting on economic work, a reporter from this news service interviewed Zhang Zhiping, the director of the provincial commission for restructuring economic systems. The reporter asked him about the guiding idea behind economic structural reform in our province this year. He said: This year, the guiding idea behind economic structural reform in our province has three special characteristics. First, we are to break away from the old structure and embrace a new one. Second, we are to change from the past tactic of striving for breakthroughs in individual areas to a new tactic, launching a coordinated reform package in various fields. Third, we no longer rely on policies but laws in order to expedite reform. This year we will be shouldering a very heavy reform workload, as the scale, intensify, and degree of difficulty of the reforms will all increase. In discussing the focal points of this year's reform, Director Zhang Zhiping said: First, we are to concentrate our efforts on introducing innovative enterprise systems and actively exploring effective way to establish a modern enterprise system while transforming enterprise operational mechanisms. Second, we will speed up the reform of the finance and taxation, banking, planning, and investment sectors and will make a major stride toward establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system at the provincial level. By centering around these two focal points, we will work to develop a market system with the market of production elements as the core, will step up the reform of the social security and housing systems, and will deepen reform in such fields as external trade, education, and science and technology in rural areas. After summing up the experience offered by the pilot projects conducted by 60 enterprises -- including Anyang Iron and Steel Company -- with the aim of taking stock of assets and establishing join ventures, we will speed up our pace in taking stock of the assets of all public-owned enterprises in the province, will verify the real value of the assets of enterprises and other legal entities, and will work harder to find out ways and measures to solve various historical issues that have been disturbing state-owned enterprises, thus paving the way for them to plunge into the market. This year, 100 industrial and commercial enterprises covered by the state budget in this province will be selected to launch pilot projects for establishing the modern enterprise system, and our aim is to have 25 percent of such enterprises in the province, thus accomplishing the reform of introducing the company system by the end of the year. As for basic trades which have an important bearing on the national economy, the state's role as capital owner will fade out this year. In this connection, three to five enterprises will be selected to issue shares for sale on the stock market, and five to eight enterprises will be selected to become listed companies in major national stock exchanges. Meanwhile, those enterprises which are undertaking the pilot joint stock system projects are required to take stock of their assets according to the company law.
