Nationwide, the three kinds of wholly and partially foreign-owned enterprises have emerged like "bamboo shoots after a spring rain." They have become an indispensable part of our symphony of reform and opening up. But there are a few discordant notes in this symphony. Profit Is Being Shifted Elsewhere A certain province once examined its 1,090 FFEs' income tax and found that 544 were losing money to a tune of 327 million yuan, with losses extending to 50 percent of the FFEs. Why are these FFEs losing money? There are many reasons. It is learned that many of the foreign investors in the FFEs often use prices to shift their profit around and artificially jack up their cost to eat up our side's profit, creating book-losses to take advantage of the state's tax exemption or reduction benefits. According to one tax department, in 1990, a foreign business came to China to set up a limited liability company jointly with a township enterprise in the garment business. This foreign company had sales channels abroad, and the high quality suits made by the joint venture cost about 150 yuan to produce, but the foreign staff paid only 110 yuan a piece and sold them through their retail network abroad. Internally, they said it was because of the market slump which forced them to cut price. As a result, for each suit we sold, we lost approximately 40 yuan. The company's Chinese manager even went to the tax department to ask for a tax reduction or exemption (in fact, even the Chinese manager was deceived by those people). Supposedly, in this kind of situation where more production and sales only bring more losses should prompt the enterprises to readjust their product mix and change their management thinking. But the other side do not care, and in fact the more money we lose, the more they step up production. It is only after a period of time that the tax department gets suspicious and sends people out to investigate and then the whole act is exposed, and the Chinese side eventually recovers millions in tax revenue and lost profit. The Funds Fail To Come Through Among some FFEs, often times the foreign funds fail to come through on time if at all, and as a result, some enterprises are forced to take out large loans from the domestic banks. In 1986, a certain Chinese hotel negotiated with a foreign company to jointly set up a hotel here with total investment of $15 million, each side controlling 50 percent of the stocks. But more than a year later, the foreign partner still could not deliver all the money, nor could they come up with the foreign unguaranteed loans it had agreed to in the contract. The building project has become just an empty promise. In the years that followed, the Chinese side waited and made concessions. In November of 1990, the Chinese side put up 10 million yuan of the 52.296 million yuan the old hotel was valued at to buy more shares and lent the remaining 42.296 million yuan to the other side in the form of an extra investment. Thus the Chinese side, so proud and eager to get into this joint venture to build a new hotel, ended up throwing in the old building too. But that was not all. In order to complete this joint-venture hotel as soon as possible and get the utilities and roads ready and purchase some electricity bonds, the Chinese side even threw in a 16 million yuan loan they had raised on their own. Remodeling the old building cost them all of their 5.64 million yuan of the registered capital plus a 20 million yuan RMB loan from a domestic bank the Chinese side took out a loan in the name of the joint venture. To date, the foreign partner's unguaranteed loan still has not shown up, and there is no point talking about the new hotel. Today, interest payments alone cost the joint venture hotel more than 5 million yuan a year. The Chinese side is stuck. What will the final outcome be? Who knows. How come the foreign capital often fails to come through? Some people hit the nail in the head when they point out that, first, certain foreign businesses have very poor credit and do not have much money of their own, and no foreign bank would lend them money. Second, some foreign business have no serious intention of cooperating and never expect to come up with their own money; they only want to use the joint venture to borrow money from China. Third, the contract terms are not tight enough and are not enforced vigorously; there is no deadline for delivering the money, leaving a loophole for the foreign businesses to take advantage of. Fourth, from the time the contracts are signed to the time of their execution, the exchange rates have changed, which can affect the foreign business's timely payment. Lastly, the Chinese side often makes mistakes. Making Money by Importing Equipment Study shows that currently many FFEs are importing their major pieces of equipment and raw materials (or the foreign companies are importing them as their share of the investment), and since the Chinese side is not familiar with the foreign markets, most importing is naturally handled singlehandedly by the foreign businesses who simply take advantage of this weakness to make money off of the equipment and raw materials. Incomplete data compiled by a relevant department for Yunnan, Jiangsu, Fujian, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Jiangxi showed that machinery and equipment reported as foreign investments worth $68.8643 million were appraised by the Commodities Inspection Administration to be worth $52.3463 million. They have overstated the value by $16.6857 million, or 24 percent. In some cases, they have overstated the value of a single piece of equipment by 12.7 times, which is most shocking. Sometimes they substitute old equipment for new or inferior quality for good to cheat the Chinese side. There is another kind of foreign businessmen who have neither capital nor real technical qualifications; their standard is far below that of some of our domestic enterprises, but they have come all the way to China to work on joint ventures. They neither provide money nor talent, but they take advantage of the fact that the Chinese don't know how to get into the international markets, and they just help us sell some goods. Do you call that joint venture? It is but a typical business relationship, but some people willingly let them take away our profit. Getting Out of the Swamp In more than a decade of reform and opening up, the FFEs have played a valuable role. This we must acknowledge. But some domestic enterprises that went into a joint venture just for its own sake have paid dearly for the lesson. The relevant departments should be concerned. One, some domestic enterprises must correct their guiding ideology with respect to "joint ventures." They must take responsibility for what they do. Two, the relevant department must promptly formulate and perfect the laws and regulations that not only protect our rights but also the foreign investors' enthusiasm and plug all loopholes at the same time, so that the FFEs can embark on a healthy developmental track. Three, before getting into a joint venture, domestic enterprises must go through different channels to investigate and get to know the other side. They must have a good grasp of the foreign business's ability to fulfill their contracts and their business reputation and demand that they provide proof of their credibility. Four, we must perfect the contract terms and leave no loophole for others to take advantage of. Five, relevant personnel must study hard and learn more about international economics and finance and business in particular, and they must find ways to obtain international market price information on equipment and raw materials and so on, so that foreign businesses cannot give us false information.
