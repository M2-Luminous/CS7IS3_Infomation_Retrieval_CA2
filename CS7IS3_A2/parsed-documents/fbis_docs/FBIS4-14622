Otherwise, damage will be done to civic accord. This process may take six to seven months," Russian Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said. Speaking at a press briefing at the Kremlin on Thursday, Kostikov said, quoting President Boris Yeltsin's opinion, that the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite correspond to the magnitude and the political and military might of Russia." Joining the alliance will narrow down Russia's possibilities for manoeuvering in settling conflicts, Kostikov continued. Additionally, Russia's accession to the bloc could limit its rights in arms trade. Therefore, the president believes that certain conditions should be agreed before Russia joins the NATO Partnership for Peace programme in order to determine the pluses of such a move for Russia, the spokesman added. Kostikov said the sincerity of the Partnership for Peace authors has been called into doubt by the NATO decision to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the second front in the World War II without Russia's participation.
