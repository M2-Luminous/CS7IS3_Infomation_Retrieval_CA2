FR940919-2-00109 FR940919-2-00046 Flexibility and Testing SSA recognizes that full implementation of the new process vision is an iterative process that requires development, testing, additional information gathering and possible modification of process changes as they are implemented. Although SSA is committed to moving forward quickly to begin implementing the new process, SSA has embraced an equally strong commitment to rigorous testing and refinement of process changes before they are fully or permanently implemented. Testing may include, but is not limited to, geographic or time-limited site testing, using ``laboratory'' settings, or relying on specific case studies. Formalized testing is most appropriate for process changes that depend on longer-term research and development, phased implementation or major organizational change. In selecting sites for initial implementation activity, SSA will take advantage of the interest and capability of different offices, states, or regions to demonstrate the viability of immediate improvements or identify early successes in improved service or efficiency. Implementation sites will, of course, be provided with the necessary resources to support their efforts. Even with extensive testing, the nature of public policy formulation, as well as sound management principles, dictate that SSA remain flexible in developing, refining and implementing the specific elements of the new process vision. Ultimately, if the results of the iterative process necessitate modifications to the process vision, SSA is prepared to make those modifications. SSA is committed to change, not for its own sake, but because it is necessary to meet present and future challenges as it strives to provide high-quality, responsive, world-class service to its customers.
