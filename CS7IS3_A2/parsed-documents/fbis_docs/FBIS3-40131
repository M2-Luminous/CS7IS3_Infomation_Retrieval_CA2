Mainland China has made the biggest contribution to growth, with the value of goods transited via Hong Kong increasing by 33 percent from January to October this year, followed by Singapore (27 percent), Germany (23 percent), the United States (21 percent), the United Kingdom (19 percent), France (18 percent), Japan (17 percent), Canada (14 percent), and the ROK (12 percent). Mainland China is Hong Kong's biggest transit market and 42 percent of its export commodities are shipped abroad via Hong Kong. Hong Kong's efforts to constantly improve its port facilities and cargo-handling procedures have also contributed to the success in its shipping industry. Operating procedures have been improved. For instance, all incoming and exiting trucks are now supervised and directed by computer as a result of the Port Authority's decision to automatize and computerize procedures. This has reduced the time required to load and unload a container to less than one hour. The container and shipping industry is very important to Hong Kong's economy. The industry handles 90 percent of the territory's total cargo and contributes 15 percent of GDP, providing jobs to 350,000 people. In the last five years, Hong Kong's capacity has increased 15 percent annually, and its marine cargo is predicted to increase from 100 million tonnes per annum at present to 200 million tonnes by the turn of the century, increasing further by 100 percent by 2011.

Mr Cheng said that foreign contractors were not allowed to undertake projects alone; only through joint ventures with local partners. Alternatively, they could take the role of project manger if half or more of the capital involved were foreign funds. In addition, according to Mr. Cheng, the current contract tendering system in China does not reflect market reality, because of favoritism shown towards state-run contractors.
