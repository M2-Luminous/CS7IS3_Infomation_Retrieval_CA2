According to an INTERFAX report, Kozyrev made the remarks at a press conference after meeting UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali at the airport. He said the program accords with Russia's demand for establishing a partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). However he added that by no means will Russia join NATO itself. He said that to join the program is an important part of Russia's partnership strategy of Europe. Kozyrev said suggestions by President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman that it would take Russia six or seven months to join the partnership for peace program referred only to the implementation of the partnership, not to the signing of the agreement itself. Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told reporters Thursday that it may take Russia six or seven months to make a final decision on joining NATO's partnership for peace program. So far 14 east European countries have signed up for the partnership program, launched at the NATO summit in January in order to establish closer military links between the western alliance and East European countries.
