So far, 19 out of the 24 members of this authority have been appointed. The bylaws will specifically seek to establish a democratic course of action and behavior that will allow this authority to avoid the mistakes and detours that have prevailed in the PLO Executive Commitee's work for years. Yesterday's meeting discussed the program of the Palestinian National Authority and its prerogatives. It allocated 22 portfolios for health, economy, education, and other fields. However, the names of those who will be responsible for these portfolios will not be known before the end of the current meetings in Tunis and, perhaps, not before the authority is completely formed. In this respect, informed sources here report that a figure close to the Hamas Movement and whose identity was not revealed will arrive in Tunis today for further consultations with the PLO leaders on the possibility of joining the authority. The sources added that Abu-Nidal Mussallami, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, led by Dr. George Habash, would most probably join the authority. According to sources from within the new authority, the apointment of the remaining members of this authority might take place at the end of the current meetings, but not necessarily so. Consultations in this respect may continue in the coming days.
