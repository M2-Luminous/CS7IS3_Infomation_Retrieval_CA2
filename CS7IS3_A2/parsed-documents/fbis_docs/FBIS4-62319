The statement was made at the news conference in Geneva by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev following the talks there. The summing-up document says that the settlement in Bosnia is possible only through talks. It fixes the idea for granting 51 pct of the territory to the Moslem-Croatian federation (49 pct to the Serbs) and says about the possible stage-by-stage lifting of sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia if the settlement in materialised. The Russian diplomats with whom an Interfax correspondent talked to, stressed those provisions in the communique which, as they believe, largely are based on the message by the Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to the presidents of the United States and France, Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand, to British Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Among them is the need to strictly observe all UN resolutions, including the maintenance of the embargo for arms deliveries to the Moslems; to deny claims by the Moslems and Croats for possessing 58 pct of the Bosnian territory and the idea that Bosnia-Herzegovina should consist of two equal parts. There is still another point which, according to the Russian diplomats, is a "clear hint" to the Moslems that the world community will not tolerate hostilities around the town of Brcko. According to a senior Russian diplomats, if Bosnian Serbs agree to 49 pct of the territory and withdraw their troops, the prospect for the lifting of sanctions from the Union Republic of Yugoslavia will be realistic. Otherwise this will mean an isolation, he said. As Kozyrev noted at the news conference in Geneva, "our task is not to ease life for one side, it is to advance every side to reasonable solutions".
