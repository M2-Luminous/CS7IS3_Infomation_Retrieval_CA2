Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told a news briefing here that the peace process cannot be broken off. He said the four planes, identified as Bosnian Serb but denied by them, clearly violated the UN Security Council resolution banning flights over the war-torn area in Bosnia. NATO said the aircraft were Bosnian Serb planes and had carried out a bombing raid on Muslim-held territory. Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP), while condoning the attack, nevertheless described it as a serious incident. "Military action is always accompanied by the danger of it escalating," the SDP leadership said in a statement. It hoped the incident would clear the way for a political solution to the Bosnian conflict. Germany has joined other NATO countries in enforcing the Bosnian no-fly zone, but its participation is limited to the use of its airmen on AWACS planes.
