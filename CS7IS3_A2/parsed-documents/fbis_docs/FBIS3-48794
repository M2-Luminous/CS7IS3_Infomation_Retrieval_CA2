At an emergency general meeting of the Political Reform Promotion Council (also known as the Private Sector Seiji Rincho) on that day, the prime minister said that if political reform was not realized, he would not hesitate to resign. This was like burning his bridges behind him in a "desperate counteroffensive" to preempt moves inside both the ruling and opposition parties to scrap the reform bills, and to effect a breakthrough in the stalemate through a call to Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono to join him for a top meeting. Hosokawa, backed by a high popularity rating, tried to win public support by appealing to the people directly in an attempt to turn the unwholesome tide. Now the talks at the joint council of both Diet houses have ended in failure, the prime minister is likely to stake the survival of his administration on his top-level meeting with Kono. As deliberations on the political reform bills entered the final stages, the prime minister and his aides drew up a strategy to implement this "threat." While a news conference had also been considered, the Private Sector Seiji Rincho meeting was considered a better venue because the prime minister could appeal to the people directly without having to answer questions about how he would take responsibility for the failure of political reform. The prime minister once used a Private Sector Seiji Rincho meeting effectively in November 1993, just before the House of Representatives passed the political reform bills. At that time, he gave the impression that he was much more dedicated to political reform than Kono, and this contributed to the passage of the bills in the lower house. In his speech on 27 January, the prime minister emphasized the seriousness of the present crisis. He said that if the political reform bills were scrapped, "what will happen to Japanese politics, which would remain what it always has been, and the Japanese economy and the people's livelihood, which are suffering from a severe recession during this period of transition?" He rejected a plan suggested by some members of the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that a consultative body be created under the auspices of the upper house president and the lower house speaker, after which the Diet session would be closed. Hosokawa reiterated his commitment to political reform, and appealed for the ideological and sentimental support of the people, saying "political reform is a question which belongs in a different realm from the maneuverings and power struggles between political parties and factions." Some U.S. newspapers even expressed support for the prime minister as a reformist, seeing the affair as similar to the "reformists versus conservatives" paradigm in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin. The prime minister, who prides himself on being the champion of "responsible change," seems to be also trying to enlist international support. At a news conference on the evening of 27 January, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "While we may need the north wind sometimes, ultimately, the important thing is to reach agreement with the warmth of the sun, or mutual trust. I think that is the decisive factor in the success or failure (of political reform)." Perhaps the fact that the prime minister called for a top meeting with Kono in a Private Sector Seiji Rincho speech showed his desperation to finalize everything through mutual agreement after pushing political reform all the way using the "numerical strength" of the majority. "I do not know. I do not know." "In any case, right now, I do not know." These were the only replies he gave to questions from reporters after the joint council of the two Diet houses ended in failure in the early hours of 28 January. After his speech at the Private Sector Seiji Rincho, he said "(What I said about not clinging to my position) was merely stating the obvious. This does not mean dissolution of the Diet or resignation as prime minister," meaning his remark did not signify the scrapping of the bills would immediately call his political responsibility into question. Nevertheless, a remark like this at such a delicate time in political reform process cannot be taken lightly. A ruling party Diet member, expressing his expectation, predicted that "if both the prime minister and President Kono go to the top-level meeting prepared to resign [if they fail], discussions will certainly be successful."
