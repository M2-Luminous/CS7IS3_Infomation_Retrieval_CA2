The IAEA secretary general's report was submitted after studies were made by a delegation sent to Iran by the agency. In Khordad [month ending 21 June] Hans Blix stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA was perfect and that there was no proof that Iran was using nuclear material for nonpeaceful purposes. The IAEA's inspection and report on Iran's nuclear activities took place within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and agreements between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact is a worldwide agreement that was approved in 1968 to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms in the world. Under this pact, nuclear countries have refrained from transferring nuclear arms and technology to other countries, while nonnuclear countries have accepted not to attempt to attain nuclear arms. The IAEA has been assigned the job of supervising the implementation of the pact. By signing agreements with various countries, the IAEA monitors the nuclear installations and activities of countries in a bid to prevent the nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy. The IAEA's view, which has been stated at a time when Iran is being accused of trying to gain access to nuclear arms, is very significant. Even though the Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and emphasizes the peaceful use of nuclear energy, there has been a wave of propaganda on Iran's intentions and efforts to acquire nuclear arms. This propaganda, which is mainly being disseminated by America, is aimed more at inflicting pressure and sanctions on Iran rather than at preventing nuclear proliferation. America has resorted to this accusation on several occasions and has called on its allies to review their relations with Iran. But while revealing that there is no basis for the false propaganda against Iran, the remarks by the IAEA secretary general as an impartial and international source showed that Iran does not intend to make nonpeaceful use of nuclear energy and that its activities to acquire nuclear energy are within the framework of international pacts that grant this right to every country.
