The plan we outlined for this year has indicators which are higher than in 1992--for agglomerates, coke, cast iron, and steel. But today, like everyone else, we are in a difficult financial position--we are insolvent. We owe 6 billion rubles [R] for the mineral raw material, R3 billion to the coal miners, and R4.5 billion to the power engineers. Our total debt for bank loans is R4 billion. Altogether, we owe R32.4 billion, and we are owed R26 billion. Our debtors include a number of pipe plants--the Volga, Almetyevsk, Chelyabinsk, Seversk, Moscow, and Leningrad plants. The pipe manufacturers alone owe us over R17 billion. We cannot be insolvent: the power engineers have already told us the transmission of power to the combine is being cut back by 40 percent. We will be leaving those customers who do not pay, and the combine has already worked out a combination of steps in this direction. We have asked the Committee on Metallurgy to resolve a number of problems which could improve our financial position through government organs. They include matters related to foreign economic activity. How do we take part in this activity if we are handcuffed and our legs are shackled? We are paying a 25-percent duty to import equipment intended for renovation, we are paying taxes on exports, 10 percent for Russia's stabilization fund and other funds and local organs. What is left for enterprises from their foreign trade activity? There are also additional requisitions in the form of a tax on profit obtained from exports. Last year we paid R64 billion for this tax alone. The State Customs Committee is hampering work in foreign trade operations as well. We are even prepared to transfer part of the wage fund to the Voronezh Customhouse: let them develop and increase their work force. They work on one shift, but we work on three: our production is continuous, and the combine ships its output for export day and night. As a result, hundreds of railcars with products destined for export. But the customs people do not have the time and people to inspect them. When imported equipment arrives, the customhouse does not authorize it to be unloaded. We must not be exasperated by the railroad tariffs introduced recently, which make the shipment of materials cost more than the materials themselves. It is time to turn our attention to the entire taxation system--this is a system which is killing the producer! By paying the taxes, we are essentially providing credit to everyone without interest. But why, if there is no ability to pay, don't they give us interest-free credit for even 3 or 4 months? If the combine does not pay in time, then fine it or tax it whatever you think necessary. But in principle, why are we worse than any other enterprise in other countries? Why do we receive credit at 210 percent, while it is 8 to 12 percent there? In December, the combine began a plant to turn out 1 million refrigerators--a reliable, modern enterprise. Why not remove the tax on the profit which we are counting on for the foreign loans of $276 million, at least for the first 3 years? We still owe $176 million of this sum, but we have to pay the state the tax on profit. What kind of concern for consumer goods production is the state showing here? Despite the tremendous difficulty, we have also organized the production of trailers (10,000 units annually), motor vehicle spare parts, tape recorders, television sets, and other video equipment, but now we have to pay taxes on all the production facilities, in which a tremendous amount of money has been invested. This is why there is no development of consumer goods industry in the country: you have your knuckles rapped if you decide to organize it. One more question. Previously they left a 5-percent fund for enterprises in the event that it was necessary to deal with an accident, prevent a production stoppage, or the like. But the Ministry of Finance abolished the "first aid." We are asking that the government raise the question of setting limits for enterprises' urgent needs. By the end of the year, all the money will be swept out for the budget--the federal and oblast budgets--and there won't be a ruble left for the enterprises! All the funds are confiscated automatically before the first of February as tax payments. How are we to pay our employees? We ask the government to reserve 10 percent of the enterprises' production cost of the metal products turned out to pay for wages. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that in countries with developed metallurgical production, a minimum of 30 percent of the production cost of output goes for employee wages.
