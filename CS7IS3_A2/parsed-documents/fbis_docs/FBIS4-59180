In an interview with our correspondent Pirhade'i about the reasons for starting the radio program and its effects on the course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Larijani, the head of the Voice and Vision Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, said: [Begin Larijani recording] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. We are very glad that thanks to the efforts of the overseas department of the Voice and Vision and those involved in the project, the Bosnian program started, thank God. Naturally, in the present world conditions, where in the heart of Europe there is an innocent nation whose situation is not understood by any of the superpowers -- you have seen in the news these days what they have done to the people of Gorazde. Transmitting the innocent call of those self-sacrificing and hardworking people was our religious duty. Because of the goal of the Islamic revolution in broadcasting the message of Muslims, it was a necessary task. We were able to make preparations quickly to start the program. The program is transmitted at 2300 hours Tehran time [1930 GMT] every night, on 9745 kHz, 31 m wave band, which is about 2030 hours their time. We are trying to expand the program. We hope that we will quickly be able to make preparations to expand the program. Of course, a great deal of effort went into the task, because they could not speak Persian well and had not received the necessary training. There were, naturally, problems for us in terms of translation. However, certain measures have been taken and I hope that the program will be expanded soon. Undoubtedly such programs could have very favorable results in sending useful information to the people of Bosnia, considering the fact that they are under propaganda pressure, too. It is a small deed. By expanding the program, we are trying to transmit the information on time and at an appropriate volume to them. [end recording] At the radio's inaugural ceremony, in addition to Voice and Vision officials, there were a number of officials of the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Culture, and Islamic Guidance and a number of the radio's staff. The programs of the radio, which will cover the Balkans, will include news on Bosnia-Herzegovina, commentary, report, developments in the world of Islam, and the culture and literature of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
