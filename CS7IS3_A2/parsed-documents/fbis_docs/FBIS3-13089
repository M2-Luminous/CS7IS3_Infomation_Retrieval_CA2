The PLO leadership's attempts to return those who left the committee in protest against the Palestinian-Israeli agreement were made by Sulayman al-Najjab, Palestinian People's Party representative at the Executive Committee, 10 days after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. They coincided the efforts being exerted in Israel, Washington, Tunis, and Cairo to rescue the peace process. The PFLP and DFLP expressed a desire to return to the PLO Executive Committee on condition that the Oslo and Cairo agreements are canceled and the negotiations are conducted according to international legitimacy's resolutions. 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PFLP Political Bureau member, who represented the front in the Executive Committee before resigning in protest against the peace talks, paid tribute to al-Najjab's efforts to return the resigning committee members and appreciated his care for Palestinian institutions and his objection to the Cairo agreement. Malluh told SAWT AL-SHA'B that he emphasized to al-Najjab that he refuses to distinguish between the Oslo and Cairo agreements because the latter was an honest translation of the former. He said his front does not understand the current attempts to distinguish between the two as if they were different things. He said his return to the PLO Executive Committee is conditional on a commitment by the negotiators to reconsider all past policies, particularly the cancellation of the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and the presentation of guarantees to do so. He pointed out that meetings [not further identified] sought to discuss the best ways by which the Executive Committee members, in their capacity as legitimate representatives elected by the Palestine National Council, can confront the state of deterioration being experienced by PLO institutions and the dangers surrounding the Palestine question and the PLO, considering the organization the Palestinian people's political entity and unified framework. Malluh admitted that nothing has thus far emerged from these meetings despite the sense of national and political responsibility demonstrated by the Executive Committee members toward the serious situation of the Palestine question and toward re-adherence to the PLO's program, the program of return and self-determination. Regarding the possibility of re-forming the Executive Committee, he said: We have to note the stands of the Committee members. These stands are mixed; some members accept the Oslo agreement and reject the Cairo agreement. Asked if he would withdraw his resignation from the PLO Executive Committee to secure a majority that could bring about a coup, he said that, based on the members' position on the overall political process, it is still premature to expect a white coup in the Executive Committee. He added: A white coup needs to be studied. The issue is not one of a coup in the full sense of the word; it is the issue of safeguarding the Palestinian people's national interests and protecting the PLO from the concessions made by the negotiating team.
