FBIS4-53411 "dreas097_c_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 North Korea Red Cross Again Demands Return of Old POW's Red Cross Again Demands Return of Old POW's Radio Reports Message SK1905033594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0136 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905033594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0136 GMT 19 May 94 Korean BFN [Telephone message from Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, to Kang Yong-hun, president of the ROK Red Cross Society, on 19 May] [Text] Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of DPRK Red Cross Society Central Committee, today sent a telephone message to Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, demanding again that South Korea respond to our proposal for the repatriation of old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- long-term prisoners who refused to renounce communism -- and for providing Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, another person who refused to renounce communism, who is seriously ill, with medical treatment. The contents of the telephone message were as follows: On 26 and 27 April, I sent telephone messages to you, demanding that South Korea repatriate Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war, and that it send the seriously ill Kim Chi-yon, daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who refused to renounce communism, to the North, for medical treatment. To date, your side has not taken any measures for our proposals that need to be settled immediately. Furthermore, your side did not even reply. This cannot be regarded as proper behavior befitting Red Cross men who regard humanity as sacred and saving mankind from misfortune as their basic mission. Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken as prisoners by the U.S. Forces during their guerrilla struggles in the South in the past years of war, are clearly prisoners of war in view of international law. Therefore, your side is obliged to repatriate them to our side. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 regarding the treatment for prisoners of war defines that prisoners of war must be released and repatriated immediately after a hostile action ends. Also, Article 20 of the Hague Convention of 1907 regarding laws on land battle and practice defines that after a treaty is concluded, the repatriation of prisoners of war should be carried out as quickly as possible. Nevertheless, your side has stated that Kim In-so and Ham Se- hwan, prisoners of war, cannot be repatriated due to the South Korean National Security Law, which has aroused protest from the international community. This is wrong behavior in which you are employing international law in your own way. Furthermore, your side acts as if you are interested in the humanitarian issue, ignoring the issue of repatriating Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, which is more important than the issue of separated families. This is a very wrong attitude. Also, it is very regrettable that without any plausible reasons, your side has not yet positively reacted to our humanitarian proposal to provide Kim Chi-yon, the daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, who refused converting from communism, with medical treatment in the North. Neglecting to say that your side will provide medical treatment for Kim Chin-yon, who is seriously ill, your side has ignored our proposal that we provide her with medical treatment in the North. This can be regarded as an attitude of ignoring the basic duty and mission of Red Cross men. The DPRK Red Cross Society Central Committee sincerely advises [chunggohada] your organization not to follow authorities of the South side, who pursue North-South confrontation, but instead to be faithful to the basic duty of the Red Cross. Thus, it again strongly demands that your side positively respond to our humanitarian proposals from now on.
