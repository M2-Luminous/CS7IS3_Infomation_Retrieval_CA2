FR940907-2-00121 FR940907-2-00085 Federal Transit Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;B] Third Party Contracting Guidelines Circular Revision AGENCY: Federal Transit Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is revising Circular 4220.1B: Third Party Contracting Guidelines. Before the Circular is finalized, FTA seeks comments from interested parties on the draft changes. This notice announces the availability of the Circular for review. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: All requests for the draft Circular should be addressed to Carolyn Thompson, Third Party Contract Review Division, Federal Transit Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 7405, Washington, DC 20590. Comments on the Circular should be submitted to the FTA Docket Clerk, same address but room 9316. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Carolyn Thompson, Procurement Analyst, Third Party Contract Review Division, Federal Transit Administration, (202) 366&hyph;5470. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Current contracting guidance for FTA grantees is contained in FTA Circular 4220.1B, ``Third Party Contracting Guidelines,'' dated May 5, 1988, revised February 5, 1990. FTA is revising the Circular to incorporate new provisions included in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, October 28, 1991) and to reflect a more current contracting policy. Most of the changes are relatively insignificant, and are shown in bold type on the draft Circular. The agency also particularly seeks comment on the following two matters. Since issuing FTA C 4220.1B in 1988, the FTA has required submission of certain contracts for preaward review in areas where the agency perceived problems. FTA proposes to retain the requirements of Chapter III, FTA Preaward Review of Third Party Contracts, pertaining to single bids, other than low bid, and brand name. However, FTA requests public comment on whether these are still problem areas perceived as needing special oversight. Similarily, FTA C 4220.1B, as extended into FTA C 4220.1C, does not apply to capital projects where no Federal funds are involved. However, because Federal operating assistance is provided based upon a percentage of the net deficit of all operating expenses incurred, FTA has applied the Circular to all operating contracts and proposes in the draft Circular to continue doing so. This has caused considerable concern and FTA is soliciting specific comments on this issue. All comments received will be reviewed by FTA procurement staff and taken into consideration in refining the guidance included in the final revised Circular. Parties interested in reviewing the draft may request a copy by writing to the Third Party Contract Review Division, at the address listed in ADDRESSES section of this document. Comments should be sent to the FTA docket, at the address listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. Issued on: September 1, 1994. Gordon J. Linton, Administrator.
