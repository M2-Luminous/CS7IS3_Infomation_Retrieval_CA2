But already these soccer ball-shaped carbon cages, incorporating 60 or 70 carbon atoms, have become the subject of application research. If a recent Tokyo symposium is any guide, both the chemical industry and the semiconductor industry could one day be transformed by the ideas now coming out of research labs. A group from Hokkaido University has confirmed that the fullerene can be modified to act as catalysts to promote chemical reactions between organic compounds. Combined with alkali metals, the fullerenes in some cases work better than platinum as a catalyst, the group reports. In one experiment, they attached six atoms of cesium to carbon-70, and then evaluated the ability of this complex to facilitate the synthesis of compounds containing hydrogen and tritium--a standard test for catalytic activity. The results showed the fullerene complex to be around ten times more effective than a platinum catalyst, which is one of the most active catalysts known. In another experiment with more direct industrial relevance, the fullerene complex was able to promote the synthesis of ethylene and propylene from ethane and propane at a low temperature of 200 C, or 30 C below that required with a platinum catalyst. But catalysts are not the only potential application for fullerenes. Groups from the University of Tsukuba, Kyoto University, the Tokyo Metropolitan University and various other places are attempting to synthesize super polymers of carbon-60 in the hopes of developing new types of plastics and electronic materials. The work is still at the basic research stage, though. It is not necessary to link fullerene into giant polymers to exploit the material's electric properties. Toshiba Corp. has fabricated a polymer film incorporating carbon-60 which can convert light energy into electric energy. The company views this as a step toward the development of new photographic and memory storage media. Meanwhile, a group at Shizuoka University is developing equipment to mass-produce fullerenes. The standard method now is to pass a current between two carbon electrodes, and then scrape off the fullerenes which form as a result. But this method cannot be run continuously, and produces only small quantities of fullerenes. In the method being developed by the Shizuoka University group, fine powdered carbon is supplied to a single carbon electrode.
