Applicants also request an order exempting them from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions, and to waive the CDSC in certain instances. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having their full payment invested for them at the time of their purchase of shares of the Funds with no deduction of an initial sales charge. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) the impact of the respective sales charges, if any, for each class of shares ( e.g., Class A shares generally would be subject to a front-end sales charge or CDSC depending on the amount of investment, Class B and Class C shares would be subject to a CDSC, Class D shares would be subject to a front-end sales charge, and Class Y and Class Z shares would not be subject to a front-end sales charge or a CDSC); (c) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;plan providing for a service and/or distribution fee ( e.g., Class A and Class Y shares would pay a service fee, Class B, Class C, and Class D shares would pay a service fee and a distribution fee, and Class Z shares would not pay a service fee or a distribution fee); (d) different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund may in the future determine to allocate to a specific class, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (e) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares ( e.g., the adoption, amendment, or termination of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1), except as provided in condition 15 below; (f) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as described in the prospectuses (and as more fully described in the statements of additional information) of the Funds; and (g) classes that impose a 12b&hyph;1 fee may convert to another class. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class arrangement, prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed system is in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.
