After an (American honeymoon) that lasted about three years, an American (troublesome era) has started; troubles and crises keep popping up, here and there. During the last three lean years, through tremendous power, America succeeded in forcing the Security Council members--including the permanent ones--to support her! Accordingly, at the expiration of the two-month period, with just a hand signal, the American Ambassador to the United Nations could issue a declaration for an extension! Currently, however, three out of the five permanent members of the UNSC--China, Russia, and France--have indicated that the positive stand of Iraq should be appreciated; both the United States and Britain have refused to appreciate that stand! Moreover, eight nonpermanent UNSC members are willing to deal positively with Iraq, while only Argentina has supported the American stand! This openly stated change implies a few important facts. First is the fact that the United States has lost its ability to either have declarations easily issued or to forcibly subject the UNSC members to her will. The second fact is that America realizes the far reaching and dramatic impact of this change. This change denotes that the battle for lifting the embargo has entered its most dramatic turn in its three years of existence because America's rationale no longer holds and is no longer influential even inside the American Congress. This indicates that the power-and-pressure weapon has become weaker and does not have full impact on the majority of nations. The third fact is that to keep on extending the embargo every two months is no longer a one-handed decision by America; the wishes and interests of other nations are now taken into consideration with regards to the extension because the embargo no longer harms the Iraqi people alone, but is harmful to the international community as well. For this reason, the rationale of those countries that support lifting the embargo will, as time goes on, be stronger and more effective; eventually it will become an established legal and interest-oriented decision. When this situation occurs, the difference of opinion that became apparent lately will develop into a crisis that would--every two months--aggravate and give rise to conflict and arguments and perhaps even lead to a dangerous dilemma that would last until the embargo is ended! Iraqis who have persevered, suffered, and have been deprived of medicine and many of life's necessities can breath a sigh of relief today as the beam of hope has turned to a burning flame that is not liable for extinction. This flame will attract more of those people who have been trapped inside the venues of American vice and lead them to both truth and rationality. The great sacrifices of our people have born fruit and have changed the embargo from an Iraqi issue to one for humanity as a whole. Currently, the human race is preparing--albeit slowly--to enter the political battle for lifting the embargo. However, despite this positive change, the spirit of perseverance and the everlasting clinging to President Saddam Husayn's perception and leadership remains the main guarantee for putting an end to and shortening the duration of the battle to lift the embargo and also for sparing us more pain.
