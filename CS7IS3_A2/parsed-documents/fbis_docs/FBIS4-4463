At that time, this experience was mainly aimed at criticizing manifestations which denied the achievements recorded by socialist regimes and considered that socialism has all type of inevitable shortcomings. These manifestations will distract us on the goal and path to socialism in our country. The origin of these manifestations lay in the fact that socialism was facing great difficulties in Eastern Europe and the USSR and our country was in a critical socioeconomic crisis. At present, after three years of implementing the SNPC resolution, we have recorded very important achievements both in national issues and external affairs. The stature and strength of our revolution is improving. An absolute majority of our people have increased their confidence in the party and state's line and policy, the socialist path, and the bright national future. However, we still have many shortcomings, weaknesses, and newly arising problems. One of the newly arising problems, as mentioned in the political report of the Mid-term National Party Conference, is "the danger of disorientation from socialism if deviations in the line and policy and in the implementation of the line and policy are not overcome". This also proves that the lesson "We must firmly maintain the socialist direction in the renovation process" mentioned in the SNPC is still correct. On the other hand, this lesson has a new application, reflecting the real situation in recent years: that is, in addition to our fine and correct actions, we must be vigilant to prevent the danger of disorientation from socialism in the renovation process. Does this danger exist? Is it a real danger or an exaggeration?. Is it contradictory when we mention the danger of disorientation at the same time as referring to our achievements of the past years, because these achievements are the result of the correct line and policy and the efficient execution of our line and policy in life? Looking squarely at the truth, we must admit that the danger is real. That is not an exaggeration. To say that our entire renovation undertaking, from all socioeconomic platforms and strategies to the line and policy and their implementation, is disorientated is totally incorrect and not in conformity with our great achievements. But it is also not correct if we say that everything has been fine, without chaos and confusion in any field or anywhere, and that we do not need an alarm about any danger. The truth is that, in the process of organizing the implementation of the renovation line, deviations, mistakes, and shortcomings have emerged. If we do not sufficiently prevent and overcome them with suitable measures, then who dare say that in the future the disorientation will not become bigger with unpredictable results? Manifestations of disorientation have appeared, are appearing, and possibly will appear in the fields of the economy, politics, theory, ideology, culture, society, cadre organization. There will be stronger manifestations of disorientation appearing in the implementation process due to an incorrect understanding of the line and policy. Manifestations of disorientation may also appear in the process of outlining practical guidelines and policies to execute the socioeconomic platforms and strategies. Manifestations of disorientation can not only appear in people who doubt our national advancement path. It is worth noting the possibility of unconscious disorientation in our cadres -- though we have no doubt about their loyalty to the regime -- due to their poor understanding, bureaucratism, and lack of responsibility in their work. Negativism, especially corruption, is a fertile ground for those who act against the socialist direction and overlook the most correct line and policy for money. Disorientation occurs on two sides: left and right. Both sides will cause damage. At present, we have to pay more attention to the rightist disorientation, especially when external forces are trying to impose this type of disorientation on us for their "peaceful evolution" goal. It is difficult to fully cover all the types of disorientation within the limitations of an article. The disorientation from socialism has appeared at different levels. The economy is one of the fields that has shown such a sign. In this field, there is no less incorrect understanding and wrong action, especially in the market economy. Some opinions have it that, in the market economy, capitalism and socialism are just the same with no differences, and speaking of the market economy under the socialist direction is coercive. In fact, in both theoretical and practical contexts, the socialism-oriented market economy bears both similarities and differences to the capitalist market economy. Being market-driven economies, they both use the market as the basic tool in distributing and consuming economic resources; prices are to be determined in accordance with the rules of value and supply and demand; competition replaces monopoly; economic units are to be independent in production and business operations; production elements must circulate in the market, and different types of markets will come into existence. The difference between the two is for whose interests state intervention in a market economy is supposed to serve -- for the laboring people or for the exploiting minority. Production resources ownership is another difference. In socialism, the all- people and the collective ownership have gradually become the basic concepts, and the state-run economic sector is a leading element in a multisectoral economy where ownership is displayed in various forms. In distribution, socialism uses labor as the main criterium. These differences are domains where disorientation from socialism in the economy occurs. Can we afford to continue to leave the situation as it is now regarding the heavily differentiated prices between industrial products and services, and agricultural products? Prices reflect economic relations and relations of interest. The existing price scale puts peasants in a disadvantaged position. While carrying out recent operations in various localities, many state trading establishments and trading cooperatives left the battlefield open to private traders in a number of areas such as production supplies, fertilizers, some agricultural products -- rice, coffee grain, pepper grain, coconut -- thus causing losses not only to producers but also consumers. These practices cause harm to the relations within the worker-peasant alliance. It also shows how important the state regulatory role is for a market economy. Development of a multisectoral merchandise economy is the main concern in the renovation process of our party. We have completely eliminated the antipathy, prejudice, and prohibition against private capitalist and individual economic sectors, thus creating conditions for all production forces to develop for the sake of the country and the people. But deviations have come. Many people are now advocating the privatization of the economy, considering it the only path for the economy to take off. Equitization is also being seen as privatization. The various forms of production resources ownership are being regarded only as the means for economic development, and it is not essential to pay attention to the difference between state and collective ownership. These are the points that a number of foreign forces would like to see developed in our country. The CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR journal in last January's edition carried an article by an overseas author saying: "The key of the political reforms in Vietnam lies with the private business sector.... The Vietnamese communists have braved all military attacks from the French and the Americans, but they cannot survive for long with the positive conditions created by private business." That shows too well what they want. We all know that each society possesses not only the ownership forms it inherited from the society which existed before it, but it also has its own ownership relations which constitute particularities of that society. This is also true for our society. While we encourage the development of other economic sectors, we cannot pay any less attention to the consolidation and development of the role of state-owned, collective, and cooperative economic sectors. Consolidation does not mean disorderly development without control and consideration for consequences. And development of the sectors does not mean we have to increase the proportion of these sectors to the highest percentages in all domains of industry and trade. Reality shows that we have not done enough to keep the state-managed business sector worthy of its leading role in production and distribution. Again, to encougage development of the state-managed business is not to compensate losses and subsidize it from the national budget, as we used to do before. The same principle applies with the collective and cooperative economic sectors. Among all agricultural cooperatives countrywide, only 12 percent of them satisfactorily operate. The operation of small business and handicraft cooperatives has been mostly spontaneous, leading to the current uncontrollable chain collapse of these cooperatives. In Hanoi alone where there used to be over 70,000 cooperative members, we now have less than one tenth of that figure. We do not want to maintain old-styled small business and handicraft cooperatives since they are no longer fit to exist. Cooperatives need to be revived with new vitality, and the state plays important role in this task. We should not use the simplistic distinction between state and nonstate business establishments as an excuse for neglecting these economic sectors, as the party platform clearly stipulates: The state and collective economic sectors are the foundation of the national economy. Nonetheless, there is still much room for improvement. It is not our policy to apply an equal income distribution system because such a move would destroy the motives behind production and business operations. At the same time, we do not accept a very wide income gap, especially when it comes to income illegally earned. According to investigation results, nearly 18 percent of the households in the countryside and in high-altitude, remote, or former revolutionary base areas are still listed as poor. The average value of the assets of rich family members stands at 60 million dong each whereas that of poor family members in the countryside is less than one million dong each. In many cases, people who have made the most meritorious contributions to the revolution survivors of fallen combatants, war invalids, members of the Armed Forces, retirees are also the very persons who experience the greatest difficulties in life. There are some business sectors which generate very high income compared with the general level of income distribution in society. There are many cases in which "some people have more than they need whereas others do not know how to make ends meet." This phenomenon is at variance with the nature of our society. If we do not work out appropriate measures to deal with this situation, the gap between the rich and the poor will be widened and social conflicts will increase in intensity. Here, the role of the state as a regulator is of great important significance. Some people maintain that because we opt for the market economy, we must accept its negative aspects. It is true that besides positive aspects, the market economy also displays many negative phenomena. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily mean that we must adopt a negative attitude. Instead, we must persist in our struggle to limit, contain, and gradually eliminate those negative aspects from social life. This undertaking requires much manpower and time. As far as the market economy is concerned, money has a very great role and effect. Nonetheless, there is no way we can accept a lifestyle in which we do anything to get money, regarding it as "God," and worse still, let it affect our conscience, honor, and human dignity. We may not use the market mechanism or customers' taste to justify our attempts to commercialize cultural and artistic activities. This would give rise to the development of unhealthy cultural and artistic activities. Realities indicate that such incidents have occurred. We may not interpret the elimination of the state subsidization system in a simplistic and indiscriminate manner. We may not use openness and cultural exchanges with the outside world as a pretext for allowing miscellaneous and harmful publications to penetrate our country. Such phenomenon have occurred. Prompted by goodwill, a foreign friend warned us: If you do not take timely counter-measures, you will be subjected to a massive invasion by material civilization. Nothing is more frightening than cultural invasion. You have won the war for national defense, which was rife with difficulties. Yet, in my opinion, that war is easier compared with the war on the cultural front in the days ahead. You should remember that if you lose your culture, you will lose our country as well. That poses a real danger if we do not heighten vigilance. We must guard against disorientation even in party-building work. Disorientation occurs if party organizations belittle their leadership role and the principles governing democratic centralism, collective leadership and individual responsibility, and criticism and self-criticism. It also occurs when there is a lax observance of discipline and a low sense of unity and singlemindedness. If party organizations fail to assume their role as political nucleus, other political and ideological concepts will fill the gap. Of course, if party organizations take charge of everything, give orders to everybody, and fail to respect the law and other operating procedures of mass organizations, then that is another form of disorientation. It is the very objective of the current movement to renovate and revamp the party to overcome both of those two forms of disorientation. It is necessary to point out that it is not easy to set a clear cut boundary between socialist disorientation and a firm grasp of socialist orientations at the initial stage. This is particularly true with the renovation process when things do not take well-defined forms at an early stage of development. Instead, this process requires time, research, and experiments before correct conclusions can be reached. Only by stepping up efforts to inspect, review, and draw experiences from real life situations as well as rectify mistakes can we overcome irregularities.
