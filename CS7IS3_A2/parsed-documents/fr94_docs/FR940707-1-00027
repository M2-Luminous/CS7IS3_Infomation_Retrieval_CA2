ACTION: Notice of extension of public comment period on proposed threatened status for Castilleja levisecta . SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that the comment period for the proposed listing of Castilleja levisecta (golden paintbrush) as a threatened species is extended. The proposed rule to list this plant species was published on May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24106), and opened the comment period until July 11, 1994. This notice extends the comment period until August 11, 1994. DATES: Comments on the proposed listing of Castilleja levisecta (golden paintbrush) as a threatened species must be submitted by August 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Information, comments, or questions on the proposed listing of Castilleja levisecta should be submitted to the State Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 3704 Griffin Lane SE, Suite 102, Olympia, Washington 98501. Materials pertaining to the proposed listing of this species will be available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment, at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dave Frederick, State Supervisor, at the above Olympia address (telephone: (206) 753&hyph;9440). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Castilleja levisecta (golden paintbrush), a perennial herb in the snapdragon family, once occurred from the Willamette Valley in Oregon north to Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Only ten disjunct populations of this plant now exist, in open grasslands ranging from south of Olympia, Thurston County, Washington; north through the Puget Trough to southwest British Columbia, Canada. Threats to the species include competition with encroaching native and alien plant species, habitat modification through succession in the absence of fire, predation, and stochastic (random) events, such as catastrophic fire. Commercial and residential development also threaten this species. The plant occurs on Federal, State, and privately owned land. On May 10, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to list Castilleja levisecta as a threatened species (59 FR 24106). The rule initiated a public comment period which closes on July 11, 1994. In order that the best information be available before making a final determination on the proposed listing of this plant species, the Service now extends the comment period for a period of 30 days until August 11, 1994. Author This notice was prepared by Leslie Propp, Olympia Field Office (see ADDRESSES section).
