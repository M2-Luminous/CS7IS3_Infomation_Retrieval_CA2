Nevertheless, the survey says, the measures can help ensure that control over the fiscal deficit is re-established. Referring to the high fiscal deficit during the current financial year, the survey points out that "after initial success, there is a tendency for fiscal discipline to weaken" as happened in many countries which faced a fiscal-cum-balance of payment crisis. It notes the success achieved on the balance of payments and inflation fronts as also rekindling of growth which is expected to be 3.8 percent for 1993-94, nearly two percent less than the target. But these encouraging trends, the survey warns, must not lead to fiscal laxity. "The alternatives to fiscal responsibility and sustained reform will bring higher inflation, low growth, recurrent balance of payments problems and the accentuation of poverty." The survey, therefore, calls for resisting them firmly so as to attain the goals of fast labour intensive growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. The need for macro-economic stability by reducing the government's revenue expenditure to sustain high rates of savings and investment has been repeatedly stressed. A reduction in fiscal deficit will also facilitate financial reform by eliminating any residual risk of a high interest-fiscal deficit spiral. In the medium-term, containment of fiscal deficit would entail serious changes in both expenditure and revenue policies. Control of major subsidies and effective prioritisation of discretionary expenditures is a key issue. While broadening of the tax-base is necessary to contain fiscal deficits, moving towards the ideals of a national value added tax and ad valorem import duty is also considered essential for putting Indian producers on a par with foreign competitors. Among other important issues and priorities highlighted by the survey are: changes in legislative and administrative framework to facilitate restructuring of industry, elimination of rigidities in labour laws, attracting foreign direct investment, phasing out import licensing and high tariffs. Shifting the composition of external finance from borrowing to direct equity investment, and from short-term and government guaranteed government debt to long-term debt with minimum reliance on government guarantee, prudent management of external debt and foreign exchange reserves, reforms in pricing, cost recovery and institutional changes in the infrastructure sector. The survey also emphasises the need for shifting composition of public expenditure in agriculture from input subsidies to creation and maintenance of infrastructure. The survey notes several plus points during the current financial year as fruits of the reform initiatives. The year is likely to end with foreign exchange reserves of about $12 billion and a current account deficit of less than 0.5 percent of GDP. An inflow of over $2.5 billion on account of foreign direct and equity portfolio investments is expected by the end of this financial year, with much higher inflows likely next year. The monetary effects of large capital inflows may pose a new challenge for the country's monetary policy for the first time in recent history. In 1991-92, foreign exchange inflows added about Rs 11,000 crores to reserve money and in 1993-94, this increase may be of the order of Rs 16,000 crores. "The contribution is likely to increase next year and we must be prepared to meet this challenge," the survey observes. A conscious policy is being followed to reduce the quantum of short-term external debt as a result of the marked improvement in foreign exchange reserves. The share of short-term debt in the total debt stock fell from 10.2 percent in March 1991 to seven percent in March 1993. The increase in external debt averaged about $3 billion in both 1991-92 and 1992-93, but in the first half of 1993-94, the increase was limited to less than $300 million. In the first nine months of 1993-94, export growth rose to 19.9 percent in dollar terms while imports declined by 1.3 percent. The deficit in the current account at 0.5 percent of GDP is also sustainable. While all this provides a very sound basis to put the balance payments position on a stable path in the medium-term, concerted policy action is required to ensure that exports maintain their growth rate in the medium-term and the trade deficit is not allowed to widen despite the likely recovery in imports during 1994-95. The survey also notes that debt servicing is expected to peak in 1996-97. Because of the large interest and principal repayments, a substantial financing gap may be expected to remain in the coming three years. In this connection, the survey refers to the issue of taking a medium-term loan from the IMF under the extended fund facility (EFF) and says that while some talks have been held, a decision will be taken keeping in view the emerging balance of payments position. The overall industrial growth during the first seven months of 1993-94 has been only 1.6 percent. The growth rate, though registering discernible improvement since July 1993, is below the expectation, the survey concedes. But it finds indications of an industrial revival due to several factors on both the supply and demand side. These factors include successive good agricultural performance, high growth of exports, a buoyant infrastructural sector, enhancement in public spending on social sectors and a substantial increase in foreign investment. Demand conditions are also favourable, indicating an industrial growth rate of around 4 percent for 1993-94. The survey, however, admits that due to a number of factors, "the industrial sector is yet to respond with full vigour to liberalisation measures." Turning to agriculture, the survey says that despite a good year, agricultural production will show slower growth in 1993-94 because of the peak levels attained in 1992-93. But the production of wheat and rice is likely to grow this year. Foodgrains stocks at 22.8 million tonnes at the end of December, 1993 were at their highest level in seven years. The survey expresses concern at the price situation. Though the annual inflation rate stood at 8.2 percent (provisional) on January 29 this year, the fiscal and monetary situation was fuelling inflation. Because of the increased administered prices at the end of January and early February, "control of inflation once again emerges as an area of priority concern." It therefore, observes: "In the coming year, containment and reduction in the rate of inflation will depend on measures for containing the fiscal deficit and reducing the potential for monetary expansion, recovery of industrial production and the management of the supply of foodgrains and other key essential commodities."
