[Naumann] First of all, the recent defense commissioner's report is, as he has himself repeatedly emphasized, a report that shows up deficiencies rather than a report on the state of the Bundeswehr. If you asked any number of commanders of all sections of the armed forces whether what the report of the defense commissioner describes reflects the general state of the Bundeswehr, then -- I dare predict -- they would all clearly answer with no. The reportage on the report, but not the report itself, has drawn up a picture that does not reflect the reality of the armed forces and does not do justice to the efforts of most soldiers who do a respectable job with a great sense of responsibility albeit -- admittedly -- under difficult conditions. By and large, the picture of the forces is more differentiated than could be presented by a compilation of deficiencies that are certainly indisputable. [Reif] So it is all a misunderstanding? [Naumann] We have to be grateful for the defense commissioner's report to put the finger into a wound that has been hurting us for a long time: It shows up the incongruity of insufficient funds and a permanently widening range of tasks with which we have to struggle. In the parliamentary debates on the 1994 defense budget we warned of the danger of sustained problems if we received insufficient funds for training, exercises, and the use of ammunition. Therefore, the Bundestag Budget Committee arrived at the conclusion that no further cuts are tolerable at the level of the Bundeswehr. That our budget was, nevertheless, cut by another 1.25 billion German marks will make it even more difficult in 1994 to provide challenging training conditions. [Reif] Are you trying to say that the Bundeswehr's assignment will be challenged by the dramatic cuts? [Naumann] The whole range of assignments cannot be met on the basis of the funds that we have been allocated. If one wants a Bundeswehr with a peace strength of 370,000 men and which has more than 150,000 civilian employees, that achieves a limited operational capability with all sectors of the armed forces, has modern equipment, and is stationed in a way that maintains our alliance capability and covers our entire federal territory, then it will be inevitable to increase the funds for the Bundeswehr. If, however, in view of our country's current financial situation it turns out to be impossible to implement such an increase, then the politicians must permit us to judge which of the above-mentioned parameters have to be regarded as being of secondary importance against the background of the Bundeswehr's assignment. [Reif] The defense commissioner has described the Bundeswehr as consisting of men all of whom are skeptical of themselves. [Naumann] In my opinion it would be wrong to say that all Bundeswehr members are skeptical of themselves. The Bundeswehr is familiar with its assignment, and it has shown it, whether in Somalia, in Cambodia, in the Adriatic, or elsewhere. There can be no doubt that some soldiers have doubts about themselves. We must not forget that for 35 years the Bundeswehr had a clearly defined -- I would say one-dimensional -- assignment, namely the defense of our country in border-near forward defense along with our allies. This assignment was deeply anchored in the awareness of our officers and noncommissioned officers, and we were profoundly prepared for it. Regardless of the level of command and control, everybody knew how successful defense had to be carried out. Our way of thinking was determined by defense planning that was consistent with the critical security realities of the FRG. Today we no longer have such simple quantities for orientation. [Reif] There are plans for joint maneuvers by Germans, French, and Poles still this year. German soldiers should even participate in joint exercises in Poland. Is the time ripe for it yet? [Naumann] I am of the view that we have the chance to continue the process of reconciliation with Poland more intensively. After all, German-Polish history must not be reduced to the 12 gloomy years in German history. It is more, because the chain of conflicts between Germans and Poles dates back to the early Dark Ages. If both peoples, who now live within safe and mutually recognized borders, have the opportunity to create a peaceful future together, then they have to make use of this opportunity. The soldiers of both nations should play a significant role in it. If, for example through joint exercises, we indicate that we want to protect peace together, then this can help to promote the process of reconciliation through getting to know one another. We will probably very soon enter into close relations of partnership, and maybe even sponsorship with other, immediate neighbors, such as the Czechs, but also with our neutral neighbors, should they so wish. Only a few days ago we discussed with the Russian defense minister the possibility of German soldiers holding an exercise on Russian soil in 1995 and, in return, Russian soldiers participating in joint exercises in Germany in 1996. One objective of such exercises is the preparation of joint missions within the framework of the United Nations.
