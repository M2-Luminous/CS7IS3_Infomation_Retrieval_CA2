ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule sets forth regulations that require air carriers, air taxi, and commercial operators to provide duty period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air commerce. This action results from public and congressional interest in regulating flight attendant work hours and from data contained in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) study of industry practice relating to flight attendant flight, duty, and rest times. This rule contributes to an improved aviation safety system by providing the opportunity for flight attendants to be rested sufficiently to perform their routine and emergency safety duties. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective September 19, 1994, except §§121.683(a)(1), 135.63(a)(3), 135.63(a)(4)(x), 135.63(a)(5), and 135.63(b) which are not effective until the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the Paperwork Reduction Requirements. FAA will publish a document in the Federal Register following OMB approval of the Paperwork Reduction Requirements. COMPLIANCE DATE: March 1, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Availability of the Final Rule Any person may obtain a copy of this amendment by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;430, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3484. Communications must identify the amendment number of this final rule. Background Statement of the Problem Flight attendants are crewmembers who perform essential routine and emergency safety duties. Routine duties include ensuring that carry-on baggage is correctly stowed; verifying that exit seating requirements are met, that passenger seat belts are fastened, and that galley service times are properly stowed; and conducting passenger briefings before takeoff. Emergency duties include conducting land and water evacuations, controlling inflight fires, handling passengers who threaten the safety of other passengers or the flight, managing medical emergencies such as passenger illness or injury, managing inflight emergencies such as smoke or fire in the cabin, and managing turbulent air penetrations, airplane decompression, and hijackings. Additionally, because flight attendants are crewmembers performing safety-related functions, they must satisfactorily complete indoctrination, initial, transition, and recurrent training requirements. In addition, they are subject to the alcohol and drug use regulations and drug testing regulations. Currently, flight attendants are the only safety-sensitive aviation group that has no regulations with respect to flight, duty, or rest periods. Such regulations exist for flight crewmembers, dispatchers, air traffic control tower operators, and aviation maintenance technicians. This final rule is comparable to flight, duty, and rest requirements for other safety-sensitive aviation groups because it enhances public safety by requiring ``rest periods'' and limiting duty periods for flight attendants. These requirements protect flight attendants from work related fatigue that interferes with their ability to perform essential safety duties. No accident/incident data currently exists to provide a direct correlation between flight attendant fatigue and passenger survivability. However, the FAA recognizes that a flight attendant who is excessively fatigued is less likely to be capable of performing safety duties than an adequately rested flight attendant. This is an unacceptable safety risk. Therefore, the FAA adopts this final rule in the interest of air transportation and air commerce safety. The justification stated herein includes that which was included in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 93&hyph;3, published in the Federal Register on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 17024).
