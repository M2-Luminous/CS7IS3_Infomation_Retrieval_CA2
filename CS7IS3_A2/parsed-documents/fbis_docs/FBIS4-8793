We have decided to concentrate our forces and defend the part of the Srpska republic between Brcko and Doboj, General Milovanovic said. Accompanied by Major General Novica Simic he was attending a celebration of the second anniversary of the liberation of Samac. After the Washington agreement and the establishment of a truce at the border with the republic of Serb Krajina, the Croatian Army deployed strong forces between Brod and Brcko, Milovanovic said. The Muslim army is also bringing fresh units to the front line between Gracanica and Brcko, with an objective of breaking through the Serb defense and gaining access to the Sava river, which we will not allow at any cost. According to Milovanovic, last night the Croatian forces opened heavy fire from their strongholds of Orasje and Zupanja on the Serb positions and villages between Samac and Brcko. We are now warning them that we will respond to any future attacks with full force against military targets in the Republic of Croatia, Milovanovic stressed.
