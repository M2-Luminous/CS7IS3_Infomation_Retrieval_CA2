Why did they unite and then fight each other and separate? [Muhammad] First, I wish to congratulate the fraternal Egyptian people, our Yemeni people, and the people of our Arab and Islamic nation on the blessed 'Id al-Adha. It pains me that this celebration should come amid secession and domestic strife in Yemen. It is true that the union is four years old. On this glorious occasion we were supposed to offer achievements to the Yemeni people, who made sacrifices for the sake of unity, instead of giving them this separation and infighting. [passage omitted] Obviously, some mistakes were made during the union experience. When the union was established power was shared by two parties. Later during the transitional period, agreed upon in 1990, power was shared by three parties in contradiction to the united country's Constitution. Furthermore, no attention was paid to the public's concerns, affairs, and aspirations. The people pinned high hopes on the union, which was expected to end a painful chapter, and to attain their great aims of development and prosperity. No attention was paid to the people's quality of life, security, stability, and economic development. No efforts were made to enhance the unified country's status. No attention was paid to the question of security, stability, and national unity. No attention was paid to the issue of regional security and stability. Naturally, I cautioned against such negative attitudes and errors from the start. I alerted Yemen's political leaders to this fact and the serious consequences and dangers of the negative attitudes and errors made during the transitional period and afterward. These errors should have been avoided by drawing up a strategic plan of what the unified state wished to accomplish. I stressed more than once that the unified state must have a strategic perspective of the country's future. Late last year I warned of the danger of domestic strife and separatism unless institutions and commands were unified. I urged that an understanding be reached among the political leaders and between the leaders of the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party. No attention was paid to this and the leadership was divided between Sanaa and Aden. The two sides subsequently engaged in media campaigns. This media escalation--added to other conflicts, quarrels, and assassinations--finally caused the situation to erupt. [passage omitted]
