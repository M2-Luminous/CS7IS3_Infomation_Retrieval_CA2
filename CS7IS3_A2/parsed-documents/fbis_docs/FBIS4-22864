Adamov, A.Ye. Domoradov, Yu.V. Mironov, Yu.M. Nikitin and Yu.M. Cherkashov (NIKIET [expansion not given]); received uly 15,1993; UDC 621.039.562.3] [Abstract] Immediately after the Chernobyl AES accident a large number of design and analytical studies of the development of the accident and the role of various factors in that situation were performed at NIKIET and other research centers, including foreign ones. This has made it possible to perform numerical studies of the origin and development of the Chernobyl AES accident. The article presents initial results of such analysis using the Relap 5/mod 2 program; the standard version of this program is widely used abroad in studies of NEPUs [nuclear electric power units] safety. The article examines two problems: 1) studying the effect on the system of operation of emergency protection equipment A3-5 and short-term insertion of positive reactivity into the core when moving emergency protection rods during a pre-accident condition of the reactor, and 2) studying the consequences of turning off the turbogenerator and of run-out operation of two of the four operating main circulation pumps [MCPs] in each loop. Calculations performed for a reactor condition that was close to the condition of the 4th unit reactor of the Chernobyl AES immediately before the accident demonstrated in the first approximation that operation of the emergency protection system in and of itself does not cause reactor runaway. On the other hand, operation of two of the four MCPs in each half of a running out turbogenerator can result in the development of a catastrophic process even without the effect of positive reactivity of old style displacing rods.
