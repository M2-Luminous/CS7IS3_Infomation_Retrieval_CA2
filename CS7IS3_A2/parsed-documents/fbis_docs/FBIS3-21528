"At the time when the Slavic civilization is on the verge of physical termination," says the letter, "we propose to take the following steps: To establish diplomatic relations with the Federative Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]; to temporarily provide complex assistance for the FRY; to denounce any sanctions against our brothers; to reexamine the issue of Belarus' nonnuclear status as contradictory to national security of the entire Slavic world; and to secede from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons." The BKSSCh has also issued a statement supporting the position of the Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich that indicates that "air raids in Yugoslavia can divide not only Europe but also the entire world." "Therefore," the statements notes, "the problems in Yugoslavia should be resolved by peaceful means."
