FR940616-0-00040 FR940616-0-00009 16. The governmental exemption is mandated by Congress. Congress did not distinguish between various governmental functions, nor did it restrict the exemption's availability for any specific governmental entities. Therefore, we do not accept CCPR's proposal. 2. Nonprofit Entities 17. Section 9(h) also exempts nonprofit entities from the requirement to file regulatory fees. In the NPRM, we tentatively found that Congress intended its exemption for nonprofit entities to cover any entity possessing nonprofit, tax exempt status pursuant to section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501. Congress' exemption of nonprofit entities from regulatory fees is substantially broader than the limited exemption from the payment of application filing fees that Congress afforded in section 8(d)(1) to nonprofit entities licensed in the Public Safety Radio Services and tax exempt under section 501(c)(3). See 47 U.S.C. 158(d)(1); see also 47 CFR 1.1112(b). The comments generally support our interpretation of the exemption, and we will adopt the exemption as proposed in the NPRM . The nonprofit exemption will be available only to those licensees who have established their nonprofit status under section 501. 3. Amateur Licensees 18. Pursuant to section 9(h), we proposed to establish an exemption from regulatory fees for amateur radio operators licensed under part 97 of our rules. However, Congress included in the Schedule of Fees an annual regulatory fee covering vanity call signs, and we proposed to establish a fee for amateur vanity call signs. We proposed that this fee would be assessed if our proposed rules to establish vanity call signs become effective. See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking , 9 FCC Rd 105 (1993). 19. We will adopt the exemption for amateur licensees as set forth in NPRM . If our proposal to issue vanity calls signs is adopted, we will also assess a regulatory fee in FY 1994 upon persons filing applications, pursuant to the charges listed in Congress' fee schedule. 10 10 The American Radio Relay League, Incorporated asserts that it has requested Congress to change the vanity call sign annual regulatory fee to a one time application fee. We, of course, will modify our fee schedule to be consistent with any congressional amendment of the fees. 4. Noncommercial Educational Broadcasters 20. In the NPRM, we concluded that regulatory fees are not applicable to noncommercial educational broadcasters. Congress included commercial television and AM and FM radio broadcast licensees and permittees in its Schedule of Fees. In contrast, Congress omitted the noncommercial educational stations from the category of stations subject to the regulatory fee. In addition, and consistent with existing section 1.1112(d) of the rules governing application fees, we proposed to exempt from the regulatory fee requirement any secondary and auxiliary broadcast services, such as low power television (``LPTV'') stations, television translators and boosters, remote pickup stations and intercity relay stations and other Mass Media, Common Carrier, and Private Radio facility authorizations used with noncommercial radio, television and instructional services qualifying for the exemption. See 47 CFR 1.1112(d). The comments supported the exemption for nonprofit educational broadcast stations and we will adopt the exemption as set forth in the NPRM . 21. Further, we affirm the tentative conclusion of the NPRM that noncommercial international short-wave will be subject to the regulatory fees. Congress did not provide an express exemption for these stations and none of the commenters urged us to exempt the international short-wave stations. In addition, unlike noncommercial LPTV and translator stations, the government does not provide financial support to noncommercial international short wave stations through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Thus, the considerations that led us to conclude that Congress intended to exempt noncommercial educational LPTV and translator stations are not present with respect to international short-wave stations. See Fee Collection Program , 6 FCC Rcd 5919, 5925 (1991).
