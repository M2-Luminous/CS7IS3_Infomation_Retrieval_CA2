The decision was based on consideration of "the recent diplomatic efforts made by Russia" to defuse the Sarajevo crisis, said the Russian president's press secretary Pavel Voshchanov. After conversations over the telephone, the two presidents agreed that it is up to the United Nations to mediate and make the decision upon the developments in Sarajevo, he said. They decided to continue discussion over the solution of the bosnia issue as a whole in the near future. Voshchanov declared that Clinton praised Yeltsin's proposal to seek a political settlement as one that can ease the tension of the crisis, which was fueled by the February-5 mortar shelling on the besieged Bosnian capital city in which 68 civilians were killed and over 200 injured. After that, NATO issued after a marathon session an ultimatum that asked Bosnian Serbs and Muslim forces to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and put them under United Nations control before midnight Sunday, or face NATO air strikes. As the deadline was approaching, Moscow stepped up mediations and, as a result, Serbs began pulling back heavy guns on Thursday. But heavy snow prevented a complete withdrawal or handing-over to the United Nations before the deadline, said U.N. Special Envoy in Bosnia Yasushi Akashi, who urged NATO not to hastily launch air strikes. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured in a television interview this evening that Bosnian Serbs will not be bombed when the NATO deadline is due. He implied his confidence stemmed from an hour talk with U.S. Defense Minister William Perry over the telephone during the day and an earlier meeting of defense ministers from Western countries including the United States and Britain.
