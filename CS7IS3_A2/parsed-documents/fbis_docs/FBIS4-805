The general principles of the Angolan electoral process will be on the negotiating table and the talks will focus on the second round of presidential elections. Dr. Jorge Valentim, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary, said in the Zambian capital yesterday that there was the possibility that an agreement might be reached in that area. That UNITA official said, however, that he favored more exchanges of ideas between the two sides so as to permit a greater understanding of the problems at hand. The UN mediators and the team led by Faustino Muteka are due to meet today. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye is expected to receive the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's counterproposal on national reconciliation, for which he has waited more than a week. The mediators and the UNITA team to the talks met throughout the morning yesterday. In the afternoon Blondin Beye met with the Ad Hoc Commission for Electoral Affairs.
