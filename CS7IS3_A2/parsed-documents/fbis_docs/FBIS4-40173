Commenting on North Korea's problem, Bonser pointed out that the most important thing in this crisis was to show firm determination so that other countries would not be tempted to follow North Korea's example.

Yushenkov pointed out that the "Partnership for Peace" programme can play an important role in the prevention of conflicts similar to the Yugoslav and Korean crises.
