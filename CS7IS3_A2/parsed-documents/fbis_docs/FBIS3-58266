Briefing correspondents today, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou very correctly noted that the decision to include former Warsaw Pact and CSCE countries in the plan for cooperation on peace gives Cyprus the right to cooperate with NATO if it wants. Asked whether the government intends to express such an interest, Kasoulidhis replied that Cyprus is happy to have the right, but added that it does not intend to use it now. Kasoulidhis said Papandreou did not raise the Cyprus issue at the NATO summit because he was there representing the European Union, not the Greek Government. The spokesman added that Papandreou planned to raise the Cyprus ssue during a luncheon for the NATO leaders.
