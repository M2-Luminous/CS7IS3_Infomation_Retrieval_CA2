As Labour took more seats today, party leader Margaret Beckett denied that they had peaked too soon. "We gave Mr Major and his whole Government notice to quit. The electors are giving them notice to quit," she told a London news conference. The mantle of trust had passed to Labour. "Where we need the votes to win a general election we are getting them." But the Tories insisted their fortunes were at a turning point. "This represents the trough of our fortunes," said Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The results were "poor, but not disastrous." Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, moved to dispel speculation that the Tories' humiliation would lead to a leadership contest. He conceded that the results were a "setback" but added: "Let me just make this absolutely clear. John Major is our Prime Minister and he will remain so." With only a few seats still to declare, the Tories had just 16, with 13 losses, and the Liberal Democrats won their first two seats ever in the European Parliament. Their leader Paddy Ashdown said they had achieved their target of capturing between one and three seats. "We have achieved that target. We have increased our vote in every single constituency across the country," he said. The Tories slumped to less than 28 percent of the vote, their lowest ever in a national election, while Labour had a massive 45 percent. The Liberal Democrats were well behind their recent opinion poll ratings, on 17 percent. With the Tories' losses in double figures, Mr Major will face strong demands for a wholesale Cabinet reshuffle in which John Patten, the Education Secretary, would almost certainly be one of the casualties. In Scotland the Tory vote plunged to a humiliating 14 percent as Labour strengthened its already dominant position, winning all the seats so far declared. But with two seats due to declare later today, the jubilant Scottish National Party was hoping to snatch North East Scotland from Labour and break through the crucial 30 percent of the vote barrier. Mr Ashdown said the Lib-Dems [Liberal Democrats] were going to look at the result in the Devon and Plymouth Euro constituency where a "Literal Democrat" may have robbed them of victory. Tory Giles Chichester -- son of round-the-world yachtsman Sir Francis Chichester -- beat Liberal Democrat Adrian Sanders into second place by just 700 votes following a recount after "Literal Democrat" Richard Huggett polled 10,203 votes. Labour Party chairman David Blunkett declared: "Labour is the only truly national party now." He added: "These superb results confirm that Labour is not only on course to defeat the Conservatives in the General Election, but has finally laid to rest the Liberal Democrat myth that Labour cannot win in the South of England." As Labour and the Liberal Democrats blamed each other for preventing further Tories losses, Mr Blunkett said: "If the Tories hadn't been rescued by the Liberal Democrats in Thames Valley, Sussex South and Crawley, and the Cotswolds, they would have suffered an even worse humiliation than they did in the end."
