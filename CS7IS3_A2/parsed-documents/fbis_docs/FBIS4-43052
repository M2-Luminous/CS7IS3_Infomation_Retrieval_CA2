The outline of the desired "security structure stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok" is visible, but there is still no final construction plan for a solid edifice. The attachment of equal significance to the concepts of "expansion" and "consolidation" in the European Union's [EU] integration policy possesses a parallel in NATO's integration policy. But no government has yet found a formula with which to apply this equation, with all its unknown quantities, to East Europe. The same applies to the yet-to-be-organized military-political WEU [Western European Union] alliance approved in 1954, which is supposed to assume the role of a West European defense alliance within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty. The addition of new EU members to the ranks of the WEU has a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is the expansion of the countries concerned within a political framework of consultations. The negative effect is the resultant distortion of the concept of joint security within NATO, whose "European pillar" the WEU has only just been defined. Frederick the Great's famous words "he who wants to defend everything defends nothing," and "he who wants to be everyone's friend has no friends in the end" fit the situation of the West European allies in their three coalitions NATO, the EU, and the WEU. The danger that they will take on more than they can handle, overextend the strategic horizon of West Europe and the Atlantic alliance, and later collapse under the growing weight of their bloated security policy, now covering the whole of Europe, has become very clear four years after the end of Soviet power in East Europe. Western politicians are now seeking safeguards in Moscow, their former great enemy. Russia, on its part, is seeking external support as consolation for its lost domination over East Europe. These interests can be brought down to a common denominator. But the latest Partnership for Peace offer will not be enough for a partnership with Russia, just as the CSCE and North Atlantic Cooperation Council, two auxiliary structures of the interim period favored by Moscow, are not enough to prevent an eastern expansion of NATO and guarantee Russia a decisive voice in European security by means of a link between the CSCE and the United Nations. The wheel of bilateral relations, with NATO as a hub, will only turn if it is connected by a fan belt to Washington and Moscow. Otherwise the wheel will be out of gear, without touching the ground of concrete reality. This necessity is only now being realized in East Central Europe, which also includes the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, as well as Hungary and Bulgaria. This feeling of reality is causing great skepticism about Western policy vis-a-vis Moscow. Politics with Russia requires a concrete accord on major issues that transcends existing differences. Up to now, Western politics has created a mainly negative image by rejecting Russian demands: "No right to veto" an eastward expansion of NATO, "no sphere of interests" for Russia in the "near abroad" or anywhere else; "no condominium" between Moscow and Brussels over European security; and "no strategic partnership" in the sense of the present "Yeltsin doctrine" about Russian privileged "special relations" with the United States, NATO, and Germany. But even without a common security forum with Russia, no "stability shift" to the East can succeed. So if Russia is not to be "isolated," an active connection in accordance with the original Partnership for Peace offer must be made. A security council will be required, in which a new version of the "European power concern" can be formed in order to look after the European scene. But because each country has a different weight on the scales of power, a "balance of power" [previous three words in English] will once again establish itself in order to make the whole scheme work. The bigger powers share a common concern over a balanced European setup in order to reduce risks to security. Of course, several conditions are to be fulfilled in order to reach an accord with Russia. They include a firm NATO link to transatlantic partnership with North America and the inclusion of the four countries of Central East Europe; a geographical limit on the size of the EU, which cannot include the whole of Europe; and a core alliance surrounding France and Germany that includes Poland as quickly as possible and is supplemented with close relationships with Great Britain, in order to lay a broad foundation of security. In this way, the balance of Europe could be kept.
