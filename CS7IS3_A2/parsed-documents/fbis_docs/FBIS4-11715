Good morning, sir. [Peres] Good morning. [Meydan] Do you know whether the agreement with the PLO has been signed already? [Peres] What I know is that it is supposed to be signed at this time. The main thing is that there is an agreement. [Meydan] Do you think the agreement is good for Israel? [Peres] Look, it would have been better had there been no need for this agreement, which arose after the events in Hebron. But in view of what happened, it is a very good agreement. [Meydan] How much have we ceded? [Peres] I do not know what you mean by ceded. We never intended to annex Hebron, either the Likud or Labor. Hebron will probably have partial autonomy. There is an incredible tension there as a result of the Cave of the Patriarchs event, and that is not surprising. We are all constantly discussing borders, places, situations. The truth is the main problem is relations. If we had different relations, there would be no problem with Hebron. I think that what we have done was a great attempt to heal understandable emotional and spiritual wounds. [Meydan] What will the multinational contingents do there? I understand that several countries will participate. [Peres] First of all, they will calm raging tempers. Also, they will help rebuild as much as possible, to restore a normal, more reasonable life. Things like that. They will also help the municipality reorganize economically and socially. [Meydan] How will they be armed? [Peres] They will have weapons for self-defense -- probably handguns. [Meydan] Will they have any powers vis-a-vis IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers? [Peres] No, no, they will not deal with any security aspects. [Meydan] Not even vis-a-vis settlers? [Peres] Settlers do not enter the picture. Overall responsibility should remain in the hands of the legitimate government, and we are the legitimate government. The same applies to the Cave of the Patriarchs: Neither the settlers nor the worshipers of either religion are in charge of the cave. The exclusive, overall responsibility is of the Government of Israel, and the Government of Israel is the one that will safeguard security and ensure that worshipers can access the site they hold holy and pray without fearing anything. This is our responsibility, and we will not shirk from it. [Meydan] There is one word we have been shirking: internationalization. It is now part of the Hebron vocabulary. [Peres] Where is the connection? Internationalization means the replacement of a sovereign government with an international government. There is no international government here. Observers have been known to be deployed in the past, such as in the Sinai, Gaza, Golan, in all kinds of places. [Meydan] In territories under Israeli sovereignty? [Peres] You are wrong, this territory is not under Israeli sovereignty. Hebron is not under Israeli sovereignty, it is under Israeli control. In the Camp David Accords, Mr. Begin agreed that this place, like other locations, would not be annexed. [Meydan] Then the international presence is not something that can be extended.... [Peres, interrupting] The international presence is temporary, limited in time. I hope we will revert to better, more normal times shortly. [Meydan] But the Palestinians are attaching great significance to this force. [Peres] Their attaching great significance does not disturb me. There is nothing wrong with it, if it helps restore normal life. [Meydan] How should we understand their waiving a Palestinian police? [Peres] I think they did not want a force subordinate to the IDF. [Meydan] Were they afraid of responsibility, perhaps? [Peres] I do not think so. Rather, afraid of the symbolism of such a thing. Why had Palestinian policemen resigned in the past? Because of the same reasons; there had been about 900 policemen in Judaea and Samaria, and they all resigned. [Meydan] The reports from Cairo are slightly confusing; perhaps we could try to understand them. They appeared to be referring to a return to the negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza and Jericho agreement, but there is now talk about Israeli consent to an early withdrawal from Gaza. [Peres] It has been agreed that negotiations complementing the talks on the implementation of the Gaza and Jericho agreement would be started at once, that the negotiations and the implementation would be accelerated. It had been agreed in Taba that Palestinian policemen will deploy in several locations in the Gaza Strip and Jericho even before the negotiations are completed. This is what is going to happen. [Meydan] When will it happen? [Peres] Within a week or so, I suppose. [Meydan] Will they have overall powers? [Peres] No, no, the powers are retained....[pauses] There cannot be two concurrent authorities. We are the authority, and we will remain the only authority until such time as we are replaced by another authority when an agreement has been reached. There will be no two concurrent authorities. [Meydan] We are very close to 13 April. [Peres] We may be able to implement a considerable part of the agreement by then and to turn the agreement, which has been a pile of papers until now, into a new reality. For the first time, the Palestinians will receive a measure of reality that will include land, responsibility, powers. Although it is not independence and sovereignty, it is still self-rule in the full sense of the word. [Meydan] Thank you very much, Minister Shim'on Peres. [Peres] You are welcome.
