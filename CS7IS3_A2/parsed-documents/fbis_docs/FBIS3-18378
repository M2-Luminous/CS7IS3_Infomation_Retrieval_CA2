As the president of the Federal Statistical Office, Hans Guenther Merk, stated, the white-collar workers got away with a stagnation of their net incomes. The situation in the new laender was much more favorable. Net wages there increased by up to 8 percent. Thus, the adaptation of incomes to the western level continued in the east, Merk stressed. Miners and workers in surface and underground engineering achieved the biggest increase. They reached 77 and 74 percent of the wages of their west German counterparts. In the industry, the wages in the new laender reached 66 percent of the western level, and in trade and the banking and insurance industry, they reached 68 percent. The gross income per month of the blue and white-collar workers in the east rose by 17 percent to 3,000 German marks [DM]. The average gross income in western Germany was DM4,500, which is 3.8 percent more than in the previous year. As the Federal Statistical Office reported, prices in the old laender were 3.3 percent higher than one year ago. According to preliminary calculations, inflation is increasing more slowly than in the past: In January, the rate was still 3.5 percent. From January to February, the inflation rate increased by 0.2 percent, whereas the increase was still 0.9 percent in the previous month. Whether it will be possible to achieve an annual inflation rate of 3 percent or a rate with the figure 2 in front the decimal point this year will depend on the increase of prices for public and private services and on the development of the rents, Merk stressed. At 4.2 percent, the average annual inflation rate last year reached the highest level since 1982.
