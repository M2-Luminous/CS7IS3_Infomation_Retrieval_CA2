The National Intelligence Service (NIS) is also set for a revamp and will be administered by Deputy President F.W. de Klerk, according to Government sources. A major announcement will be made next week about the NIS's new image, and changes to its senior management. The two moves are the latest in a series of shake-ups of ministries and State departments as the multiparty Government shifts gear to tackle unemployment and poverty, and to address backlogs in education, health and other services. Reliable sources say the SA Communication Service (SACS), Central Statical Service (CSS) and Central Economic Advisory Service (CEAS) are in the process of being placed under Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The former labour leader, who is responsible for co- ordinating the RDP from the President's Office, has already approached the three organisations to set up working relationships. The CSS and the CEAS will play the role of a think-tank to focus the RDP into disadvantaged and under-funded sectors, while, at the same time, monitoring progress and checking wasteful spending. The CEAS has already begun preparing a White Paper describing the nuts and bolts of the plan outlined by President Mandela in Parliament last months, according to CEA chief Jan Dreyer. Dreyer pledged his service's support for Naidoo, saying he had already begun working closely with the Minister. There is now a major shift in attitude towards addressing development and priorities, he said. An important party of CEAS's job would be to maintain fiscal discipline. The full extent of the CSS's involvement in the RDP has not yet been spelt out but Naidoo has held discussions with its management and indicated it will fall under his jurisdiction, said highly placed CSS sources. The CSS would throw its weight behind the RDP but wanted to ensure that it could still perform its function at a professional level and protect the credibility of its data. The CSS wanted to continue providing information to the private sector. "Where we can play a significant role is in monitoring the implementation of the RDP. The results should be quantifiable," the source said. The SACS has also not yet been officially informed of its future position but its placement in the President's Office is being considered. One of its main jobs will be to report on the RDP's progress. The SACS is currently under Constitutional Minister Roelf Meyer. This suited it during the transition, said a spokesman, but it would be beneficial now for it to fall under the President's Office. "Effective communication would be critical to the [process of reconciliation. "We are always operating on behalf of other ministries but it would not be like that under the President because the SACS would not be easily annexed by one department alone," he said. Another option on the table was for SACS to be taken over by Foreign Affairs, but this was less likely to happen. The prevailing feeling was that most developed countries can target communication exclusively outward, but in a country like South Africa it should be mainly inward, the spokesman said.
