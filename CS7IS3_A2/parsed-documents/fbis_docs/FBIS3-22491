The survey showed that estimates of Chinese population with active TB is 523 per 100,000, and population with positive TB is 134 per 100,000. Estimates of patients contracting active TB and positive TB are around 5.39 million and 1.51 million respectively, despite recent decreases of 2.8 percent and 3.0 percent of patients with active TB and positive TB. Experts believe that the above decreasing rates are still too low compared with that of other diseases. Although large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have shown sharp decreases at an annual rate of 19.2 percent and 15.7 percent respectively, active TB and positive TB cases in autonomous regions and the rural areas such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Guizhou, and Xinjiang have increased approximately 2.4 times and 2.8 times that of large cities.
