In addition to securing certain guarantees with respect to the rights of self-government, the laws adopted provided an opportunity for a number of Federation entities to adopt legislative and normative resolutions determining proper jurisdiction of organs of local self-government and deciding issues in the formulation of local budgets, land use, and the composition and management of municipal property. The natural process of formation and development of the system of local self-government was cut short by the events of September-October 1993, as a consequence of which the representational organs of local power were dissolved. Among the first edicts signed following these events, however, were the edicts of the Russian Federation president regarding guarantees of the rights of local self-government. As these edicts emerged, we were able to trace a certain evolution in the views of presidential structures on the system of self-government. In particular, the change in status of the head of local administration may be considered a positive factor. Whereas in the initial variant the head of a local administration was recognized as the head of local self-government, later edicts reflect the elected head of local self-government as becoming the head of local administration. Unfortunately, some of the issues in these edicts were resolved not in favor of the development of self-government. Thus, the budgetary rights of population centers were significantly encroached upon, the quantitative composition of representational organs was determined by presidential volition, not the will of the voters, and the scope of authority of these organs was restricted, thereby restricting the ability of citizens to adopt one form or another of self-government in their territory. The Russian Federation Constitution adopted 12 December 1993 devotes a separate chapter to questions of self-government, in which its presence is acknowledged quite definitively and guarantees are presented with respect to its rights and the separation of organs of local self-government from organs of state authority. But despite the thorough preparation that went into this fundamental document, certain wordings make it possible, on its basis, both to create a developed system of self-government and to in fact eliminate this entirely. Based on the historical experience of foreign countries and Russia as reflected in the European Charter of Local Self-Government and the Declaration on Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation adopted by the Union of Russian Cities and supported by the Russian Union of Local Self-Government, we consider the following as necessary features of the presence of self-government: --acknowledgement of the population center and its surrounding territory as the primary entity of local territorial self-government; --presence of a general infrastructure securing the vital activity of the populace; --opportunity for the populace to effect realization of direct and representational democracy (specifically--elections of the organs of self-government); --possession by the organs of local self-government of their own jurisdiction, including fundamental jurisdiction in the sphere of municipal property, local taxes and budgets, and use of land in their territory. In accordance with the edict of the Russian Federation president, elections of organs of local self-government should take place prior to June 1994. In this regard, Federation entities are afforded the right, taking historical, ethnic, and other traditions and particularities into account, to adopt the Statute on Self-Government and Statute on Elections to Organs of Local Self-Government in their territories. Even a cursory analysis of the above-mentioned statutes in a number of Russian oblasts leads to the depressing conclusion that self-government has been curtailed, and rigid, centralized rule has been reestablished. Models of pseudo-self-government are being proposed for implementation that are not only far distant from the views of self-government recognized throughout the world, but are even remote from the progressive provisions contained in the president's edict. Here a departure from the Constitution justified on the principle of "revolutionary expediency" is not recognized as any serious violation. In order to return to the civilized path of development of local territorial self-government, we consider it necessary as a measure of first order to review a number of existing legislative acts and adopt new ones, in particular--the Russian Federation Laws "On Principles of Local Self-Government," "On Principles of Administrative-Territorial Structuring," and "On the Budgetary Rights of Local Self-Government," and we appeal to the deputies of the Federal Assembly of Russia with proposals: --to legally secure the basic principles of local self-government in Federal Law as soon as possible; --to review presidential edicts on matters of local self-government over the period September 1993 through the present, verifying their conformance with the Russian Federation Constitution and repealing provisions that contradict it; --to conduct parliamentary hearings dedicated to the course of reform of local self-government in Federation entities, engaging the participation of all-Russian and regional social and political organizations, representatives of the organs of self-government, and all other interested parties. We appeal to the residents of cities, settlements, and rural villages. We appeal to the CITIZENS of Russia! Self-government is the business of citizens themselves--it is a job for you and us. It is necessary that we stand up for our right to establish the power of authority in the localities. There is only one solution--to attain the REALIZATION of what appears in words in existing legislation: the principle of ELECTING and REPLACING AUTHORITY on a systematic basis. In the cities, settlements, and villages, everywhere our lives are in process, everywhere that is our HOME. And if we can influence living conditions in our own home, in our own city, then all of Russia will become our home. The interests of Russia are first and foremost the interests of the people of Russia. We are up to the task, if we just get to work!
