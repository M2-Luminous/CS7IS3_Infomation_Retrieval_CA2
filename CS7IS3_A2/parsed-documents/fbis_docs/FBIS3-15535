The article, titled "The Future of the Baltic States is in Europe", notes that with the Baltic states regaining their independence in 1991, "the injustice, which began with the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, was corrected." "The sphere-of-influence-guided thinking of those days must not come up again. The Baltic region has been and will remain one of the regions in Europe that are particularly sensitive in recording the big tectonic shifts of our time." Kinkel says it is now one of the most urgent tasks to see to it that the Russian Army units still remaining in Estonia and Latvia were pulled out. There is no reason to delay this or make the process dependent on conditions not directly related to it, the German foreign minister says, adding that there can be no justification to keeping one's troops on the soil of an independent country without that the latter so wishes. The German foreign minister also states that his country is putting its full support behind the Baltic countries progressing toward a full member's status in the European Union. As an intercessor for, and protector of the the Baltic states, Germany wants the European Agreement to be signed with these countries still this year. The European Union would be imperfect without the Baltics, Kinkel says. "Europe is not only a geographical but also a cultural concept. The future of the Baltic states is in Europe," the minister concludes.
