Those attending the meeting included Zi Cheng, member of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee Standing Committee, and Zhou Qishun, vice chairman of the Tibet Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. In his opening address, Major General Zhang Zhu, political commissar of the Tibet Armed Police Corps, said: The guiding ideology and main tasks of this meeting are, using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as guidance and based on a series of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important instructions on building up the armed police force, to diligently study and carry out the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the expanded meeting of the CPC Committee of the Armed Police Corps, the Fifth Expanded Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Regional CPC Committee, the Tibet Regional Meeting on Public Security and Judicial Work, and the meeting of directors of public security departments (bureaus); to sum up the Tibet Armed Police Corps' work of 1993; to lay down a plan for its work for 1994; and to mobilize all officers and men to study the situation and to work in a down-to-earth manner, in order to accomplish all tasks entrusted by the higher authorities, to strive to raise the Corps' troop building to a new level, and to make greater contributions to preserving the motherland's unification and to maintaining Tibet's stability. Zhang Zhu pointed out: In the new situation, the responsibilities of the armed police are even more arduous. This year is a crucial one in which the country will deepen reform and develop a socialist market economic system. In this year, Tibet also will launch some major reform measures. These measures will inevitably result in the adjustment of interests and relationships between various sectors, and some new destabilizing factors will emerge in the course of reform. Therefore, maintaining stability is very important -- without a stable social environment, Tibet's economic construction cannot be carried out smoothly. The developing situation urgently requires that we quicken the pace of construction, improve our performance, and raise our work to a new level in the new year. Those attending the meeting included members of the CPC Committee of the Tibet Armed Police Corps; officials in charge of military and political affairs of all detachments; leaders of logistics, frontier affairs, and other sections of all detachments; major leaders of units directly under the corps and of all frontier checking stations; and leaders of the corps' offices and other departments, totalling 110 persons.
