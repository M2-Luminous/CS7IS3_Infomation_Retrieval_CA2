FR940216-0-00062 FR940216-0-00010 C. Nonexhaust Model Nonexhaust emissions are less strongly affected by vehicle design and are influenced by fewer fuel characteristics than are exhaust emissions. In addition, the theoretical principles involved in nonexhaust emissions (which include evaporative, running loss, and refueling emissions) are better understood, and nonexhaust emission control technologies are more consistent across vehicles, than are exhaust emissions and emission control technologies. Since the relationship between fuel properties and nonexhaust emissions is less complex and better understood than for exhaust emissions, there was much less need for EPA to generate additional data to evaluate nonexhaust emissions than was the case for exhaust emissions. EPA was able to base its nonexhaust VOC emission model on data generated from EPA's ongoing nonexhaust emissions testing program that has been used to develop EPA's MOBILE emission inventory models, specifically the MOBILE4.1 and MOBILE5.0A models. EPA believes this data to be sufficient to model the relationship between fuel properties and nonexhaust VOC emissions for the purposes of this rule. Additional information about MOBIL4.1 and MOBILE5.0A can be found in Dockets A&hyph;91&hyph;02 and A&hyph;92&hyph;12. EPA is in the process of developing an enhanced model of nonexhaust VOC emissions, based on a more complete set of theoretical principles and additional test data, that is expected to be more accurate and more widely applicable to oxygenated fuels than the MOBILE models. A preliminary version of this model was discussed at a public workshop held on August 25, 1992, and materials related to this model have been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. At this time, however, this enhanced nonexhaust VOC emissions model is not complete and hence is not incorporated in today's complex model. The nonexhaust VOC model in today's complex model is based on correlations between RVP and nonexhaust VOC emissions derived from the July 11, 1991 version of MOBILE4.1 for Phase I of the reformulated gasoline program (1995&hyph;1999) and from MOBILE5A for Phase II (2000 and beyond). This approach is consistent with the definition of baseline emissions set forth in Section IV.A and is based on the same considerations outlined in that section. To develop the correlations shown below, the MOBILE models were used with temperatures of 69 to 94 degrees Fahrenheit for Class B areas and 72 to 92 degrees Fahrenheit for Class C areas. As discussed in Section IV.A, a basic inspection and maintenance program was assumed for Phase I while an enhanced I/M program was assumed for Phase II. In addition, the presence of Stage II evaporative emissions recovery systems with an overall vapor recovery efficiency of 86 percent was assumed (as discussed in the SNPRM and NPRM). EPA is in the process of promulgating requirements for onboard refueling emission controls which may be more effective at controlling refueling emissions than Stage II vapor recovery systems. However, these requirements did not apply to 1990 model year vehicles and hence cannot be incorporated into the model for certification purposes. In addition, EPA has chosen not to incorporate the effects of onboard refueling controls in its evaluation of the effects of reformulated fuels on emissions from the entire in-use vehicle fleet, which includes vehicles from a number of different model years. This decision was made for several reasons. First, requirements for onboard refueling controls have not yet been finalized, making evaluation of their impact on in-use emissions difficult. Second, onboard refueling controls are not expected to be required on all new vehicles until 2000 and are not expected to be present on the bulk of in-use vehicles for several years after that time. Third, while onboard controls are expected to be more efficient at controlling refueling emissions than Stage II controls, the difference is not expected to be large in areas affected by the reformulated gasoline program and will affect only a small portion of total nonexhaust VOC emissions. Since EPA's analysis of the additional benefits of onboard vapor recovery controls is not yet available, and since such benefits are expected to be small relative to overall emissions, EPA has chosen to retain its assumptions regarding Stage II vapor recovery in forecasting the effects of fuel modifications on nonexhaust VOC emissions from the in-use vehicle fleet. The only toxic air pollutant covered by the reformulated gasoline program that is found in nonexhaust emissions is benzene, which is a natural component of gasoline. The other four toxic air pollutants listed in section 211(k) are solely products of fuel combustion and hence are not found nonexhaust emissions. As discussed in the SNPRM, the Agency's correlation between fuel benzene content and summer non-exhaust benzene emissions is based on results from General Motors' proprietary model of tank vapors, as confirmed independently by EPA-generated data using a number of fuels. Both the derivation and verification of the non-exhaust benzene emissions model are discussed more fully in the RIA. The nonexhaust benzene emission model also depends on the RVP of the fuel, as is the case for the nonexhaust VOC emission model. The derivation of the nonexhaust benzene and VOC models is discussed more fully in the RIA.
