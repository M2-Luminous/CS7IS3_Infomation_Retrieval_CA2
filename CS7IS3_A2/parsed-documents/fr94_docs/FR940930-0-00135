FR940930-0-00135 FR940930-0-00028 II. Description of Action A. Clean-Fuel Vehicle Emission Standards CAA section 242 requires EPA to promulgate regulations setting emission standards and other requirements for CFVs. For LDVs and LDTs, EPA is required to adopt the standards set forth in sections 242 and 243 unless it finds that the standards of the California Air Resources Board LEV program are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the federal standards that would apply to CFVs. EPA cannot make such a finding at this time so today's regulations adopt the standards set forth in the CAA. 1. Light-Duty Vehicle and Light-Duty Truck Clean-Fuel Vehicle Standards a. Requirements of the CAA. Clean Air Act section 241(7) defines a CFV as a vehicle that meets the emission standards applicable under part C of Title II of the CAA. As discussed later in this preamble, CFVs will satisfy the requirements of both the Pilot program and the CFF program. The CFV emission standards for LDVs and LDTs are set forth in sections 242 and 243. (Standards for heavy-duty CFVs under section 245 of the Act are discussed in II.A.2 below.) Any LDV, LDT, or HDV that can operate on only one fuel and that meets these standards will be classified as a CFV regardless of the fuel that is used to meet the CFV standards. However, a CFV in the CFF program must operate on clean alternative fuels, as defined in section 241(2) of the Act, when operating in the covered area. Subsections 243(a) through (d) specify LDV and LDT exhaust emission standards (50K and 100K miles) 3 for the following pollutants: non-methane organic gas (NMOG), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO X ), diesel particulate matter (PM) (only for the 100,000 mile point), and formaldehyde (HCHO). These standards are prescribed in two phases for LDVs and light LDTs (up to 5,750 pounds loaded vehicle weight (LVW) and 6,000 pounds GVWR). Phase I applies only to the Pilot program and takes effect with the 1996 model year (MY), the first year of required sales under the Pilot program. These statutory Phase I standards are numerically identical to those which define the California Transitional Low Emission Vehicle (TLEV). 4 The Phase I standards apply to the Pilot program in MYs 1996 through 2001. Phase II standards are identical to those which define the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV). 5 The Phase II standards apply to the CFF program in MY 1998 and to the Pilot program beginning in MY 2001. Only one set of exhaust emission standards applies to heavy LDTs (above 6,000 lbs. GVWR). These standards take effect in MY 1998 and apply to both the CFF and the Pilot program. Table 2 contains the TLEV and LEV standards for LDV and LDT CFVs. 3 The intermediate useful life for LDV and LDTs is 50,000 (50K) miles. The full useful life for such vehicles is 100,000 (100K) miles. 4 The California TLEV standards are effective in model years 1994 through 1996. 5 The California LEV standards are effective in model years 1997 through 2003. CAA part C section 241 specifies that definitions contained in part A, section 216, shall apply to the CFV programs. The heavy LDT subcategories (i.e., above 6,000 lbs. GVWR) shown in Table 2 are based on test weight. CAA section 216(8) defines ``test weight'', or ``TW'', as the sum of the curb weight and the GVWR divided by two: TW = (Curb weight + GVWR)/2 = ALVW This definition was established in 40 CFR 86.129&hyph;94 by the federal Tier 1 rulemaking (56 FR 25724; June 5, 1991) and is referred to as ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'', or ``ALVW''. The Agency chose to use ALVW, as opposed to TW, to minimize confusion with the term ``equivalent test weight'', which is used interchangeably with ``test weight'' throughout current EPA motor vehicle regulations and test procedures. Therefore, ``test weight'' defined in CAA section 216(8) is referred to as ALVW in this Final Rule, which is consistent with its definition established in the Tier 1 regulations.
