FR940720-1-00020 FR940720-1-00006 The only potential economic impact would be cost of marine type fixtures. As discussed above, that cost is de minimus. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Under federal law, authority to issue regulations to implement the Inland Navigational Rules is vested in the Secretary of transportation and delegated to the Coast Guard. Therefore, if this rule become final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing this subject matter. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
