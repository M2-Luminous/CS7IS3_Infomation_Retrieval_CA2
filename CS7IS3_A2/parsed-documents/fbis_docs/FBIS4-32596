Communal census instructors and clerks are still awaiting their political leaders' views before they go out and do their job. Local census committees insist on having only Albanian census clerks in "pure ethnic regions." Due to the delay, they also request postponement of the operation for as many days as it has thus far been put off. The census is carried out normally in all remaining cities. As the Macedonian television reports, the State Statistics Institute informs that 338,599 citizens, 98,593 households, 104,155 apartments and 39,430 farms have been registered up to June 29, inclusive. Parallel with the census in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is the census of Macedonians throughout the world who have valid documents, regardless of the date of issuance. This operation is carried out in 10 foreign countries in which Macedonia has diplomatic offices, in three countries in which it has only representative offices, and all countries whose authorities gave permission for the census to be realized. Reports from these countries indicate a need of prolonging the deadline. Some sources inform Macedonian citizens of Albanian origin in Switzerland and Germany have announced their intention to boycott the census. No census of Macedonians was allowed in Federal Yugoslavia by the authorities there.
