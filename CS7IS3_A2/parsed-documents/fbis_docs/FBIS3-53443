This was stated by the general officer commanding in chief of the Northern Command, Lieutenant General Surendra Singh, while addressing a press conference at Udhampur yesterday. He said the militants are feeling demoralized. Infighting among the militant groups is also a cause of their frustration. The general said the situation in the state is under control. He, however, did not rule out sporadic incidents of violence or killings by the militants to create tension. He said the so-called strongholds of militants, like Sopor and some other parts in the valley, have been cleared and the people are now heaving a sigh of relief.
