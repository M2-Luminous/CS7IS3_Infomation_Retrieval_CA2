The sources said that during the 12-hour interrogation yesterday, Hadi Hasan gave a full confession on how the crime was planned in coordination with Muhammad Faris Kadhim, chief of intelligence at the Iraqi embassy, and defendants Khalid Khalaf, 'Ali Sultan Darwish, and George Tarjian. According to Hasan, Kadhim had asked him to assassinate al-Tamimi at the orders of the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad, after furnishing him with the crime weapon. The sources note that defendant 'Ali Sultan Darwish confessed to planning and preparing to carry out the crime with his colleagues and to hiding weapons, particularly the murder weapon. Darwish said that the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad had issued orders to assassinate al-Tamimi at once as an opponent of Saddam Husayn's regime. He confessed to committing the crime with his colleagues. The investigating judge has ordered the extension of the defendants' remand in solitary confinement, and prevented visitors. The number of persons implicated in the case has thus risen to five, including three diplomats.
