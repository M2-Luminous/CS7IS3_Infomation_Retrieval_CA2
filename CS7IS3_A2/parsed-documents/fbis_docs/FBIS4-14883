"The danger of spying has considerably increased today and can inflict major damage to independence, defence capability, scientific, technical and economic potential of the country", he told a conference on "Security of Individual, Society, State and Russian Special Services". The director added that secret services of former Warsaw treaty member states and of former Soviet republics also get involved in the spying activities. "This tendency calls to strictly determine the notion of the threat to Russian security", Stepashin said and added that counterintelligence bodies should be strengthened. "A strong democratic Russia should have strong security bodies. As any other state, it has the right to resort to adequate measures to protect its national interests", he said. Stepashin also voiced concern over increased attempts of foreign special services to ensure access to commercial information. Dwelling on anti-crime fight in the country, he warned that mafia is actively trying to penetrate into the bodies of power, also by intimidation and terror. New concepts of ensuring the national security are necessary and the Russian security council is working on them, the director said.
