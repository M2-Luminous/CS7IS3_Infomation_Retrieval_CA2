Under the accord, European enterprises will have the right to compete for public bids in 39 U.S. states while American manufacturers of heavy-electrical equipment will be able to increase sales to state-owned utilities in Europe. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU trade chief Leon Brittan made the announcement at a joint press conference in the city, where 120 ministers are meeting to sign the Uruguay round of trade accord reached last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Kantor said that the accord, to be signed Friday within the Uruguay round framework, will allow the two sides access to markets worth some 200 billion U.S. dollars. But the public market of telecommunications in Europe, coveted by U.S. firms, still remains to be discussed here later. Kantor and Brittan had met several times outside the ministerial meeting of GATT, which opened Tuesday in this Moroccan city and will last till Friday.
