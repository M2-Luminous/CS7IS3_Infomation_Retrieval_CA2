Commenting on this criticism at a news conference following an 11 January cabinet session, Minister of International Trade and Industry [MITI] Hiroshi Kumagai--who is renowned for "sacking a bigwig bureau chief"--refuted the criticism and defended Japanese bureaucrats, saying: "Bureaucrats and politicians share the same judgment." The United States has been escalating its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats. In December last year, Bowman Cutter, special assistant to President Clinton for economic policy, said: "Japanese bureaucrats have a tendency to give more priority to the interests of their respective ministries than to the prime minister's intentions." U.S. Commerce Under Secretary Garten, who is in charge of handling the automobile and auto parts issue, has been shunning contacts with bureaucrats and increasing contacts with other people since he arrived in Japan. The U.S. criticism against Japanese bureaucrats aims to win public support in Japan by shifting its spearhead to the bureaucrats instead of the Hosokawa cabinet which enjoys a high public approval rating, and to keep bureaucratic resistance to the cabinet in check. The relationship between politicians and bureaucrats has changed delicately since the coalition government was inaugurated and the resignation of former MITI Industrial Policy Bureau chief Masahisa Naito drew attention in the United States as a symbol of that change. MITI Minister Kumagai criticized the bureaucrats shortly after taking office, saying, "The Japanese market is a lump of established interests. Government officials are unaware of this because they work at their desks." At the 11 January news conference, however, he defended the bureaucrats, saying, "MITI officials are working hard. They are not closeting themselves in the logic of government office." Stressing the need for the "unity of politicians and bureaucrats," he clarified his attitude that he will not yield to U.S. trade demands. It is believed that, mindful of smoldering distrust of him among MITI officials following the fuss over Naito's resignation, he made the comments in a bid to "mend fences" with them.
