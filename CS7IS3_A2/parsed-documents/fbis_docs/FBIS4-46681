Shprygin, president of the Center for Study of the Conditions of Prices and the Market (Tsenakor) of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Economic Sciences: "Price as a Lever of Financial Stabilization"] [Text] In countries with a developed market economy, stabilization of the financial system and support for the processes of the normal functioning of the market are realized by means of a whole system of economic levers, a key place among which is occupied by prices. Prices operate simultaneously both as an important instrument of control and as an object of government regulation. Having liberated prices, Russia abandoned both, finding itself, in fact, thereby the sole country which had taken the path of complete self-elimination of the state from a controlling impact on prices. This was quickly reflected in the results of management in a thousandfold-plus growth of prices of almost all commodities produced in the country and the complete disorganization of control of the economy. Inasmuch as prices under acute shortage conditions compensate enterprises for virtually all product costs, prices have ceased under the current irrational production structure to influence qualitative changes in production. As a result we are increasingly acquiring a warped economy. What under normal conditions, according to the laws of the market economy, should be efficient and, in keeping with this, have high prices is in our deformed production structure proving cheap, and the less efficient product, more costly. As a consequence, the production structure of Russia is becoming increasingly less efficient and is lagging increasingly noticeably behind countries with a controlled market economy like the United States, Japan, the FRG, and others. There are simultaneously increasing contradictions between the interests of individual enterprises and the long-term interests of all of society. This is being manifested particularly graphically in the sphere of investments, when long-term investments in production, which are beneficial from the viewpoint of the national economy as a whole, are proving disadvantageous from the viewpoint of the current interests of private entrepreneurs. As a result, whereas countries with controlled prices have an opportunity to influence with them inefficient industries and thereby effect progressive structural transformations, we are increasingly losing this opportunity. There are today few people who believe that under the current conditions the market is capable independently, without the intervention of the state, of effectively regulating the proportions of the national economy. The production and financial disproportions have become so deep that continuation of the chosen price policy makes it, in view of its destructive nature, not only pointless but also dangerous for the economic system. These disproportions cannot be rectified by means of an improvement in the financial system alone inasmuch as the state thereof, in turn, depends on the state of the system of prices itself. Their rectification, together with the use of methods of market regulation, requires the active intervention of the state in the regulation of pricing processes. We can hardly, for example, agree with the current pricing practice, whereby significant amounts of national income created in agriculture and the fuel sectors are via the prices of the products coming into these sectors being withdrawn from them, and then the state, by means of a variety of privileges and subsidies, returns to these sectors the funds withdrawn from them. Specifically, by means at this time of a nonequivalent increase in the efficiency of products thanks to an increase in the price (not counting inflation) of metal, mechanical engineering products, electric power, and timber approximately 14 percent of the national income created in coal industry is being withdrawn from this sector, and then, by means of the establishment of a special tax on the prices of the products of the other sectors, the state returns to this sector some of the national income withdrawn from it. What, one wonders, is the point of introducing special taxes and thereby ratcheting up the already high inflation even more when all questions connected with the assurance of normal economic conditions for the functioning of the sector may be settled by means of the establishment of prices objectively estimating the equivalence of exchange of the results of labor between sector and the utility of the product they create? Unfortunately, this is not being done. Approximately the same situation is taking shape in certain other sectors of natural resource use also. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amounts of National Income Withdrawn Via Prices, % | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1988-1990 |1992-1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture[.sup]1[/] |37 |41 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coal industry[.sup]2[/]|12 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil-producing and petrol-|31 |32 | |eum-refining sectors[.sup]| | | |3[/] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Timber[.sup]4[/] |16 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Per volume supplied to the sector of products of: 1, 2 = mechanical en-| |gineering, timber and electric power and metal products; 3 = mechanical engi-| |neering; 4 = machine building, fuel. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is not surprising that these sectors are permanently in a difficult economic situation and are experiencing a chronic shortage of financial resources. Whereas the sectors of natural resource use are losing a substantial part of national income, it is accumulating in surplus in certain manufacturing sectors, on the other hand. Thus in mechanical engineering surplus national income in connection with the higher rate of growth of prices compared with the increase in the efficiency (consumer properties) of the machinery, not counting inflation, constitutes approximately 35 percent, and in commerce, 60 percent. As a result, whereas the efficiency of the sectors of natural resource use is declining on account of the permanent shortage of financial resources, the efficiency of the manufacturing sectors, mechanical engineering particularly, is declining as a consequence of their reduced competitiveness caused by the disproportionate growth of product efficiency by increased prices. Whereas here mechanical engineering withdraws to its advantage via prices per comparable amounts of exchangeable products from the fuel sectors, power engineering, iron and steel industry, timber industry, and other sectors of the national economy up to 40-45 percent altogether of the national income created in these sectors, it, in turn, redistributes some of the national income created in it (up to 10 percent) to the servicing sectors. With such a price policy the financial system becomes extremely muddled and increasingly less capable, and cost proportions and the actual picture of the aggregate product created in the sectors are distorted. As a result, all incentives to labor are lost and the fledgling market relations are destroyed. The state must determine for the market, therefore, insofar as it is not yet itself in a position to do this efficiently, progressive price proportions in the exchange of what are for it the most important products. But it must not compel the manufacturer to make products which are unprofitable for him. The manufacturer himself should decide what kind of products he will manufacture. We see also in the determination of basic price proportions the state's role as equal participant in market relations. It should in this connection occupy a more active position in the harmonization of price proportions and the estimates of the costs of labor in its exchange between sectors and the most important industries inasmuch as the objectiveness of the commensuration of the costs and the results of labor depend on this, and the justification of the levels of pay, pensions, allowances, and other monetary payments are likewise dependent. It has to be stated that in connection with the growth in price disproportions the value assessment of the labor of employees of the base sectors of the national economy frequently proves to be unjustifiably understated compared with the labor of employees of the nonproduction spheres. Thus the value assessment of the heavy and dangerous labor of miners and iron and steel industry workers, counting withholdings from pay, constitutes at the present time approximately 45 percent of the valuation of the labor of employees of commerce, who receive their pay immediately following the sale of a commodity. As far, on the other hand, as the valuation of the labor of a scientist is concerned, it constitutes an even lesser value--26 percent. Thus as a result of the distortion of the price proportions directly influencing the proportions of distribution of the national income into the accumulation fund and consumption fund and, thereby, the proportions of remuneration, the employees of the base sectors of the national economy have come to be the least socially protected. It is not surprising that it is in the sectors of material production that the greatest decline in productivity is occurring and that a recession is observed. In need of government regulation today are the price proportions of the sectors of the fuel and energy complex, transport, and the base industries of mechanical engineering and also the price proportions between agriculture and industry, which are today shaping up to the disadvantage of agriculture and throwing its economy back to the level of the end of the 1970's. Agriculture has always been a sector at whose expense other sectors of the national economy have developed, which has left its mark on its production structure and led to the engineering backwardness of the sector. As a result, the sector cannot compete in many processes with other countries. There is in the agriculture of Russia today a production structure and specialization of production engineering processes which took shape under the conditions of the business relations of the former USSR with a command system of management, when it was planned for each kolkhoz and sovkhoz what would be produced when and in what quantity and to whom the products would be supplied. This production structure was oriented toward large-scale production, to whose servicing industry was adapted also. We have to come to terms with this. It is essential also to consider that agriculture is tied to land which farms have cultivated for many decades and which has, therefore, techniques adapted to the production of strictly defined crops. Changing this production structure which has evolved in the agro-industrial complex will take much time and large resources, which the state does not have. Agriculture cannot under these conditions be approached with the same yardsticks of price liberalization with which we approached industry, especially since in respect to industry this policy has proven ineffective. With its technical backwardness and inadequate competitiveness, agriculture will be in need of government support for a long time to come. The efficiency of the government's price policy in respect to agriculture, therefore, consists not, having set free prices in this sector, in distancing itself from the support of agriculture as quickly as possible but in creating by means of price privileges and a variety of preferences incentives to the concentration of the production of agricultural produce in the most favorable areas of its commodity production. A most effective way of influencing production is the stimulation by prices of resource-saving, and via this, a reduction in the product's prime costs, that is, developing production thanks to economies in resources approximately 3-3.5 times more cheaply than thanks to the development of new deposits and the attraction of new resources. The acquisition by the state of extra revenue thanks to a reduction in prime production costs, not thanks to an increase in prices, should be the main direction of the price and financial policy of the state. It is essential in this connection to return to the practice, which existed previously and which gave a positive account of itself, of the determination of ceiling prices showing the upper limits of prices within which the purchase of products is for the consumer efficient. This would enhance the role of the consumers in pricing processes and simultaneously prompt the manufacturers to reduce production costs. World market prices are a special question. Many economists are speaking of the need for the prices of the domestic market to be aligned with those of world markets. But this cannot be done. So-called "world" prices are the national prices of individual countries reflecting the production costs that exist in these countries and their technical development levels and also the correlations that exist in these countries in the levels of the remuneration of employees and incapable members of society, which with us, as shown above, are distorted. In this connection, adapting our domestic prices to the prices of other countries, we would not only destroy the business ties and techniques that have been created with great difficulty over many years and thereby undermine production even more but also conclusively destroy the economy. The transition to market relations requires a linkage between the pricing processes occurring at the macrolevel and prices at the level of enterprises, individual territories, commodity manufacturers, and the consumers. In order to protect the interests of each participant in social production against any arbitrary action, against the unwarranted intervention of the state in pricing processes included, it is essential to draw up a special pricing law by analogy with the laws that exist in all countries with a developed market economy. Without this, the current chaos in the economy will continue.
