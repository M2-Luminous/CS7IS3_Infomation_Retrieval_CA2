Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue with a tour of several places. We now go to our correspondent Mladen Bosnjak at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency [words indistinct]. Good day. [Bosnjak] Good day. The news conference was very brief and actually consisted of two parts. In the first part, Mr. Kemal Muftic, adviser in the Presidency, read out the joint statement signed by both presidents, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic. Following this, Mr. Tudjman answered a mere one or two questions and that is how this meeting with the press corps ended. I suggest we listen to both; first the joint statement of the two presidents, and then the part, the two brief answers given in response to the correspondents' brief questions. Let us listen. [Begin recording] [Muftic] Ladies and gentlemen, state delegations of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard], headed by Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman and President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, [words indistinct] on 14 June, today in Sarajevo (?held) official talks on furthering relations and areas of possible cooperation between the two neighboring countries, particularly in the area of defense from the mutual aggressor, and several [words indistinct] issues pertaining to the economic, traffic, humanitarian [words indistinct] the process of establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and the establishment of the future confederation with the Republic of Croatia. The two presidents held long talks behind closed doors, and were later joined by the president and vice president of the Federation, Messrs. Kresimir Zubak and Ejup Ganic. The official talks between the delegations were attended on the Croatian side by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr. Mate Granic, Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro, Defense Minister Gojko Susak, the president's National Security adviser, Hrvoje Sarinic, presidential advisers Ivic Pasalic and Slobodan Lang, and the Republic of Croatia's ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Zdravko Sancevic. For the host country, the delegation was comprised of Prime Minister Dr. Haris Silajdzic, Deputy Prime Minister Edib Bukvic, Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic, Foreign Minister Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic, Minister for Industry Faruk Smajlbegovic, Minister for Refugees and Social Welfare Dr. Arif Smajkic, Justice Minister Dr. Kasim Trnka, and Information Minister Ivo Knezevic. In the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, and respect, and keeping in mind the wider international implications of the aggression on both countries, the two presidents expressed the belief that the mutual recognition of all the states created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the international monitoring of Serbian and Montenegrin borders toward Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 787 and 838 [Muftic is interrupted by an unidentified voice that says 769] and 769, (?is) a necessary step for establishing lasting peace in this part of the republic. On this occasion, the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia again confirmed their commitment to peace and a negotiated solution to all conflicts, but their highest representatives consider it necessary that the international community should provide clear guarantees for the cessation of the aggression and occupation, and the full observation of human rights and the territorial integrity of both countries in order to further the relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this sense, they agreed that the following be accomplished through the work of joint commissions: a) The liberalization of the transit of the citizens of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the transit of goods through the Republic of Croatia, according to the laws of the Republic of Croatia. b) Joint [words indistinct] the return of the refugees and displaced persons according to the principle of all to their homes. c) The opening up of all communications and telecommunication links, particularly (?between) Split, Mostar, Sarajevo, Zenica, and Tuzla. The Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina supports the Republic of Croatia in all its legitimate efforts and attempts aimed at a peaceful reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories into its state, legal, and economic system. The Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will jointly build two bridges on the Sarajevo-Ploce railroad. The money, project, and supervision will be provided by Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the work will be carried out by construction companies from Croatia. The stands on the use of the Ploce port have been agreed on in principle. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia will agree on the joint strategy of approach in the talks on the succession with the Islamic countries, especially Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. An agreement was also reached on the joint appearance in third countries through mixed commissions. In order to rationalize the diplomatic network, the embassies of Bosnia-Herzegovina in some countries will represent the interests of the Republic of Croatia and vice versa, where this is proves to be useful. It was also agreed that the problems of the property of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Republic of Croatia and vice verse be solved without delay, in accordance with the interstate agreement. The two presidents agreed that [words indistinct] the individuals who are against the spirit and practice of the established federation and the future confederation be removed. The talks between the highest state delegations of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina were held with the intention to remove all misunderstandings through the constant and direct cooperation of official representatives of the two countries. Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, has invited Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kresimir Zubak, president of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to visit the Republic of Croatia. The invitations have been accepted with pleasure. The visits will be arranged through the usual diplomatic channels. This was the joint statement by the two delegations (?led by) Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman. [Izetbegovic] Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have much time considering that President Tudjman should (?travel further) and that we spent a bit more time on agreeing this statement. Before we start with questions and answers, I would particularly like to draw your attention to the part of this statement that represents the message of President Tudjman and me, a message that consists of two proposals, namely that of all states that emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia start recognizing one another. This is our first message. The second message is that the control of borders be secured, of course, [words indistinct] the Croatian-Serbian border, up in the north, then the Serbian-Bosnian border, and the Montenegrin-Bosnian border. This is what I particularly wanted to draw your attention to. This is our message to the world. The rest more or less concerns our [words indistinct]. This is all. We are ready to answer your questions. Of course, we will not spend (?much time). [Tudjman] I would like to say that the Croatian delegation came to Sarajevo, and not only to Sarajevo as we are, our delegation will continue journey through Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order to contribute to the realization of the Washington agreement on the creation of the Federation and confederation. [Unidentified speaker] We have five minutes. [Correspondent] (?I would like to ask) Mr. Tudjman. Does the Croatian community of Herceg-Bosna exist? [Tudjman] It exists. Since the Croatian community of Herceg-Bosna was created during the resistance against Serbian aggression, it will exist until the Federation comes into life and until the foundations have been laid for the confederation. [Correspondent] Mr. Tudjman. What is the first [word indistinct] Will you go to Kiseljak and (?on from there)? [Tudjman] Leave that for subsequent reporting. [Correspondent] Is there a chance of you visiting some other places, like Mostar [word indistinct] try to help the implementation of the [word indistinct] federation. [Tudjman] Herceg-Bosna does not need to die, but it must be incorporated into the Federation as an essential basis for (?the Federation) and the confederation. [Izetbegovic] The question that you asked has been regulated by the constitutional law very clearly, namely, that the existing authorities continue functioning until the federal authorities are set up. This is the so-called temporary arrangement and that is how it is regulated. [Muftic] (?If there is nothing else) [words indistinct] Thank you for your time. [end recording] [Studio announcer] We have our reporter Mladen Bosnjak with us. Therefore, Mladen, what else was included in the program of the visit by Dr. Tudjman? [Bosnjak] As we have already reported, Croatian President Mr. Franjo Tudjman arrived at Sarajevo Airport at approximately 0930. At approximately 1000 he entered the Presidency building, where we was received by his hosts -- Mr. Izetbegovic, President of Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation Zubak, Vice President of the Federation Ejup Ganic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina prime minister and several ministers in the government, and the Sarajevo mayor. After the ceremonial welcome, the official talks started, which resulted, as we have just heard, in an announcement, that is to say, a statement of the two (?presidents) and also this impromptu news conference. To the surprise of, I would say, his security service, Mr. Tudjman decided to stroll through the streets of Sarajevo from [words indistinct] to the Embassy of the Republic of Croatia, which was ceremonially opened today. On that occasion he met with several Sarajevo residents. It seems to me that these contacts have surprised the Sarajevo residents themselves, however, a certain intimacy and happiness about these contacts could also be sensed, because this is also one of the signs that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the federation of the Croats and the Muslims-Bosniaks, is springing into life. After his stay in the embassy building, Mr. Tudjman [word indistinct] the Presidency building where Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija Izetbegovic held a ceremonial lunch in his honor, and afterward they held the news conference -- we have already heard the recording that we have broadcast unedited to be able to report promptly about the most important event in Bosnia-Herzegovina today. That's it from the Presidency building about Mr. Tudjman's visit in Sarajevo.
