"It is an attempt to interfere in the life of the country," he explains to AVVENIRE, "and foment distrust in all sectors of society." He has run the gauntlet of criticisms and accusations in the past, remaining steadfast and impassive throughout. However, this seems to be Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi's darkest hour. No other issue had ever induced him to hand the minister his resignation. The list of those under investigation refers to allegations against him of embezzlement and abetting crime. Parisi answered our questions cordially. He is indignant, but he regards himself as extraneous to the intrigue. [Ruggiero] Commander Parisi, you knew nothing about all this? [Parisi] Nothing at all. I found out toward midnight on 7 January. I had received no notification before then, nothing whatsoever. [Ruggiero] You denounce maneuvers against you designed, more generally, to destabilize the country. Do you lump everything that is happening together? [Parisi] I do not include the person who compiled the entry in the list of investigations, which is a mandatory procedure, as the Rome public prosecutor has explained: It is a necessary procedure because entry in the list cannot be avoided, whatever sort of allegations are made, even when they are obviously unfounded. Of course, whoever broke the rule of silence, leaking the news late in the day, has not exactly behaved impeccably. [Ruggiero] What we meant by maneuver, however, is everything that preceded your entry in the list. [Parisi] Of course, but, rather than a maneuver this could be merely the sign of a fairly common strategy of defense: launching an attack instead of rallying to the defense, attack as the best form of defense. [Ruggiero] On whose part? [Parisi] The people under investigation, those who attack others violently to bring those others into the limelight rather than themselves. It is an old trick, and we shall have to see what practical advantage it gives them. Those who do it are fishing in troubled waters. [Ruggiero] The allegations are embezzlement and abetting crime. [Parisi] There has been no embezzlement of 3 million lire because I never took that money. As far as the abetting allegation is concerned, it is utter rubbish. However, I am at the examining magistrates' complete disposal to clear up this second issue; the first has already been dealt with. [Ruggiero] The atmosphere is becoming uglier and uglier. Is there a coup in the air? [Parisi] It is not a matter of coups but of an attempt to interfere in the life of the republic by creating a murky climate, rendering it more and more malevolent, and, above all, sowing the seeds of discontent and increasingly widespread distrust in all sectors of society. [Ruggiero] Who might have a vested interest in all this? [Parisi] A lot of people. All those who want to halt the course of history. [Ruggiero] Political forces? [Parisi] I do not want to identify them. I cannot define them, even in terms of class allegiance, because I do not have sufficient information. However, there are interest groups that would like to halt the course of democracy. They are forces with links to the criminal world as well, and who are therefore going all out to hinder the process of renewal. [Ruggiero] There is no connection between real bombs and "bombshells" in the figurative sense? [Parisi] It is difficult to say. Of course, all that has happened in absolutely correct, orthodox terms to clean things up has been submerged by a certain type of campaign, and above all by the misinformation that has been brought in to inflate everything. It is still happening. These developments are highly insidious and hint at subtle minds moving within a well-reasoned and calculated timeframe with the intention of destabilizing the situation. [Ruggiero] This would seem to be your darkest hour. [Parisi] I think that it is the most difficult hour in the history of Italy. My person is of only modest significance in comparison with the general interest. [Ruggiero] All the same, this time you submitted your resignation. [Parisi] It was my duty. [Ruggiero] But you did not do so on a number of other occasions when you came under violent attack, in the Contrada affair, for example. [Parisi] Allow me to say that in that case my role was entirely institutional, not private, and that the whole matter was passed on to the magistrates, so it was up to them to draw their conclusions. [Ruggiero] But have you never entertained suspicions regarding the great festering sore in the secret services? [Parisi] I have no monitoring powers. I left the secret services seven years ago, and five different directors have succeeded one another since then; what should I know about what has been and is happening there? The head of the secret services does not report to the chief of police: He is entirely his own master.
