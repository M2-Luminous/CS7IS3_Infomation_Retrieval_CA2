Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], spoke at the rally on behalf of the CMC and the three general departments. Inscriptions by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen were read at the rally. The three leaders' inscriptions are, respectively: "Carry forward the hard-boned spirit and promote Army building in an all-round way," "Pass on the hard- boned spirit from generation to generation," and "Carry forward the tradition of Red Army veterans and promote the hard-boned spirit." The "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" is famous throughout the services for its steadfast combat readiness, strong militancy, toughened military skills, and strict military and administrative discipline. On 22 January 1964, the Defense Ministry designated it with the honorable title of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company." In 1985, it was again named by the CMC the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company." The company has been cited for collective meritorious service, first class, on three occasions; collective meritorious service, second class, on 11 occasions; and collective meritorious service, third class, on eight occasions. The company's party branch three times has been named an advanced grass-roots party organization in the nation and throughout the services. Yu Yongbo congratulated the company on behalf of the CMC and the three general departments. He said: The growth and progress of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" reflect the painstaking care of three generations of our party's leadership collectives. Chairman Mao received the delegations of the Sixth Company on six occasions. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a high opinion of the company and pointed out: "As far as companies are concerned, they are doing the right thing in emulating the Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the company's work style should not be the work style of one company alone. All companies, and even cadres at all levels, should study hard and train hard like the Sixth Company and should have the political awareness of the company." Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected the company in person and called on us to "carry forward the hard- boned spirit and promote Army building in an all-round way." He also pointed out: The "hard-boned" spirit is the precious spiritual wealth of the PLA. This spirit, in a nutshell, means never bowing before any adversity but rather daring to fight, to sacrifice, and to win. This kind of hard-boned spirit is important in times of war; it is also important in times of peace. Comrade Jiang Zemin's comments, which sum up the Sixth Company's basic spirit and bring to light the profound substance of the "hard-boned" spirit, serve to point out a direction for the emulation of the Sixth Company in the new situation. Yu Yongbo said: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the whole party and the whole nation are marching with big strides along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. As the solid pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship, our Army is entrusted with the sacred mission of safeguarding national security and providing a peaceful environment for reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. We must arouse our morale and fighting will with the "hard-boned" spirit; be loyal to the party, the people, the motherland, and socialism at all times; place the interests of the party, state, and people above everything else; and make new and greater contributions to the party and people. He urged leading cadres at all levels in the military to take the lead and set a good example in emulating and promoting the "hard-boned" spirit, arm the cadres and fighters with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and further enhance their awareness and steadfastness in implementing the party's basic line. It it necessary to guide the cadres and fighters to conscientiously study modern military skills, train hard, constantly enhance their awareness, foster a correct outlook on life and values, and arm the whole Army with this all-conquering, hard-boned spirit. We should, pursuant to the requirements in the reissued "Program for the Construction of Grass-Roots Army Units," develop in large numbers all-round competent companies which are "qualified politically and competent militarily, which have a fine work style, which maintain strict discipline, and which are assured of adequate logistical support." On behalf of the three general departments, Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the General Political Department, presented the company with a horizontal board with the words "Forever preserve and carry forward the hard-boned spirit" inscribed in gold. Also present were leaders of the Nanjing Military Region and Zhejiang Province including Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi, Li Zemin, and Wan Xueyuan, and officers and men of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company."
