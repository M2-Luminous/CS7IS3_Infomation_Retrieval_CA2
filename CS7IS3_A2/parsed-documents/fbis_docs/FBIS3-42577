Oreshkin, department chief at the All-Russia Institute for Market Trends Research of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations: "The Year 1994: Basic Directions in the Formation of Foreign Trade Policy"] [Text] The Russian system of state regulation of foreign economic activities has undergone a difficult two-year period of formation. On the whole, developments moved in the direction of strengthening economic methods of regulating one of the most important spheres of the national economy, albeit not always consistently. In the second half and toward the end of last year the first normative documents were adopted, on the basis of which the basic provisions of national foreign trade policy for 1994 were formulated. We will see how optimal and well-considered the combination of economic and administrative methods of control on the part of the state over the activities of Russian importers and exporters in foreign markets is over the current year. At the editors' request, our regular author, Candidate of Economic Sciences V.A. Oreshkin, department chief at the All-Russia Institute for Market Trends Research of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, reflects on this subject. The basic document that defines the main directions of nontariff regulation of exports from Russia in the current year is the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation Decree No. 1102, issued on 2 November 1993. Like last year, this system envisages first and foremost quota restrictions and licensing of exports of certain categories of products and a special policy regarding exports of strategically important raw materials (SIRM). In 1993 the licensing policy set by Government Decree No. 854, dated 6 November, was on the whole relaxed: Ammonia, synthetic rubber, phosphate fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, methanol, calcium phosphates, and some varieties of timber and sawn lumber were removed from the list of goods to which quotas applied and which constituted the bulk of Russian exports--fuel and electric power and raw materials, although later this list was expanded by adding grain and the products of its processing, oil-yielding crops, ethyl alcohol made from edible raw material, meat and milk products, casein, and wax. Beginning 1 January 1994, in keeping with Decree No. 1102, the list of goods that require export licenses within established quotas included 12 items: fuel and electric power, hydrocarbon raw materials, certain categories of nonferrous metals and raw materials for their production, cellulose, wheat, soy and sunflower seed, nondenatured ethyl alcohol, fish, crustaceans, and caviar. Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation Decree No. 2213-r, dated 10 December 1993, added to this list coniferous varieties of commercial timber and wood ties for mainline railroads. First put into effect on 1 July 1992, the original SIRM list included 13 commodities; in September it was expanded to 15, and after 1 April 1993 it was modified to include fish and fish and marine products, while certain varieties of timber and paper products, sodium, and household items made from aluminum were dropped from it. Thus, the SIRM list became virtually identical to the list of commodities subject to quotas, with the exception of rolled ferrous metals, exports of which were unrestricted. This identification generally remains effective for 1994, although the SIRM list defined by aforementioned documents Nos. 1102 and 2213-r is somewhat broader than the list of commodities subject to quotas due to the inclusion of some varieties of nonferrous, alkaline, alkaline-earth, and rare metals and materials for their production, fertilizer, raw diamonds, and sawn coniferous varieties of lumber. Government Decree No. 1103, dated 30 October 1993, made effective as of 1 November new export duty rates for goods exported from the territory of Russia, and GTK [State Customs Committee] of Russia Directive No. 479, dated 11 November 1993, set the procedures for their calculation and collection. In 1992-1993 export duties applied to about three-quarters of Russian exports. Exports of fuel and raw materials, foodstuffs, and industrial semifinished products were subject to duty. Of finished industrial goods, tariff regulation applied to exports of aviation equipment and arms. New export tariffs differ from those previously in effect first and foremost in the following respect: --the list of goods subject to export duties has been cut almost by half (to 29 items) due to the exclusion of animal husbandry products and the products of their processing, certain varieties of food-processing output, alcohol, paper and cardboard, printed material, and textile raw materials and semifinished products; --duties vary by item and range from 2 to 64,000 ECU per tonne of exported commodity (in the past the maximum rate was as high as 80,000 ECU); ad valore custom rates--from 3 to 25 percent (5 to 70 percent, respectively). The most noticeable reduction in duties occurred with respect to agricultural products and foodstuffs, to which high export rates were applied in the past at a "proscriptive" level in order to limit exports, since exports of such products from Russia in 1993 were to a considerable extent made possible by state subsidies, which later dropped off sharply. There has been a perceptible reduction in duties with respect to certain varieties of nonferrous metals and raw materials for their production. According to Decree No. 1102, exports of goods for state needs and exports of commodities from Russia to CIS countries on a clearing or interrelated basis are exempt from export duties in 1994, as they were in 1993. Policy in the area of tariff regulation of exports in 1994 will be formed taking into consideration the same factors as the policy in the area of administrative regulation. Exports of a number of raw materials that previously fell under the government's administrative and economic control currently no longer have to be restricted, either directly or indirectly: Domestic prices for them have reached the world level or even exceeded it, which leads to practically identical results regardless of whether these goods are sold on the domestic or foreign market. I want to remind you that in keeping with the Law "On Customs Tariffs" quantitative restrictions on exports and tariff regulation expire on 31 December 1995. Liberalization of foreign trade policy with respect to Russian exporters in 1994 does not mean that the state forfeits control over their "civilized" conduct in carrying out deliveries of products to the foreign market. Strengthening of this control will be aimed first and foremost at the timely repatriation of foreign currency earnings to Russia. On 12 October 1993 the Central Bank and the GTK of Russia issued Joint Instruction No. 19 and 01-20/10283, which sets the procedure for hard currency control over repatriation to the Russian Federation of foreign currency earnings from exports of goods. For SIRM exports it goes into effect on 1 January 1994, for all other goods--on 1 March 1994. As is known, over the past two years similar documents had been adopted at different levels of legislative and executive authority on numerous occasions. The aforementioned instruction is probably the first appreciable step on the road to creating a real working mechanism of control over repatriation of foreign currency proceeds by exporter enterprises. The control structure is quite complex, since it must tie into a single chain all the Russian components of an export deal: "exporter--customs--bank." In keeping with the instruction, control documentation has been introduced allowing the passage of goods over the border to be traced, and foreign currency proceeds to then be repatriated. In these circumstances the role of authorized banks increases dramatically, since now they will in fact perform the functions of foreign currency control agents, especially when possible sanctions and penalties envisaged by the instruction are applied. Another direction of strengthening export control on the part of the state is necessitated by factors of an "external" nature. On 2 December 1993 Government Decree No. 1248 was issued "On Measures of Settling Trade Disputes Arising in Connection With Exports of Russian Goods." In keeping with this, the government will implement control over the activities of exporting enterprises whose dishonest trade practices lead or may lead to importing countries imposing antidumping or other restrictive measures with respect to Russian goods. Such control will be exercised in the form of establishing additional quotas for exports of commodities with respect to which importer countries introduce restrictions; requiring their licensing; setting minimum export prices; and limiting the actual number of exporters. The MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] has the right to revoke the export licenses of Russian exporters--regardless of form of ownership--that are identified as "violators." Russian exporters should be aware of the preferences they may be eligible to claim in exporting goods to the countries of the European Community [EC], which unites 12 states in Western Europe. The point is that the General System of Preferences of the European Communities (GSP EC) has been in effect since 1971, which envisages customs and tariff preferences in importing into EC countries goods from a state to which the preferential (favored) treatment is extended. In order for a commodity exported from Russia into EC countries to qualify for this preferential treatment, the Russian exporter has to present in these countries a Form "A" certificate of the origin of goods issued by MFER authorized representatives in the regions in keeping with departmental instruction No. 452 dated 24 June 1993 "On Procedure of Issuing Certificates of the Origin of Goods for Selling Within the General System of Preferences of the European Community (GSP EC)." Otherwise, "nonpreferential" rates of European Community customs duties will be applied to imports. The system of regulating imports in 1994 includes the same instruments as last year--procedures for determining the customs value of imported goods and control over their safety, procedures for establishing the country of origin, tariff and tax regulation of imports, etc. However, in keeping with Government Decree No. 985 dated 30 September 1993 and GTK of Russia Instruction No. 445 dated 1 November 1993, on 11 October 1993 new rates of excise taxes on imported goods went into effect, which are higher compared to those in the past. Then excise tax rates were once again modified in keeping with Government Decree No. 1185 dated 19 November 1993 and made effective by GTK of Russia Instruction No. 501 dated 26 November 1993. Currently excise tax rates in effect range from 10 to 250 percent of the customs value of imported goods. Letter No. 01-13/11649 of the GTK of Russia dated 22 November 1993 establishes the procedure for importing goods by physical persons. The main provision of the document is to set general provisions for regulation of imports of goods, including payment of duties, value-added tax, excise tax, customs fees, and so on, for both legal and physical persons if these goods are imported with the intention of their subsequent use for production or commercial purposes. The tightening or liberalization of import policy in the future will depend to a large extent on new import tariff rates, which are now at the stage of approval. In the current year work will continue on the formation of a normative base which will define the contents of customs regulations set by the Customs Code, and the finalization of trade regulations governing trade with all countries that are former USSR republics. The MFER has completed work on analyzing the reports of enterprises, sectors, and regions in utilizing the means received as a result of preferences granted in 1992-1993 in their conduct of foreign economic activities. In the future the ministry, which has always advocated an integrated system of state regulation of foreign economic activities, will strengthen record-keeping and control over the receipt and targeted use of such means.
