"The proclamation of these decrees," the letter says, "is dictated by the imperative need to pull the country out of the economic crisis and to continue the reforms. Due to various reasons, the present legislation does not ensure the needed conditions for the effective reformation of the Russian economy. Due to this, and in order to fulfil their constitutional duties and the president's and government's commitments under the social concord agreement, a decision was adopted to step up the ongoing economic transformations. The president informed the State Duma that after the adoption of his decrees, the Government of the Russian Federation was instructed to submit to the Federal Assembly (parliament) bills, worked out on their basis, so that the latter could adopt amendments and supplements to the legislation in force. "The decrees, in the part relating to the competence of the Federal Assembly, will remain in force until corresponding federal laws are adopted," the president's letter says.
