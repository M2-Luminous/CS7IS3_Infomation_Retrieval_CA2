Robertson, Branch Chief, (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant is a periodic payment plan, which registered as a unit investment trust on July 30, 1958 by filing a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On the same day, applicant filed a registration statement on Form S&hyph;6 under the Securities Act of 1933 to register its securities. The registration statement was declared effective on or about April 12, 1961, and applicant's initial public offering commenced soon thereafter. 2. Applicant consisted of Insurted Systematic Investment Plans and Single Payment Plans (collectively, the ``Plans'') under which payments by planholders were invested in shares of Pioneer Fund, an open-end investment company. Each Plan was established and governed by the terms of (a) an individual agreement among the investor, and depositor, Pioneer Plans Corporation, and (b) a custody agreement between a sponsor and the custodian, State Street Bank. The individual agreements and the custody agreement were governed by the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 3. On December 20, 1990, the board of directors of Pioneering Services Corporation approved a plan of conversion which would convert each Plan to a Pioneer Fund Open Account. This vote subsequently was ratified by a written action of directors dated as of February 22, 1994. 4. Planholders who had completed their contractual Plan payments at the time of conversion were notified of the conversion by letter dated January 2, 1991. On the same day, planholders who had not completed their contractual payments were given the right to purchase shares of Pioneer Fund at a reduced sales charge of 2% to complete their Plans. This charge was lower than the amounts that would have been required to complete their Plan obligations. 5. On January 5, 1991, Pioneer Plans Corporation converted each Single Payment Plan and Insured Systematic Investment Plan to a Pioneer Fund Open Account. Upon the effectiveness of the conversion, the entire share balance of each Plan was transferred to a Pioneer Fund Open Account registered in the name of the holder of the converted Plan. The conversion had no effect on the value of the assets held in the Plans ( i.e. , shares of Pioneer Fund). 6. Pioneering Services Corporation paid all expenses in connection with the conversion. Expenses were incurred to pay the manager of the project, and mailing and printing costs. 7. Applicant has no debts or other liabilities outstanding, and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant had no planholders at the time of filing of the application. 8. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. Applicant presently has no legal existence under the state laws pursuant to which it was created. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10198 Filed 4&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
