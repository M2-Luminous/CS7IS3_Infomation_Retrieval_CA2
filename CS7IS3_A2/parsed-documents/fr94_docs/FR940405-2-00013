FR940405-2-00013 FR940405-2-00007 Comment 2: Krupp alleges that the Department suggested, and later confirmed, through a memorandum to the file that the Department had destroyed Krupp's proprietary questionnaire responses submitted in 1983 and 1984. Department's Position: The Department did not destroy documents relevant to this period of review. Prior to publication of the preliminary results of this administrative review, we were unable to locate documents other than written public versions of Krupp's 1983 and 1984 responses to requests for information. Subsequent to publication of the preliminary results of review, we discovered a few boxes of documents bearing the administrative proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex to the Central Records storeroom. A thorough review of the information contained in those documents revealed that it ``pertained either to a different company, an irrelevant period of review, or was in an unusable computerized format for purposes of a dumping analysis.'' See Memorandum to the File from Jackie Johnson, Case Analyst, dated March 2, 1991. Other than indicating what the Department was ultimately able to locate in its files, the memorandum contains no statement that any of Krupp's files were destroyed, nor does the memorandum contain any implication that this was done. Accordingly, contrary to Krupp's allegations, the memorandum does not support the contention that the Department destroyed any documents whatsoever. Comment 3: Krupp argues that the statutory language and legislative history of sections 776(b) and (c) of the Tariff Act explicitly prohibit the Department from using information submitted in support of a petition as BIA in an administrative review. Krupp contends that petition information may only be used for purposes of a final BIA determination in an investigation. The petitioner supports the Department's use of an adverse BIA rate based on information from the petition arguing that the Department's regulations not only allow the Department the discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what is the best information available, but explicitly allow for the use of information submitted in support of a petition as BIA. See 19 CFR 353.37. Department's Position: We do not agree with Krupp's interpretation that either the statute or its legislative history prohibits the Department from using the information submitted in support of a petition as BIA for the margin in an administrative review. While section 776(b) of the Tariff Act indicates that the Department ``may'' use information from the petition as a basis for a final determination in an investigation, this section contains no prohibition, explicit or otherwise, against using such information as a basis for the final results of an administrative review. Indeed, section 776(c) of the Tariff Act explicitly states that, in making its ``determinations under this [sub]title,'' the Department ``shall, whenever a party *␣*␣* refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, use the best information otherwise available.''
