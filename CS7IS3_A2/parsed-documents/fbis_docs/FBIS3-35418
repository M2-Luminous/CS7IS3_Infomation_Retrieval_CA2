The explosion occurred as the train was passing the village of al-Muti'ah after leaving Asyut Station. Some 11 passengers, including six tourists, were injured in the explosion. They include: Major Faysal Fattuh al-Wakil of Suhaj; Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hayy, a technician in the Arab Contractors Company; Faysal Fahmi Adam, an orthopedist at Asyut University; Lieutenant Jamal Ahmad Husayn, a resident of Suhaj; and Rif'at 'Abd-al-Majid, a train worker. The wounded tourists are Angel Ascot and Joe Fix, New Zealand; Ulrike Dolgan and Christian Schreiker, Germany; and Grace Casio and Jocelyn Clonita, Australia. They were all slightly hurt. All the wounded were taken to Asyut University Hospital for treatment. The explosion occurred in the second coach on first class, damaging the coach roof and shattering windows. An initial examination of the train indicates that the shattered glass probably injured the passengers. Leading officers in the Asyut Security Directorate, the criminology laboratory, and various detective agencies went to the scene and the prosecution was notified to launch an investigation. Investigations are under way to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident. The train was sent on its way to Suhaj then Luxor after an inspection by explosives experts.
