The attitude of the Tiraspol authorities is completely different. In Tiraspol some are ready to cooperate with us in normal conditions, while other think we are spies, the quoted source states. Our mission's mandate is valid for one single state -- the Republic of Moldova, recognized by the world community. Any attempt to create an artificial state within Moldova is doomed to failure, as it had not and will not have the support of world community. For the conflict's solution, the CSCE mission's recommendations suggest, on one hand, the consolidation of the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Moldova, and, on the other, the necessity to grant a special statute to the Dniester region, which would provide a series of rights for this region, said the interviewed. Dabrova referred to the peace-maker role Russia assumed, mentioning that it declares "wherever and whenever possible that it promotes peace in various conflict zones on Earth" and it "demands from international organizations, CSCE in particular, material, moral, and political support of this role it assumed." At the same time, "to provide this support we would like first to see how Russia asks for support while it provides no proof to persuade us what and how actually happens." Theoretically, Russia accepts to cooperate with the CSCE mission to Moldova, but practically hinders its cooperation with the Joint Control Commission. I believe Moldova will not stand another military conflict, but it is long until the conflict is solved. The prospects over the next years cannot be optimistic for Moldova, which, as all other states in the region, has a period of dismantling a system and searching for another, more favorable one, the quoted source notes.
