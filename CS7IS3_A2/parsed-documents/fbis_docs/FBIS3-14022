Earlier, Russian President Yeltsin, in a letter to the Indian Government, expressed his concern over the blatant violation of human rights by the Indian security forces in occupied Kashmir and urged the Indian rulers to stop the atrocities. It was not only the United States and other Western countries that had kept patting India on the back for not implementing the UN resolutions on holding a plebiscite on the Kashmir issue, but Russia, too, which, during the Soviet Union era, openly supported India on the issue. This had been the Russian posture all along--from vetoing Security Council resolutions against India to Nikita Khrushchev's outright rejection of Kashmir as an issue. Recent statements by personalities holding the most important positions in Russia on human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and in support of the Kashmiris' right to self-determination indicate the emergence of a positive change in the Russian foreign policy after the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union. This can be termed as a welcome development for the resolution of this long-standing issue. The shift in the Russian stand on occupied Kashmir --no matter whether due to a greater awareness in the United States and other Western countries of the human rights violations in the valley, or to the tough resistance by the Kashmiris -- is a good and welcome change that will help secure an early solution to the Kashmir problem. *
