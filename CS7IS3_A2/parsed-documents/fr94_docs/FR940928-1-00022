SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Registers of October 12, 1988 (53 FR 39783), February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7596), and January 16, 1991 (56 FR 1631), which announced that Merck Sharp & Dohme, Division of Merck & Co., Hillsborough Rd., Three Bridges, NJ 08887, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 8F3649 for celery, PP 9F3703 for tomatoes, and PP 0F3880 for strawberries) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances for residues of the pesticide abamectin B 1 and its delta-8,9-isomer (a mixture of abamectin containing greater than or equal to 80 percent abamectin B 1b (5-0-demethyl abamectin A 1a ) and less than or equal to 20 percent abamectin B 1a (5-0-demethyl-25-di(1-methylpropyl)-25-(1-methylethyl) abamectin A 1a )) in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) celery at 0.035 part per million (ppm); tomatoes at 0.005 ppm; and strawberries at 0.02 ppm and a feed additive petition (FAP 9H5570) proposing to amend 40 CFR 186.300 by establishing a feed additive regulation under section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.348) for abamectin B 1 and its delta-8,9-isomer in or on tomato wet pomace at 0.01 ppm and tomato dry pomace at 0.07 ppm. On January 31, 1990, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Division of Merck & Co. requested that the pesticide petitions be amended by increasing the proposed tolerances for the RACs tomatoes (PP 9F3703) and celery (PP 8F3649) to 0.01 and 0.05 ppm, respectively, and by deleting the proposed tolerance on wet tomato pomace (9H5570) since there is no distinction between wet and dry pomace, and the higher proposed feed additive tolerance of 0.07 ppm for tomato pomace is adequate. Subsequent to the initial notices of filing, EPA established import tolerances for residues of abamectin B 1 and its delta-8,9 isomer on the RAC fresh tomatoes at 0.01 ppm and established a feed additive regulation for tomato pomace at 0.07 ppm for tomatoes imported from Mexico. (See the Federal Register of December 13, 1991 (56 FR 6503)). Although the tolerance level proposed for tomatoes is the same as that established in December 13, 1991, that tolerance was limited to fresh tomatoes only. The current proposed tolerance is for all tomatoes. Since the tolerance level proposed for tomato pomace is the same as that established in December 13, 1991, FAP 9H5570 is being administratively withdrawn. The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in related documents published in the Federal Registers of May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23209, cottonseed) and August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836, citrus). The Agency used a two-generation rat reproduction study with an uncertainty factor of 300 to establish a Reference Dose (RfD). The 300-fold uncertainty factor was utilized for (1) inter- and intra-species differences, (2) the extremely serious nature (pup death) observed in the reproduction study, (3) maternal toxicity (lethality) no-observable-effect level (NOEL) (0.05 mg/kg/day), and (4) cleft palate in the mouse developmental toxicity study with isomer (NOEL = 0.06 mg/kg/day). Thus, based on a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day from the two-generation rat reproduction and an uncertainty factor of 300, the RfD is 0.0004 mg/kg/body weight (bwt)/day. A chronic dietary exposure/risk assessment has been performed for abamectin using the above RfD. Available information on anticipated residues and 100% crop treated was incorporated into the analysis to estimate the Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC). The ARC is generally considered a more realistic estimate than an estimate based on tolerance-level residues. The ARC from established tolerances and the current action is estimated at 0.000106 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 26.5 percent of the RfD for the U.S. population. The ARC for children, aged 1 to 6 years old, and nonnursing infants (subgroups most highly exposed) utilizes 64.2 and 95.1 percent of the RfD, respectively. Generally speaking, the Agency has no cause for concern if anticipated residues contribution for all published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD. Because of the developmental effects seen in animal studies, the Agency used the mouse teratology study (with a NOEL of 0.06 mg/kg/day for developmental toxicity for the delta-8,9 isomer) to assess acute dietary exposure and determine a margin of exposure (MOE) for the overall U.S. population and certain subgroups. Since the toxicological end point pertains to developmental toxicity, the population group of interest for this analysis is women aged 13 and above, the subgroup which most closely approximates women of child-bearing age. The MOE is calculated as the ratio of the NOEL to the exposure. For this analysis, the Agency calculated the MOE for high-end exposures for women ages 13 and above. The MOE for the high-end exposure is 167. Generally speaking, MOEs greater than 100 for developmental toxicity are acceptable to the Agency. The metabolism of the chemical in plants and livestock for this use is adequately understood. Any secondary residues occurring in meat, meat byproducts, or milk will be covered by existing tolerances for those commodities. There is no reasonable expectation of finite residues in poultry and swine commodities; therefore, no tolerances are necessary at this time. Adequate analytical methodology (HPLC-Fluorescence Methods) is available for enforcement purposes. Prior to publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the enforcement methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Reponse and Program Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202 (703)-304-5232. The tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will be adequate to cover residues in or on celery, strawberries, and tomatoes. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
