FR940825-1-00039 FR940825-1-00008 Several commenters urged HUD to eliminate the requirement in the 1988 proposed rule that applicants and tenants must submit original immigration documents for verification with the INS. These commenters asserted that the proposed rule failed to consider the burden this requirement would impose upon individuals who had to surrender their INS documents, or upon HAs that would have to implement costly procedures to keep track of these documents. As an alternative, these commenters suggested that individuals be permitted to submit certified copies of INS documents, with original INS documents required only when the responsible entity has a reasonable suspicion of fraud or misrepresentation. HUD has consulted with the INS about whether certified immigration documents, rather than original INS documents, are acceptable for SAVE verification. The INS has indicated to HUD that ``*␣*␣* only originals of documents denoting immigration status'' may be used to establish eligibility through the SAVE system. Consequently, HUD does not have the discretion to modify this provision of the rule. However, it should be noted that under no circumstance should a responsible entity retain in its possession any original INS documents. The responsible entity should review the original INS document, make photocopies of the document for its own records, and return the original document to the applicant or tenant as quickly as possible. This restriction on the retention of original INS documents by the responsible entity is included in the 1994 proposed rule. 4. When Documentation Is To Be Submitted Two commenters noted that the 1988 proposed rule did not contain time limits for applicants and tenants to submit their immigration documents. The commenters stated that, to the extent immigration documents must be submitted within the time period for the general recertification of eligibility process, it would be ``too brief a period.'' HUD agrees with the suggestion that owners and housing authorities (HAs) must provide notice of the time period for submission of immigration documents. Section VI.A.3 of this preamble describes the time for submission of documents as provided in the 1994 proposed rule. The 1994 proposed rule also requires owners and HAs to inform applicants and tenants of this time period in the notice to applicants and tenants that advises them that the provision of financial assistance or continued financial assistance is contingent upon the submission and verification of immigration documents. Another commenter asked that the rule clarify that the responsible entity's notice to tenants and applicants, advising that financial assistance is contingent upon the submission and verification of immigration documents, be in writing. HUD intended that this notice be in writing, and the 1994 proposed rule makes this clarification. Several commenters asked HUD to include in this notice, as well as the notice informing ineligible applicants and tenants about the denial or termination of assistance, of the existence of, and the procedures for obtaining relief under, the ``preservation of families'' provision. HUD agrees that both of these notices should inform applicants and tenants that they may qualify for relief under the preservation of families provision, and indicate the criteria and procedures for obtaining such relief, and the 1994 proposed rule adopts this requirement for notices. 5. Removal of 1988 ``Reason to Suspect'' Provisions A number of commenters expressed concern that the 1988 proposed rule authorized an owner or HA to initiate termination procedures whenever there is evidence of conflicting or inconsistent information regarding an individual's identity or claimed citizenship status. Several commenters claimed that the 1988 rule's ``reason to suspect'' provision invites discrimination against anyone who ``appears foreign,'' and they urged that sanctions be imposed upon responsible entities that are found to have discriminated on this basis. The 1994 proposed rule removes this provision. Any false statement or fraudulent evidence concerning eligibility on the basis of eligible citizenship or immigration status should be handled in the same manner that an owner or HA addresses false statements or fraudulent evidence with respect to other aspects of eligibility. To the extent possible, eligible citizenship or immigration status should be treated the same as other factors that are taken into consideration in determining a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance. Except where mandated by statute (notice requirements, verification procedures, hearing requirements, special relief provisions), the proposed rule directs the responsible entity to rely on existing procedures that are in place and applicable to other eligibility factors. 6. Privacy Issues One commenter asked HUD to revise the provision in the 1988 proposed rule that granted authority to HUD to share with Federal, State or local government agencies any information that it obtains during the verification process. The commenter stated that information concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status obtained by HAs and project owners during the verification process should not be used for any purpose other than to determine eligibility for assistance. Information contained in the HUD systems of records is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Information gathered by HAs or private owners is not. However, any information gathered by these entities could be subject to State or local privacy laws. The 1988 proposed rule purported to list all the sources to which the information could be released and the purposes for which the information could be used. HUD has concluded that a rule cannot anticipate all the possibilities in which such evidence may be compelled to be released by HUD or the project owner or HA under applicable law, and the 1994 proposed rule removes the list of circumstances in which evidence of eligible status may be released. (Section VI.A.7 of this preamble describes how the 1994 proposed rule addresses this issue.)
