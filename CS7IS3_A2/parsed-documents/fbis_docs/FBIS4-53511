According to the results, 36 percent of the respondents said "Japan-U.S. relations are in good shape or they are in relatively good shape" and the figure shows a 20-percent drop from 55 percent in the October 1991 telephone poll conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN. According to the poll's results, 21 percent of those surveyed forecast that "they [relations] will worsen in the future," far exceeding the 13 percent who predicted, "They will be better than now." Asked about their interest in and image of the United States, 76 percent cited "guns and murders," whereas 41 percent cited "freedom and democracy." Nonetheless, the results of the recent poll showed that while people's perception of the United States as an important nation heightened, the percentage of those surveyed who called for repealing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty shrank, and the percentage of those who favored keeping the treaty as written increased. In the recent poll, 8 percent of those surveyed answered that "Japan-U.S. relations are in bad shape while 38 percent answered "they are in relatively bad shape." In this way, 46 percent answered that Japan-U.S. relations are not in good shape and the percentage was an increase of 13 percentage points from 33 percent in the October 1991 telephone poll. The results of the recent poll showed that the younger generation takes a pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations while the older generation takes an optimistic view of them. Skilled engineers, business mangers, and white-collar workers take a relatively pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations. Compared with the past three polls since 1989, the results of the recent poll showed a decline in the percentage of those who answered that "Japan-U.S. relations will be better than now" and an increase in the percentage who answered "they will worsen in the future." Almost all of the younger generation takes a pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations. Asked about their interest in and image of the United States, 76 percent cited "guns and murders" whereas 41 percent of them cited "freedom and democracy." Thirty-five percent cited "drugs," and 32 percent "racial discrimination," with 22 percent pointing to "movies, music, culture and recreation." In this way, the Japanese had no good image of the United States. Asked what to do with their family members or relatives if they intend to stay for a long time in the United States for study or other purposes, 42 percent said "I have no position," while 41 percent said "We oppose them staying in the United States for a long time," with 17 percent "favoring them staying in the United States for a long time." Asked to comment on former Prime Minister Hosokawa who said "no" at the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, 73 percent said "We rate his act highly," while 23 percent said "We cannot rate his act highly." Asked to comment on the Super 301 provision which the United States intends to invoke to slap high duties on imported Japanese goods, 53 percent stated, "The United States should not invoke the provision" while 20 percent of them stated, "U.S. invocation of the provision is inevitable." Asked about the cause of the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, 17 percent of those surveyed said "Japan is responsible for it" while 16 percent said "The United States is mainly responsible," with 54 percent saying "We have no position." Compared with the October 1991 telephone poll, the results of the recent poll showed a flat line in the percentage of those who said "Japan is responsible for it or we have no position on it" and a drop of 16 percent from the 23 percent in the previous poll who said "The United States is mainly responsible for it." Asked if the United States is an important nation for Japan in the December 1991 poll, 22 percent of the respondents said "The United States is the most important nation for Japan," while 61 percent said "The United States is one of the important nations for Japan," with 6 percent saying, "The United States is not such an important nation for Japan." In the recent poll, however, 23 percent said "The United States is the most important nation for Japan," while 66 percent said "The United States is one of the important nations for Japan," with 5 percent saying "The United States is not such an important nation for Japan." In this way, the results of the recent poll showed that the Japanese perception of the U.S. importance in Japan heightened a little. With regard to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the percentage of those polled who favored repealing the treaty largely shrank, and the percentage of those who favored keeping the treaty as written largely increased compared with the October 1991 telephone poll.
