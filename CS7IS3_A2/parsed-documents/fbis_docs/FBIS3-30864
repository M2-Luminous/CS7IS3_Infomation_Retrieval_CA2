Deputy Interior State Secretary Pal Kara became OVB secretary. Members are Arpad Erdei, Hungarian Lawyers' general secretary, Sandor Horvath, Independent Lawyers' Forum vice-president, Istvan Kukorelli, dean of constitutional law at Budapest Eotvos Lorand University, and Janos Nemeth, Eotvos general deputy rector. In keeping with the Hungarian-U.S. inter-governmental agreement on intellectual property rights, Parliament today amended a 1969 law, bringing it into line with European legislation. A draft resolution was adopted to join the 1961 Rome Convention protecting performing artists, audio record manufacturers, and broadcasters. Changes concern rights of both authors and performers, as well as the patents system. Earlier legislation covering chemical, food, and pharmaceutical products protected the manufacturing process, while now the product itself will enjoy legal protection.
