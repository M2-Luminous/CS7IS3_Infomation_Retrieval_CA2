In a letter to the UN secretary general the East Timor resistance says that the United Nations has double standards when it comes to defending universal principles. The letter, dated 31 March, and signed by Konis Santana, leader of the armed front, was given to Butrus-Ghali last Friday, the day the Portuguese and Indonesian foreign ministers met in Geneva. In the letter, revealed by the LUSA news agency today, the resistance leaders speak of cases where acts of aggression had failed, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, in order to stress that the Indonesian occupation of East Timor has only given rise to UN resolutions which have not substantially altered the situation. According to Konis Santana, this situation continues because of the political, economic and commercial geostrategic interests of powerful nations, which lead the United Nations to use double standards when dealing with acts of aggression.
