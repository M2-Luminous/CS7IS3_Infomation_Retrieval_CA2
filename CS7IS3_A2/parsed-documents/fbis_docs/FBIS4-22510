About 120 million Russians live in Russia, and about 30 million citizens belong to other nationalities. Of these 30 million, slightly fewer than a third--nearly 9 million--comprise immigrants from the former union republics of the USSR. In other words, of every dozen Russians, one is connected in some way with those lands now known as the near abroad. He is connected by bad memories sometimes, unfortunately. But basically the number cited--one in a dozen--is made up, understandably, not of Russian immigrants but of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Armenians, Azeris, Moldovans, Georgians, Uzbeks, Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Kyrgyz, Turkmen, and Tajiks. This somewhat unusual order of listing is by decreasing number of representatives of these peoples within the borders of Russian territory. The largest group living in Russia are the Ukrainians--4.4 million. The fewest of all are the Turkmen--about 40,000. Major diasporas include the Belarusians, 1.2 million, the Kazakhs, 0.64 million, the Armenians, 0.5 million, and the Azeris, 0.34 million. There are a little over 100,000 Georgians and Moldovans each. The majority of the peoples of the former union republics are represented in Russia by the same number of citizens as the population of a major city might comprise. Does the Russian state remember that these people too have national feelings and interests? These people do not make up republics or autonomies, as do other nationalities residing in Russia, nor are they demanding this. Thus it is even more pointless to ignore their demands. Above all for information. Nationality-group societies and confessional organizations might concern themselves at least somewhat with the cultural, religious, and educational requirements and needs of their fellow tribesmen, but it is beyond the powers of such organizations to arrange for issuing periodicals, to say nothing of radio and television. The old information connections have been completely disrupted. It used to be in Moscow a person could easily subscribe to or purchase republic newspapers and magazines, radio and television broadcast programs produced in the union republics, and all kinds of festivals, TV bridges, and so forth, were organized. Of course, in all this there was, often even overwhelmingly, a degree of falsity, mere show, deceptive and self-serving propaganda, which is in fact why the "single information space" collapsed. But in starting to talk now about reestablishing it, it is clearly useful to account clearly for the reality that has formed in its stead. The heirs of the union's former so-called Central TV and Radio--the Russian federal TV-radio companies--have reoriented themselves wholly toward Russia, and only Russia. Even if some of the content in the broadcasts were especially calculated for our neighbors and they felt like seeing or hearing something, neither side would have the money to make that happen. According to world practice, it is the receiving country that pays for the technical provision and the right to transmit broadcasts from another state. Here we have it the other way around. The director for international communications of the VGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company], Sergey Yerofeyev, informed the RIA [Russian Information Agency] that, except for Belarus, Turkmenistan, and a few other countries of the CIS, which undertook the expense themselves (and only for the transmission), the other states of the near abroad have informed the company that they cannot pay to disseminate Russian TV and radio programs. Nor are the Russian TV and radio companies themselves in a position to do this any longer; they don't have the money to run them to their own country. The picture with the periodic press is analogous. Let us turn our attention to this, however. The above-mentioned announcement by VGTRK's director for international communications stresses that the company is still trying to pay for transmission beyond the borders of Russia, since it is concerned about the interests of the 20 million Russians in the near abroad, for whom television and radio are the "sole channel for direct and vital contact with Russia," and since "it would be a tragedy if the last connecting thread were to break off." This is so, undoubtedly, and the appropriate efforts must be redoubled, although in no instance can one count merely on the enthusiasm of the television companies, which without the support of the president and the government are simply powerless to do anything. I still wonder, though: Why does the director for international communications, while worrying about his fellow countrymen abroad, not even mention the 9 million other fellow countrymen of his who are living in Russia but are linked by blood to her neighbors? Why does he say nothing about that every twelfth Russian who in the correspondence page indicated that he was a Ukrainian, or a Turkmen, or an Armenian, or a Moldovan, or an Estonian. . . . Least of all do I wish to reproach S. Yerofeyev personally. This is just the old habit of thinking about information connections as primarily one-sided. Inside the Soviet empire, Russia (or more precisely, Moscow) was the center, sending out "necessary" information to an entire one-sixth of the world, but hardly ever receiving it. The "back connection" scarcely enjoyed equal rights. Now the "situation" has changed, but the psychology has not. To some frankly, but to the majority subconsciously, the "single information space" means the Russian space, which just creates additional grounds to reproach us for imperial ambitions. In Moscow it is much easier to buy a newspaper from the United States or Japan, or pick up a broadcast from London or Paris, than to read, watch, or hear information from Kiev or Tallinn, Tbilisi or Bishkek. Usually you can still pick up radio from the nearer capitals, but the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asia are virtually inaccessible to radio listeners, and there's not even a dream of TV broadcasts from them. Is something being undertaken to change the situation? The Mir TV-radio company has been created. It was conceived as CIS-wide, but its technical and creative possibilities do not allow it to proceed, understandably, in any way comparable with the former union Central TV and Radio. For the most part it broadcasts "from Russia with love"; analogous broadcasting into Russia is nil. Last December, at a meeting in Ashkhabad between CIS heads of state, a decision was passed to create a weekly entitled "The CIS: A Common Market." This February, representatives of the Commonwealth countries' economic departments signed founding documents on the publication of this newspaper. They were supposed to club together to finance and distribute it in all the shareholder states. Everything seemed decided. But there still isn't a "single common CIS publication"! As was reported at RF [Russian Federation] Roskompechat [Russian Committee for the Press], it isn't even registered, inasmuch as Roskompechat has temporarily halted registration. An unimportant but eloquent detail: once again, everything is being decided (or not decided) in Moscow. What does the situation look like "from the other side," from the countries of the near abroad? How do immigrants from there who are living in Russia learn about events going on there? Vadim Dolganov, press-attache, Ukrainian Embassy, Moscow: Two newspapers are published in Russia for Ukrainians. The Association of Ukrainians in Moscow and Russia puts out UKRAINSKIY VYBOR, and the Slavutich society puts out UKRAINSKIY KURYER. The former comes out more or less regularly, something you cannot say about the latter, unfortunately. There are many problems with their publication, which are extremely difficult to resolve, primarily due to a shortage of money. For this reason, the Promin radio station has ceased to broadcast to Russia. I want to emphasize that it is merely a matter of money, and any attempts to drag politics in here have no foundation whatsoever. Information links must be restored as quickly as possible because there are so many misunderstandings on these grounds, and as a result the mass media, instead of aiding mutual understanding, often hinder it. Our ambassador, Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy, recently met with the editors-in-chief of the Russian newspapers. All of them supported his proposal that within the CIS, at the level of prime minister, an agreement is necessary on mutual obligations to facilitate the exchange of information in every way possible. So far that information is often not objective. We frequently write about one another the way we used to write about America: Oh, they're lynching Negroes there, and in Chicago it's nothing but gangsters. It was reported, for example, that in Sevastopol all the schools were switching to Ukrainian. But that's not true! The press is supposed to reduce, not compress the tension. The Intersputnik system is not being utilized now. Broadcasts to Ukraine could go over that, and from there at least to the regions of Russia where Ukrainians live in large numbers--Tyumen, the Far East, Moscow, and St. Petersburg. Anatoliy Goreglyad, press-attache, Embassy of the Republic of Belarus: As far as I know, there are still no newspapers or magazines in the Belarusian language in Russia. The Batkovshchina society came out as the initiator for such a publication, and it is registered with Roskompechat, but it has not yet started to come out. Even we in the embassy get newspapers from Minsk with great difficulty, and only through Internal Affairs Ministry channels. The picture is the same with Russian newspapers in Belarus. These problems cannot be solved until the issue of Belarus's entry into the ruble zone is decided. Regina Minaylova, cultural advisor, Embassy of the Republic of Belarus: Belarusians come to the embassy asking to read our ZVEZDA or our NARODNAYA GAZETA. The Batkovshchina Society is organizing a subscription in Minsk for Muscovite Belarusians, but the shipping is terribly expensive. There is no retransmission of broadcasts from Belarusian radio in Russia (nor is there of the radio of the other former union republics--Ed.), and it can be very hard to pick up Minsk. As far as I know, soon after the election of Mecheslav Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council of Belarus, President Yeltsin suggested to him that the single cultural space be revived within the CIS and a corresponding agreement and committee be set up to deal with issues of culture, science, education, and information. This is absolutely essential! David Demetrashvili, press-attache, Georgian Embassy: It's hard to say how many Georgians there are in Russia now. After all, a large number of refugees have been added! In Moscow and St. Petersburg, GRUZIYA: SOBYTIYA, LYUDI in Russian, is being distributed. Two issues have come out. There is nothing in Georgian. After all, though, Russians need to know the truth about Georgia, too! In their reports on Georgia, unfortunately, the Russian media often commit blunders. Nikolay Martyanov, head of the Foreign Economic Activity Department, Roskompechat: The assistance program for ethnic Russians in the near abroad provides for duty-free shipment of publications for them, duty-free supply of printing equipment, and paper for printing newspapers, magazines, and books in Russian there. The same needs to be done to help put out publications intended for representatives of other ethnic groups residing in Russia. This could be done on a reciprocal basis. Lavrentiy Mikhaylov, head, International Cooperation Administration, Roskompechat: The restoration of contacts and the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral agreements on information exchange inside the CIS and with other countries of the former USSR is a matter of great importance for Roskompechat. At the suggestion of the Belarusian side (we had wanted to make the same one, but they beat us to it), a meeting is planned for representatives of the press and of the appropriate government departments of the countries of the CIS to discuss the exchange of publications and mutual assistance and cooperation in the sphere of the press and information. The meeting is proposed for May. * * * Unfortunately, we were unable to find anything out about similar plans in the area of TV and radio, since on the Russian side there is simply no one working on that as yet. The Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service, which was formed by presidential edict, has yet to be created as a practically functioning organ. Let us sum up. Everyone we were able to talk with is in favor of a single information space. The Russia's economic situation, however, and especially that of its poorer neighbors, allows no hope that in the near future we will even be able to approach the scale this space enjoyed formerly. Efforts at the state level are scattered and weak and do not go much beyond good intentions. For all intents and purposes, there is no information market across the former Union. The absence of a full-blooded, healthy exchange of information is becoming a major reason behind many conflicts and tensions. Russians abroad may still be at least partially informed about affairs in their homeland, but non-Russians in Russia are virtually not at all about events at home. The circulations of the two Ukrainian and one Georgian newspapers mentioned do not cover even a hundredth of their potential readers, and there is no information at all about publications for representatives of other nationalities in Russia. And finally. A request not to reproach the author for the weakness of the constructive part. Many suggestions could be made, and some have already been heard in conversations. Everyone speaks with enthusiasm on "what is to be done." But nothing is done. The main thing is that all gazes are once again turned toward Russia, whereas the Russians themselves, while treating outside initiative quite jealously, are manifesting their own initiative meagerly. As well as one-sidedly, concerning themselves only about Russians abroad. As David Demetrashvili correctly noted, the idea of creating a network of information media for non-Russians in Russia is topical and very necessary. If, I might add, the game goes through the same gates as before, the creation of a new information space, where all "players" are on an equal footing, will not even be able to get started.
