The Palazzo Chigi [government seat] was unusually bereft of official cars and bodyguards, so I thought with irritation that the prime minister was out. But instead, there he was, right on time, in his double-breasted suit with a spotted necktie and a big smile. That was enough to win me over to the new incumbent. On one occasion, at the time of the barons of the First Republic, Paolo Cirino Pomicino, recently arrived at the Agriculture Ministry, made me wait for an hour and then proceeded to explain to me that power is measured by how long you can succeed in keeping someone waiting. Bodyguards and security staff, with their red and white symbols of authority, have been reduced to a minimum. "This is the first thing I did when I reached here," Berlusconi said, somewhat embarrassed. "You should have seen the state I found this place in. You may not believe it, but among the tapestries and stucco work they had amassed reproduction antique furniture -- lamps, chairs, and tables made in Brianza. Apart from the lack of taste and discrimination, there was a complete neglect of even the external dignity and decorum of this institution." After another, inevitable, smile, this former businessman from Brianza explained: "The lack of identity of a political class is apparent even in small things. For instance, if the prime minister wants to invite a prominent figure to lunch, he has to ask the other ministries to provide hospitality. And to think that the staff and officials scattered in the various offices total 5,200 people -- 5,000 more than under De Gasperi. You know what the cross section of a tree looks like when it has been felled and you can see its age from the growth rings? It is like that in these offices: Imagine cutting a section through them, and you will see the stratification of the apparatus accumulated from government to government. [no end quote as published] [Bianco] I know that your name is synonymous with efficiency, Prime Minister, but there were moments in Parliament when your face betrayed your irritation with parliamentary ceremony.... [Berlusconi] There is only one thing that usually irritates me -- theatricality, rhetoric, pomp. But this applies both inside and outside Parliament. I am concerned with the things that need to be done. The moment I arrived at the Palazzo Chigi I decided to announce that the prime minister's salary would go to charity. Then I changed my mind, because of my horror of rhetoric. You can imagine: People would have said right away that a sacrifice of 6 million lire a month for Berlusconi was no sacrifice at all. [Bianco] In your first parliamentary victories in a difficult Senate situation, did you succeed mainly because of your courage to gamble everything, or were the opposition forces left confused by the force of attraction exerted by the first prime minister, enjoying strong popular support, to believe himself invincible? [Berlusconi] I have realized something: In Parliament there are no victories and defeats in pitched battles; there is a dialogue, a debate on the basis of different roles, and a majority decision that it often takes too long to reach and that is often reached by means of confused mechanisms. The confidence debate was an excellent example. Those who wanted to turn it into a propaganda event failed; it was ideas, programs, and -- if I may be permitted to say so -- the attitude of the government which prevailed. And not only the effect of the people's support. [Bianco] Would you rather gain a victory or an overwhelming victory? [Berlusconi] Good manners are for me the most important rule. But political observers find it difficult to appreciate their importance. You saw what an impact my shaking hands with Giorgio Napolitano in Parliament had. But that was merely a necessary gesture; I tried to explain that it was neither a propaganda gesture nor an attempt to secure a benevolent attitude. While other left-wing oppositionists were yielding to demagoguery and personal attacks, Mr. Napolitano was able to be both tough and correct. [Bianco] Nevertheless, that handshake did almost more to create difficulties for the opposition than the adherence to the spoils system has.... [Berlusconi] I am not trying to cause difficulties for the opposition. That was the favorite pursuit of the parties of the First Republic, which used parliament to build a new balance every day by dint of successive declarations.... [Bianco] What is your strategy, Prime Minister? [Berlusconi] It is to govern. That is all. Then the voters will decide. This is the essence of rotation in a first-past-the-post system. [Bianco] A few days at the Palazzo Chigi have caused the coercive Berlusconi to disappear in favor of the Doroteo-style [reference to former Christian Democratic Party (DC) faction] Berlusconi.... [Berlusconi] I do not feel like either. If I had to describe my experiment I would say: the happy mean, a liberal and moderate government. I am learning that there is no politics without patient negotiation, but if negotiations exhaust and enfeeble politics, then that means trouble. [Bianco] Are the opposition forces right to demand at least a few chairmanships of parliamentary committees as a means of exercising institutional monitoring? [Berlusconi] The issue of the parliamentary committees must not be exaggerated. The basic principle is that Parliament exercises legislative and monitoring functions, and can accept, amend, or reject the government's political orientation. This is the task of the whole of Parliament, both majority and minority. Parliament is an instrument of the people for exercising their sovereignty, not a weapon of the opposition forces for obstructing the government's activity. This role is not determined by the chairmanship of a committee. We have been clear with the minority -- limited political accords in an atmosphere of institutional courtesy and calm coexistence amid our differences, but no associational joint management of parliamentary activity. [Bianco] You have learned to sound like a manual of parliamentary procedure, Prime Minister. [Berlusconi] I like precision and I do not like to talk about things about which I know nothing. [Bianco] Are the relations that you seek with the PPI [Italian Popular Party] solely for opportunistic reasons, in order to increase your majority in the Senate? [Berlusconi] On the contrary. The PPI is a political area that attracts a moderate Catholic vote, which is also part of our own coalition. We and they are close, whether or not that party's leaders like the fact. I am not trying to undermine anyone's position, and I do not want their party to disintegrate. I am seeking a serious dialogue with the PPI; I reject the attitudes of preconceived hostility of the old DC Right. [Bianco] Samuelson says that even though you won such an overwhelming vote in the elections you "cannot do anything." Are you afraid of becoming the umpteenth representative of Italy's "nongovernment?" [Berlusconi] I preferred Kissinger's assessment: The government must concentrate on specifics and implement its program proceeding from its economic part; and the disputes over questions of principle, the ill-intentioned and vengeful climate imposed by the losers -- all this will disappear faster than is believed. [Bianco] Even Clinton, a Democrat, made the same recommendation, thus disappointing progressives in this country. [Berlusconi] I too was surprised. I expected vaguer and more diplomatic remarks, with a more remote reference to our problems and recent history. Instead President Clinton said what he had to say, with a friendly and pragmatic attitude that is typical of the best of his country's culture and, I would say, of the "American spirit." I am sure that, leaving aside justifiable anxieties stemming from the innovations, our allies will display impeccable respect for our independence of judgment and support for the new Italy that emerged from the 27 March elections. [Bianco] Yesterday a less optimistic governor of the Bank of Italy warned you not to lower your guard on the public spending front. [Berlusconi] That was a strange point to make, since reducing and selecting public expenditure and lowering tax pressure have always been at the center of my program. [Bianco] What would you do if another Crotone [location of major industrial dispute] were to occur? [Berlusconi] I would seek a responsible and realistic solution, as [former Prime Minister] Ciampi tried to do. But I would try to ensure that its entire burden did not fall on the shoulders of the community as a whole or on the general interest in a recovery of the economy and of employment. Jobs must be protected by creating new ones and by stimulating development, not by placing constraints on state industries. [Bianco] Is your decision influenced by the spreading propatronage attitude in the Catholic component of the majority or the AN's [National Alliance] "social" policy? At Crotone the MSI [Italian Social Movement] demonstrated together with the Left. [Berlusconi] The suggestion that the AN is a neostatist party is one of the many myths constructed on the basis of empty talk. As far as I know, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, Fini and Tatarella [AN] share the government's approach to deregulation in the economic field. [Bianco] Some 20 years ago La Malfa senior complained that it was impossible to dream of Scandinavian-style social services in an economy such as ours that produced one-third of the per capita income of those countries. Is this still so? [Berlusconi] Scandinavian-style social services are perhaps not within our reach even now, but we can permit ourselves something better than we have now. [Bianco] The entire political class, both Right and Left, who have left the scene, was convinced that these services should be administered by the state, and that the difference lay solely in the quality of management. Now that you are in Rome, are you too starting to think this way, or are you convinced that social services administered by the state are in themselves a source of waste? [Berlusconi] The state owns essential services that it cannot relinquish. But who says it must administer them bureaucratically instead of on the basis of the criteria of efficiency that prevail in the private sector? The Constitution states that the republic guarantees certain social rights such as work, health, and education -- not inefficiency and neglect of the citizens' needs. [Bianco] Now that the ministers have been changed, is it necessary to change the ministries and their respective bureaucracies? [Berlusconi] I have found the public administration to be full of expert and responsible people. Certain procedures and old habits are an obstacle, but many members of the so-called bureaucracy were only waiting for a new wind in order to get rid of them. [Bianco] What advice would you give to Fini? [Berlusconi] The AN leader has a great opportunity to legitimize, definitely and unequivocally, a governmental Right capable of a positive attitude and a civilized and reassuring language, leaving the dross and the nostalgia to their proper fate. The country is ready for this, and Fini is too astute a politician to be unaware of it. All the rest -- the dispute over the remark that I in fact never made in my interview with THE WASHINGTON POST -- seems to me artificial. [Bianco] Do your ministers not have a slightly guilty conscience, as in the case of [Interior] Minister Maroni, who demanded the head of the Vicenza police chief after the Nazi skinhead rally? [Berlusconi] Maroni is a good minister and has not set a foot wrong so far. The opposition forces are full of praise for him because they hope to be able to set him against his government colleagues. These are childish tricks. Maroni seems to me a solid person free of vanity. [Bianco] What would you like to say to [Northern League Secretary] Bossi that you have not already told him? [Berlusconi] To proceed courageously along his chosen path. To move on, with the League, from a phase of protest to a phase of government and real reform of this country. In the short term excesses seem to yield more, but in the long term a rigorous attitude and a sense of state are what pay. [Bianco] Bossi says that [former League ideologue] Miglio, since their split, has been working for Berlusconism. [Berlusconi] I respect Mr. Miglio, but I do not engage in underhanded tactics. Ultimately, leaving aside the bad feeling, convergence on a possible form of federalism will prevail over all the misunderstandings. [Bianco] With regard to bad feeling, there has been some even in Forza Italia. What would you prefer it to be like -- a business party, a new mass party, an American-style mega-electoral committee with no apparatus? [Berlusconi] A movement of public opinion, a solid but flexible organization that does not crystallize into a party, that does not become rigid; an electoral cartel that can return to its presence within society between one election and the next, maintaining constant contact with the deputy and senator for the constituency concerned, with the entire institutional system, and with the citizens, organized through the clubs. Forza Italia has, and must maintain, its own soul and identity; but we do not need too forceful an ego, we do not need a party that will copy the policy of the parliamentary groups and that of the government. I said this in Parliament. We must move on from government by the parties to government by the institutions. [Bianco] Would you have dinner with Cacciari and Occhetto [Democratic Party of the Left]? [Berlusconi] I consider the mayor of Venice someone who can reason calmly. Perhaps I could talk with him about the usefulness to the country of an opposition that has a very clear objective. Not to obstruct the incumbent government's path but to plan an alternative government. Perhaps we would agree on many things, perhaps even on the menu. [Bianco] The Scalfaro issue: At the start of the Second Republic is it still possible for the president to be someone who took part in the constitution of the First Republic? [Berlusconi] Why not? Renewal is never entirely confined to individuals. [Bianco] Have you been won over by the grand old men? [Berlusconi] This republic's grand old men still have something to teach us. For instance, Francesco Cossiga's Senate speech was very fine -- committed, a real challenge. [Bianco] The whole of Italy knows Berlusconi's dream, but are you sure that you can achieve it? [Berlusconi] It is within everyone's reach -- to work hard and to pursue a straight path, without fear and with humility.
