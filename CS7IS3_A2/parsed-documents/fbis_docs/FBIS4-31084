Even our most bitter enemies in the world and the fiercest opponents of the Serbian national interests do not question Yugoslavia's integrity and the Albanian alternative should be aware that this issue is not negotiable, Percevic told the radio of Jagodina, town in central Serbia. A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades been active in Kosovo. The separatists have illegally proclaimed the `Kosovo Republic' and advocate its secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation with neighbouring Albania. Underscoring that the offer for a dialogue has remained open for some time, but that the ethnic Albanian parties are rejecting it, Percevic said that in the end they will have to accept it because they are also becoming aware that `their aim -- an independent Republic of Kosovo -- cannot be realized.' British minister of state at the Foreign Office, Douglas Hogg, who was recently in Kosovo, also told the ethnic Albanians, national minority in Serbia and Yugoslavia, that they cannot count on their own state. We had political contacts with some political parties from Albania but not with ethnic Albanian parties in Serbia which rally most members of this minority, simply because they refuse a dialogue with the legal Serbian and Yugoslav authorities, Percevic said. Commenting persecution claims by ethnic Albanians, Percevic said that the `representatives of the Albanian minority are intentionally boycotting the rights they have been granted by this country's consititution with the aim of convincing the world to the contrary.'
