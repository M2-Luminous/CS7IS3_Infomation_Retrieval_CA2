As stated in a "senryu" [Japanese traditional satirical poem] composed by a member of the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] have suffered from chronic shortages of ammunition. Although ammunition factories are fully capable of production, half of these factories are not in operation. Chugoku Kayaku Corporation [CKC] is engaged in filling cartridge cases with gunpowder (the main office is in Kure, Hiroshima Prefecture). There are eight assembly plants in Yoshii, Gunma Prefecture, but only half of them are operating every day. Four years ago, when the number of contracts received from the Defense Agency [DA] reached its peak, CKC extended its road to construct new factories along it. However, at the moment no new factories are found, and only weeds grow near the road. There are more than 10 ammunition manufacturers in Japan, but only two companies are engaged in filling cartridge cases with gunpowder. CKC exclusively handles large ammunition, such as artillery shells and guided missiles; 87 percent of its sales rely on contracts received from the DA. Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the growth of the DA budget for purchases of ammunition leveled off in line with the sluggish rise in the defense budget. In the draft 1994 budget, the defense budget decreased compared to that of the previous year. Due to the increase in expensive ammunition such as guided missiles, the budget for artillery shells was reduced, while the number of cartridge cases to be filled with gunpowder also decreased. The amount of orders received by CKC fell to two-thirds of that during the peak. Tomihiro Umeyama, head of CKC's Tokyo branch office, said frankly: "Further sluggishness in the size of orders could result in a severe situation, such as deteriorated quality and a drain of technicians." On the other hand, an official from the DA Equipment Bureau [DAEB] said: "It is impossible to increase the defense budget for the sake of one private company." However, at the same time he added: "From the viewpoint of national security, the bankruptcy of an ammunition manufacturer could cause problems." It is common sense in the international community that ammunition should be produced domestically because, in case of emergency, there is a possibility imports will be suspended. A DA officer merely reiterated the routine remark: "The company should make increased efforts." More than 1,300 manufacturers do business with the DA; this number is even larger if subcontracting companies are included. Reduction in the defense budget is a direct issue of life and death for the defense industry. However, the DAEB is helpless because "the development of the industry is beyond our responsibility." Some officials even retort aggressively: "If they are really faced with difficulties, they will raise unit prices. If they do so, we will simply have to buy more expensive products." The essence of the problem is believed to lie in Japan's defense philosophy itself. When the "National Defense Program Outline" was formulated in 1976, the DA stipulated that in an emergency the SDF should be able to fight for one month, and thus began storing ammunition. However, total stores of ammunition, including reserves at the end of 1992, are 127,000 tons, far short of the goal of a one-month stock. On the other hand, the DA did not hesitate to purchase the most advanced equipment for frontline defense, including the F-15 fighter, Aegis ships with superior air defense capability, and airborne warning and control systems (AWACS). A colonel with the Ground Staff Office offers self-criticism, saying: "If there is insufficient ammunition, the latest equipment will be nothing but paper-mache. The absence of objections to distorted procurement programs proves the DA has become insensitive under the prolonged peace." Disarmament brings out the reality of an "army" incapable of fighting.
