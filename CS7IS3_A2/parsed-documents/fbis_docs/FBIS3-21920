However, skepticism claiming that crime cannot be defeated is not advisable either." [passage omitted] He indicated that the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] will maintain a single response for gaining society's confidence: working with resolve and integrity. By doing so, it will eventually succeed in addressing the demand for a reduction in crime. He remarked that the efforts to combat the drug traffic, and to punish "money laundering," would be intensified "as an international commitment for Mexico." In the border zones, the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) and customs' agents will devote more effort to detecting smuggled firearms. They will go to great lengths to combat impunity, and will continue to oversee the conduct of PJF members and PGR employees. Moreover, those dismissed for committing crimes will not be reinstated. [passage omitted] As for the battle against the drug traffic, he claimed that the statistics prove the country's effort in this regard, adding that, in response to Mexico's recommendation that the demand for drugs be attacked as well, the United States Government has announced changes in its strategy for eradicating drug consumption. [passage omitted] Finally, he announced that the investigations of the assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo have made great progress: 35 persons have been arrested and brought to trial, and there are 13 arrest warrants to be executed.
