Infuriated, he telephoned the municipal government to ask about this and learned that many grain shops in Beijing had had no rice to sell for almost a month. In the free market, individual peddlers are selling rice at a price of 2.4 yuan per kg, 50 percent higher than the government limited price. This is hardly unacceptable to southerners, who are used to eating rice as a staple but not other grains. Some experts said that this situation in the Beijing grain market is the result of contention between different interest groups which use rice as a pawn. At the end of last year, grain prices began to soar in some southern Chinese provinces, and this astounded the high-level CPC leadership. The State Council immediately took measures to control grain prices to prevent overall inflation. Price inspection teams were sent out one after another, and many cities introduced grain price limits. Some officials optimistically estimated that grain prices could be controlled. Several months have passed and these measures which were effective under the planned economic structure--a structure which was backed by state monopoly over the purchase and marketing of grain--have been mercilessly restricted by the market mechanism. In this "contention for rice," the government and consumers are on one side whereas grain selling departments, officials in grain producing regions, and peasants are on the other. An assistant in a grain department said that the government had set the rice price at 1.6 yuan per kg, but now the purchase cost of rice is 1.7 yuan per kg, so the more rice it purchased, the heavier losses it is suffering. The government's attitude is very clear: Grain shops may stop selling rice but may not sell rice at a high price. So grain shops stopped selling rice. Similarly, in some grain producing provinces, the government and grain growers are cornering the grain market to wait for an upward adjustment in grain purchase prices which will be introduced soon. Thus grain purchasing personnel sent out by Beijing Municipality have found doors slammed in their face. The good old days when of all parts of the country supported Beijing at all costs under the planned economic structure has ended once and for all. Reports say that to control rice prices, the government will use the grain reserve fund to purchase rice from grain producing regions at high prices and then sell it at low prices. The relevant government department is worried that this sum of money will not be recovered after being spent. How long will the government be able to play this "game?" The present situation reminds us of the "combat" against inflation carried out by the old and new regimes in Shanghai 40-odd years ago. In 1948, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was then in charge of economic control, introduced monetary system reform in Shanghai; to curb inflation, he adopted measures to limit prices and even resorted to the use of economic policemen for the enforcement of the measures. But Shanghai industrialists and businessmen declared that there were no commodities. The confrontation between these administrative measures and the market mechanism resulted in Chiang Ching-kuo's failure. Years later the newly born CPC regime encountered a situation similar to the one Chiang Ching-kuo had met. Under Chen Yun's plan, the new regime skillfully injected the liberated areas' cotton and coal reserves into the market to control prices. As a result, the tactic of cornering the market failed and businessmen who wanted to become wealthy by "honest and dishonest means" suffered heavy losses. Subsequently the CPC won a key battle in curbing nationwide inflation. Forty-odd years have passed, and the "contention for rice" in Beijing reminds us that administrative measures which were effective under the single planning structure in the past are no longer "panaceas." Introducing market mechanisms and administrative measures simultaneously and establishing a new price control system to curb inflation are difficult problems for a government in an economic transformation period. We will soon know the outcome of the ongoing "contention for rice" in Beijing. Reports say that after a special meeting is held, the municipal government's relevant department will allocate a fund and send rice purchasing teams. Then millions of kilograms of reserve rice will be injected into the market.
