This was only natural: Their desire to restore the Cossacks' use of land and the hetmens' self-rule as well as the formation of a Cossack unit in the army had to find support in the appropriate legal acts. Plans for the future included the creation of a professionally trained group of Cossack deputies who would defend the Cossacks' interests under the complicated political and ethnic situation emerging in Cossack regions, mostly in the Kuban, Terek, and North Kazakhstan. The board of the Cossack Union, which was the first mass Cossack organization created in the USSR, set its stake on the USSR Supreme Soviet and put immense effort into its work with deputies from the Cossack regions. These attempts were not successful, however. Kuban was represented in the Supreme Soviet by the ill-famed Ivan Polozkov; other Cossack regions were represented by just as incongruous local party leaders. The Cossack Union could not "delight" the Cossacks with any single act that would have anything to do with them, not even an act on their rehabilitation. Hardly any more success was achieved in the highest legislative organs by another public Cossack organization, the newly restored Union of Russian Cossack Troops, which had been eliminated by the Bolsheviks. Unlike the Cossack Union, it managed to establish contacts with the Russian parliament. It used a new approach in coordinating its activities with the leaders of those political parties and deputy associations whose policy in one field or another corresponded with Cossack interests. An attempt to set up a group of Cossack deputies who would work to restore the Cossack status met with no success. The lack of any significant results shown by the Cossack Union and the Union of Russian Cossack Troops in their work in the highest legislative organs of both the former USSR and the Russian Federation caused a certain disappointment in them among the Cossacks, who shifted their attention to the regional power structures. The 70-year-old pronouncement of Don hetman Kaledin that "The healing of Russia should start with the outlying areas" has been spread widely; whether it is appropriate or not, people keep quoting a statement by Novosiltsev, a contemporary member of the Union of Cossack Troops: "Given the current situation, it is impossible to form any state power in Russia. Power should be established in the provinces, in the oblasts, and from there it should spread to the center and then settle." Most of the Cossack leaders came to the latest elections with this idea of creating a strong local power which would become the Cossacks' ally. As a result, the votes of many millions of Cossacks supported a large variety of parties and election blocs, from Russia's Choice to the communists. The support of the Cossack voters was quite considerable and some of the Cossack hetmen have joined regional representative bodies (some of them were even elected to the Russian State Duma). This allowed the local Cossack organizations to resolve some critical issues, mostly legal or economic in nature. However, the emergence of these "Duma Cossacks" did not do anything for the Cossack community of Russia as a whole. They were elected from various "non-Cossack" parties and blocs and, being promoted by one or another structure that financed their election, these deputies, instead of working for the Cossacks, had to "pay back" by working for those who had financed their successful election campaigns and ensured them victory over the other candidates. Three months have passed since the State Duma started work, but nothing has been uttered from its podium yet about the situation of the Cossacks on the Terek or in North Kazakhstan, or about the threat of ethic and social explosions in the Kuban and Don. Nothing was said either about any mechanism allowing implementation of presidential edicts on Cossack self-administration and use of land, or about correlating these edicts with legislation on Cossacks' federal service. In order to change the situation, the Cossacks may act as an independent force at elections to all-Russian representative bodies and produce their own socioeconomic program. One must also remember that the Cossack movement is well organized and its participants are socially active and disciplined (the percentage of voting Cossacks is much higher usually than the same figure for other sections of the population). But the weakness of the Cossack movement lies in its lack of unity, in the absence of accord among its leaders. The hetmen of various Cossack units and unions cannot come to a mutual understanding, are unable to design a mutually acceptable pre-election program. Therefore, the total number of Cossacks proclaims only its potential possibilities, but not its realistic strength. One of the strong points of the Cossack movement is the fact that it is scattered over the entire territory of Russia and represents all social strata of our society. The Cossacks enjoy more popularity with people from other locations in non-Cossack areas. The reason for this lies on the surface: Other residents of Cossack regions are concerned about violations of their rights and therefore observe the Cossack movement with apprehension; but residents of "non-Cossack" territories do not have the same emotions and view the idea of restoring the Cossack status with more objectivity. Thus, the three Cossack propagandists from the Cossack association in Moscow managed to collect more signatures in Novgorod Oblast for support of Don hetman Kaledin than the Cossacks of the Kuban and Orenburg areas taken together. The result of propaganda may be a lot more effective in other areas, for instance, the north of Russia and the subpolar region, which have large numbers of descendants of the repressed Cossacks. During the election campaign the Cossacks may move outside their traditional regions and transform the entire territory of Russia into their field of action. But in order to achieve any success in the pre-election struggle, the ultimate goal set for the Cossack movement should be other than a fight for privileges. Only in this case can the Cossacks realistically count on the support of the Cossack population. The Cossack movement does not have any well-known leaders on the all-Russia scale. It should rely on the provisions of its program but not on the popularity of certain "leaders" who bore us on TV. It should prove that a strong Cossack movement is needed for the purpose of reviving all Russia and establishing its army.
