FR941110-0-00292 FR941110-0-00018 On the island of Hawaii, Sesbania tomentosa is known from two regions of the southeast coast and two areas along the northwestern coast. On the southeastern coast it occurs along 16 km (10 mi) of coastline between Ka Lae and Kaalela. This cluster of populations on State-owned land contains an estimated 260 individuals growing between sea level and 25 m (80 ft) elevation, with some populations occurring in `Ilima Coastal Dry Shrubland (HHP 1992j7, 1992j9, 1992j44, 1992j45, 1992j50; HPCC 1991j, 1991k; W. Char, in litt., 1993). The second cluster is in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and consists of scattered populations within a 19 by 8 km (12 by 5 mi) area from above Kukalauula Pali to Kahue, at elevations between 10 and 850 m (30 and 2,800 ft). This cluster of populations on federally owned land contains at least 50 individuals (HHP 1992j4, 1992j8, 1992j40, 1992j41, 1992j46, 1992j47; H. Huntzinger, in litt., 1993). On the northwestern coast, a single plant occurs at 30 m (100 ft) elevation on private land at Kaupulehua (W. Char, in litt., 1993). The other northwest coast population is also on private land at Waiakailio, and consists of eight plants with several seedlings at 300 m (1000 ft) elevation (W. Char, in litt., 1993). The total currently known populations of Sesbania tomentosa on the 8 main Hawaiian islands (Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii) contain an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 individuals. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the largest population occurs on Nihoa and consists of several thousand individuals (HHP 1992j35). Sesbania tomentosa is found on sandy beaches, dunes, soil pockets on lava, and along pond margins (Geesink et al. 1990). It commonly occurs in coastal dry shrublands and grasslands, but is also known from open 'ohi'a forests and Mixed Coastal Dry Cliffs (HHP 1992j2, 1992j4, 1992j5, 1992j7, 1992j14, 1992j27, 1992j28, 1992j35, 1992j49). Associated plant species include 'ilima, naupaka kahakai, Heteropogon contortus (pili), Myoporum sandwicense (naio), and Sporobolus virginicus ('aki'aki) (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2, 1992j7, 1992j8, 1992j12, 1992j13, 1992j25, 1992j28, 1992j31, 1992j33, 1992j40, 1992j45, 1992j49, 1992j50). The primary threats to Sesbania tomentosa are habitat degradation caused by axis deer and cattle, competition with various alien plant species, fire, and destruction by off-road vehicles. A specimen collected by David Nelson in 1779 from the island of Hawaii was described and named Solanum incompletum (thorny popolo) by Dunal (1852). In 1888, Hillebrand described two varieties of the species: var. glabratum and var. mauiense. In 1969, Harold St. John described the species S. haleakalaense based on a specimen collected by Hillebrand on the south slope of Haleakala on Maui (St. John 1969). In the latest treatment, S. haleakalaense was synonymized with S. incompletum and no subspecific taxa of S. incompletum were recognized (Symon 1990). Solanum incompletum, a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), is a woody shrub up to 3 m (10 ft) tall. Its stems and lower leaf surfaces are covered with prominent reddish prickles about 4 mm (0.2 in) long or sometimes with yellow fuzzy hairs on young plant parts and lower leaf surfaces. The oval to elliptic leaves, 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) long and about 7 cm (2.8 in) wide, have prominent veins on the lower surface, and are on stalks up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long. The leaf margins are lobed with one to four lobes on each side. Numerous flowers grow in loose branching clusters with each flower on a stalk about 9 mm (0.4 in) long. The calyx and flowers generally lack prickles. The white petals form a star-shaped corolla about 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter. The curved anthers, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, top short filaments that do not extend beyond the petals. Fruits are round berries about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter that mature from yellow-orange to black. This species differs from others in the genus by being generally prickly and having loosely clustered white flowers, curved anthers about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, and berries 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) in diameter (Symon 1990).
