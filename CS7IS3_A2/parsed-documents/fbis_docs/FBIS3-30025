NODONG SINMUN today views this as another sign that the puppet clique's war moves to slay the fellow countrymen in the North, teaming up with outside forces, have been carried into extremes. The analyst says: At a time when the United States was working full blast to deploy Patriot missiles at U.S. bases in South Korea as part of its attempt to overpower the Democratic People's Republic of Korea militarily, the puppets decided to introduce the missiles. This is an anti- national act which can be done only by warmaniacs who are balking at a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and trying to unleash a war against the North of the same nation. Though the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is attempting to frighten the North with something like Patriots, it is an inept act. Even if the United States and the South Korean puppets bring into South Korea anything more terrible than Patriots, our people and People's Army will never be frightened. The warmaniacs would be well advised to act with discretion.
