They discussed the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, the Washington agreement and UN Security Council resolutions. Gen. Bobetko stressed that he had informed his guest about the fact that Croatia has fulfilled all its tasks, and that there can no longer be any pretexts for the other side not to comply with the agreement. He mentioned that one such problem is the fact that the Serb side had not withdrawn from one part of the battlefield north of Zemunik, from where the airport in Zemunik can be targeted. Another concrete problem is that a Jasenovac-bound road remained closed today and therefore a Croatian delegation was unable to lay a wreath at the monument there. Gen. Bobetko stressed that Gen. de Lapresle had promised him that UNPROFOR would insist with the Serb side that they resolve these problems. Gen. de Lapresle said that he is pleased with the course of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement in Croatia so far, adding that not all the provisions of the agreement have been implemented 100 percent, but that the newly created problems would be resolved by joint committees which had been established for that purpose. He empahized his pleasure at the cooperation with the Croat authorities, saying that he and Gen. Bobetko shared the wish that the cease-fire agreement should be implemented, which is a precondition for the second step in the normalization of Croatian-Serb relations -- the resolution of economic problems. The UNPROFOR commander will chair a meeting of a central joint committee in Turanj near Karlovac tomorrow, at which the implementation to date of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement will be examined.
