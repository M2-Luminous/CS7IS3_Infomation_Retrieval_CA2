Solutions to the most contentious problem -- the Russian export of nuclear-cycle goods -- were finally found during the meeting. Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "if the political will is present," the agreement may now be initialed by the end of Greece's chairmanship in the EC (it expires at the end of June). For the time being experts will have to "weigh the balance of interests set forth in the agreement" yet another time -- there will be no more high-level talks. A solution on the export of nuclear-cycle goods, including uranium -- an apple of discord in the talks -- was reached thanks to mutual concessions. Initially, the EC was not inclined at all to accept Russia's proposal on including this subject in the draft agreement on partnership. During the Moscow meeting a compromise was reached. According to Mr. Shokhin, the two sides decided that, first, a special agreement on trade in nuclear-cycle goods be worked out; and, second, that this matter be presently included in Article 20 of the draft agreement on partnership, citing, however, an existing agreement from 1989 with the EC. Among other things, the agreement calls for preliminary consultations to be held before quantitative limitations are imposed; the competence of Euratom to be recognized when solving trade issues; and a pledge by the sides "to take into account the situation on the market" (export volumes were not specified). In order to clarify their stances, the sides agreed to exchange corresponding letters. The results of the Moscow meeting and talks on the partnership agreement in general must be considered by the EC Council 16 May. Mr. Shokhin pointed out that "there is hope" that this matter will be finally resolved because both side show their interest in it; he added, however, that now everything depends on "political will," otherwise the process may be delayed. As a matter of fact, the European parliament passed a resolution the other day that links the conclusion of the agreement to the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, even though it is only recommendatory in nature (then again, the parliament itself is bracing for an election). The Moscow talks focused not only on the partnership accord. Mr. Shokhin and Sir Leon also signed a memorandum on setting up a working group to look into the possibilities of attracting foreign investment in Russia. According to Oleg Preksin, Russian member of the EBRD board of directors, who also joined the group, it will have to present the results of its work (a report) to the European Commission by 28 June. One of the key projects of the Russian side will be the creation of the Multilateral Agency to Guarantee Investment in Russia (MAGIR). That is to say, a multilateral fund involving both Russia and Western countries is to be set up abroad to insure investment against noncommercial risks (details of the project have yet to be clarified). This matter may be considered at the G-7's summer summit in Naples.
