The resolution adopted recently by the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council, which envisages that these higher territorial self-administrative units will evolve from the current districts, also seems to be rather unviable. What next? [Klaus] The government has not rejected the proposal for 13 higher territorial units. It has had six alternative proposals in succession and, in essence, is not ruling out any of them. We will discuss this issue again on 29 June as the first point on the agenda regardless of what else is on it. This is a complicated matter, and it is a great shame that parliament has "put a lid on it" from above by setting a deadline [for its submission] before the end of June. There is thus a risk that we will choose a solution that we will perhaps regret in the long run. The basic proposition involves parceling out this country, a unitary state, into a certain number of regions. This is, in essence, an irreversible intrusion into the state body of the Czech Republic. This is such a fundamental change that whoever trivializes it and accuses the government of hesitancy, whoever accuses this or that side of not wanting to resolve the issue, is doing this country a disservice. As a responsible person, I have to say that there is one fair conclusion: There is no obvious consensus in this country on this issue, not only in the government, but also throughout society. The issue involves whether, in such a situation, it would not be better to postpone the matter until this has been settled. It would be the greatest shame if, by coincidence, only one reason for creating these regions were to transpire among the coalition partners or the other political forces in parliament--that it would aggravate the ODS. That would be a terribly feeble reason, and, unfortunately, I have the feeling that, when all is said and done, this is the dominant reason at the moment. The rhetoric of this or that politician is different, however. [Kriz] Some politicians are casting doubts on your foreign policy orientation toward the West... [Klaus] This seems really extraordinarily amusing to me. These opinions are being expressed by some Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] representatives who seek out every preposterous pretext so they can attack the ODS and me. The West has a completely different impression of our stances than the ODA Central Office. [Kriz] You have described the 3.5-percent rise in the gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year as a "breakthrough." There have been a total of 13 quarters since the beginning of transformation, however. Of these together, growth was achieved in five of them, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Growth of 3.8 percent was even achieved in the second quarter of last year. Growth was recorded in two successive quarters in the second half of 1992. So, this is nothing new. Therefore, did you use too strong an expression this time? [Klaus] We envisaged then that the development in the second half of 1992 was the start of the growth tendencies. These were interrupted by the breakup of Czechoslovakia. This prevented 1993 from becoming the first year with plus signs. I think that the first quarter of 1994 is the beginning, a year later, of what was indicated in the second half of 1992. I admit that this trend need not be confirmed in the second quarter of this year, but there is undoubtedly a general growth tendency here.
