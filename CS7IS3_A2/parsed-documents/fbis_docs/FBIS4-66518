In a joint press conference held by Clinton and Rabin at the conclusion of their talks, the President referred to the issue of Russia's return to the Middle East and noted, "We will be able to evaluate her intentions in the coming days and weeks by her behavior." What that remark means is that the American Government as well as the Government of Israel is concerned by signs of active involvement on the part of Russia in the peace process, a factor that has thus far not been taken into consideration. Last Friday the Security Council voted to pass a resolution condemning what happened in Hebron on 25 February. The draft resolution also contains a mention of Jerusalem as a part of "the occupied territories," as was forcefully demanded by the PLO. The United States conducted tireless negotiations over the last three weeks with Yasir 'Arafat aimed at linking the passage of this resolution with a PLO promise to resume negotiations with Israel. Despite Yasir 'Arafat's refusal to bow to American pleas on the issue of linkage between the UN resolution and the resumption of the talks--and his contemptuous behavior toward the American delegation headed by Dennis Ross, who came to Tunis--the Americans agreed to bring the resolution up for Security Council passage on Friday, in its original draft. It turns out that one of the main reasons for the American agreement stems from Russian pressure not to further delay the passage of the resolution. The Russians even threatened that they would act on the matter with or without U.S. agreement, and they would not care if the United States were to "veto" the resolution. From the Russian point of view, such a "veto" would be helpful in their attempts to persuade the Arabs, and especially the PLO, that they are returning to the Middle East arena with the same mission that they performed in the past as the principal supporter of the Arabs in the Arab-Israeli conflict. U.S. Persuasion At the end of the week, senior U.S. sources confirmed that they had made a supreme effort to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from contacts and negotiations with the Russians on the issue of the "peace process" without prior coordination with the United States. This was after it was made clear to the Americans that the surprise visit of the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Jerusalem and Tunis and the invitation of Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat to visit Moscow in the month of April were not simply a "diplomatic gesture," but augured a Russian political turnaround from her position over the last five years during which she dealt mainly with her own internal affairs and was only a figurehead on the issue of the peace process. As usual, Yasir 'Arafat felt that this was another golden opportunity for him to demand a "price" from the Americans for his agreement to delay his cementing of closer ties with the Russians. He accomplished that first and foremost with his demand that the Security Council pass its resolution of condemnation without obliging him to simultaneously announce the resumption of talks with Israel. The fact that the United States was forced to agree to this demand by 'Arafat clearly reflects the renewal of the Russian presence in the Middle East--a presence that, from here on out, will demand different table rules from those that have prevailed thus far, while the United States has been the dominant factor in the Middle East since the convening of the Madrid conference at the end of 1991. This Sunday Russia gave another sign of her new policy. When delegations from Israel and the United States rushed to Tunis to try to persuade Yasir 'Arafat to return to the negotiating table, Russia announced that she was sending her representative Victor Pozobulkov, the director of the Middle East department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, to act as a counterbalance to Dennis Ross, the senior American emissary. From the American and Israeli reactions, it seems that this change in Russian policy has caught both the United States and Israel off guard. In some sense it might be said that their reactions to the change proved that they were not only caught off guard but that they have been left in a real funk. The fact is that 80 members of the U.S. Senate appealed late last week to President Clinton to "veto" the Security Council resolution should it contain the paragraph calling Jerusalem a part of the occupied territories. All of the Jewish organizations in the United States, led by AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee], the Israeli lobby organization in Washington, were also urgently called to Washington to clearly and firmly express their demand that the United States "veto" the Security Council resolution. Steve Grossman, the president of AIPAC, met last week for this purpose with President Clinton and let him know that U.S. Jewry would consider passage of a resolution mentioning Jerusalem as "occupied territory" to be a very serious matter. Despite the appeals of Senate and House members and the Jewish organizations, the U.S. representative at the Security Council voted for the resolution while abstaining from two of its paragraphs, the paragraph mentioning Jerusalem as occupied territory and the paragraph implying that the Security Council recognizes Palestinian sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. The instruction by the White House to its representative on the Security Council to vote as she did is more indicative of confusion in this case than careful forethought. The Invitation to Moscow When Yitzhaq Rabin, during his visit last week to Washington, was asked about his reaction to his invitation and 'Arafat's to visit Moscow in the month of April, he answered that he really did not expect it from the Russians, but he accepted the invitation. On the matter of the U.N. Security Council resolution, the prime minister stated that the inclusion of Jerusalem as occupied territory is something Israel rejects, "but if it is a matter of one item in the entire process, then it is not so bad." Rabin thought that the Americans would insist that their vote for the resolution would be conditioned on PLO agreement to renew the talks and on implementation of the "Gaza and Jericho First" plan. In fact it turned out that the Russian pressure caused the U.S. President to change the stand he had announced to the Israeli prime minister 48 hours earlier. And the United States allowed the resolution to pass without "vetoing" it, as she had threatened to do for three weeks. When Shim'on Peres initiated his secret talks in Oslo a year ago, containing his "big plan of deception" centered on an agreement to "the declaration of principles" with the PLO, he based it on the global state of affairs. In that view of things, the world had undergone far-reaching changes over the last few years. The Soviet Union had disappeared and the Russia that had taken her place was not and would not be a superpower. He also pointed out that the Berlin Wall had fallen, that the people of Eastern Europe had been liberated from the Communist yoke, and that from now on hegemony in the world would be exclusively American. Since--according to this view of things on the part of the Israeli prime minister--the period of conflicts in the world was over and peace would soon prevail, Israel had to hurry to join in the "new world order" by signing peace treaties with the PLO and with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon at any price. Shim'on Peres even loudly and publicly mocked the positions of the Likud and his partner in the national unity government, Yitzhaq Shamir, who he felt had closed their eyes to the changes that had occurred in the global political order and were stubbornly clinging to their position that Israel must not agree to any accommodation that would deviate from the Camp David accords, and certainly not conduct negotiations with the PLO terrorist organization. Now the turnaround in the Russian position comes as a slap in the face to the Israeli prime minister, proving his "vision" faulty and demonstrating the entire structure he built to be a house of cards about to collapse. The Changes in Russian Policy The Russians did not announce the change in their foreign policy indirectly or in a roundabout way. They did it in the most direct and public fashion. Over the last two weeks the Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has distributed to the world's newspapers lots of articles, in which he outlines the new Russian foreign policy. There is no doubt that Kozyrev is not doing this on his own initiative, but with the authorization and encouragement of the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. In articles published in THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON TIMES last week, he sets down Russia's new foreign policy principles. At the center of the Russian Government's plan is the principle that Russia will no longer concede exclusive American hegemony in the world. The Russians say that they were and remain a "superpower" just as they were before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and accordingly the Americans and the rest of the world have to deal with Russia. Still, there is a substantive change in the new Russian policy as opposed to that of the "Cold War" period, and it is the Russian willingness to establish "cooperation" between the two superpowers, the United States and Russia. Such cooperation requires the Americans not to make unilateral decisions on issues and in areas in which the Russians have their own interests. Andrey Kozyrev even lays out the strategic goals of the new Russian policy and refers specifically to the present peace process when he says, "In the Middle East, our efforts will be focused on our continuing role as partners with the United States in the peace process and in realizing the aspirations of the Palestinian people. We will strive for extensive economic cooperation with the Arab states with the aim of attracting their financial resources for Russian economic development in its modern era and for strengthening the Russian position in world trade, including weapons trade." The wording of this paragraph of the Russian plan shows that their strategic decision is to return full force to the Middle East. Furthermore, they stress their desire to return to active involvement in the Middle East in all areas, so that the possibility of the Russians returning to their function as Arab "patron" is very real. If this Russian plan is, in fact, implemented, there is no doubt that it will have many implications for what is termed the "peace process." If the Israeli Government indeed sees itself responsible for the future and security of the State of Israel, it must quickly come to grips with this turnaround in Russian policy in the Middle East and change its strategy and tactics to meet the new challenges that she is thereby faced with. The government's running amok after the PLO and its desire to hand over control of Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip as fast as possible to the terrorist organization only shows that the government of the left still has not come to understand the change that is taking place in the international order in the Middle East as a result of Russia's return to the region.
