If tariffs are raised, Latvia will not receive, over the next two years, approximately $250 million worth of foreign credits. In addition, the granting of a G- 24 credit would be canceled. A $90 million credit earmarked by the IMF would be tied up, and two credit lines at the World Bank would be suspended -- a $50 million credit for agriculture, and $35 million earmarked for the development of the Latvian Universal Credit Bank. [passage omitted] Summarizing the possibilities, an increase in customs tariffs would mean a complete change in Latvian economic policy, stated Osis. Consequently, a move toward protectionism would take place and any decent competition would be destroyed by supporting ineffective production. The finance minister accused the Latvian delegation to the talks with the European Union, concerning a free trade agreement, of presenting -- during the course of negotiations -- new, higher customs tariffs instead of the present effective ones, and deemed it an illegal and wrongful action. "These tariffs have not been accepted, either by the government or by the parliament's Budget and Finance Committee, therefore the delegation had no right to propose such tariffs," stated Osis. The Latvian Finance Ministry, however, does not at all intend to utterly resign from import customs duties, emphasized Osis. The following compromise is being considered -- for approximately six agricultural products, tariffs would be raised by 50-70 percent over the present amount. The types of products would be determined on the bases of the Latvian agricultural development program, which has not yet been worked out. After choosing these five or six products, which will be decided to be beneficial for Latvia, their production will be supported by establishing respectively high customs tariffs.
