Good morning from our Press Hour program, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our guest today is Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, and he will be interviewed by my colleagues Conrad Seidl of DER STANDARD and Herbert Lackner of PROFIL and by me. Mr. Minister, with just a few hours before the Sarajevo ultimatum expires, the first question that naturally arises is what does the situation around Sarajevo -- the situation of the Western alliance, but also that of the United Nations -- look like from the Austrian viewpoint? [Fasslabend] There is no doubt that the NATO ultimatum addressed to the Bosnian Serbs constitutes some kind of turning point in the international policy toward Yugoslavia. We can note today that part of the heavy weapons and guns have been withdrawn. It is impossible to say right now whether all the weapons will indeed be withdrawn. In any case, one gets the impression that the ultimatum is meant seriously. This is also indicated by the meeting of NATO defense ministers this afternoon and by the convening of the UN Security Council for tomorrow. Things will essentially depend on whether for the first time the international community's determination will really be expressed here, which might make the warring parties give in and, in the long run, could lead to an end to the fighting. [Mayer] Then we would have a solution for Sarajevo, but not for the many other Bosnian towns, which will be all the more embattled in the future. Their names also have been in the headlines for the past two years. Thus, attention is shifting to Sarajevo and to the solution there and away from the other places, where the fighting continues unabated. [Fasslabend] This is certainly correct and, in my view, this is particularly important because a large part of the fighting did not take place in and around Sarajevo, but rather all over Bosnia. Even now, the main area of fighting is in Bihac in northwestern Bosnia, and it has certainly been a rather skillful policy of the Serbs to divert attention by one or another maneuvers to the capital city and, on the other hand, to conquer territory in other Bosnian regions, which has led to the fact that a large part of the goals of this war -- that is, a large part of the territorial gain, which is to lead to the establishment of Greater Serbia -- indeed has been achieved. In my view, it is necessary to make it clear that the basic principle must hold true -- namely that an aggressor, someone who is trying to achieve political goals by military means, must not be successful. I think this is exemplary for Europe's entire future policy. The point is not just to prevent as much suffering as possible in Bosnia in the future, but the point certainly also is that an aggressor must not be politically successful with military means, because this would have unpredictable consequences for all of Europe and the entire world. This would also have consequences for Austria. As a neighboring country, we are certainly affected to a certain extent by this specific security policy and, thus, also by all other political decisions, such as joining the European Union [EU]. [Seidl] This conflict, however, also has shown that a small country -- even if it is diplomatically recognized and if all people say how terrible all this is -- has had to stand up to an aggressor for about two years before, it is said: If this and that does not happen, then perhaps the international community may intervene militarily. As the Austrian defense minister, one would have to draw conclusions from that and say: Our country would also have to wait about two years until someone comes and helps us. Could Austria stand up to an aggressor for two years? [Fasslabend] This is certainly a very good question you have asked. There is no doubt it is one of the essential insights gained from the Bosnian conflict, the Yugoslav conflict, that one has to assume that, at least during the initial stage, one only its own defense capacity, only the security one is willing to provide for itself. Of course, this is not the only thing. We can proceed from the premise that, due to the new situation as well as the measures we have taken, for the first time in our history, we can expect to be able to fulfill a large part of our tasks on our own in the future. In addition, however, there are no doubt still many fields in which it is important that something is done at the international level. Our joining the European Union will be the most important step for Austria's security since the conclusion of the State Treaty in 1955. By far this will be the most important security policy measure, and one which will have a decisive influence on Austria's position for coming years and decades. [Seidl] Will things then work more quickly? Will we be helped more quickly if we are ever threatened? [Fasslabend] One must certainly assume that different yardsticks are used for an EU member state than for a country that just stands on its own. Therefore, joining the European Union, belonging to this community, is certainly of enormous importance. However, things go beyond that. EU membership today not only entails a lower probability of being attacked and a quicker reaction by other states, but from the outset a reduced probability of a conflict that might affect our country. This means that we would have more possibilities to influence the preventive settlement of crises and conflicts in our surroundings and we could, thus, certainly make a certain contribution to the stability of our entire surroundings. [passage omitted] [Mayer] What do the analyses and information that you have obtained tell you about what the Serbian side is expected to do if a military strike is carried out [after the expiration of the ultimatum]? [Fasslabend] One has to distinguish between the military part and what is going on beyond that. [Mayer] I mean the entire security sphere. [Fasslabend] In military terms, the case would be that NATO forces would be united from various cities in Italy, would be combined somewhere over the Adriatic Sea, would refuel, and then, accompanied by an escort, would fly to Sarajevo, establish an air shield there -- that is, ensure their own safety -- and then, using exact maps, try to hit the heavy artillery. [Mayer] Well, what I asked you about are the Serbian reactions. [Fasslabend] In this case, one cannot expect any major military reactions by the Serbs because the weapons they have there would be relatively insufficient. On the other hand, there have been threats of reactions beyond that, and one certainly has to take these threats seriously. It is certainly not so easy to say what these threats refer to, but, basically, they probably refer to terrorist activities. [Mayer] What kind of precautions are being taken? [Fasslabend] Basically, Austria is actually not a country that would be affected directly. Planes are not taking off from our territory; we are not an aggressor, and we are not a direct neighboring country. On the other hand, however, in addition to Italy, we are the nearest Western country and, therefore, one can certainly not rule out anything. One can only prepare very consistently for this situation and for all potential incidents by watching all events with utmost attention and by taking appropriate measures, which has been done. [Mayer] Even though no planes are taking off from Austria, our territory is regularly and often flown over by planes that are preparing for this military operation. Obviously, there are quite a few flights that we always permit. [Fasslabend] This is correct, but this has been the case for many years. This means there is no special situation now as a result of the UN decision. We constantly have supply flights for the UN troops in Yugoslavia cross Austrian territory and also trains running through Austria. However, this is also partly in the Serbs' interest. Therefore, I would not say this is being used as a reason to act against us. [Lackner] I know this is a sensitive issue, but I would like to come back to colleague Mayer's penultimate question: Do your intelligence services have any information about potential terrorist activities in Austria? After all, Austria has been very exposed in political terms in the Bosnian issue. [Fasslabend] As I said before, since we are not a neighboring country and have not carried out any aggressive acts and are not involved now, we can assume the center of such potential activities would not move toward Austria. Instead, one has to assume the Serbian side would probably try to bring about a turnabout in public opinion in those countries that have soldiers stationed in Serbia, in Yugoslavia -- that is, to make them stop their activities. This means one has to assume such activities would primarily be directed against countries that have sent troops. Second, one would have to think that activities might also go beyond these countries. [Lackner] yesterday Russian President Yeltsin warned against bombing and said this might have terrible consequences. Do you believe a new East-West conflict might develop in Bosnia? [Fasslabend] I do not believe a new East-West conflict might develop along the lines of the old one because the conditions have changed completely. [Lackner] Perhaps along the lines of the very old one. [Fasslabend] However, what one has to see without any doubt is that the longer this war lasts, the more different the positions of the big powers become, which, sooner or later, might lead to discrepancies between individual states and, in the end, to the shattering of the cohesion, which means an enormous opportunity for Europe and which was very much in evidence two or three years ago and is still possible -- just think of the fact that the Russians are in the NATO Cooperation Council and participate in the deliberations there. The same goes for the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Czechs, and the Hungarians. This is doubtlessly something that must be included in one's calculations in this connection. Therefore, I think the quicker this problem is solved, the quicker the international community comes to an agreement, the smaller the possibility will be that Europe might be in disagreement again. After all, one has to see one thing -- if military aggression were to be successful in Yugoslavia, if this becomes a political method, one can almost make bets on when the next military aggressor will turn up. At the same time, this also leads to a loss of the Islamic world's trust in the Western community of states because they get the feeling that the West's determination is not so great if a conflict does not involve oil fields but only people who belong to a non-European religion. I think this would be very, very dangerous. After the end of the East-West conflict and after the collapse of the Eastern system of power, we have had a unique opportunity for the first time all over the world, namely that all states orient themselves toward the Western values, toward democracy, human rights, the relevance of international law. It would be fatal if this opportunity were missed, if one were to get the feeling that these are only instruments to implement the Western policy of power and are not really values actually enforced by the people and the democracies in the West if they need to be protected. [Mayer] Why is the security aspect, which we have discussed and which is really important for Austria, hidden with embarrassment in the government's arguments for EU membership or is pushed into the background? The Austrians' need for security does exist -- we know that and it has been confirmed by the polls. Would it not be possible to get broader agreement to the European Union by pointing to this important aspect? [Fasslabend] I do not know whether one could achieve a broader agreement with that argument, but I think the time has come to tell the people in Austria how important EU membership would be for the country's security. I can only repeat what I said a few minutes ago: For Austria's security, our joining the Europan Union is the most important step since the conclusion of the State Treaty. This is the basis. We can assume membership would not only entail a far higher degree of military stability, would not only ensure Austria's safety and freedom, but also would ensure lastingly all our opportunities and our ability to develop. Just as the State Treaty constituted the basis for the entire state for almost four decades, the EU treaty today is probably the basis for the next three or four decades -- in security policy and also for the economy and for overall politics. [Seidl] This also has a reverse side -- i.e., solidarity is not just a one-sided issue but means that we, too, have to show solidarity with others; we have to give up what we have understood so far to be neutrality, find a new understanding of neutrality, or give up neutrality completely. We must also expect that we will be called upon to show solidarity -- for instance, one sees tensions are rising between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and Greece -- that we will be called upon to stand up for Greece's security interests with Austrian soldiers, or what Greece considers to be its security interests. [Fasslabend] Basically, the position of neutrality certainly changed fundamentally after the end of the Cold War. It was a product of the Cold War -- as it is put so aptly -- and, therefore, it lost its function when the Cold War ended. Still, we need not throw it overboard. Austria will enter the European Union as a neutral country, if the people so wish. The precondition for that is a referendum. As soon as we are in the European Union and when future solidarity is involved, then one must say the following: The probability that Austria will have to stand up for others in some incident is extremely low. The entire area of West Europe is no longer facing any immediate threat, if one considers the fact that countries like the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, or France do not have any opponent in the neighborhood anymore, but they are only surrounded by friendly countries. This means we must ask ourselves whether the other countries would be willing to stand up for us if a crisis develops in our neighborhood, because we are the only European country that has four neighbors from the former Communist sphere and, therefore, we are affected to a particularly great extent by developments and potential crises in this area. In this case, it is certainly good to have friends and to have the opportunity to go to them as soon as a crisis starts and draw their attention to it, because we must also be clear about one thing: One must explain crises and factors of risk to those who make decisions in West Europe. These crises are noticed much later from a distance of 1,000 or 2,000 km. We saw this in Yugoslavia, where Austria was the first country that constantly pointed to this crisis, where it was certainly a disadvantage for us that we were not yet in the European Community. In the future, it will be all the more important to be in it and to be able to directly present issues that concern us. [passage omitted] [Mayer] The government agrees we have to join the European Union for a number of reasons, also for the security aspect. However, the government does not say anything about the form in which we want to participate in such a collective alliance. Obviously, it does not really agree among itself. For the time being, citing a number of arguments, we have refused using a number participate in Partnership for Peace. How does the defense minister envisage that? A few weeks ago you were at a NATO conference in Berlin in your official capacity. How do you envisage that? What would be the ideal form of cooperation for Austrian national defense? [Fasslabend] Well, I must make one thing clear: Austria has not only decided that it wants to participate in the EU, but the Austrian Government has also made it clear that, as soon as Austria becomes an EU member, it should also obtain observer status in the Western European Union [WEU]. From the security policy point of view, this is certainly a very big and important step, because in the WEU we will have the opportunity to present our analyses and ideas from the very start and to participate in all security policy aspects in Europe. This means that this step is already planned. The issue of the Partnership for Peace, which has been discussed all over Europe in the past weeks, is certainly also an interesting development, which, however, is primarily aimed at the East Europeans and the people in East and Central Europe and not so much at the neutral countries, like Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, and Austria, even though the latter are not excluded. One can already say that we certainly consider Partnership for Peace to be a very valuable instrument in shaping future security and peace in Europe, but we naturally see our priority in joining the European Union and Partnership for Peace is of secondary importance for us. What we are going to do -- to say this quite specifically -- is that in those fields where we have already started cooperation, such as in peacekeeping, disaster relief, international doctrines, etc., we will engage in large-scale cooperation.
