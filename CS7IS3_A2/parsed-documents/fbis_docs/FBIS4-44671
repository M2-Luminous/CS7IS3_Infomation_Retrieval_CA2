The initial timetable called for a launch decision in mid-1994. [But] the consortium's general director Henri-Paul Puel confirmed in late January that there would be a delay of at least six months for the project unveiled in June, 1991, in Bourget. Aerospatiale and Alenia will make no decision about the future of the ATR 82 program until the end of this year or early 1995. The go-ahead, says Henri-Paul Puel, depends on three things: a technical design for the aircraft, a launch customer, and a healthy and realistic basis for financing the venture. Technically, the design and engineering department has absorbed the lessons of two marketing campaigns. The ATR 82 started out with 76 seats, a number that rose to 78, and recently to 80. "There is a real demand in that niche," confirms the program head. "Two thousand stage 2 `jets' with fewer than 130 seats will have to be replaced toward the end of this decade. The majority of them operate over distances of less than 500 km. The shorter the distance, the poorer the seat occupancy rate. These aircraft--which are costly to run--usually fly at only 50 percent capacity." Hence the selection in Toulouse of an 80-seater "whose logical engine choice will be a turbo-powerplant." This does not mean, however, that the jet option (Allison AE3012, CF34-6, or ALF512) has been scrapped. The consortium has not abandoned the idea of manufacturing a common trunk that can accomodate either engine, "on a straight airfoil that we would have to alter and reinforce with new tail units." But the first ATR 82, which the consortium says will be ready to fly in 1995-96, will be turbopropelled. "About 70 percent of our customers favor a turboengine," says the consortium's industrial director Antoine Bouvier. Two turboprops were originally in competition: the former GMA 2100 (AE2100) and the PW300/305. Both are derated engines in the 4,500 hp category. "The Allison 2100 looks like a good candidate," says Henri-Paul Puel for now. But no final choice has been made. The consortium is paying particular attention to Lycoming's latest proposals involving the LP512 (derived from the LF507), and especially to General Electric's for the GLC38. Whatever the outcome, the engine selected will have to supply maximum takeoff power of 2,500 to 2,700 kW (3,600 hp), for a maximum weight calculated at 29,850 kg, a cruise speed of 335 kt (620 km/hr), and a maximum range. Henri-Paul Puel currently estimates it will cost $500 million to launch the ATR 82 program. "That is much too high, and will have to be pared down to an acceptable $400 million with the addition of new partners." The consortium CEO sees "the ATR 82 as a chance to clinch new alliances while broadening our organization." From that standpoint, launching the ATR 82 would be a decisive step in creating a new, regional aircraft industrial entity, a development that Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois openly favors. But with or without partners, the ATR 82 remains a priority objective whose accomplishment will depend on whether the consortium can be certain of finding "good launch airlines and at least 30 to 50 aircraft orders." The ATR 82 is another ace the Franco-Italian consortium can play to move toward a rationalization of the commuter market.
