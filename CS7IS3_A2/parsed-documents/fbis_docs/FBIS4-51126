Chernomyrdin's visit to China and hopes the visit will deepen bilateral relations, according to Chinese diplomats and trade officials in recent interviews with XINHUA. The Russian prime minister is scheduled to arrive here on May 26 for a four-day official visit at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng. "China attaches much importance to the first visit here by the Russian head of government," a Chinese Foreign Ministry official in charge of Russian affairs said, adding that the visit is expected to be a complete success. Noting the 4,000 km-long Sino-Russian border, the official said the maintenance of long-term, stable and good-neighborly ties of friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conducive to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. Sino-Russian relations in various fields have recorded rapid development since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, he said. Since Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit here in late 1992, the mutually beneficial cooperation in politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and other fields has developed in a "healthy and sustained" fashion, he said. The two countries have also maintained normal consultations and cooperation on major international issues, he said. This year, Sino-Russian relations are marked by the increase of high-level contacts between the two countries, he said. The high-level contacts, no doubt, play a positive role in propelling bilateral relations forward. During the forthcoming visit of the Russian prime minister, leaders of the two countries will exchange views on the enhancement of bilateral relations, especially of mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation. A number of documents for cooperation are expected to be signed, sources here said. An official of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said that since the two countries signed an economic and trade cooperation agreement at the beginning of 1992, bilateral trade ties have been developing rapidly. He said the bilateral trade figure was 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, which was higher than the highest one between China and the former Soviet Union, adding that the figure in 1993 was 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 31 percent. In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade cooperation were diversifying with the development of barter trade, cash trade, compensation trade, leasing and mutual investment, he said. The official noted that the two economies are highly mutually complementary and there is a broad prospect for bilateral economic and trade cooperation, as well as scientific and technological cooperation. In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such as large trade corporations, China will seize the opportunity to press for a gradual shift from the dominant barter trade to cash trade with involvement of all foreign trade means, he said. He said that China will continue to stress the role of border and regional economic and trade cooperation, strengthening administration over border trade and the standardization of commodities inspection, in a bid to facilitate the development of such cooperation and two-way investment. He expressed the hope that the two countries will make full use of land transport, along with more development of sea transport for developing bilateral trade.
