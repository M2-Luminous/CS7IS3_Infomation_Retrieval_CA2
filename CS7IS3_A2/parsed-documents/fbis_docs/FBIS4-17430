The trade union's leaders illustrated the reality of national catastrophe with some quite impressive figures. A family of four now needs 2,500 drams to buy bread, salt, sugar, kerosene, and soap. The minimum wage in Armenia is just 176 drams -- less than $1. Unemployment is rising rapidly in the republic as a result of the collapse of the economy, and mass emigration from Armenia is assuming the character of a national disaster. Just recently Armenia itself used to admit and accommodate Armenian expatriates from many countries. The last of them -- an Armenian from Iran -- returned home in November 1991. Since then the traffic has been one-way, out of Armenia. Various figures are cited, reflecting the process of emigration from the republic -- between 300,000 and 800,000 in the past year. It is not easy to keep a precise account of the numbers leaving because the majority of them retain their residence permits, thus confusing the sociologists' and statisticians' charts. However, for a republic with a population of just 3 million, the departure of even 300,000 people is too much. And whereas people closed their eyes to this fact until recently, it is now causing serious concern to the authorities who are worried by the easily predictable demographic and social consequences of the mass exodus. The first to feel those consequences are surely the military commissariats, which have received less than the expected number of draftees and older military reservists summoned to training camp. But even if the national army, which is in its formative stage, has somehow managed to cope with this task, you cannot say the same for the economic sphere. At the moment the majority of enterprises are in a state of enforced idleness. But soon, when the machinery starts working at last, there will simply be no one to operate it. Many plants in Armenia today are staffed primarily by people of preretirement age who are coming to the end of their working lives. The younger and more energetic people are going into commerce which, incidentally, could only benefit everyone if they were starting up business on their own land instead of far from their native land. It is not only entrepreneurs who are seeking their fortune in countries far and near but also construction workers, engineers, doctors, and teachers. These are mainly young or middle-aged people who in a certain sense constitute the hope and flower of the nation. You can find many of them today in the consular section of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan. They are trying to legalize their residence in Russia by obtaining Russian citizenship. The endless lines of people waiting to receive the relevant stamp in their passport have forced the consulate to temporarily stop accepting applications. Meanwhile the number of applicants for Russian citizenship continues to rise.... Armenian emigres prefer to settle in Moscow, Krasnodar, Stavropol, and Rostov. However, they are also seeking and finding shelter in other less promising regions in the belief that things cannot be worse than they are here. The number of people wanting to go to the United States, Europe, and countries in the Near and Middle East has increased considerably. Besides the language barrier there is another obstacle on the road to the outside world, and that is the obvious reluctance of those countries to give refuge to these unfortunates with no capital of their own. "In Armenia today there are 107,000 officially registered unemployed, 652,000 pensioners, 300,000 refugees, and around 100,000 invalids. Another 100,000 are living below the poverty line and need immediate help," Ashot Yesayan, Armenia's minister of labor and social security, explained. These difficult times for Armenia cannot go on indefinitely but the sooner all those who have been forced to leave their land return, the sooner they will end. For the moment, however, the windows in many homes in Yerevan remain dark even on those rare evenings when the electricity supply is switched on. There is simply no one to switch the lights on.
