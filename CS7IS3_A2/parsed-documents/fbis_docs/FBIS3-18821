"We have to learn to take care of the state -- and even to love it a little -- because if we lose track of society's progress as a whole, business will suffer too," said Professor Prodi, an economist who teaches at Bologna when not busy with public sector affairs, in a talk entitled "State and Market in a Changing Italy," held at the University of Bologna main lecture hall. "The modern state was born of the conviction there was a leading role to play in assuring citizens certain essential functions," said Prodi. "I would never attempt to dismantle that conception of the state because it would be like destroying our roots, it would encourage disintegration and we would be committing those errors that today, we see the United States trying to remedy," he said. "For years the international business community scoffed at us, they were convinced Italy would never carry out privatizations," said Prodi, who has just finished supervising the successful transfer to public company of one of Italy's largest commercial banks, Comit [Italian Commercial Bank], following quickly on the sale of Credito Italiano and IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property]. But privatization is a process that "cannot be interrupted, even after the elections, because people are lining up to buy the shares and the politicians can see that," he said. Privatization helps to restructure public finance "but above all it creates economic pluralism and thus supports political democracy," he continued, but "we have to make these companies grow, not create conglomerates with them." "If in the place of a public sector monopoly we go on to create a private sector monopoly, then I must say I preferred the public sector one," he added. In a lecture one listener said it sounded like "a speech by an aspiring prime minister," ("if that's what one is aiming, one is generally more cautious," shot back Prodi) the IRI chairman underlined that the long and sometimes torturous process of privatizing Italy's public sector industries and services did not imply the state would not continue to play a "fundamental" role in Italian affairs. Italy needs a public sector "with a light structure, but that remains responsive," because it is "unthinkable that the state be absent from its role in the life of the country," he said. While reducing tax pressure is a goal, said Prodi, it is not something than can happen in several months or several years. "The goal is not to avoid taxes, but to have an intelligent, light state," he said. Prodi also commented on the Italian television market, recalling an old professor of his and his lessons on anti-trust rules. "He used to say that the mass media was a chapter all by itself, and that the law had to be more stringent in relation to it. First, it was important to fix market quotas to make sure they weren't excessive, secondly, to pay particular attention to the interface between media ownership and general economic power overall," Prodi said.
