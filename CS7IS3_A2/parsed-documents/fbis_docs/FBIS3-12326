In its emergency meeting this evening at the Arab League headquarters, the council held the Israeli occupation authorities responsible for this crime and those committed by the Israeli settlers. The council called on the Israeli authorities to disarm the Israeli settlers. The Arab League Council decided to reaffirm its Resolution 5269, adopted in its extraordinary session on 11 and 12 January 1993, calling on the United Nations to find a suitable mechanism to implement the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention by detailing a UN force to provide protection for the Arab citizens in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. The council called on the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference-- the United States and Russia--in view of their special responsibility for ensuring the success of the peace process to undertake a principal role in providing the necessary protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. The council also called on the UN Security Council to send a UN committee to investigate this serious incident and adopt the necessary measures to enable the committee to carry out its mission. The council also called on the Security Council, particularly the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference, to immediately implement the council resolutions regarding Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories as illegal and an obstacle to comprehensive and just peace, particularly Resolution 465 of 1980, which called for the dismantling of the existing settlements and suspending any plans for the establishment of new settlements in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem. The Arab League Council decided to consider 15 Ramadan of every year a day to commemorate the martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to remind the international community of the inhuman Israeli actions. The council called on the Arab states to provide all forms of aid and support to the families of the Palestinian victims and martyrs. The council decided to ask the Arab League secretary general to continue his contacts with all the international bodies to ensure the implementation of this decision and urge them to adopt whatever is needed to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. The Arab League Council called on the cosponsors of the peace conference to work seriously to achieve peace by enabling the Palestinian people to secure their legitimate rights, including their right to self-determination, and establish their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
