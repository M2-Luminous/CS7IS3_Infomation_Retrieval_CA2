The material of this column will describe the various parties functioning in Azerbaijan and their leaders. Here you will learn about the republic's politicians and their views of the political situation. Today's guest is a colleague, editor of the newspaper ISTIGLAL, and a leader of the Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, you were a pioneer of the Azerbaijan Popular Front in 1989. But on the threshold of the January events you and a group of APF [Azerbaijani Popular Front] activists declared that you were withdrawing and forming a social democratic party. What were the main disagreements that brought about this split? [Alizade] Yes, I was the first to begin to gather people around myself and to campaign for the creation of a democratic organization for perestroyka, glasnost, and the defense of our Karabakh. I provided the name of the organization and its slogan, and I wrote the first version of its program, albeit very imperfect. It is not a question of an idle "I this and I that" here, I am still proud that at that time I yielded to a sincere summons of my heart and found within myself the resolve to make a break with the settled measured tenor of life of an armchair scholar and to throw myself into the thick of political struggle. People of Baku, professionals with pure intentions, gathered in the Provisional Action Center of the APF in 1988. Subsequently, following its association with the Varlyg organization in March 1989, the APF became soiled by party-mafia clan intrigues. My first shock occurred in the fall of 1989--people who had pioneered the Front and who had sworn fealty to the Motherland and the people broke. Since then the APF has become something alien to me. I protested against the troglodytic anticommunism, unbridled nationalism, and moral relativism of the "bey's" with plebeian mentality. On 7 January 1990 I quit the APF, but remained true to the ideas of democracy, human rights, liberty, and justice that had been embedded in the APF's precongress program. The program of the SDPA [Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan] is, in fact, the first version of the APF program. A two-sector economy, political pluralism, and pluralism of the forms of ownership, a return to national sources, and openness to world culture and experience--this is the essence of our program. The reason for the split may be expressed very concisely. Those who fiercely resisted implementation of the KGB's "20 January" plan and the rest, who subsequently became social democrats, who deliberately, and unquestioningly, led the people to slaughter [sentence as published]. The social democrats have never led and will never lead the people to the slaughter. [Fatullayev] The SDPA is one of the leading parties in our republic. There is no doubt that the party's assertive activity throughout all the previous political peripeteias has attracted the attention of the community of the republic. How do you, a leader of Azerbaijan's social democrats, evaluate your party's activity? [Alizade] I believe that the SDPA has performed an exceptionally important role in the enlightenment of the masses. Our party had and has now the courage to rise up against the opinion of the majority and to not only say but also shout the truths, by disregard for which leaders relying on the blind support of people they have deceived are leading people to disaster. I consider the party's main merit our consistent campaign for national reconciliation, which has now become the prevailing political idea. It is the SDPA that, by its realistic policy, has contributed to our people resisting xenophobia and not sliding, like the Armenian people, into the abyss of fascism. After all, the blind, total denial by one nation of another is fascism. We may speak boldly of an anti-Turkic fascism that has conquered in Armenia, but in Azerbaijan the people have not succumbed to the vain hankerings of various gray "animals" and have not fallen into the trap of anti-Armenian fascism. [Fatullayev] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties have stated repeatedly that Azerbaijani social democracy does not have a chance of winning party influence among the population of the republic any time soon since contemporary Azerbaijani society has not reached the corresponding stage of development. [Alizade] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties of Azerbaijan are distinguished by a utopian nature of their views bordering on caricature. These people, blindly carrying out the orders of their masters, are incapable of understanding the normalities of social development. They are unwilling to be reconciled with the idea of the exhausted nature of their function of destroyer of the totalitarian state. Their extreme approach is the wedge that dislodged the other, Bolshevik, wedge. The time for creation is nigh, and, as the experience of almost all the post-socialist countries testifies, social democrats are performing not at all the least role in this process. Of course, everything depends on the specific conditions, but the leaders of the SDPA see this normality and are working to ensure that the predictions of the false oracles not come to pass. The idea of the exclusiveness of the Azerbaijani people, to which normality does not extend, is a foolish idea, and I do not believe that it has a chance of being realized. The people long for social justice, and the social democrats will fight for it. [Fatullayev] In the opinion of many foreign politicians, present-day world social democracy has taken a step to the right, having thereby renounced some of its strategies to some extent. How do you evaluate such changes in the purposes and tasks of world social democracy? [Alizade] The political success of the European social democrats and the high standard of the peoples in Europe testify that this is the right course. As far as "fidelity to principles" is concerned, this is an invention of limited conformists. Social conditions in a particular era may engender "principles" that are very useful for the defense of the interests of the working people. But societies develop, and the new conditions could create a dilemma: either to remain loyal to the "principles" and lag behind life and become detached from the interests of those same working people or, on the other hand, to adjust the "principles" and continue to uphold the interests of those same working people. Of course, the processes of stratification in Western societies differ from ours, but on the path toward the social market economy Azerbaijan will inevitably pass through the stage of "national accord" for the sake of the efficiency of the transition from one system to another. This is why the SDPA has not a clear-cut "class-based" program but an orientation toward the accomplishment first and foremost of national goals. This is why the SDPA is not "struggling" against "capital" but struggling to ensure that national capital stand on its own two feet and begin to work. After all, without the "employer," there is no "wage worker." Under the conditions of total state ownership, on the other hand, struggling against the national state is meaningless. The SDPA is struggling against the corrupt and predatory state bureaucracy, for denationalization and privatization, and for government protection of the population. The tasks coincide, as you can see, with the goals proclaimed by the state. The entire problem is that the state proclaims goals and in practice does everything the other way about; we, on the other hand, are trying to ensure that state tasks be accomplished correctly. [Fatullayev] The press organ of the SDPA--the newspaper ISTIGLAL--of which you are the editor, is at the present time one of the most popular print publications among the republic press. What would you like ISTIGLAL to become in the future? [Alizade] I would like to see ISTIGLAL become a more diverse newspaper with information on world politics, culture, sport, the home, the environment, and such. Unfortunately, ISTIGLAL is currently the canvassing organ of the social democrats. No money, that's why. We are writhing in the grip of a financial crisis. [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, when will Azerbaijani democracy come to power? [Alizade] Answering this is very easy. The social democrats do not make coups. Consequently, we have to wait for the parliamentary elections. At these the social democrats should increase their representation. Then work in parliament. The people, primarily "people working for wages," small-time entrepreneurs, and people of the free professions, have to see for themselves that this small faction is consistently defending their rights. Serious success should be expected at the elections of the year 2000. This is my forecast. But in life anything can happen. It cannot be ruled out that crime bosses could physically eliminate party leaders. Or that the right and ultra-right leaders could plunge the people into such a morass of misfortunes that the country's very existence is in jeopardy. The SDPA will fight against such a development of events. The SDPA will fight for the realization of our optimistic forecast.
