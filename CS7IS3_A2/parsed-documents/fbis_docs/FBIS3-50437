Endara noted that he should not be questioned on whether or not the alliance will be broken because that issue concerns the political parties who are conducting the negotiations. Some media have reported that the government alliance between the Arnulfist Party and the Molirena was broken once they failed to reach an agreement regarding who was going to head the presidential ticket. Molirena wants to head the official presidential ticket, but the Arnulfist Party believes that Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the widow of former president Arnulfo Arias Madrid, should have this position. According to Endara, he took off his "politician's hat" on 8 November when he promised not to interfere in the electoral campaign, and "since then the only hat he wears is that of president of Panama." Meanwhile, Education Minister Marco Alarcon said that the possible rupture of the government alliance "is a situation that was perceived from the beginning given Molirena's intransigence." Alarcon believes that "it is disgraceful" for a country that the most powerful -- financially speaking -- groups try to impose candidacies, and the people must react against this intention. Alarcon added that "for moral reasons" Molirena should resign from the government in light of the fact that "they have the power and the money" and it is untrue that "the people will allow them to choose our next president."
