Commenting on the second round of these talks due to begin within the framework of the disarmament conference in Geneva on May 16, Grigoriy Karasin stressed that the treaty to be worked out was not only a means for the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime but also the important step towards the furtherance of strategic stability. The Russian side regards work on this treaty as a "priority direction in the activities of the disarmament conference in 1994", the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman told journalists. According to Grigoriy Karasin, at the forthcoming meeting Russia will seek to "intensify multilateral talks with the aim of preparing a treaty, possibly by the spring of 1995 which would considerably promote the success of the oncoming conference devoted to the prolongation of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty scheduled for this period".
