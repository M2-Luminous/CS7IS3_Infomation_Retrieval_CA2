To obtain a listing of clinicians and establish a new network would require additional time (years) and funds. 2. ASPN has established methods for routinely collecting and reporting data from its membership. The systems, staff, and other resources are in place, available to be used for this proposed project. Patient records are accessible to ASPN for follow-up and investigative purposes. 3. ASPN clinicians have participated in a replication of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey which allows for comparisons of ASPN practices with a national sample. 4. The majority of in-office laboratory testing takes place in a primary care setting. ASPN is the only national, primary care, practice-based research network operating in the United States at the present time. 5. Although other smaller primary care, practice-based research networks have been established in the United States, ASPN has the most diverse geographic distribution which enhances the generalizability of the data collected in this study. 6. The composition of the ASPN network members includes a significant number of rural practices, a feature not present in other practice-based research networks operating in the United States at the present time. 7. The ASPN network services approximately 350,000 active patients. As laboratory errors are considered to be statistically rare events, the large number of patients seen in the network greatly augments the power of the studies. 8. ASPN has an established reporting rate of 93&hyph;98 percent. This is markedly higher than what one would expect to be able to achieve outside of a practice-based research network. The high reporting rate is due to monitoring and follow-up protocols used by the research support staff with ASPN. The high reporting rate makes the data collection more efficient and complete. 9. The ASPN network contains a small number of practices in Canada. This small subset of the network can be used as an internal control to assess changes in the practice of laboratory medicine in the United States compared to Canada. 10. All ASPN network physicians are required to endorse and support the participation of their practices by recording and reporting accurate data about patients collaboratively with other ASPN practices. Accurate and current data are paramount in this project. 11. There is no other known provider which can provide this type of investigative project.
