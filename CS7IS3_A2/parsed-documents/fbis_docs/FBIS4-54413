The KSCM believes that after modification by the parliamentary budgetary committee, the draft amendment to the law on political parties, which is now being discussed in parliament, entirely ignores the results of the June 1992 elections. KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek said that the ruling right-wing parties, along with some opposition parties, wanted the amendment to weaken mainly the KSCM. "Those who support the amendment in its present form, will be well paid by right-wing parties for their accommodating move," Grebenicek added. Vojtech Filip, a KSCM expert on legislation, criticized the efforts to ban political parties from running any businesses, and described them as attempts to impair the "constitutional equality of all forms of property". Parties should be allowed to at least edit and publish, Filip said. He added he was convinced that the aim of the discussed amendment was mainly to restrict funding of the KSCM and weaken it in the forthcoming local and Senate elections. Grebenicek said that in the elections, the KSCM would be also paralyzed by a ban on editing activities, as it would cause it difficulties with the printing of advertisements during the pre-election campaign. In contrast to this, the right-wing parties would remain intact, as they "have a considerable majority of the media at their disposal, and their representatives have enough financial opportunities to publish any documents," Grebenicek said.
