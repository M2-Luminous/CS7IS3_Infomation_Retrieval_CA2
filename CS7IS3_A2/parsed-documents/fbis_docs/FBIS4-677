The process was meant to start on Wednesday morning but was delayed because of a dispute over the terms of reference for mediation. The dispute arose from the IFP's objection to a reference to the election date in the new terms of reference drawn up after the government joined the process as a full participant. The IFP has argued that agreement on constitutional issues would lead inevitably to negotiations on a new election date, a position rejected by both the government and the African National Congress. A spokesman for the international mediators said they had held discussions with the parties and were preparing to release a statement during the course of the morning. A draft agreement between the government, the African National Congress and the IFP was reached after talks in Pretoria involving representatives of the three parties. The agreement suggested a two- phase approach to mediation whose effect would be to separate the question of the election date from the terms of reference. The draft agreement was discussed with the mediators at a meeting late on Wednesday night. However, the draft was awaiting the final approaval of the IFP before the mediation began.
