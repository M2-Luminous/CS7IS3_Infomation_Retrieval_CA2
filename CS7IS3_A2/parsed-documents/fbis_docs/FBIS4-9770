On the front door, you can still see the marks left by other representatives of "law and order" who recently broke it down. In the past few years, this peaceful house in the Playa residential area in west Havana has been "visited" a total of nine times by the police with varying degrees of heavy-handedness. This is the home of Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz, a leading Cuban dissident and president of the Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation -- an unofficial body, of course, and one which has been a constant cause of concern for the political police since it was founded in 1987. The head of the household, who has spent more than eight of the last 12 years behind bars and who declares himself to be "in the opposition for 26 years," shows us a few of his personal photographs. In one, he stands smiling with the head of the Spanish Government, Felipe Gonzalez, while in another he is seen with Ted Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president and Democrat senator for Massachusetts. `Country Is Immense Concentration Camp' Twice "Elizardo" has been allowed to travel abroad. He explains: "Both times, the authorities wanted to make a good impression on the rest of the world. Then they stepped up the repression when I returned." "Elizardo" is a resolute opponent and the current authorities have made him pay dearly for it. What makes him different, however, is that he represents the social-democracy movement. He refuses to join the Miami expatriates who are pushing for a return to raw capitalism and the "good old days" of Batista, the dictator overthrown by Castro in 1959. He explains: "We want change for Cuba to come with a minimum loss of human life. What we are suggesting is gradual democratic reform, in the same way, for example, that Spain got rid of `Francoism' and Chile did away with `Pinochetism.'" He takes a dim view of the current situation in Cuba: "The country is an immense concentration camp. There are prisons everywhere." He even comes up with the figure, impossible to verify, of 100,000 prisoners, both "common law" and political detainees, out of a total of just over 10 million inhabitants. This would give Cuba the highest proportional rate of imprisonment in the world, with approximately one in 10 citizens in jail.... "Cuban society has become an Molotov cocktail. All the ingredients are there, after 35 years of totalitarianism. There is the accumulated hate of all those people who have been the victims of denunciation, and those people whose homes have been attacked, sometimes by their neighbors, during `disavowal actions' (demonstrations of hostility against opponents of the regime, supposedly spontaneous but in fact organized by the authorities). Nor should we forget that there are hundreds of thousands of veterans from the African wars who know full well how to fight. If the authorities hesitate and if weapons are available, it could turn into a blood bath. This is why we are proposing national reconciliation with a general amnesty, like in Chile or Central America. No one can be prosecuted by the authorities for their previous political activities. There are about 1 million members of the Communist Party in Cuba, and most of them are good people..." "Elizardo" is aware that this desire for "reconciliation" scarcely pleases -- to be euphemistic -- the anti-Castro groups in Miami. The last straw for someone who has spent so long in prison is to be accused of being an agent of the regime by expatriate organizations demanding a severe purging when Castro has been overthrown. In the peace and quiet of Florida or New Jersey, it is easy for the most extreme expatriates to forecast the imminent fall of the Communist system and to delight in imagining scenarios where, for example, the former owners of tobacco and cane sugar plantations will have their property returned to them and the hotels and tourist beaches will be put up for auction. `Romanian or Czech Model' For "Elizardo," it is clear that things will not happen that way. His prime concern is that a blood bath be avoided. Then again, who knows how long this system can continue, since it did not crumble, as people had often said it would, with the disappearance of the USSR and the "socialist camp." Fidel Castro may be 66 years old, but he enjoys excellent, even blooming health; he does not drink and he has given up smoking his legendary cigars. "Elizardo" concludes: "Sooner or later, change will come. The question is knowing whether it will follow the Romanian model or the Czech model." He would, of course, prefer a Cuban version of the "Velvet Revolution." The same analysis prevails with Western diplomats stationed in Havana. Even if most of them prefer not to openly frequent dissidents, they are fully aware of the position tirelessly defended by Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz and his friends. One of them said: "Castro has made considerable concessions by decriminalizing the possession of dollars by private individuals, but on the political front he has not budged an inch. We have to think about what will happen in the next few years if he remains this inflexible. He will either be gently retired by the more lucid members of the regime's `young guard,' or he will be brutally overthrown in a bloody uprising." This "young guard," which the dissidents admit exists, is made up of people in their forties who were practically born with the Revolution and whom Castro has promoted to key posts in recent years -- people like Carlos Lage, who controls the whole economic sector, or Roberto Robaina, formerly charged with youth policy and now foreign minister. They are the "fresh, young faces" whom the bearded patriarch has taken some pleasure in promoting over the heads of some of his former comrades in arms with long-standing experience. Obviously, they cannot, according to the very strict code governing the system, speak publicly about Castro's succession. They are thinking about it, however, and apparently have permission, in recent months, to voice a few of their thoughts to foreigners. This "young guard," therefore, is trying to relay the following message: The Americans must first lift the embargo. Castro himself would be ready to step down with dignity if he could be sure that everything he had accomplished would not collapse in a few hours. Institutional solutions can be found, but for the time being there is no question of talking to opponents like "Elizardo," especially since, in the eyes of the Socialist International, he would be the ideal choice to succeed the "Lider Maximo." The "young guard" is certainly ready to take over the reins, but its most brilliant members are well aware that, for years, the unenviable fate of the real or supposed successors to Castro has been disgrace, exile, or death.
