The U.S. President and his Russian counterpart held talks on such issues as bilateral relations, European security, and the nonproliferation of weapons of massive destruction and signed a series of documents. President Yeltsin and President Clinton spoke highly of this visit and issued the "Moscow Declaration" to proclaim the advent of the "new stage of mature strategic partnership" between Russia and the United States. The press maintained that Russia and the United States had settled some problems in bilateral relations and coordinated their positions in international affairs through this summit, but they "failed to open up a new era in bilateral relations." The timing of the Russo-American summit was not fortuitous. Over the past few years, the United States treated Russia as the major country for implementing "democratic values and a free economic system." The United States once again demonstrated its support for the "forces of democratic reform" when great changes occurred in Russia's domestic situation. Meanwhile, the United States fell short of its wishes in handling international affairs. It had to seek Russia's cooperation on the issues of establishing a new security structure in Europe and settling the problem of nuclear proliferation. On the other hand, Russia tried to work through this summit to strengthen its economic cooperation with the United States and to emphasize that power status was on an equal footing with the United States so as to "regain its external prestige." Russia's economic reform was still the key item on this summit's agenda. As indicated by the results of Russia's parliamentary elections last December, the Russian people had exhausted the limit of their tolerance for the pain caused by reform and the opposition in the new parliament would strongly criticize any radical reform policies implemented by the authorities. The question of whether Russia would drastically change its economic policy in the face of this pressure was a U.S. concern. During the talks, President Yeltsin guaranteed that Russia would not slow the pace of market economic reform. Meanwhile, he did not overtly ask for direct aid from the United States but rather urged the United States to open its market to Russia, abolish trade restrictions left over from the Cold War period, and engage in economic and trade cooperation on an equal footing. President Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. firm support for Russia's "democratic market changes" and the fulfillment of the promise of granting aid to Russia that was made during the Vancouver Summit and afterwards. The United States agreed to reduce tariffs on over 4,000 Russian commodities. In addition, the two countries also reached an agreement on a $12 billion purchase of Russian uranium fuel. In the future, Russia will orient its economic policy toward society to a greater extent and will try to utilize every means to alleviate the pain of reform. People have noticed that the United States showed its understanding and support for this practice and declared that it would help Russia in this area, without making any new promises. As a measure to "establish relations of mutual trust," the two presidents agreed that both sides would change the posture of targeting their strategic nuclear weapons on the other party by this May. The press considered that this decision signified the formal consent of the two nuclear powers to relax the state of alert which threatened to trigger off conflicts at any moment over the past few decades and that this decision was conducive to the further development of Russian-American relations. To a greater extent, however, this was regarded as a symbolic gesture. The most eye-catching scene during Clinton's visit to Moscow was Russo-American cooperation in settling the issue of Ukraine's nuclear weapons. Russia, the United States, and Ukraine signed a formal agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons in Ukraine within a scheduled period of time. The press here was quite cautious in responding to this, however, saying that the agreement would be strongly opposed by the Ukrainian parliament. Russia's IZVESTIYA pointed out: In view of the mood of the Ukrainian parliament, it is impossible, in any case, to think that this problem has been solved. Another focus of the Russo-American summit was the question of establishing a new security system in Europe. Under the present circumstances, good handling of relations with Russia has an important bearing on overall European security and stability. Because of this consideration, the NATO Summit -- which ended not long ago -- neither gave East European countries any guarantee of security nor worked out a clear timetable for these countries to join NATO. President Yeltsin expressed his support of NATO's "partnership for peace" plan and stated that Russia was willing to join the plan, thus opening up the path of extensive positive cooperation between Russia and NATO. An examination of the remarks made by President Yeltsin and President Clinton, however, reveals that the views of Russia and the United States on the new security system in Europe are not completely identical. Clinton stressed that East European countries would eventually join NATO through close cooperation and, on this basis, a unified Europe without new boundaries would be established. Yeltsin maintained that NATO's "partnership for peace" was only one of the new plans for the construction of a new Europe, and the role of collective security organs such as the CSCE should not be neglected. In addition, the United States and Russia still have divergent views on a number of issues, such as the question of whether Russia has a "special status" and "guiding power" in East Europe and in the CIS, the rights of Russian inhabitants in Baltic states, and the withdrawal of Russian troops from that area. As commented by the press here, although the Russian and U.S. leaders said that they would consistently take new steps to establish a "strategic partnership" between the two countries, the prospects for this kind of relationship are still very uncertain. The future development of Russo-American relations hinges to a very large extent on Russia's political situation and changes in its foreign policy.
