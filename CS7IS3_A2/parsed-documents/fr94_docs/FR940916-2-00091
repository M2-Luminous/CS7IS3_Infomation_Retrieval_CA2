FR940916-2-00091 FR940916-2-00077 III As a result, the NRC has serious concerns regarding Dr. Kusmik's performance and supervision of NRC-licensed activities, and in particular, the supervision of such activities. Dr. Kusmik's actions were particularly serious since, as the RSO at the facility, Dr. Kusmik was charged with ensuring that Licensee staff adhered to requirements and performed activities in a safe manner. Rather than properly discharging those responsibilities, Dr. Kusmik set an unacceptable example for the individuals to whom he gave direction, as well as to others engaged in NRC-licensed activities at the facility. The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate in all material respects. Dr. Kusmik's actions in causing the Licensee to violate 10 CFR 30.9 and his misrepresentations to the NRC have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC, if he was employed as an RSO or authorized user. Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public, including the licensee's employees, will be protected if Dr. Kusmik were permitted at this time to be an authorized user listed on the License or act as an RSO. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require that License No. 20&hyph;20592&hyph;01 be modified to: (1) Remove Dr. Kusmik from being named on the License as an authorized user and prohibit Dr. Kusmik from acting as an RSO; and (2) require that Dr. Kusmik be directly supervised by an authorized user should he perform NRC-licensed activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the conduct described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. IV Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 30, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that license no. 20&hyph;20592&hyph;01 is modified as follows: A. Dr. William F. Kusmik, for a period one year from the date of this Order, is: 1. removed from Condition 11.A of License No. 20&hyph;20592&hyph;01 as an authorized user; and 2. prohibited from acting as an RSO. B. During the one-year period set forth in Paragraph IV.A of this Order, the Licensee may allow Dr. Kusmik to perform NRC-licensed activities only if he is under the direct supervision of an authorized user as defined below. NRC-licensed activities are those activities that are conducted pursuant to License No. 20&hyph;20592&hyph;01. Supervision of Dr. Kusmik during this period shall be performed as follows: 1. The Licensee must document the name of the authorized user responsible for supervising Dr. Kusmik's activities and ensuring compliance with all applicable NRC requirements. 2. The supervising authorized user shall routinely observe and review all radiological safety records generated by Dr. Kusmik's activities. On a monthly basis, records generated by Dr. Kusmik will be reviewed and initialed by the supervising authorized user to assure that the records are complete and accurate. Any record found not to be in accordance with NRC requirements shall be reported to the RSO. 3. The RSO shall: a. ensure and document that he/she has provided training to Dr. Kusmik on the License, its conditions, and all applicable NRC requirements, including the Licensee's radiation safety procedures; b. perform documented audits of all radiological safety activities conducted by Dr. Kusmik on quarterly basis; and
