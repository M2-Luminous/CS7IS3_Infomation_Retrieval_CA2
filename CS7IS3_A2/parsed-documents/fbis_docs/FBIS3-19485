Palomares; place and date not given: "Felipe Gonzalez Asserts That Whoever Commits Crime of Corruption `Ends Up Paying'"] [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez is convinced that "whoever commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends up paying." The head of government made this general assertion, at a time when evidence of the improper use of secret funds is proliferating, in an interview with EFE agency President Alfonso S. Palomares. Gonzalez asserted, "contrary to the doomsayers," that "the crisis is beginning to be surmounted," and expressed his confidence that the coming PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress will serve to make the party "a more transparent organization in its functioning and in its funding." The Socialist leader regards as unfounded the impression that some cases of corruption go unpunished in Spain. According to him, what happens is that judicial investigation is sometimes slow and causes some frustration because there is no immediate response. "But there is not the slightest doubt that, in general terms and respecting what is the rule-of-law state, whoever commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends up paying," he asserted. Gonzalez tried to convey hope and optimism about the future, and to this end argued: "It can in no way be believed that we are in a stage of decline, even though we are in a crisis situation." In his opinion, the fact that 5,000 net jobs were lost in February, as against the 48,000 lost in February 1992, shows "the trend is changing." This will be seen in foreign trade, "and, appreciably, in tourism and the construction industry." "We are beginning to recover a much more positive path from the economic viewpoint. This will be slow, and the structural problems must continue to be combated. And I also say, contrary to the doomsayers," Gonzalez added, "that the crisis is beginning to be surmounted." The prime minister announced that he will give the struggle against unemployment top priority, at the same time as continuing the effort to contain the deficit. According to the PSOE secretary general, the welfare state needs to "readjust." "It is necessary to curb any kind of abuse, and try to order the welfare state in such a way that it will survive," he stated. Gonzalez explained that the basic intention of the labor reform prepared by the government and now submitted for debate in parliament is to facilitate enterprises' adjustment to the changes, an adjustment in which employers and trade unions should have more prominent role and the government a less prominent one. Investment Confidence From his viewpoint, the suspension of payments by the Santana plant in Linares (Jaen) is not a sign of foreign investment's loss of confidence in Spain but a result of the crisis. "If there were some element of loss of confidence, we would have to do whatever is possible to regain confidence," he added. Nine months after the parliamentary elections, the prime minister believes that 9 million citizens gave him their support to promote the culture of pacts between the parliamentary forces. The "change on change" also consists, he added, of some aspects of economic policy and of imparting a new impetus in the autonomy and institutional spheres. "And we will continue along this path," he stated. Following several months of agreements between the government and Convergence and Union, he stated that they have both seriously discussed such important issues as the course in the struggle against the deficit and tax incentives for investment. "There has been no kind of pressure or that impression which some people sometimes wish to give of horse-trading, which is an extremely unpleasant thing because it is unfair." And he took the opportunity to rebuke the People's Party for its criticisms of that cooperation. "Our conduct has been serious and much more responsible than that of those who are shouting against it, and who would probably be doing the same thing if they were in the position in which we find ourselves." "I believe," the prime minister added, "that it is very important for our country that the moderate nationalists in Catalonia should become involved with the state's government, with Spain's governability. It seems to me that this is important." This contribution benefits the Catalan nationalists themselves in the sense that "they know very well that if Spain as a whole fares well, if the Spanish economy as a whole fares well, Catalonia fares well within that whole." Impetus to Autonomy Gonzalez stated that, following the extension of the so-called slow track autonomous communities' powers, the government will now make "an effort to complete the so-called historical communities' autonomy statutes. We are trying to complete (the autonomy framework), but to complete it in terms which are somewhat relative from the historical viewpoint. This does not mean," he warned, "that the area of friction between a power which is being decentralized and a power which is being assumed on the basis of decentralization will disappear for ever." In order to explain that warning, he pointed out that "even as centralist a state as France has a constant process of discussion on the elements of administrative and political decentralization." With respect to the negotiations with the People's Party to select the holders of vacant institutional posts, the prime minister stated that if the People's Party insists on making some agreements conditional on others, the government "will try to seek a solution." After acknowledging that the People's Party -- if not exactly its chairman, Jose Maria Aznar -- is an electoral alternative, he added that "whether it could be defined as an alternative in terms of its program is another, and much more debatable, matter. Every month and a half or two months, they say that they are presenting a new economic program...." Gonzalez trusts that Spain's dispute with Norway within the framework of the enlargement of the European Union over the fishing quota for Spain in that country's waters "will be resolved over the next few days." With respect to the presence of Spanish troops in Bosnia, he explained possible future contributions in this way: "We are one of the few countries which have a presence in the area, and we are making an enormous humanitarian aid effort, at the limit of our means. If it were a matter of rounding off this effort with another company, it would be possible; if it were a matter of doubling our effort, this honestly would not be possible for us, and therefore we have said so." "I Have Not Asked and Do Not Ask for a Free Hand" "I have never used this expression, because I do not like it. The strength which I may have had within the party has depended basically on my availability. Hence I have not asked and do not ask for a free hand." With this statement, Felipe Gonzalez tried to clarify in the interview with the EFE agency what exactly his stance is on the coming PSOE federal congress, which will begin next Friday [18 March]. "What I have always asked of my comrades and will continue to ask," Gonzalez said, "is not to ask me to work against my conscience or my personal convictions. I am in agreement with the resolutions of the majority of my comrades, I work well; if I disagreed and felt that I was in a minority, I could not shoulder the majority's responsibilities." The Socialist leader advocates as a general rule that voting be individual and public, delegate by delegate, "in all proceedings of the congress and in the life of the party in general. And it should be secret for the election of officials." The candidate for reelection as secretary general wants the PSOE Federal Executive Committee to have from this congress onward a standing committee which will meet more frequently than the team as a whole. He also wants "part of that leadership to deal with internal matters and for the main part of the leadership to deal with conveying to society what the party's tasks must be." Bar for Women Gonzalez agreed with the "aspiration" of a "democracy of parity," in which men and women will be represented equally. "How we move from this situation to achieving that aspiration is another matter," he added: "Some people sometimes become annoyed because I say that the problem which we still have is that we are jumping one and a half meters, and if we set the bar at 2.2 meters, somebody will be tempted to pass under the bar and not try to jump. What we must do is to be raising the bar in order to achieve the aim of a `democracy of parity,' which seems to me one of the major elements of change for the society of the future in Spain." From his viewpoint, the main conclusions of the congress should be "the intention to fight unemployment as an essential factor in surmounting the economic crisis, and to make the party a transparent organization from every viewpoint in its functioning and funding, so that the intention to open itself to society and be in constant contact with it is apparent."
