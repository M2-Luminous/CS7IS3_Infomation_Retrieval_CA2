In his statement following his meeting today with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Musa said the final measures to implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement will be signed the first week of May. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he stated that Egypt supports NATO's recent measures to strike the Serbs if they continue their aggression or if they violate the decision to withdraw their forces 20 km from Gorazde. Musa added that the formation of the United Nations committee on Bosnia-Herzegovina marks a step forward, because questions had arisen concerning some of the proposals made by some of the mediators. He said President Mubarak has sent Ambassador Badr Hammam, assistant foreign minister for Arab and Middle East affairs, to Yemen to contact the Yemeni president and vice president. Hammam is carrying a message from President Mubarak following yesterday's contact made by the president with the Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid.
