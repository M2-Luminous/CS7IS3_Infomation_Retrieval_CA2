FR941207-0-00005 FR941207-0-00001 (2) A part-time employee shall schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty. (c) The time limits established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for using restored annual leave accounts shall not apply for the entire period during which an employee is subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). When coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends, a new time limit shall be established under paragraph (b) of this section for all annual leave restored to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). 3. Section 630.308 is revised to read as follows: ยง630.308 Scheduling of annual leave. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before annual leave forfeited under section 6304 of title 5, United States Code, may be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period rather to the end of the leave year. (b) The requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an employee who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). When coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) terminates during a leave year, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to comply with the scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of the agency or his or her designee may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if coverage under 6304(d)(3) terminated during the leave year and the employee was unable to comply with the advance scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control.
