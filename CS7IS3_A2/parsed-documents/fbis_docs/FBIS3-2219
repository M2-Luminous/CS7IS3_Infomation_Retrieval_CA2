The friend said Wei had telephoned at 12:20 p.m (0800 GMT) [time as received] to say that his period of interrogation had finished and he would be returning to Beijing later Saturday evening. Wei, who was picked up by police Friday morning, was taken to a state guesthouse in the northern outskirts of the city, the friend said by telephone. Wei, who was released from prison on September 14 just six months short of a 15-year term, was taken into detention just four days after meeting in Beijing with U.S. assistant secretary for human rights John Shattuck. During the meeting, Wei had urged Washington "to be as tough as the Chinese" over the question of human rights in China.
