The statement called an Ultimatum to President Nazarbayev was made Wednesday at the news conference in Moscow by Chairman of the Congress of Russian Communities' Executive Committee Dmitriy Rogozin. He said that one of the leaders of the Russian community in Kazakhstan, the editor of the newspaper "GLAS", Suprunyuk, was arrested in Patropavlovsk on April 12 and then carried to Almaty where he is kept in prison. He is accused of stirring up inter-ethnic feuding. Rogozin, however, is sure that Suprunyuk was arrested for political reasons. Rogozin sent a letter to Russian president Yeltsin asking him to play a personal part in the fate of the Russian citizen. Asked by Interfax what is behind the statement "own variants for his liberation", Rogozin said that he had no right to make public any plans on this score. He referred to mass demonstrations of the Russian-speakers in Petropavlovsk in support of Suprunyuk and on the sentiments of the local Cossack community.
