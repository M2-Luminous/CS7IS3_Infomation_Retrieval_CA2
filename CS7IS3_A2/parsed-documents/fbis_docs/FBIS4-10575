The reasons are threefold: 1. His understanding and practice of politics; 2. His serious, specific, and viable government program; and 3. His compatible, serious, and imaginative team of colleagues 1. Andres Pastrana understands and practices politics in a different way. He tries to surround himself with competent, upstanding people, no matter what party they belong to. He did this as mayor and in the Senate, where he worked with Liberals, Conservatives, and independents. Andres' multiparty philosophy stems from his own convictions about who he is and what politics is, convictions that he has demonstrated with deeds. This is unlike the multiparty approach that Samper Pizano has proclaimed at the eleventh hour, motivated by a publicity strategy as with so many of his proposals. Andres is in tune with the new country. This is why every day he receives more support from young people, women, and independents. They are the spokespersons of a Colombia that is tired of empty promises, corruption, and political hucksterism. And they are key pieces in Andres' political agenda, as he believes in young people and in women, not because of their age or their sex but because of their potential, which has not been properly harnessed. It is with good reason that Andres has been building his credibility among the public. Those who think that this campaign is and ought to be polarizing Liberals and Conservatives are wrong. This is a short-sighted view of the citizenry's position. At bottom, this campaign is about credibility and trust, about the person Colombians believe in and in whose hands they will place their country's future. In this regard, the support for Andres is telling. People know him; they know that he is straightforward, honest, committed, and experienced. Those who identify with the new politics acknowledge him as such. They remember his record as mayor; this is why more and more people are supporting his political agenda every day. In contrast, the feeble single-party approach does not represent the new country. Political parties are going through an unprecedented crisis. It is a surprise to no one that patronage and corruption are no longer the exception but the rule, thus putting an end to ideological debate. They have replaced it with a simplistic blend of mechanical alliances and with subliminal messages that wind up trivializing politics. This shows that they underestimate our thoughtful, reflective young people, who would like to analyze and compare platforms before voting for a color or article of clothing of little significance. Colombia is tired of lies. The incident involving Samper Pizano and Juan Gomez Martinez is truly regrettable. To offer the vice presidential nomination to the current governor of Antioquia and then to retract it is altogether irresponsible. It is worrisome that a presidential candidate's credibility has been undermined, to judge by the opinion poll that one radio news show conducted. The fact is that Samper Pizano should have acknowledged the offer he made and explained the political circumstances under which he did so. The country would have preferred a clear answer to a lie. 2. Andres Pastrana is the only candidate who has put a serious, specific, and viable government program before Colombia. For the first time in history a candidate has identified what the priorities of his administration would be, what they would cost, and where the revenue would come from. Andres' government program is, in itself, a development plan. It has a profound social content. Education, drinking water, and housing are priorities, because we want to make a leap towards development. Andres is committed to these issues and to the environment, infrastructure projects, agriculture and agribusiness, the modernization of government, security, justice, and a growing economy, based on the liberalization model, that can create more and better jobs, and his commitment is the result of a responsible analysis of national realities, of people's needs, and of ways to meet them. Meanwhile, shallow proposals such as the ones that Samper Pizano made at the Economic Association of Friends of the Country, for example the need to update our antimonopoly legislation, reflect a lack of familiarity with the real world. When I was development minister, I issued the regulations for promoting competition that implemented the principles set forth in Law 155 of 1959 and that contain provisions designed to insure a free market without abuses by the players in it. This law is now being enforced. Therefore, to call for its updating when it has been in effect for barely a year is superfluous. The problem here is a lack not of laws but of political will. And Andres has never lacked will. The other side's lack of a program is also worrisome. The country is aware of Samper Pizano's contradictions. Let me mention a few. In May 1993, for example, he said that "the circumstances that justify the legalization of drugs are more imperative now." But he later asserted that such a move "would be an insult to those who have been slain by narcoterrorism." During his time in the Development Ministry he fiercely attacked the liberalization policies of the administration he was serving, which cost him self-exile in Spain. Now, in contrast, he admits that he wholeheartedly backs such policies. Likewise, during his 1989 presidential campaign he defended patronage as "a personal relationship between a political leader and the community that he is trying to help." Today, however, realizing that this political practice is on the decline, he says that "patronage continues to exist and is worrisome." I share this concern with Colombia: our citizens want clear-cut positions, not vacillation. 3. Andres Pastrana has a compatible, serious, and imaginative team of insightful colleagues who can make adjustments. One of Andres' major virtues is that he knows what sort of people to surround himself with. He demonstrated this throughout his term as mayor and in the Senate. His campaign team is conscientious and works together. Most of us have known each other for many years; we are friends and we believe in Colombia and in Andres. None of us seeks personal gain. This is why we are working with enthusiasm and conviction. We have not had to make a pile of mistakes or heal rifts within the campaign staff, as the other side has. This quality has enabled us to remain in tune with each other and to act promptly, imaginatively, and tenaciously. Andres Pastrana will be the next president of Colombia because he is an open, receptive man who understands and practices politics without sectarianism or clannishness. Because he has shown his independence by taking stands that benefit the country above and beyond groups and parties. Because he is a man of action, as he has shown in both the mayor's office and in Congress. Because he has the moral authority and the resolve needed to combat corruption. Because as a public official he has been steady and calm during crises and in handling problems of law and order. Because he is a team player and surrounds himself with good people. Because he is a man with renewal-oriented ideas. In short, because what Andres wants for Colombia is what the great majority of Colombians want.
