Organic Lipids Can By Themselves Arrange Themselves Into Special Structures"] [Text] Frankfurt--Chemists at the British University in Bath under the direction of professors Stephen Mann and Douglas D. Archibald have found a fabrication process for organic-inorganic microcomposites that allows one very flexibly to make quite different structures of materials. The process points out new ways to make submicron structures. The process is based on laboratory observations that organic lipids that have a hydrophilic sugar group like that of the so-called cerebrosides can by themselves arrange themselves into special structures. Moreover, lamellar, fibrillar, or tubular developed microstructures form via self-arrangement. When suspensions of these structures are brought into contact with ferric chloride in an acid environment, films of iron oxides form that eventually change into magnetite-type crystal beds. So, ceramic structures form from an organic matrix with metallic oxide particles. Their structure can be compared with that of bone matter, which consists mainly of an organic matrix made of the cartilage-forming protein collagen and are embedded in the inorganic particle made of the mineral calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite, and thereby impart to the bone hardness and strength together with a certain elasticity. Until now similar microcomposites have been able to be produced in small amounts only with zeolites, into whose pores a few different organic molecules were embedded. A greater multitude of different structures is possible now because of the ability to influence the organic components of the microcomposites. Although one can not yet predict which end products can be synthesized in large quantities even technically in the future, synthesis from lipids represents an important advance in the direction of the utilization of self-arranging organic compounds. However, extensive research work is still required. The University of Bath (Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom) reports that it hopes that a portion of this work can be sped up by means of special designer programs that can make, already before the actual synthesis and synthesis reactions, quite precise theoretical statements concerning the properties that can be expected.
