It states this in the draft state closing account for 1993 that it has submitted to parliament. It considers price stabilization to be an important feature of economic development. The level of inflation measured by the consumer price index was 20.8 percent last year, 8.0 percent of which can be ascribed to tax reform. During the year, the prices of foodstuffs increased by 13.2 percent, nonfoodstuffs by 18 percent, public catering by 21.9 percent, and services by 25.3 percent. The productivity of labor rose for the first time since the start of transformation--by 2.4 percent compared with 1992. It has not changed much in large organizations; it has increased by just under 25 percent in small organizations, and it declined by 12.2 percent in construction. The decline in unemployment halted in May, and the number of people out of work began to go up in June. At the end of the year, there were 185,000 people out of work, 50,000 more than in 1992. The average period of unemployment was 4.6 months. At the end of 1993, 4,954,000 people were working in the national economy--that is, 17,000 fewer than the previous year. The structure of employment has changed, however. The labor force in industry and agriculture gradually transferred to construction and services. Some 7 percent were employed in agriculture and forestry and 34.4 percent in industry. The 50-percent boundary was exceeded in services for the first time. Some 45.5 percent were employed in the private sector, which was more than in state and local organizations. The population's real income rose by 5.6 percent, while its nominal income rose by 27.6 percent. The government forestalled extreme wage development (by 32.7 percent in June compared with 1992) by wage regulation. The closing account showed income amounting to 358 billion korunas [Kc] and expenditure amounting to Kc356.9 billion. That is, it ended with a surplus of more than Kc1 billion. The government proposes that Kc200 million be used to support small and medium-sized business, especially in the Bruntal, Louny, Novy Jicin, and Znojmo Districts. The sum of Kc87 million should be transferred to the North Bohemia Mines shareholding company to repay the credit for removing the overburden, Kc340 million should go toward establishing a system for administering and supervising the Czech Republic's taxes and duties, and Kc454 million should go toward boosting the reserves for dealing with social problems.
