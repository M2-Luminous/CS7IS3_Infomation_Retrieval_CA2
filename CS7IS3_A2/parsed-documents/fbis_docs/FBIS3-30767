It is noted in a statement signed by Radomir Smiljanic, president of the White Rose and of the Danube Blockade Council, that "we all genuinely and deeply mourn the innocent victims of Sarajevo, but at the same time we wish to draw attention to the fact that for the fourth time the unscrupulous propaganda machine of the Bosnian Muslim government and world agents have used the same trick." "The suffering of the innocent is used to move the world public and NATO's military power against the Serbs and to undermine the Geneva peace process," the statement says and goes on to warn the NATO Council "under no circumstances to take military action or mount air strikes against the Serbs in former Bosnia-Herzegovina."
