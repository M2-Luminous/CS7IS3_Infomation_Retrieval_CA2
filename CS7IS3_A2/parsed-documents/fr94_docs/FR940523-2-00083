FR940523-2-00083 FR940523-2-00042 Staff of the Department of Housing and Urban Development developed the form and will collect and concatenate the data. There will be no additional contractual cost to the government. A13.0␣Respondent Burden All public and Indian housing authorities which expend HUD funds on law enforcement or security staff will be required to collect the data and submit the report annually. Currently HUD does not anticipate more than 1200 HAs to have to complete more than the first part of the form. The initial set-up or modification of one housing agency's data collection system is estimated to take three working days (24 hours). Once the collection system is in place, the annual burden for one grantee, including time to prepare data and complete the form is 8 hours. The total annual burden program-wide will vary based on the number of housing authorities which use HUD funds to pay for law enforcement or security staff, which is not anticipated to be more than 1200 HAs. Name of Reporting Form: Public Housing Law Enforcement/Security Form Respondent: All public and Indian housing authorities Number of Respondents: 3300 Estimated Time in Hours: Initial set-up: 24 hours; subsequent reporting 8 hours/year. Frequency in Reporting: Annual. Annual Burden (In Hours): For 1200 housing authorities, 28,800 hours for initial setup plus 9,600 hours/year for subsequent reporting. Note: The reporting requirements for small housing agencies (under 1,250 units) are somewhat less, as they are less likely to have used more than one HUD funding source to pay for law enforcement and security activities. A14.0␣Reasons For Change In Burden This is a new reporting form and therefore this section is not applicable. A15.0␣Tabulation Plans, Statistical Analysis, Study Schedule and Publication The concatenation and analysis of the results is intended for use by the program staff at the Department to monitor shifts. The concatenation and analysis of the results is intended for use by the program staff at the Department to monitor shifts in the use of funds and to report to Congress and the White House. As part of ongoing program monitoring, the data gathered may be tabulated and used periodically to assess the overall effectiveness of HUD funds in national efforts at increased law enforcement. Currently, there are no plans for such a formal assessment based on this report. PART B.
