ANC Regional Office Deputy General Secretary Obed Bapela said that when the marchers got outside the organisation's offices they had stopped and begun hurling abuse at the ANC. They were also brandishing guns, Mr Bapela alleged. As the ANC's security retreated "there was a burst of gunfire", in which one man was wounded. Mr Bapela said he did not know who the gunfire had come from. "We want to dismiss the police story that there was a sniper in this building." The ANC had agreed to co-operate with police in allowing them to carry out ballistic tests on the security guards' weapons, he said. The ANC earlier telephoned SAPA to say its regional office was being "attacked". Police told SAPA's reporter on the scene minutes after the shooting, however, it appeared as if the wounded man had been hit by a sniper who had been aiming at the marchers. By 9.20 AM, with the bulk of the Zulu marchers still due to arrive at their kick-off venue at the Library Gardens, a state of near-hysteria seemed to hang over Johannesburg. Security personnel hovered around with walkie-talkies, merchants gossiped in little groups in their shops, work apparently forgotten, and SAP [South African Police] officers patrolled four-abreast. The streets, for this time of the day, remain relatively deserted. Mr Bapela said he and ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] General Secretary Tokyo Sexwale would be doing a helicopter fly past to "assess the situation".
