FR940127-1-00021 FR940127-1-00008 4. Demonstration As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than December 31, 1994, or the State must show that attainment by December 31, 1994 is impracticable (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The attainment demonstration for Columbia Falls was conducted using receptor modeling (CMB) and rollback modeling. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter ( m g/m 3 ), and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 m g/m 3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 50 m g/m 3 , and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 m g/m 3 (id.) The demonstration for Columbia Falls indicates that the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be attained by December 31, 1994 at 136.3 m g/m 3 , and it will be maintained in future years. The demonstration indicated that an annual concentration of 31.1 m g/m 3 will be achieved by 1995, 5 showing attainment of the annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. Ambient monitoring has not measured an exceedance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in Columbia Falls since 1987. The control strategies used to achieve these design concentrations are summarized in the section titled ``RACM (including RACT).'' For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration and the control strategies used, see the TSD for this proposed action. 5 The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration as providing for attainment by January 1, 1995. EPA is proposing to approve the State's demonstration on the basis of the de minimis differential between the two dates. The State should promptly inform EPA if EPA has in any manner misinterpreted the date by which the State has demonstrated attainment in the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. 5. PM&hyph;10 Precursors The control requirements that are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels over the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). An analysis of air quality and emissions data for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust, stationary sources and residential wood burning. Neither the emission inventory nor the CMB analysis for Columbia Falls revealed any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors. Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major sources of precursors of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequences of this proposed finding are to exclude these sources from the applicability of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this proposed action. Note that while EPA is proposing to make a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). The State of Montana's PM&hyph;10 SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Flathead County Health Department (FCHD) will submit to EPA a reasonable further progress/milestone report consistent with federal guidelines by December 31, 1994. 6 6 Thus, this report will be submitted coincident with the December 31, 1994 attainment date. The de minimis timing differential between the first milestone submittal date (i.e. November 15, 1994) and the attainment date make it administratively impracticable to require separate submittals. See generally 57 FR 13539. In addition, FCHD will prepare less detailed annual progress reports for the prior year by August 1st each year. These annual progress reports shall provide information on the effectiveness of the control strategies for re-entrained road dust. The MDHES will add a progress report for the Plum Creek facility. To monitor the progress of the road dust control rules, a report will be completed on the type and amount of de-icing and sanding material applied, the number of applications of de-icing and sanding materials, the dates of application of each material, and where and when the street sweeping and flushing occurred during the winter season. The sanding material test results for the percent silt and durability also will be submitted.
