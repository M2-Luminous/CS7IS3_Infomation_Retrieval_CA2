We have learned that Zhirinovskiy has officially applied for the entry visa, which he will also be granted. For the time being it is not known whether the Slovene politicians have coordinated their views about this visit. In connection with the claim that Zhirinovskiy has allegedly sent a letter to some Slovene political institutions informing them of the visit, the Foreign Ministry says that this is not the case and that the Foreign Ministry has received no such letter. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is expected to remain in Slovenia until 1 February. He will be staying in Bled where he will be joined by sympathizers from all over Europe.
