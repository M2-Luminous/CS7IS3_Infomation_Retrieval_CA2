The action represented the first punitive step by the UN nuclear watchdog agency against North Korea, which promptly said that it will order two IAEA inspectors still in the country to leave the country. The IAEA's technical aid to North Korea amounted to 270,000 dollars in 1993. The IAEA board of governors voted 28-1 for the resolution cosponsored by the United States, Japan and other countries, which have expressed grave concern over Pyongyang's clandestine nuclear program as a destabilizing factor on the north Asian security scene. Libya was the sole dissenting country. China, North Korea's longtime ally, abstained, along with three other countries. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told reporters in Istanbul that their countries will push for an international conference on North Korea and a resolution of sanctions by the UN Security Council against North Korea. Moscow has proposed an international conference on North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program to help defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula. After the IAEA's historic vote, a North Korean diplomat in Vienna said his country no longer guarantees the continuity of nuclear safeguards.
