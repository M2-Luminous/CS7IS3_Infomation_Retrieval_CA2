FR940527-2-00012 FR940527-2-00009 In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we compared U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level of trade, where possible. We calculated FMV based on packed ex-factory prices charged to related and unrelated customers in the home market. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we included arm's-length sales to related customers, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.45. In light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead will adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight and inland insurance. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, were appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and warehousing expenses. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. As discussed above, the IVA was only levied on sales in the home market invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. Therefore, we calculated two FMVs, one covering the period May&hyph;September, 1993, and one covering October, 1993, of the POI, to account for the application of the IVA tax only on sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. See ``Concurrence Memorandum'' for further details. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base ( i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. Currency Conversion Because certified exchange rates from the Federal Reserve were unavailable, we made currency conversions based on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the International Monetary Fund. Oxidor has requested that we use a currency conversion methodology different from the Department's normal practice given the sustained increase in the bolivar/U.S. dollar exchange rate during the POI. We have disallowed Oxidor's alternate currency conversion methodologies as Oxidor has not met the requirements of currency conversion using the ``Special Rule'' in 19 CFR 353.60(b). See ``Concurrence Memorandum'' for further details. Verification As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of phthalic anhydride from Venezuela, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Margin percent Oxidor C.A. 3.03 All Others 3.03 ITC Notification In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination or 45 days after our final determination.
