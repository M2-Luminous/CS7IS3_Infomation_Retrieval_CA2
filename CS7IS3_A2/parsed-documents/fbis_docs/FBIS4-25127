The talks, scheduled for June 2, were postponed because the Muslim side refused to show up at the talks before the Bosnian Serbs withdraw from the U.N.- protected area. Earlier today, the Bosnian Army command and U.N. peace-keeping force confirmed the pullout of the Serb troops from the zone, clearing the way for the truce negotiations. Akashi met Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic, Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic separately today to discuss with them his draft proposal for the cease-fire talks. It was reported that Akashi was calling for a four-month truce with separation of forces and withdrawal of heavy weapons from conflict lines. Face-to-face talks among the warring factions are expected on Tuesday [7 June].
