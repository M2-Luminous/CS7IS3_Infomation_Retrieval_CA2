The petrochemical industry occupies an important position and plays an important role in the national economy. It is a leading industry and a pillar which has supported economic takeoff and social development in many developed countries. The petrochemical industry has become an important scale to measure a country's economic strength and scientific and technological standards. In our country, the petrochemical industry is still a new industry. In the wake of more than 40 years' of development, and especially after the founding of the China National Petrochemical Corporation [CNPC] in 1983, a number of modern oil refining, chemical industry, chemical fiber, and chemical fertilizer enterprises have been established, thus substantially increasing the comprehensive strength of China's petrochemical industry. By the end of 1993, the total value of the assets of China's petrochemical industry amounted to 182.9 billion yuan, an increase of more than 500 percent in 10 years; the petrochemical industry's sales reached 145.2 billion, an increase of more than 200 percent in 10 years; and the accumulated total financial revenue turned over by the petrochemical industry over the past 10 years was more than 130 billion yuan. In order to develop the petrochemical industry into an economic pillar, we must first of all set an aggressive, realistic target which can be accomplished through effort. This target must consist of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitatively speaking, we have put forth a basic idea about a two-stage program according to the guideline laid down by the central authorities. In the first stage, by 2000 we will raise the annual crude oil processing capacity to about 200 million metric tons and ethylene production capacity to about 5 million metric tons, thus initially upgrading the petrochemical industry to be a pillar of the national economy. In the second stage, by 2010, we will raise annual crude oil processing capacity to over 300 million metric tons and ethylene production capacity to 8-10 million metric tons, thus enabling China's petrochemical industry to approach or reach the advanced world levels both in terms of scale and actual capacity. Qualitatively speaking, our first main task is to increase the variety and brands of our products, raise our product quality and grade, increase economic returns, and strive to optimize the industry's returns. Over the past 10 years since the founding of the CNPC, returns (profits and taxes received) have doubled, from 10.7 billion yuan in 1983 to 21.7 billion yuan in 1993. We are planning to double returns again in the next seven years, that is, by the year 2000, mainly through such measures as speeding up technological progress and intensifying business management. This will be a very arduous task to accomplish, as it requires us to work really hard indeed. Comrade Jiang Zemin has noted: "To strive for development we need new ideas too." In light of this spirit and the requirements laid down in an inscription written by Comrade Jiang Zemin, we need a new idea to guide our efforts to revitalize the petrochemical industry and build it into an economic pillar. We maintain that the eight-character principle of "large scale, advanced technology, serialization of products, and intensive production" must be upheld in order to explore a road with Chinese characteristics to speed up the development of the petrochemical industry, to revitalize the industry, and to build it into an economic pillar. Large scale means economies of scale. In other words, we should emulate the successful experiences of foreign countries, stress economies of scale when starting new projects in the future, oil refining installations must have an annual capacity of over 5 million metric tons each, ethylene installations must have an annual capacity of 450,000 metric tons each, and all existing medium and small-scale installations must undergo technological transformation to gradually increase their economies of scale. Advanced technology means to implement in real earnest Comrade Xiaoping's idea that "science and technology is the primary productive force," keep track of advanced world standards, speed up scientific and technological progress, apply advanced technology in achieving the greatest economic returns, and seek development by tapping internal potential. While stressing self-reliance in vigorously developing new technology, we must also attach importance to assimilating and making use of the advanced technology available abroad so that our country's petrochemical industry can develop from a more advanced starting point. Serialization of products means to vigorously develop the intensive processing of crude oil, synthetic materials, and chemical materials; strive to develop a full range of upstream, midstream, and downstream products; produce high-quality products with advanced technology, new designs, high added value, and marketability; and constantly develop a series of products including oil products, plastic products, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, and fine petrochemical products. Intensive production means to sum up our practical experiences, boldly assimilate advanced management experience from abroad, establish a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism which suits the needs of the socialist market economic structure, and ensure scientific management, high efficiency, low inputs, and high outputs, thus scoring the best results. Deepening reform is the only way out to revitalize the petrochemical industry and develop it into an economic pillar. According to the guidelines laid down in the "Resolution" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the CNPC must be gradually reorganized into a shareholding company to suit our country's national conditions. At the same time, it is necessary to fully delegate all the decision-making powers to enterprises that the "Regulations" have vested in them and to extricate enterprises from the yoke that has been placed on them by the highly centralized planned economic structure of the past, so that they become real, active entities in the market. Therefore, as far as business strategy is concerned, it is necessary to gradually develop a business operational mode characterized by the "group enterprise structure, transnational operations, the joint-stock system, and diversification." The introduction of the group enterprise structure means to give full play to the advantages of the socialist system which can pool resources to accomplish big projects and to give full play to the initiative of all departments of the corporation through the rational assignment of duties and readjustments of power and interests within the corporation, thus increasing the competitive power of Chinese petrochemical products in domestic and overseas markets. Transnational operation means to adapt to the international market and promote comprehensive cooperation with foreign countries, including measures to attract foreign businessmen to start investment projects and establish plants in China, import advanced foreign technology, jointly exploit oil resources with foreign investors, directly import oil resources from abroad, go straight to start investment projects and set up plants abroad, and expand exports of products, technology, and labor services, as well as overseas project contract operations. Promoting the joint-stock system means to encourage more local investors and foreign businessmen to run joint ventures in the petrochemical industry and to develop joint-stock companies in various forms after the model of a company with limited liability and a limited stock company. Existing enterprises also must carry out reform to introduce the joint-stock system step by step and in a planned way, and the CNPC must speed up its pace in transforming itself into a state-owned shareholding company. Diversification means extending intensive processing operation to produce midstream and downstream petrochemical products and to further develop more upstream products. At the same time, it is necessary to actively develop tertiary industry and gradually build up a large-scale diversified cross-trade and cross-sectoral operational structure which integrates industrial production, trading, commerce, banking, scientific and technological research and services, engineering, information services, and consultancy services, thus increasing economic returns and our economic strength.
