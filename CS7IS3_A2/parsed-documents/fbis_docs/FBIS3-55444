Units, bandit formations, and groups, which penetrate into the territory of Tajikistan with hostile intentions, are making attempts to cross the state frontier almost continually. The prime purpose of these attempts is reconnaissance, sabotage, and terrorism. And tension is arising as a result of these attempts. There are also formations which have gone underground in Tajikistan, and I think that they are also, for the time being, not disposed toward keeping the peace. The most important thing is that, along with the border guards, Tajikistan's national army, and units and elements of the Interior Ministry, the peacekeeping forces have taken steps to guarantee, as far as possible, peaceful conditions for constructive work in Tajikistan.
