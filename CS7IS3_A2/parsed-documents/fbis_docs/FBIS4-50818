He pointed out during the inspection: Military industry enterprises and institutions should take full advantage of their technological superiority to enter the main battlefield of economic construction. During his stay in Sichuan, Liu Huaqing inspected Chengdu Aircraft Industry Company, China Southwest Electronics Research Institute, Southwest Rolling Stock Plant, Construction Machine Tool Plant, and Chongqing Shipyard. He fully affirmed the achievements made by factories and scientific research institutes in relying on their technological superiority to open up civilian goods market. He said: The military industry in Sichuan, having a tremendous strength and playing a very important role, has made great contributions to China's national defense construction. Some military industry enterprises have found, through exploration, effective ways to turn themselves into producers of goods for civilian use. Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with great strategic insight, proposed the conversion of military industry enterprises into producers of civilian goods some 10 years ago. With his guidance, China's military industry enterprises have achieved a strategic shift and made great success. At present, military industry enterprises should seize the opportunity to further readjust their structure, take the initiative in entering the market, and adapt themselves to the new situation in which we are establishing a socialist market economic structure. During the conversion, the enterprises must take full advantage of their superiority and use high and new technology to produce pillar products. It is necessary to carry forward the military industry's tradition of "putting quality above everything else." At the same time, it is necessary to try in every possible way to reduce costs, enhance competitive power, and constantly update products according to market demand. Liu Huaqing was greatly concerned about the work and livelihood of scientists, technicians, and enterprise workers. Wherever he went, he familiarized himself with their income and living conditions. He said: Military industry enterprises and institutions have a very good work force. Quietly immersing themselves in hard work and dedication, they have displayed the fine quality of the working class and contributed to the national defense construction and economic development. Now, it is necessary to stabilize the work force and carry out reforms to develop production, enhance economic efficiency, and further improve the production and living conditions. Liu Huaqing pointed out: Sichuan has very good natural conditions and a great potential. Located on the major route of the Red Army's Long March, it is an important strategic place to which Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation have paid great attention. Leading comrades at all levels must fully attach importance to agriculture, which is the foundation of economy, and arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for production. It is necessary to pay attention to the difficulties confronting large and medium state-owned enterprises and use our heads to overcome them. Liu Huaqing emphasized: Since the masses are greatly concerned about such issues as the promotion of ethical integrity and the improvement of public order, we should take action to deal with those issues at the grass-roots level. On some economic difficulties and problems at present, Liu Huaqing said: We should work in accordance the central authorities' unified plan and subordinate ourselves to the interest of the whole. Under the conditions of market economy, we should display the pioneering spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and frugality and work as one to overcome difficulties. Accompanied by Chengdu Military Region commander Li Jiulong and Sichuan party Secretary Xie Shijie, Liu Huaqing visited the officers and men of the People's Liberation Army units and the armed police units in Sichuan during his inspection. He called on those units to pay attention to the quality of troops and urged them to actively support local economic construction.
