Turkey's monthly wholesale inflation soared to 32.8 percent, pushing the 12-month rate to 125.3 percent, the second highest level since 1939, when Turkey started to produce price indexes. The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed on Wednesday [4 May] that consumer prices rose 24.7 percent, sending the year-on-year consumer inflation rate to 107.4 percent. Back in February 1980, the peak of an economic crisis, consumer and wholesale prices had risen by 26.9 percent and 29.3 percent respectively. The annual rates in February 1980 were 133.7 percent for consumer and 133.2 percent for wholesale prices. Other peak rates are 104.4 in 1946 and 107.2 percent in 1980. The coalition government's original program target for the entire 1994 was an inflation rate of 54 percent. Year-end consumer and wholesale price inflation rates were 71.1 and 60.3 percent in 1993. In March, consumer prices rose 5.2 percent and wholesale prices 8.5 percent. They went up 4.4 percent and 2.6 percent last year. A dramatic price surge for the month of April was expected already. Premier Ciller, as part of her economic recovery program, dropped a bombshell of public sector price hikes that were followed by the private sector firms. "Several private sector firms have already raised prices by more than 100 percent in order to protect themselves from inflation and to minimize losses from a shrinking market," explained one former Treasury chief. "It is not possible to survive under the circumstances. At the end of the year's second quarter, 60 percent of Turkish manufacturers will be suffering from payments problems, and at the end of the third quarter 90 percent," said Sozer Ozel, chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Industry (ASO). He predicted to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that things would get progressively worse in the economy during the rest of the year. "There is already a large number of company closures. I do not want to talk of the possible picture by the end of the year," Ozel said. Some businessmen are remaining calm. "If the correct steps are taken, the Turkish economy could overcome the crisis within a month," said Besim Tibuk, chairman of the Net Holding company. Economists have been warning of possible stagflation. They say three-digit inflation, as expected, could couple with a drastic decline in industrial activity, making stagflation inevitable in the medium term. ``There has been hardly any economic activity since the start of the financial crisis this January. We have inflation rates above the 100 percent mark. One does not have to be a genius to combine these two and conclude that stagflation is in the offing,'' said one Ankara professor of economics. ``The important thing is to establish confidence in the government's policies,'' Ozer Ertuna, economics professor at Bosphorus University and former chief adviser to Ciller, told REUTERS. "Bankruptcies will be seen if it cannot be provided." Observers say the economy is heading into recession after last year's consumer-driven 7.3 percent growth. "Production is declining, prices are rising and consumption is falling rapidly. The economy is being dragged into stagflation," said Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO). Three small banks and eight brokerage houses failed last month, and some companies in the telecommunications, car and textile industries have suspended production. There were reports on Wednesday that Turkey's manufacturing industry grew by a negative 1.4 percent in March compared with the same period of last year. Capacity utilization in the industrial sector is 72 percent. Some economists are still optimistic. "It is normal that prices rise extremely fast in the first months of a stabilization program," said Professor Cafer Tayyar Sadiklar, former finance minister and the central bank governor. He predicted that inflation would fall noticeably in the coming months. Opposition politicians were angered by the disclosure of inflation figures. Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz said this was a sign that the economy had gone out of control. Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Deniz Baykal said that Turkey had now entered a period of three-digit inflation figures, predicting that the financial crisis would soon turn out to be a production crisis, forcing several factories to close down. Meanwhile, Turkish financial markets reacted calmly to Wednesday's news that the annual inflation had hit three figures. The Istanbul stock exchange index firmed 285.08 points to finish at 15,130.98, bringing the two-day recovery to 6.6 percent following a 37 percent plunge since April 15. The Turkish lira firmed to 35,600 to the dollar from 36,200 Tuesday.
