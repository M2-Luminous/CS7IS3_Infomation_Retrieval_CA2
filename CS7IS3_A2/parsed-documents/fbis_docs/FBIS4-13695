He said: The United States has asked NATO to use air power for returning peace and safety to other Bosnian regions declared as safehavens, including Gorazde, as had been done in the case of Sarajevo. Clinton's fresh remarks have come at time when the United Nations and the Western governments have come under fire and criticism by the international community for the indifference vis-a-vis the Serbs' criminal attacks which led to the fall of Gorazde. The United Nations and NATO, which have carried out a belated and small-scale attack on two Serbian tanks around Gorazde during their so-called military operation involving one U.S. F-15 fighter plane after the Serb attacks and before the fall of Gorazde, actually gave a green light to the Serbs for escalating their attacks and capturing Gorazde. The same belated attack gave way to softness toward the Serbs in silence, coupled with satisfaction, following the protest lodged by the Russian Government which contained a clear threat. Now that the international community is questioning the United Nations and the Western governments for their deceitful and betraying role in the fall of the 65,000-population city of Gorazde, the U.S. President, Bill Clinton, by expressing such remarks is trying to bring down the wrath and indignation of the world community. This is at time when certain pro-Serb elements in the U.S. Administration, such as Senator Joseph Biden, cannot hide the happiness they derive from the Serb victory. Joseph Biden, the second influential man in the U.S. Democrat Party, speaking in the Foreign Relations Committee, had called for the whole withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping forces from the so-called safehavens, saying that let the Serbs and Muslims fight each other since war is the only way to reach a solution. In his yesterday's press conference, Clinton also said that the United States will step up its efforts for imposing sharper sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the supporter of Bosnian Serbs. This is at a time when all the signs and evidence speak of the fact that Moscow and Washington have launched wide-scale efforts to relax international sanction against the confederation of Serbia and Montenegro, seeking the consents of some of the Western governments in this regard. It should, therefore, be said that Clinton's new remarks stand in contradiction with the performance of his administration and that the White House tricks cannot lessen the degree of the crime of the United States, which culminated into the fall of Gorazde and the perpetuation of the genocide of Muslims by the Serbs in Bosnia.
