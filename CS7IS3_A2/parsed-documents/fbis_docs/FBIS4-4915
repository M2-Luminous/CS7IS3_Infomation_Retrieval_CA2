Present at the symposium were Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, officials concerned, officials of political parties and public organisations and men of science, education and press. Speakers at the symposium proved that the 10-point programme is a great program of independent reunification and a great charter of national unity for putting an end to the history of division and confrontation covering nearly half a century with the strength of the nation. They said the 10-point programme is a banner of powerful unity for actively breaking the deadlock with the united strength of the nation in the grim situation in which the destiny of the nation is at stake and a great charter of unity and reunification for achieving the reunification of the country and the prosperity of the nation with the strength of the nation by uniting all the compatriots. They said the foundation of a pan-national unified state by confederacy formula is a most reasonable goal for uniting all fellow countrymen of different classes and quarters, transcending the regional and institutional differences between the North and the South at present. They branded the "three-phase reunification formula" of the Kim Yong-sam group as an imitation of the "formula of unification through Korean national commonwealth" brought forward by its predesessors, a proposal of division and confrontation in every aspect, which is no more than formulae of "unification of systems" and "unification by prevailing over communism". They said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation is a program of great unity embodying the great idea of benevolent politics of President Kim Il-song, because it provides for granting special favours to those who have performed exploits for the reunification of the country and, if those who had betrayed the nation in the past, take the patriotic road, repentant of their past, for dealing with them leniently to enable them to contribute to the cause of national reunification.
