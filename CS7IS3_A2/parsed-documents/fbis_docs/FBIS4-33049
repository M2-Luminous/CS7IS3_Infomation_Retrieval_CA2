He appeared before the bicameral commission specially appointed by Congress to study Decree 51. Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the suspension of guarantees was justified while the juridical basis to eliminate the value added tax was determined. However, with this week's promulgation of the Law on Conspicuous Consumption and Wholesales, the intention of the government is to reinstate economic guarantees. In light of lawmakers' questions on whether the speculation unleashed by the increase in dollar prices would prompt authorities to maintain the measure allowing the executive to implement price control actions, Sosa Rodriguez asserted there are mechanisms that can be implemented. He added these mechanisms do not have anything to do with the suspension of economic guarantees. The minister insisted the executive will use all resources before implementing foreign exchange controls, because this measure would not benefit the country. Sosa Rodriguez expressed he hopes the situation will normalize with the implementation of the new foreign exchange sales provision adopted by the Central Bank. He stated there are no reasons to justify an uncontrolled increase in U.S. currency. The minister announced he will travel on Thursday to the United States, where he will meet with representatives of the IMF and the banking sector to explain Venezuela's situation, to try to restore confidence among international economic sectors. He hinted at the possibility the government may present in the short term a compensatory bond plan for salaries and social programs, which would benefit the poor. Nevertheless, he did not make specific announcements because these measures are now under study at the Ministries of Development and Labor.
