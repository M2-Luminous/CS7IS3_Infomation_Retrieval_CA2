He told PRENSA LATINA: We are not starting from zero. He acknowledged the last two years of work by the consular office in Havana. He said: The road is open; this contributes to today's mature and solid relations. Regarding the outlook for relations, he said that there are good possibilities of further strengthening existing ties. In this regard he mentioned public health, tourism, technology, and the agricultural and livestock sector. Right now our responsibility is to open those roads and to include new sectors, Santamaria said. He recalled that during Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's trip to Colombia, some ideas were discussed that could be consolidated by visits from Colombian businessmen to the island. Santamaria noted the pleasant impression that the Cuban minister produced in his country. He said: He is an honest and open person who knows how to touch the heart of the people. I can assure you that all those who spoke with him think highly of him. Santamaria trusts that with the renewal of bilateral relations, Cuba will be seen in the framework in which his country has developed its ties with Central America and the Caribbean. First, the two economies and commercial possibilities must be studied, he said. He added: Colombia wants, and has played, an important role in this type of agreement in the Caribbean. Santamaria said that in the past two or three years, the government of Cesar Gaviria has implemented an aggressive economic opening up policy that has led to important agreements with Mexico and Venezuela and to negotiations with Central American countries. Some of these negotiations, like those with Guatemala and Costa Rica, are well under way, the ambassador noted. Regarding the Fourth Ibero-American Summit scheduled for 14-15 June 1994 in Cartagena, Colombia, the ambassador said that his country is working hard to prepare for a smooth meeting. All Ibero-American countries have confirmed their participation in the meeting, he said. They can be sure, he added, that Colombia will offer the necessary guarantees. Santamaria recalled that Cartagena has hosted presidential meetings and thus will be able to offer the most suitable conditions for a meeting of this nature. Regarding the Colombian electoral process, Santamaria discussed changes that will supply new ingredients to the upcoming elections. In this regard he mentioned a two-round presidential election; an increased number of presidential hopefuls, with each party choosing its candidates through internal consultations; and the incorporation of new movements, such as the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, which is carve out a role in Colombia's political life as an option to traditional parties. Referring to the capture of notorious drug trafficker Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the diplomat said that such events close a tragic chapter in Colombia's history. He pointed out: Nevertheless, this taught Colombians an important lesson -- no one, no matter how powerful, can oppose the will of a country, defeat the state's legitimacy, and place themselves above the law and institutions. With Escobar's death a chapter on narcoterrorism closes, which gave back to Colombians their faith in justice, stressed Santamaria, even though he admitted that this does not mean an end to drug trafficking. Santamaria repeated: Colombia continues its struggle against this scourge with the same intensity and spirit. Regarding the government-guerrilla dialogue, Santamaria explained that the Colombian authorities maintain contact with a dissident faction of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a group called the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS]. The CRS unilaterally decreed an end to hostilities more than a year ago. This created a favorable climate for detente at the start of the dialogue with the government. An eight-point agenda is under discussion with good prospects that by February or March it will end in the demobilization of its members and their full incorporation into Colombian political activities, Santamaria said. The Colombian ambassador in Havana was in charge of the presidential peace council for a year and coordinated preparations for a constituent assembly. In addition, he had a role in the peace process that ended with the demobilization of the M-19 [19 April Movement], Quintin Lame, PRT [Revolutionary Workers Party], and EPL [Popular Liberation Army] guerrilla groups.
