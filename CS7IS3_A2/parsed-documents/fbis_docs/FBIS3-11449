The peasants are under investigation by the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) over their alleged ties to drug trafficking. Soliz said the measure was taken after the intelligence services determined that the peasant mobilization was headed "by agitators," allegedly trained by drug traffickers who intend to create problems for the executive branch authorities. Soliz noted: "Yes, there obviously exists some type of link. Records (of the detainees) have been prepared and the intelligence services will surely determine who these people are. If they have any ties to drug trafficking, these people will be called to testify at FELCN." He said the infiltration of drug traffickers in the assemblies and meetings of coca growers aims to prevent the growers from understanding the alternative development program's benefits for Chapare's peasant communities. He expressed optimism, however, that the interrupted negotiations with coca growers will be resumed on 3 March. Soliz added: "We understand they will attend the meeting, and in this regard we want to use all our ability for dialogue to see if they are sincere in resuming the dialogue and fulfilling the law." He said the task of eradicating illegal coca in Chapare will continue in accordance with the plans of national officials and in strict compliance with the law. He announced that the Social Defense National Secretariat installed a permanent office in that region with experts and under secretaries who will contact the real producers at least five days each month to promote alternative projects. Soliz also reported that several coca growers' leaders are constantly threatening the peasants who want to join the coca replacement plan, and this clearly shows the political handling of the coca problem.
