According to the report, Panama's economic expansion was attributed to active investments and, to a lesser extent, on consumption which showed a moderate increase. The construction sector registered a growth of nearly 40 percent. Farm production dropped because of a reduction in the harvest of plantains, sugar, and tobacco. The ECLA report added that unemployment dropped from 13.6 percent in 1992 to 12.4 in 1993.

Last Monday, President Guillermo Endara expressed disagreement with this corn import, ordered the closing of the silos, and banned the unloading of soy beans from a ship that docked at Balboa port.
