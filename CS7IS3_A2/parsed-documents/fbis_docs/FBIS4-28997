During the past five years, more than 62,000 Vietnamese were repatriated from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Japan. The Vietnamese Government and international organizations have provided aid and assistance to these returnees while creating conditions for them to stabilize their daily life and to reintegrate themselves quickly into the Vietnamese community. In Haiphong, Quang Ninh, Ho Chi Minh City, Thua Thien-Hue, and Quang Nam-Danang about 70-75 percent of the returnees now enjoy a relatively stable life, 5-10 percent are doing well, and 10-15 percent experience difficulty in finding jobs and living quarters.
