However, this will not protect the Czech arms factories from being scandalized by foreign competitors, who have described the Czech Republic as a `dealer in death.'" This is how Jan Vlcek, director of the RDP arms consortium, commented on the government bill on the export of military technology. The press published this statement on 28 January 1994. By coincidence, the letter in which Engineer Vlcek, in the name of the RDP Group, asks Minister of Industry Dlouhy for help in obtaining arms export licenses to Iran bears the same date. This Is Not Your Business As recently as mid-January, the RDP management vehemently denied any contacts between their company and the Iranian regime. "That is just rumor and gossip. We are sticking to the line of Czech foreign policy," Director Vlcek told RESPEKT at the time. Shortly after that, it became clear that the contrary was true. Documents confirming that Lubomir Soudek, Skoda director general and chairman of the RDP Presidium, had held talks on possible deliveries of surface-to-surface missiles and the modernization of T-72 tanks with Iranian Government officials in Teheran at the beginning of December of last year were published (see RESPEKT No. 3/94 for details). When this fact surfaced, the arms producers kept a cool head. "It is no one's business what negotiations we are conducting, and with whom. If someone wants to make an affair of it, then he should not be surprised if the unemployment rate goes up," Soudek told reporters. The official reaction was unequivocal: The RDP Group's plan regarding Tehran is doomed to failure because it is impossible to acquire export licenses for military technology to Iran at this time. On 18 January, MLADA FRONTA DNES even quoted an "anonymous source from diplomatic circles," who said: "If Mr. Soudek behaves like this in Iran after the bill on arms exports is passed, his activity could be considered criminal." Ten days after this statement, Jan Vlcek wrote his letter to the minister of industry, and, within the next 10 days, the said bill passed. Vladimir Dlouhy submitted the arms consortium's request to his three colleagues from the government (the interior minister, defense minister, and foreign minister). According to Engineer Fritzl of the Licensing Office of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, their opinion is awaited. Reportedly, the official rejective stance on military trade with Tehran has not changed. The RDP chiefs are equally committed, however. An Untrustworthy Man According to military experts, the only thing the RDP Group can do is to persist. Their most ambitious program--to modernize the T-72 tank in cooperation with French partners--has oriented them, from the very beginning, toward very risky markets. There are about 8,000 [T-72 tanks] in the world that are of Soviet origin. Of these, about half are in the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, and the rest in countries such a Syria, China, Iran, and Iraq. Several pieces are also in NATO states--for instance, the United States has four, but these tanks are antiques to be put on display in museums, and the owners do not want to modernize them. When Lubomir Soudek and Jan Vlcek established the arms group in the summer of last year, their plans were mainly based on the orders of the Czech Army. It was expected that the RDP Group would use the know-how of the French firm SOFMA while modernizing domestic machines. The Army, however, turned down the offer. According to the officials from the Defense Ministry, economic reasons played their role when the decision was made (the adaptation of one tank costs 45 million korunas [Kc] in RDP prices, which would swallow the whole 1994 Army budget if we wanted to modernize all of the 540 tanks of our Army), as well as personal reasons. "Mr. Vlcek is an untrustworthy man and his personality is unacceptable to us," Defense Ministry Spokesman Zdenek Borkovec says. Minister Baudys is of the same opinion: "The RDP Group director general is suggesting utilizing the capacity of our Army, without ever discussing this subject with the Army. In view of the questionable trading activities of the consortium, I consider the participation of the Czech Army in these projects as quite out of the question." Partners in the Background Foreign markets are absolutely not interested in the arms the manufacturer is unable to sell even to the Army in his country. Countries whose reputations are such that no one can openly offer them anything are the only exception. Trade with them may be lucrative, but there is a catch. When they come to light, they mean a scandal for the exporting country. The perseverance with which the RDP Group is pushing for its Iranian contract shows that the management of the consortium decided to take risks. Reportedly, they have already invested Kc10 million in the T-72 modernization program without having moved a single step forward. The efforts to sell "repair lines" to Iran are seen by experts as logical. The experts, having applicable documentation, could, on Vlcek's call, make the first steps toward the conclusion of the main deal: Adjustment of the Iranian T-72's on the basis of French technology and know-how. "The French partners to the RDP Group play a key role in the intended trade. Their profit would be adequate, but they would bear practically no risk," an official from the Ministry of Industry and Trade Licensing Department told RESPEKT reporters. If the deal fails, nothing will happen. SOFMA has offered its know-how not only to the Czech arms manufacturers. It has successfully sold it to Poland and Slovakia, and negotiations with the Bulgarians are reportedly under way. If Soudek's and Vlcek's RDP obtains the license, SOFMA will get on the Iranian market, something it cannot do for the time being. Only the Czech side bears the risk of the possible scandal. According to available statements from responsible officials, it seems that the contract with Iran will not be authorized. "The fact is, however, that a very intensive lobby is being established here. They will try to push for their interests as much a possible," Engineer Samek, supreme director of the Licensing Administration, commented on the course of the "Iran case." Information provided to RESPEKT confirms his words indirectly. Apart from Iran, the RDP Group also offered to modernize Syria's "72's." This happened during Director Vlcek's trip to Damascus last summer. Syrian General Hussain Al Ali came to Prague to confirm the deal at the beginning of November. The RDP Group management refused to answer any questions on the matter.
