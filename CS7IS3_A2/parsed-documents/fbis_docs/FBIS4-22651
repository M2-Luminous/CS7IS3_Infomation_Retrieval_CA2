Tishkov, director of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "The Eurasian Union As a New Symbiosis"] [Text] Kazakhstan is an Eurasian country even though created in its current form by the Soviet regime, it has the required legitimacy and is going through a complicated process of new nation building. The patrimony of the post-Soviet space--the doctrine of ethnonationalism as the basis of statehood--was manifested strongly in that country: half of the population, consisting of ethnic Kazakhs, in the face of its elite, formulated and in many ways realized the claim to exclusive control of power, resources, and cultural space, utilizing the thesis of "their own" statehood for "indigenous" nations. But a multiethnic nation will be unable to function on the basis of that doctrine since the other citizens under conditions of even minimal democracy will not reconcile themselves to that situation, and particularly such an ethnic group as the Russians, which is almost as large as the Kazakh group. Kazakh nationalism has already manifested its impatience and intolerance in a provocative change of toponymy, language policy, in the barring of non-Kazakhs from power, prestigious occupations, and higher education, as well as in the immigration policy. To some degree the manifested nationalism was explicable as a form of therapy against the harm done to Kazakh people and the destruction of their collective dignity by former state regimes, as well as a means for eliminating unitary dependence on the former center. But it is impossible to build new statehood and a relationship with new fellow-citizens on the basis of this doctrine and political practice, just as it is impossible to preserve for long the contradiction in the sovereignty of a "multinational nation" and a "Kazakh nation." The time has arrived for making a choice, and that choice exists, and it can also become a model for many other new states of the former USSR. President Nazarbayev was one of the first leaders to start speaking about his citizens in terms of a nation state--as Kazakhs, understanding both the real situation in the country, and the imperatives of world norms of state building. Kazakhstan can and must exist as a state representing the interests and rights of all of its citizens, which is on a path toward the creation of a multicultural civil nation. All who take part in the socioeconomic and cultural life of the state and are loyal to that state as their homeland, comprise the Kazakh nation. In a cultural sense the make-up of that nation has a complex character just as that of all other large nations of the world, be they the Indian, British, Spanish, or the Russian nation. Ethnic Kazakhs, as a nation, represent a competitive group in the social and cultural aspects, capable of adopting a nation-saving formula of "bilingualism on a multicultural basis" and thereby providing equality for another equally strong group--the Russians, while guaranteeing the preservation of ethnic identity for numerous minorities. That formula, without the reinforcing power of a special status, will grant benefits to Kazakhs, most of whom are bilingual and have assimilated numerous aspects of the Russian culture, which in turn promoted their modernization. That formula will end the ambiguity of the situation and compulsion with regard to those Kazakhs themselves, who utilize components of the Russian culture (in the linguistic aspect) and do not use the Kazakh language. What is most important is that it will provide promise and faith in their state for half of the population in the face of Russians and Ukrainians, relieving them of false forms of solidarity of the Cossack type and of the threat of becoming the objects of geopolitical speculations by Russian nationalism. Kazakh national radicals, many of whom are establishing their status and prosperity not through diligence and ability but through ethnic affiliation, will not renounce their ideology since it brings power and allows exploitation of fellow-tribesmen as well as state resources as if on a "lawful" basis ("this is my land"), which is no better than former outrages. The country, however, has enough responsible and intelligent politicians and intellectuals who could follow a course toward creation of cross-ethnic social coalitions and a policy of cultural pluralism instead of racing around with ballot boxes over the territory of the former USSR collecting votes of citizens of other countries (but with Kazakh blood) in order to ensure a parliamentary majority. Ethnic nationalism is myopic and primitive: its adherents do not care if one or another force or group is deprived of the vote, it prefers "the solution." That is an axiom of political science. Kazakhstan society, which is characterized by a high level of tolerance, has not yet been corroded that deeply by ethnonationalism which still remains an exercise of the elite elements and some of the youth. On the Russian side, most of its recruits are probably veterans, but the younger elements are also now being heard. The faster it is possible to replace it with civil nationalism, i.e. all-Kazakh patriotism, the better the future faced by that country. The latest proposal by Nazarbayev concerning creation of the Eurasian Union appears to be exceptionally important since the powerful economic and socio-cultural symbiosis between Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and a number of other post-Soviet states is preserved, and it is wiser to utilize it for common welfare of the people without its breakup by rigid borders which, at least between these three states, the politicians of our generation will not be able to impose on the population. It will not harm either the sovereignty nor the culture of the nations and may prevent some tragic errors. It is gratifying that Nazarbayev's initiative received the support of many important politicians, for example, that of Sergey Shakhray.
