In statements to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY on the 24th anniversary of the issuance of the historic 11 March statement, the two Kurdish officials added that settling the Kurdish issue and halting infighting in the Kurdistan region were only some of the significant accomplishments of the glorious 17-30 July revolution. They reiterated the Kurds' allegiance to the historic and unique leadership of leader President Saddam Husayn. They also reaffirmed their willingness to make sacrifices to safeguard Iraq's unity and thwart the enemies' schemes, which aim to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and national unity. The two Kurdish officials noted that the lawlessness, instability, insecurity, anarchy, murders, and thefts currently prevailing in the Kurdistan region are cogent proof of the false claims made by archtraitors and archagents, who have accepted subservience to their foreign masters, the enemies of Iraq. Concluding their statements, they asserted that agents and traitors will be defeated, with God's help and the determination of zealous Kurds, particularly since the zealous Kurds have always demonstrated their support for the courageous leadership of leader President Saddam Husayn.
