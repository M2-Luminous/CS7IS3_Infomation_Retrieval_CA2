The planned relief will cut their enterprise income tax (EIT) by nearly half. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is currently negotiating with the State Tax Bureau to reduce EIT paid by China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines from the unified 33 per cent tax rate down to 18 per cent, according to reliable sources. The tax reduction is proposed as a subsidies arrangement, under which the two airlines would submit the full amount to the tax bureau first, after which 15 per cent would be returned to the CAAC, which looks after the whole family of state-run airlines in China. The concessionary period will run for two or three years under details still being finalised by the State Council. The planned tax cuts would save the two airlines about US$4.5 million (about HK$34.7 million) per year. Alfred Shum, partner of Ernst and Young, said the tax cut would give a facelift to the airlines' profit forecasts. Their annual income currently amounts to about US$30 million each. Beijing is determined to develop its lucrative aviation business, which has long been enjoying a premium 18 per cent EIT, compared to a tax rate which sometimes reached 55 per cent for domestic enterprises before the tax reform came into effect on January 1. Other main state-run airlines including Air China, China Northern Airlines, China Northwest Airlines and China Northeast Airlines are also on the list to benefit from the tax cut measures. But business insiders said the concessions would arouse jealousy among the remainder of the second batch of 22 companies seeking overseas listings. Mr Shum said he believed the tax breaks could set a precedent for the other companies seeking overseas listings. Joseph Fu, partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, said China would be unfair if it granted tax concessions to only one industry. "China will appear to overrule its own rationale to achieve the unification of income tax rules if it does give the tax premium to the aviation industry," he said. Li Yonggui, general deputy commissioner of the State Tax Bureau, denied tax concessions had been granted to the two airlines. "We have always been trying to unify the tax system. Although we granted tax privileges to lower the first batch of H-share companies' EIT rates by 15 per cent, we are not going to repeat it this time," said Mr Li.
