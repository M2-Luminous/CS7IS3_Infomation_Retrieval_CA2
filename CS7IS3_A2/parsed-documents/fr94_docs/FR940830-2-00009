FR940830-2-00009 FR940830-2-00003 Forest Service Revised Draft Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Early Winters Alpine Winter Sports Study, Okanogan National Forest, Okanogan County, WA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Cancellation of a revised supplement to a final environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: On January 22, 1991, a notice of intent to prepare a revised draft supplement to the final environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Early Winters Alpine Winter Sports Study on the Okanogan National Forest was published in the Federal Register (56 FR 2158). Because there is no longer any party proposing development of this alpine winter sport site and, subsequently, no need for a land exchange in the project area, the Forest Service has decided to cancel this revised supplemental EIS. The data developed and collected from the environmental and the land exchange analyses, as directed by Public Law 101&hyph;560, is completed and will be made a part of the public record. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Direct questions regarding this cancellation to Jim Gregg, Resort Development Coordinator, Box 579, Winthrop Ranger District, Winthrop, Washington 98862 or telephone (509) 996&hyph;2266. Dated: August 22, 1994. Sterling J. Wilcox, Acting Deputy Associate Chief, National Forest System. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21352 Filed 8&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
