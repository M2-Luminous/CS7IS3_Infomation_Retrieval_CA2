This was announced by the Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief, Feliks Gromov, at a meeting of the government's commission led by Chairman of the State Committee for Control over Atomic Safety, Yuriy Vishnevskiy, on the settlement of the issue concerning radioactive waste products. The state committee's press service told INTERFAX that the commission's meeting decided to set up a specific working group for examination of the situation with radioactive waste products in the Far East. This group is to work out a report for the Russian government. The commission also discussed the operations schedule within the scope of the special federal program for 1994 on processing and utilization of radioactive waste products and used nuclear substances. This problem became especially significant after the incident in October, 1993, when radioactive waste products were dumped into the Sea of Japan. This caused protests from Japan, South Korea and the environmental organization Greenpeace.
