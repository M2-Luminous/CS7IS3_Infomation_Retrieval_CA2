I respectfully greet you all. The coalition governments established by the two big central right parties and the central left party following the 1991 elections made a great promise to our people. This was a promise of democratization and restructuring. The activities undertaken by the 49th government on this issue have now achieved a comprehensive entirety and a concrete essence as a result of the democratization and restructuring plan the 50th government is announcing today. Our world will enter a new century in six years. It is natural and necessary for Turkey, which experienced a great leap in the 20th century with a lot of effort and unfaltering conviction, to get ready for a new leap. Turkey will have another encounter with history. Since the establishment of our republic we have made achievements in all fields of our social life of which we can really be proud. We have achieved great developments. No one can deny this. I would like to state with gratitude and appreciation that all previous governments have exerted efforts and have a share in these developments. Our world, however, is rapidly changing and being restructured. Turkey, on the other hand, needs to change at a faster pace. Naturally, our people's expectations have increased. When we come to think of it, we were a nation of 13 million, most of whom were living in villages and rural areas with little involvement in world developments. Now our population exceeds 60 million. Most of our citizens live in cities and urban areas. Our youth are especially well aware of world developments. They aspire for the same rights and opportunities granted to the people of the contemporary world. They, therefore, have expectations and rightfully so. It is not possible nor is it right to keep our people within narrow confines. From time to time there are calls for advancement from all sectors of our community and from all parts of our country. A new leap is needed in Turkey. We should be entering the 21st century as a contemporary and productive country with an equitable distribution of wealth and in which human rights and democratic freedoms are being fully exercised. The economic stability and restructuring program which we announced on 5 April might well be the most comprehensive in our country's history. We are implementing the 5 April decisions with strong convictions and determination. We will not allow for any deviations. The current passing difficulties should not discourage anyone. The economic measures we have taken are, step by step, reaching their goals. By the end of the first three-month implementation period everyone will realize that better results will be achieved. The aim of the 18 May decisions, which we are announcing today, is to provide a brand new structural framework for Turkey -- politically, administratively, and socially. The two main approaches that will be used to bring about this process are: first, amendments to the Constitution and its laws; second, the seventh five-year development plan for 1995-1999 to which we attach great importance. I would like to discuss first the Constitution and then the envisaged amendments to the laws. The government will support removing all constitutional, legislative, or de facto deterrents to freedom of thought and expression in our country. We want all of these obstacles and difficulties eliminated. We think that this is an essential element of a democratic society that respects its people. We cannot ignore Turkey's Constitution during the process of democratization. We are all aware that the Turkish Republic was guided by three different constitutions over 70 years. Today, the Constitution of 1982 lags behind the process of democratization and restructuring. For this reason, we need a new constitution to meet the expectations and ideals of a democratic civilian society; a constitution that will include the characteristics of democratic institutions found in the Western world and that will also provide for the participation of its citizens. This constitution, by recognizing and determining basic rights and freedoms, has to be based on a democratic framework. For these reasons, we believe that we have to start our democratization program with a new constitution. Experts from the two parties that are partners in the coalition government worked intensively on the problems involved in creating a new draft constitution and they will continue to do so. During the next three months, we will hold discussions with the other political parties on the draft constitution and the discussions will be open to the public. Following these assessments, the new draft constitution will be submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA]. I call on all political parties and public institutions to cooperate in drawing up a civil and democratic constitution. Honorable members of the press, undoubtedly preparing a new constitution will take time. We propose the following: Regarding Article 67 of the Constitution -- already existing and approved by the TGNA -- on the right to vote, to be elected, and to conduct political activities, we propose the right to vote and participate in a referendum for all Turkish citizens who are 18 and older and the right to vote for Turkish citizens living abroad. Regarding Article 68 on political party legislation, we propose reducing the membership age for political parties from 21 to 18 and that permission be granted to establish auxiliary organizations such as women's or youth groups to encourage a participatory and pluralistic democracy. In Article 69, on the principles by which political parties have to be governed, we propose eliminating all restrictions on cooperation and relationships between political parties and trade unions, professional organizations, syndicates, waqf's, corporations, and public institutions. As to Article 76, on the requirements for running for the post of deputy, we propose reducing the minimum age to be elected deputy from 30 to 25. We want these amendments to take effect as soon as possible. Work is under way to achieve this. In addition, in Article 82, we think that the ban on deputies' not being able to serve in professional organizations and trade unions should be removed. We also envisage eliminating the restrictions in Article 84 regarding the resignations of TGNA members. Regarding Article 135, we believe in removing the laws which foresee the abolition of professional establishments on the contention that they are politically active. It is necessary to eliminate the existing bans in Article 51 of the Constitution on the right to establish unions and in Article 52 on union activities. Work on these issues will be completed as soon as possible. These amendments to the Constitution will assist Turkey in making great leaps forward toward democratization. When these amendments are made, 7 million young people will, for the first time, vote and thus play a role in determining the fate of our country. Out of 2.5 million citizens who live abroad, 1.4 million will have the right to vote from their place of residence. In the 1991 elections, only 46,000 citizens could vote by personally arriving at the border gates. This modification will eliminate our citizens from feeling alien and will give them the right to have their say in governing their countries. Unions, syndicates, and trade unions, as an organized power in our society, will be able to increase their participation and effectiveness in the political life of Turkey. Lowering the eligible age to be elected deputy to 25 will increase the voice of the younger generation in our parliament and will encourage the youth to be more responsive to the country's problems. With this modification, in the 1996 elections, approximately 6 million young people will have the right to be elected and enter the parliament. This kind of participation will give the Turkish parliament a new force and dynamism. These amendments will also eliminate a great number of restrictions which do not meet the principles of democratization. For these reasons, we give great importance to these changes in the Constitution. We believe these changes are the stepping stones toward democratization and reconstruction. In addition to these modifications, valuable experts from both parties have worked intensively on other articles in the Constitution. Assessing these works, we are going to propose other amendments to the Constitution. Undoubtedly, there is a need for conciliation and cooperation with the political parties represented in the assembly in order to initiate the changes in the Constitution. Our government is ready to fulfill all the duties that fall on it to facilitate this cooperation and conciliation. In addition to the changes in the Constitution, we foresee 60 new draft bills within the framework of the democratization and reconstruction program. We decided that 20 of the planned 60 draft bills have high priority. After the 20 draft bills with high priority are passed we will submit the rest to the Assembly. In the report that we have distributed to you, there is a list of all the proposed draft bills. Dear friends, with your permission, I would like to explain the reconstruction process. We see the reconstruction process embodying all political, legal, economic, administrative, and social arrangements envisaged by the democratization process. Reconstruction has both internal and external dimensions. Our government believes that Turkey should integrate with the civilized world. Turkey has made its choice to become a member of the European Union. We will also achieve a uniform customs arrangement. Communication and flow of information with the rest of the world is of utmost importance. For this reason, we are going to increase the channels of communication and information and if necessary we are going to institutionalize them. The reconstruction process aims to use the seventh development plan as its main mean in attaining the hoped for ends. Turkey, up to now, has survived six different development plans. We are integrating with the world and we have to offer a new strategy in the seventh development plan. We will provide this strategy. This development plan is different than its predecessors; it will provide for Turkey's reconstruction and integration into the civilized world and include the necessary principles and measures toward that end. There are differences in the development levels of various regions in our country at the socioeconomic level. The differences are especially obvious in the east, southeast, and Black Sea regions. All the former governments exerted great efforts to eradicate these differences. One of the most important examples of these efforts is the GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. Our government sees the eradication of the developmental differences between the regions as the most important and basic need of a social state. It is essential to provide minimum living conditions for everybody in the country, for all the citizens of our country. The state will continue to have a leading role in the regions which have priority regarding development plans. Industry will have priority until it reaches a certain level. New centers will be established in the pilot regions to make them more attractive. Regional development projects will be implemented. The seventh five-year plan will make use of regional and physical techniques. GAP, which is the largest integrated regional development project, will be serve as an example for other regions. Regional development plans will also be implemented for the Black Sea town of Zonguldak. One of the main prerequisites for the development of our undeveloped regions is to provide security. For this reason, before everything else, we are determined to bring peace and tranquillity to these regions. Valued members of the press, the Turkish Republic is a undivided state. As we have announced in our government program, we will not allow any behavior that will harm the structure of this undivided state. We are going to handle all social issues within this framework. As indicated in the government protocol; any physical or legal shortcomings, hindrances, or limitations in the protection, free expression, or development of our citizens' cultural, linguistic, or ethnic identities will be handled within a national unity framework and eradicated. The important point here is that all citizens, who are faithfully tied to the Turkish Republic by their citizenship, should continue to profit equally from their rights as citizens and individuals, without discrimination, and this guarantee should be strengthened. Another aspect of the restructuring and democratization process is to provide Turkey with an up-to-date understanding of a centralized administrative structure. Our plan has the characteristics of reform. We had the following determination when we started our work, that today a centralized structure is not possible anymore and that today it is impossible to govern Turkey from Ankara. For this reason, we are determined to hand over to provincial administrations a great number of services which are conducted by the central government. Provincial administrations will be responsible for the development and progress of their own regions in cooperation with the municipalities. These provincial administrations will not only play a leading role in developing their regions but will also have full authority -- in cooperation with the municipalities -- over their area in the construction, maintenance, and management of villages; roads, drinking water installations, electricity, mosques and schools, social and administrative installations, small industry centers, organized industrial areas, cultural centers, sports installations, health centers, and hospitals. The basis of this structure we developed for the provincial administrations and municipalities is that these establishments will have the authority to collect and impose taxes in their regions by councils appointed through elections. Valuable press members, in conclusion I would like to point out the following: Obviously, democratization and restructuring is a process. We cannot belittle the great steps taken toward this end since the establishment of our republic. Today when we are on the threshold of the 21st century, our government is determined to overcome all obstacles in the way of democratization and contemporary values. Our government sees as its historical duty the opening of the horizons of our people by establishing a pluralistic and participatory democratic system based on tolerance and conciliation. Turkey, which is part of the changing world, will enter the new century as an exemplary and leading country on the one hand -- without losing its identity and national values -- and on the other, as a country which embraces universal values. Our government, with the belief that the state exists to serve its people, has announced this democratization and restructuring implementation plan fully aware of its responsibilities. We call on all our political parties, democratic organizations, and each and every one of our people to cooperate in the application of this package.
