The political affairs panel of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) held separate talks here this morning with the Liberal Party of Hong Kong and the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong in order to solicit their opinions on PWC's work. Wang said that the Basic Law has clearly stipulated that civil servants in Hong Kong may stay at their posts after 1997, adding that they do not have to state their political stand. He said that if there were some servants who wanted to quit their jobs, they should make a notice in advance according to the present practices so that others could be arranged to replace them to fill the vacancy. Wang said that the Basic Law has also clearly stipulated that the senior officials in the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central government of China. Therefore, he continued that there does not exist the consultation with the British side in appointment of the senior officials in the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
