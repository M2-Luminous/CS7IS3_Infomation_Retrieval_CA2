The letter was intercepted by the Tiraspol Security. It states that "Dniester faces a crisis situation affecting the economy, especially the industry, and the state administration. The shortage of cash made the revolted citizens take streets demanding the resignation of the corrupt government and Russian aliens who are to be blamed of people's impoverishment. A lot of employees of administrative and juridical organs are resigning. The 14th Army is not able to assure them with jobs. It can only morally support them. Firm measures taken by us would allow us with minimum effort to achieve the awaited settlement of the relations with Moldova. Regardless of all my reports on the situation, General Lebed [head of 14th Russian Army] refused my requests to take measures. Obviously, this is a underestimation of the situation." Bergman demands Lebed "the permission to take control over the situation in Dniester." Sources from the Security Committee say that "it is unlikely that the letter was written by Bergman, as its form and style do not correspond to the Chancellery norms of the Russian military units." However, the same sources say that the signature belongs to Colonel Bergman. Colonel Bergman denied that he wrote the letter. He called this provocation instigated by the Dniester Security Council. He pointed out that "such a letter could not be sent to the Russian Defense Minister by avoiding the 14th Army command."
