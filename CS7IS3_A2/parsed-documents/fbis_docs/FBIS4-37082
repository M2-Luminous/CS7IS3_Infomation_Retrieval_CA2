These currents are the Muslim Brotherhood, the radical Islamic groups (al-Jihad current), and al-Azhar. The differences between these three currents were pinpointed regarding their stands on the Copts, the class distinctions between the leaders and cadres in these three currents, the state and social institutions, relations with the outside world, and the organizational peculiarities of each of these currents. Regarding the differences, some of those who took part in the discussions were of the opinion that there are no differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist Muslim currents and that what the Muslim Brotherhood is currently claiming--that it rejects violence and accepts pluralism and democracy--is a tactical stand. This stand is based on the principle of dissimulation [al-taqiyah] which they adopted from the Shiite doctrine. Those who expressed this viewpoint were Dr. Majdi 'Allam, secretary of the National Democratic Party's youth branch in al-Jizah, and Major General Fu'ad 'Allam, who noted that the idea of accusing society of being blasphemous is being copied from what the Brotherhood's youth wing did in 1946. Shaykh al-Banna did not reject it, although he did point out that it is not in their interest to revive these ideas at this point in time, before the Muslim Brotherhood has taken control of the state, and he said that they should not provoke conflicts with the state while they are weak. These same ideas were revived by Sayyid Qutub during the early sixties. He leaked them from prison and they reached the Guidance Bureau. Qutub's stand was the same as that of the former imam. Therefore, there are no differences among the various groups, nor between them and the Muslim Brotherhood. The apparent differences are personal ones over leadership, or because one group indulges in infighting with another, or for reasons dealing with the weakness or strength of some group or the availability or absence of funding for it. Others believe that a distinction should be made between two things: The political approach and the actual behavior of the Islamic groups, with all their differences. Regarding the Brotherhood's political approach, we find that much of it is blasphemous. As for their current behavior, we find that they have moved away from violence. The Brotherhood and al-Azhar agree with the other groups with respect to their political lines, but differences remain in their actual behavior. Those holding this opinion were Dr. Jihad 'Awdah, head of the Research Center for International and Political Development; Dr. 'Ali Fahmi; and Alain Rousion [last two names as transliterated], head of the Sidage Center. On the other hand, the points of agreement between the Islamic movement's three currents were spotlighted, such as their stand on implementing the Islamic shari'ah, the rule of non-Muslims, assessing the West's political approach and economic dealings, and on general social and cultural factors. The three currents agree on implementing the shari'ah, setting up an Islamic caliphate, disdaining Muslim rule over non-Muslims, and being hostile to the West (by using hostile slogans), and on having economic dealings with the West as long as it is in the interest of the Muslims. The seminar concluded by proposing many ideas. The most important of these were: -- Finding a link between the growth of the Islamic movements in the Islamic world and funding coming from the oil-producing countries. This explains the reason why there is a similarity between the Islamic groups' thinking and the Pakistani and Wahabi ideas. -- By dealing with religious violence solely through oppression without looking into the social and economic issues, the state encourages increased religious extremism. Ambassador Tahsin Bashir supported this idea. -- Al-Azhar does not disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic groups on the level of jurisprudence, only on the mechanism for relations with others. -- The concept of al-shari'ah is vague and general. There is no such thing as al-shari'ah, but there is jurisprudence. Whoever talks about al-shari'ah is talking about a defined and strict regime that incorporates some ideas of jurisprudence and ignores others. It uses the former to govern with. This leads to the establishment of a theocracy which, according to jurisprudence itself, is contrary to true Islam. This notion was confirmed by Dr. 'Ali Fahmi.
