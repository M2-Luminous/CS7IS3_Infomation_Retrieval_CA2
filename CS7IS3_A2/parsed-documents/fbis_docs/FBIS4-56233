I feel like someone who has returned to his alma mater after graduation to see the friendly faces and hear the voices that helped him through every step of the struggle. I am very honored. I am a friend who has come to speak with the Honduran people. [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. Friends, you can now ask your questions and viewers can participate by calling us at 32-6074 and 32-5514. Mr. President, it is obvious that the topic of the moment, the issue that is being discussed by all Hondurans and even internationally, because it constitutes a big step for Honduras, is the change from obligatory military service to a voluntary and educational military service. We discussed it on this program last night with great satisfaction. What does this mean to you? At first glance it looks like the beginning of the fulfillment of campaign promises. [Reina] I am truly very pleased to have accomplished what I proposed during the campaign through a concerted effort and in a very serious, united way. We have not had any conflicts. There are, of course, some considerations that must be taken into account, although certain sectors refuse to do so. For example, what would happen if the voluntary military service fails to provide the number of Armed Forces troops required at any given time? I believe that issue has been properly addressed. Citizens have certain duties, and the state, during times of war and in accordance with the law, can find ways to draft those citizens whose duty it is to serve. But we cannot do it the way we used to recruit people. We all agreed on that point. No one agreed with our previous recruitment system because it had two defects: first, it was very rigid; and second, only the poor were drafted while the sons of the wealthy evaded the draft. That could not be viewed as justice anywhere in the world. That is why this step has been received with great satisfaction, and, of course, I am very proud. I congratulate the Armed Forces, the Honduran people, and the young people whose wishes I have fulfilled with this decision that began as a campaign promise and is today a reality in the National Congress. [Reporter] Why use adjectives such as social and humanism, Mr. President? [Reina] To be absolutely frank, those adjectives were suggested by distinguished officers as a means of complementing and enriching the document. The word social is used because the trend is to help the majority; and the word humanism is used because humanism is the prevalent doctrine at the end of this century. For instance, when we talk about fighting drugs and corruption and of making our measures humane, that constitutes humanism and meshes perfectly with the idea that our men, respecting our dignity, will defend their fatherland without the harshness that once marked recruitment. This position is humanistic, social, and educational because it will enable each recruit to improve his cultural heritage and because it is voluntary. [Reporter] What do you mean, Mr. President, when you say that military service will also be democratic? [Reina] I mean that democracy is not simply a matter of going to the polls. It is not a formality. It is a philosophy to live by. Every decision must be made with the objective of shaping a democratic man. A democratic man does not take advantage of anyone; he does not offend or violate rights. A democratic man accepts opposing decisions by those involved in a dialogue. He would never take arbitrary actions. Democracy as a way of life is perhaps the most important meaning of this work. [Reporter] Mr. President, today we heard different reactions to your decision from various, obviously important sectors. The most important reaction probably came from Defense Minister General Andino Flores. He virtually said that the Armed Forces had accepted the decision of their commander in chief, who is the president of the Republic. He implied very clearly, however, that the Armed Forces high command had not fully accepted the decision. He said that they acknowledge that the commander in chief, who is the president of the Republic, has the final world, but that they disagreed with the decision nevertheless. [Reina] I believe his terminology is causing some confusion. The Armed Forces said: We will accept the decision. We are nondeliberative. We are obedient, and this is the final decision. The defense minister himself will present the draft and explain the reasons for it. Gen. Andino Flores tried to explain -- this is my interpretation -- that the high command does not exactly share my views on voluntary service because obligatory service allowed the Army to have the number of troops the country would need at any given time. I wanted to stay between these two extremes. The Armed Forces say: We disagree but we obey. I do not see any contradiction. This confirms that the idea of a voluntary military service comes not from them but from the president of the Republic. [Reporter] Mr. President, can you tell the Honduran people that an agreement on this issue has been reached with the Armed Forces High Command? [Reina] Discussions were very open, very cordial. There were positions that from the beginning did not agree, but in the final draft we began to find this point of consensus. I believe this has been one of the quickest moves toward consensus. It is a truly historic act -- really momentous. It is a change, and changes of course deserve to be discussed. The parties should accept the resolution made by consensus. [Reporter] It was indeed an historic event. As you said tonight, there was a consensus. Today there was a meeting between a ranking officer and the National Party. What was the meaning of that meeting? Do you think it was necessary? [Reina] I think it was a political act. The issue is now at the National Assembly, the political forum par excellence where every option will be discussed. Some will insist that the draft must be obligatory. I have heard someone say that this contradicts citizens' rights. Nevertheless, I think the most important thing is to please the majority, which will be very satisfied with this great step forward. No more will we see young men virtually lassoed and forcefully drafted. I have always insisted on this. A heroic figure showed us how to win battles. Battles are won only by men who voluntarily defend their rights. [Reporter] Very interesting, Mr. President. You speak of winning battles. Let us talk about the country's economic situation. You spoke of giving the economy a human face, but the prices of many basic basket products have been raised. That is what the people resent most, particularly considering that you have been in office less than 100 days. What do you think about this? [Reina] Those price increases do not depend on the government. There is a mistake regarding the human face reference. At the Jose Cecilio del Valle building today we explained the nature of the Honduran Social Investment Fund [FHIS], which will reach every corner of the country, not as a social compensation, as it has been described, but as projects for a majority of the people. The idea is not to give things away to people but to help them intelligently and spontaneously develop their own communities. Now we will talk about boards of trustees, which have never really worked very well. The community and the government should participate in projects to benefit the people. Through a broad plan, FHIS will provide the human face we want for the government measures. We intend to reach all communities. If someone protests because beets or carrots are more expensive, he should remember that these prices do not depend on the government. The government could freeze prices, but that would be a risky move because there could be negative effects. The Honduran economy will improve when we produce more. We are laying the groundwork for higher production and for the people's health through food so basic grains are not absent from Hondurans' tables next year. [Reporter] Mr. President, your remarks about production are for the intermediate and long term. What about a short-term solution for the basic product price raises? [Reina] We could even freeze prices. I have selected an economic cabinet made up of the most capable Hondurans. We have no commitments to anyone. There are several important projects such as the Trujillo Bay and the cold storages, but we have no obligations. We are approaching these projects with free hands. A decision will be made about what is best for the nation. Prices remain as they are because we are in a very difficult situation. [Reina] The economic situation I inherited, as well as the nation's overall situation, has been truly dramatic. We will not be looking to the past. We want to look toward the future. When there is talk that we have not yet taken off, I want to say that the government has implemented a number of measures, including the historic measure on volunteer military service. Nevertheless, what we have not been able to do away with is the corruption that prevails in this country. We are committed to doing this. We will eliminate and overcome corruption. [Reporter] Peasant organizations that want to become productive are concerned about the fact that there has been an announcement saying credits are now available, but so far, these credits have not been issued to enable the peasants to work their fields. We also have reported that 10-15 days a [words indistinct] to the president of the Republic and the government for those credits to be released under very favorable conditions. [Reina] We are committed to this, and we believe we will fulfill this promise. I met with the peasant associations. They requested that land titles be granted in a more expeditious manner. We have issued pertinent orders for land titles to be delivered as quickly as possible. A large number of peasants will be issued documents that will given them full protection of their property. This is one of my campaign promises -- namely, legal security for all Hondurans. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. President, on the issue of corruption, we have heard of corruption charges against high-ranking members of your government -- for example, in the transportation administration, the transportation ministry -- that is, SECOPT [Secretariat of Communications, Public Works, and Transportation] -- as well as in INJUPEM [Teachers Retirement and Pension Institute] and PANI [National Children's Board]. It appears that these accusations have enough credence to at least look for people who are responsible. Do you believe such people should be brought to trial? [Reina] If they are not put on trial, we will have achieved nothing. The judicial branch was created to prosecute all criminal activities and to punish the guilty. On 10 May, I will hold a general meeting to analyze the way in which we have been advancing and uncovering illicit actions. The Commission to Prevent and Fight Corruption [Commission de Prevencion y Combate a la Corrupcion] will announce the specific cases -- of which there are many. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Humberto Garcia asks if one of the attractions of voluntary educational service is that a person will receive the minimum wage when he enters military service? [Reina] This has been one of the arguments used by men in uniform that has some validity; however, I have spoken to businessmen, economists, and labor experts, and this need not be the exact case. A minimum-wage increase would not solve the problem. The country will go bankrupt if we give a soldier who now earns 50 lempiras the minimum wage. We are going to try to improve conditions so that the people's cultural level can start to improve through education. The country will benefit from this improvement and the professionalism that it will bring to the Armed Forces. There is something very interesting. The Air Force and Navy do not have compulsory recruitment. The young people even wait in line to enter those services. Thus, we have taken measures to make the other services attractive too. [Reporter] You mentioned wages and improving the situation, Mr. President. Does this mean the Armed Forces budget will be increased? [Reina] It could come to that. However, what has been ordered for the time being is a reduction in the size of the government. The Armed Forces accepted this with great dignity, and it promptly cut 10 percent from its budget. [Reporter] What changes will this important event, which requires a constitutional reform and also concerns the Armed Forces, demand in the relations between the Armed Forces and civilian society? [Reina] It demands the total unification of Hondurans. It requires that everyone, civilians, religious people, laymen, atheists, and military personnel unite. It requires that everyone who lives in this country feel that, at the end of this century, the country has established a climate of security, peace, development, and harmony. We have to unify the Honduran nation. The Cold War -- we talked about the Cold War during our campaign -- divided and harmed us a great deal. I hope we will never return to such a situation. [Reporter] On the issue of corruption, Mr. President. Based on the charges made by the current government and the U.S. Senate pronouncements on corruption in Honduras, what is your opinion of the government organizations that are in charge of controlling this problem? [Reina] They have to be assessed. We will now have a prosecutor general who is going to be the nerve center of the entire, let us call it, government probity system. This, together with the general state modernization concept, is part of the new term. The modernization of the state will allow us to make a thorough assessment of the kind of government we have had. I said to you during my campaign: We want a state as close to normal as possible. The three elements of the state are territory, population, and government. Our territory has not been defined. We still have to define its coastal area. The population did not identify with the country, and the governments were not elected. Thus, we were a state that was far from being perfect. Today, we are starting to improve the government. We are going to evaluate all the electoral issues. We are going to review the way people are registered. We have advanced in this respect because now we all feel we need to improve the government's mechanisms. [Reporter] The Honduran people are plagued by high electricity rates and an energy crisis. When will Hondurans stop seeing their bills grow by the month? When will they see an end to electricity cuts? [Reina] The crisis involves more than just the rates because if we continue to have blackouts, the country could go completely bankrupt. That is the problem we are trying to solve first. Yesterday I received a very attentive, fraternal, and timely call from the Mexican president. He will give us....[pauses] He said this because on Sunday, engineers will leave Honduras to check the units he will give us. Each one has a 30-megawatt capacity. Those 60 megawatts will ease the situation considerably. This, along with an electricity interconnection with Panama and a possible interconnection with Costa Rica and Nicaragua, will help us overcome the crisis. The truth is that there are many shortcomings. First, all those who have robbed the ENEE [National Enterprise for Electric Power] [words indistinct] robbing water or energy. Second, rates have not been at the level the enterprise should have set. To give you an example, it is not right that someone who owns a hut in a shantytown pays the same rate as someone who lives in a luxury residential area. Part of the solution could lie in that difference in the possibility to contribute energy for everyone. [sentence as heard] I think we will work toward ensuring that the ENEE overcomes its crisis once and for all. Surprisingly, 190 million lempiras is owed to the ENEE. [Reporter] We have a list of many companies, including multinationals, that owe the ENEE. We do not understand why this was allowed to happen. We learned, through complaints made through the media, that people protest when electricity is cut when they owe 70 or 90 lempiras. [Reina] That is one of the irregularities. Callejas told me once: The situation at ENEE needs to be reviewed because it is the most poorly managed company in this country. I think there have been all sorts of problems there. There are people who act dishonestly by stealing energy but they are actually stealing from the people. We must stop this. This type of corruption must be eliminated not partially but at the very root. [Reporter] Mr. President, what responsibility do the engineers, boards of directors, and ENEE management during the previous administration bear for this new rationing? [Reina] That is where the commissions that were appointed to uncover corruption, tax evasion, embezzlement, and inefficiency come in. [Reporter] [Words indistinct]. [Reina] They could be held responsible if the negligence was very serious and punishable. [Reporter] What will your government do to collect the huge debt that companies and private citizens owe the ENEE? [Reina] As I told you during my campaign: Enforce the law. The law is not enforced here. [Reporter] When will you begin to enforce the [words indistinct]? [Reina] I think that it is already being enforced and there are already (?fugitives). Efforts are already under way to obtain pardons for these poor people. They say that the people should only be made to pay their debts. The issue here is not whether the person should pay, because anyone who commits a crime must pay for it. That is what people will find the most exciting and what will convince them of the new style of government that I have spoken about. [Reporter] Will you tell us about that in your next message? [Reina] My next message will be full of information. [Reporter] Mr. President, more specifically, will electricity rates be raised? [Reina] The decision belongs to the commission. We declared the emergency. We found the most capable people to handle the problem. It is up to them. [Reporter] International credit organizations have suggested that your government raise tolls and eliminate transportation subsidies. [Reina] [Words indistinct] I have always believed that tolls on alternate routes are a burdensome tax. Every driver has two alternatives: use a paved street or a gravel one. Either way, your vehicle is subject to a toll. That is how it is everywhere. Curiously, Hondurans will gladly pay tolls everywhere else and consider it normal, but they resist paying the tax at home. There are some exceptions, such as the distinguished city of San Pedro Sula, where everyone pays tolls willingly. I think that is why we should implement the measure gradually in the rest of the country. The problem is how to balance our budget and correct the deficit, how to overcome our concerns. Everyone trembles when representatives of international banks come to the country to collect, and we have a knife at our throats. One possible solution would be to privatize Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]. Such transactions, if they are not handled carefully, could turn out to be just another tragedy for the country. I will discuss all of these subjects later, such as the plans for an oil refinery in Puerto Castilla and a cold-storage enterprise. All of these plans, considered by an impartial arbiter such as the government, can give the country incentive and improve its image. We have received assistance from Mexico and Costa Rica because they have seen our country's democratic process and the strengthening of our institutions. [Reporter] Who authorized the refinery planned for Puerto Castilla? [Reina] It has not been authorized. [Reporter] No, it hasn't. Who made the deal? [Reina] The previous government. [Reporter] What is being done? [Reina] A commission has been appointed to check everything and to consult ecologists and businessmen so the best possible decision will be made for the Honduran people. Just like that. Great things are simple. Hidden things are a cancer, as I have mentioned several times. [Reporter] Who will decide which firm will conduct the environmental study and determine the pro's and con's of installing a refinery in Puerto Castilla? [Reina] We have to find the most capable firm. [Reporter] Who will make the decision? [Reina] The government. We have a very radical environment minister, and we have those with interests in the refinery who keep extolling its virtues. Both positions must be considered and a decision made. [Reporter] Personally speaking, do you have reservations about the refinery? [Reina] I think the ecologists might be right. If so, we would have to look for another location for the refinery. I am not sure about this because I am no expert. Many good things are mentioned in connection with this refinery, but no one would dare propose to make a deal with me for these things. I do not think anyone would dare make such a proposal during my term. [Reporter] What you say is very important. [Reina] Very important. [Reporter] Are you planning to privatize Hondutel? [Reina] We will open the debate. We will privatize it if necessary; otherwise, things will remain as they are. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What about your invitation from the U.S. President to attend the summit meeting in Miami in December? [Reina] It is a dignified invitation from the President of the United States. There are two big events coming up: one in Cartagena among the Latin American [as heard] heads of state, and the other in early December in Miami. We have been invited to the latter by President Clinton. I think these two events must become complementary. [Words indistinct] with President Gaviria and with President Figueres to begin establishing agendas for the two summits. Otherwise they could be repetitious. The two agendas could be topical. One could focus on the inter-American system, human rights, and drug trafficking, while the other could emphasize social development, national identity, and all forms of corruption that impede the development of democracy. That way we would make these two big summits complementary. They are important because they will be held at a time when the world is very much in favor of everything that contributes to unity. [Reporter] I wonder how this attitude can help Honduras? How could [words indistinct] benefit Honduras? [Reina] In the first place, the country that isolates itself is a country that fails and gets trapped in its own problems. Honduras has been one of the most isolated countries in the region. Hondurans have not been good negotiators. We have to change this attitude. I am surprised that within such a short period -- I only have three months in government, for example -- relations with Costa Rica are excellent. Costa Rica is not very inclined to integrate with Central America and has instead tried to join South America and even Europe. Now, with President Figueres we have very similar positions. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Why haven't subsidies been taken away from the transportation sector and given to farmers to produce more food? [Reina] If subsidies are taken away from bus owners, they will increase fares, and we will see buses being set on fire in the streets. It is not so easy to govern. Regarding food, the natural resources minister has drafted a plan that I hope will work. There will be enough basic grains for this year. [Reporter] What do you think about the warnings that some assembly companies are thinking about leaving the country because of problems with electricity rationing and the creation of labor unions? [Reina] Those companies could resolve the energy problem by [words indistinct]. I am sure their business can afford this and still profit. Regarding the labor union problem, these laws cannot be modified by any particular person. Laws cannot be superseded by contracts or agreements. Laws represent the interest of the state and are not negotiable on orders from anyone. If assembly companies want to take advantage of our low-wage labor force and our geopolitical location close to the great U.S. market -- because they know that it is profitable -- they must also help us improve the kind of assembly being done here by transferring technology through industrial contracts. I think this will come. It is just a matter of being patient. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What about commercial and diplomatic relations with Cuba? [Reina] I think this is one of the delicate issues that must be discussed at the summit meetings: the Cartagena one, in which Spain and Portugal will participate since it is the Ibero-American Summit; and the Miami meeting, which President Clinton has convoked. I think the system must find a democratic way out. An abnormal situation must not continue indefinitely. I do believe that whoever replaces President Fidel Castro must live in Cuba and be a charismatic leader inside Cuba. We must seek a democratic and peaceful transition. [Reporter] You would not establish formal relations with Cuba under Fidel Castro? [Reina] I will abide by whatever the inter-American system decides on this. [passage omitted]
