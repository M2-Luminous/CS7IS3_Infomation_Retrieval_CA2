The exercise drills to garner Muslim votes are increasing in the Congress Party now. This time around, they are trying to incarnate Ghulam Nabi Azad as the messiah of the Muslims. It is possible that Mr. Azad will be credited with the success in loosening the rules. This game will be played because the Muslims are upset. They will consider anyone who helps them rid of it their supporter. In this exercise to bring Mr. Azad to the front, many veteran Muslim leaders have been pushed back. Salman Khursheed, Aslam Sher Khan, Tariq Anwar, P.M. Sayyed, C.K. Jaffer Sharif, Ahmed Patel, Ammar Rizwi, Sibt-e Razi, and Asad Madni will have the role of Mr. Azad's associates. Meetings and conferences have been started to promote Azad's new image. He is being cheered in these meetings and conferences according to a strategy. The Congress (I), which was pushed away from the Muslims after the Babri Masjid incident, is eager to get back its old vote bank. The efforts are to develop one of its leaders as a Muslim sympathizer, so that his name can be used to attract votes during the next election. This leader will have to tell the Muslims at the time of the election what he had done for them. The hint will be that Mr. Azad and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had formed a similar policy. Mr. Azad is following the prime minister's instructions. He has also started various meetings. After understanding this whole game, other ministers like C.K. Jaffar and P.M. Sayyed have also become very active on this front. However, Ghulam Nabi Azad is in the forefront of this race to become the leader of Muslims. He has already sponsored two major conferences on Muslim problems. His major achievement was holding the conference of Urdu editors. The Urdu editors were greatly opposed to the Congress until recently. It is hoped that after this conference, they will be softened towards the Congress Party. These programs are organized in a way that the people do not suspect involvement of the Congress Party. Therefore, new faces are being pulled in for the success of these programs. Even the meeting organizers are not made aware of the plan to develop leaders. In order to keep the reality hidden from the people, leaders of other parties are also included in the program. This was especially kept in mind when holding meetings of Urdu editors and of the so-called ulemas (Muslim scholars). Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh, was invited to the Urdu editors conference. E. Ahmed, secretary of the Muslim League, and Abdul Samad Siddiqui, a Janata Dal leader, were invited to the ulemas conference. Mr. Azad announced in the conference that he wanted to have everyone with him and this conference did not have any thing to do with the Congress government. In the ulema conference, Mr. Azad was trying to prove himself to be more popular than non-Congress leaders. He called the non-Congress leaders to him for talks and had himself recorded on videos for this purpose. Efforts were made to raise the burning issues related to Muslims in these conferences. In both conferences, Mr. Azad raised issues showing he was not happy with the central government's policies. Mr. Azad went as far as to say that he did not care for his cabinet position when it came to resolving the problems faced by the Muslims. Taking the courage to say this clearly shows that his Congress bosses had given him the green flag to do so. It has been decided to bring the Muslim into the Congress fold for the elections. This can happen only when the problems faced by the Muslims are alleviated. The Congress is aware now that it must do something to reduce the problems faced by the Muslims before it asks for their votes, so that the Congress leaders can declare that the Congress had helped the Musims. Then Muslims will have to do a favor in return for this favor. Jaffar Sharif is not as successful in establishing himself as the leader of Muslims as is Ghulam Nabi Azad. Both of them spoke in the Urdu editors conference. Mr. Azad used sycophancy and emotions to deceive the Muslims. Mr. Sharif had to say in the end that he did not want to talk like Mr. Azad and lose sight of his goal. He spoke very emotionally. It was too much in the ulemas style. The whole Congress drama was fully rehearsed. The plan was to declare Mr. Azad the leader of all Muslims in the country. No one got wind of it before this. The information about this conference was privy to only a few people. Salamatullah had gathered people from here and there for this. The journalists were not informed about this conference. One major reason for not informing eminent leaders in the capital was to avoid their opposition to this plan. Mr. Azad has neither any importance among the Muslims nor is he called dishonest or deceptive like other leaders. In addition, the ulemas who were going to make this announcement were not well known. Salamatullah is known as a cemetery salesman and government broker. Still, these two leaders were declared the leaders of the whole Muslim community in the nation in the presence of a few bearded people. Another conference in this series was held to discuss education on 28 April. Mr. Azad was the guest of honor. Parliament Member Sunil Dutt was also invited, however, he did not attend. However, A.M. Khusro, chancellor of Aligarh University, M.N. Farookhi, vice chancellor, and several other professors and intellectuals expressed their opinions. This conference was also organized by Salamatullah.
