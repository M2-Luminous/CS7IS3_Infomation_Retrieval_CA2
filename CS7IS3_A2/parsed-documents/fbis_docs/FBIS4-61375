The Minister also spoke on the reasons why the meeting between the Armenian, Azeri and RMK representatives, planned to be held in Moscow on April 15, failed. According to Mr. Gukasyan, Azerbaijan caused the failure, by not accepting the Russian cease fire initiative. A. Gukasyan positively evaluated Jan Eliasson's work and stressed that the new CSCE Chairman realistically estimates the opportunities and demonstrates a constructive approach to resolution of the Karabakh problem. If he continues working in a similar manner, concrete results will be possible soon.

A plan on the initial stage of introducing CSCE observer mission was also coordinated during the meeting in Prague. Mr. Gukasyan stressed once again the importance of coordinating the Russian, CSCE and UN peace initiatives.
