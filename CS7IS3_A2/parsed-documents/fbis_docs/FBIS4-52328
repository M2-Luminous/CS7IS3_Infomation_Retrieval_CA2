A maximum of 60 percent of life companies' net profits can now be sent abroad, with some leeway permitted by the registrar of insurance companies, who is the department's director-general. Rapid economic growth helped enlarge the insurance market and some companies should invest more of their increased earnings locally, he said at the weekend. The department would not set a formal ceiling for the amount of net profit which a company could remit abroad. It would consider the issue case by case, he said. The move is aimed at the only foreign-owned life insurer operating in Thailand, American International Assurance, but Mr. Pracha denied that the company would suffer, saying treatment would be fair and would not affect the Government's policy of promoting foreign investment. Only five foreign companies had non-life insurance operations in Thailand, New Hampshire Co, Universal Co, Guardian, Commercial Union, and part of the AIA operation. These five altogether remitted around 100 million baht in profit to their head offices abroad. American International Assurance has more than 50 percent of the life insurance market in Thailand. From January to September 1993, about 216,700 of the total of 792,580 life insurance policies held by AIA clients represented 11.7 billion baht in premiums, compared with 24.2 billion baht for the industry as a whole. The AIA took 3.28 billion baht in first-year premiums for the first nine month of 1993 compared with 6.57 billion baht generated by all 12 life insurance companies in Thailand. In 1992 the company sent abroad about 700 million baht accounting for 48.5 percent of its total net profits. The company reported healthy growth in profits last year in line 17-18 percent for the industry overall. Mr. Pracha said he appreciated the AIA's apparent investment of large sums in the stock market, loans and property investment. Its investment was worth as much as 30 billion baht, but he would still seek greater local input by the company.
