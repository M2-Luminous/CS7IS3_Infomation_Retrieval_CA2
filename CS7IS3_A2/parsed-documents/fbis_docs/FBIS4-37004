The president asked the ambassadors to convey messages to his brothers the leaders of these states on developments in our country and issues concerning relations between our country and each of their states. In his messages, the brother president stressed that what is going on in Yemen is an internal affair in which no party should interfere in order to ensure that the conflict will not be prolonged and to spare further Yemeni blood. The brother president urged his brothers the leaders of the GCC member states to do whatever is needed to preserve the Yemeni unity and stability in Yemen which will be in the interest of the Yemeni people and strengthen security and stability in the region. He stressed that the Yemeni unity is an important and basic element for stability in Yemen and the region and embodies the Arab nation's national objectives and supreme interests. He also stressed that preserving this unity is a pan- Arab responsibility as much as a Yemeni responsibility. The brother leader noted the Republic of Yemen's eagerness to improve its strong brotherly ties with its sisterly GCC member states on the basis of mutual respect, good neighborliness, noninterference in internal affairs, and the positive cooperation that embodies the common aspirations of the Yemeni people and their brothers in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf.
