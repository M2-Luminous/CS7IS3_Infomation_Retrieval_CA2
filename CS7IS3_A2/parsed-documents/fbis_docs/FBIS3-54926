It is expected that the bloc will incorporate representatives of all parties and organizations which either did not contest the 12 December elections or failed to pass one of their stages. The parties affiliated with the New Russia bloc are an exception. In particular this bloc will apparently include the Russian Social Democratic Center, the Russia Revival Union, the SPT, the PT [previous two expansions unknown], the Russian Christian Democratic Movement, the Democratic Party Moscow branch, and others. The new bloc intends to contest elections to local power bodies.
