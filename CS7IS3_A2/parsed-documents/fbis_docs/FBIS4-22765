Could This Be for the Better?"] [Text] Last week, the Union of Journalists of Russia, the Glasnost Defense Fund, and the Committee in Defense of Freedom of Speech and Rights of Journalists held hearings on the draft Regulations on the Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting of Russia. The Federal Service, which was established by an edict of the president in December 1993, became the successor of the Ministry of the Press and the Federal Information Center. As the regulations show, it did not just inherit but also multiplied the functions of the two predecessor organizations. The text betrays a certain nostalgic desire to recreate some kind of Ministry of Propaganda. As the anonymous authors think, the new agitation and propaganda arm will not just control, verify, and issue and revoke licenses but also monitor off-budget funding for TV and radio companies and analyze the content of audio and visual materials, which may be interpreted as the introduction of censorship. The duties of the chairman are as specific as can be: The chairman of the Federal Service may directly influence the information policy of the state because he is granted the absolute right to appoint and dismiss the heads of all-Russian state broadcasting and regional TV and radio companies, as well as approve regulations on territorial TV and radio broadcasting services. This cannot fail to remind us of the rigid pyramid of the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting with its local committees still before the federal era! The new centralized organ is ready to extend its influence to independent TV and radio companies. As Igor Malashenko, general director of the NTV [Independent Television] independent TV company, put it, only the right to mint its own coins is not set forth in this "delirious" text. As is usually the case, such documents see the light of day under quite mysterious circumstances. The text of the regulations was discussed with bewilderment at a conference of chiefs of regional TV and radio companies; thereafter, it accidentally ended up in the committee for defending the rights and freedoms of journalists. It came out at the hearings that the authors of the regulations have not been found. The preparers did not wish to show up at the discussion of their own creation, either. So, it is still unclear who penned the document. The management of the Federal Service has stated that it has nothing to do with this opus. According to Kirill Ignatyev, chairman of the Subcommittee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the parliamentary Information Committee, Aleksandr Yakovlev said in a conversation with him that the draft regulations are actually the "typist's version." Apparently, the "typist" is the proverbial "fall guy" with whom Russians are so familiar. Representatives of the parliamentary committee, the court chamber for information disputes, state and nonstate TV and radio broadcasting companies from Moscow and the regions, experts, and journalists were of the same mind: The document contradicts existing legislation and broadcasting practices to such a degree and, in essence, violates the right to freedom of information that serious discussion of it is out of the question. However, the opinion on the regulations expressed at the hearings is, after all, emotional in nature, it is called upon to put the authorities on notice about what the community of journalists thinks. It does not at all mean that the Regulations on the Federal Service, which are "making the rounds" of Kremlin offices and, according to some information, collecting endorsements, will not become official. Their circulation may be a trial balloon floated in order to determine the attitude toward the maximum program, some details of which may later be abandoned. Therefore, it is premature to close the discussion, all the more so because participants in the hearing familiarized themselves with the draft of a new edict of the president, according to which the Federal Service should be abolished, along with the Committee for the Press. It is planned that a new Federal Information Service of Russia will be established instead of them which will coordinate the activities of newspapers, television, radio, information agencies, and publishing houses. If the draft edict is to be believed, it will be headed by the already mentioned Aleksandr Yakovlev. P.S. Early last week quite a number of other documents associated with television and radio were discussed at the Russian-American Information Press Center: the draft laws on television and radio broadcasting, on federal communications, on state protectionist measures with regard to the mass media, and on procedures for coverage of the activities of organs of state power by state-owned mass media. All of them drew many bewildered questions from those in attendance. To be sure, lawyers who were conducting this meeting "reassured" the audience: The Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting (as well as other legislative acts) will hardly be passed by the current membership of the State Duma. Apparently, television will have to exist, just as before, outside of the law. Who knows--it might be for the better, especially if we take into account the imperfection--to put it mildly--of most documents submitted to the public for judgment.
