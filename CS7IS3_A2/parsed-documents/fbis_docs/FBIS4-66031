At the same time, he called on the government to exclude Albania from all financing or aid supplied by the European Union. A statement issued by the KKE [Greek Communist Party] Central Committee Press Office stresses that there is concern over the fate of the Greek minority in Albania. The statement adds: Following the recent intervention by the United States in Greek-Albanian relations with its report on the issues of the Greek minority, nationalist and chauvinist circles have felt that there is freedom of action. The [Albanian President Sali] Berisha government has capitalized on U.S. intervention and support with the expansion of arrests of Greek Albanians. The KKE has protested the systematic attempt to spread instability in the Balkans and all those who support it by participating in or being driven to nationalist and chauvinist actions.
