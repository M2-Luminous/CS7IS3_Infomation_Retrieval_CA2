That means about one-fourth of the personnel. Yesterday State Secretary Sigve Brekke presented the Storting a report on reorganization in the military. This will be the greatest change any government sector has ever experienced. It is to be done without any dismissals. The officers' organizations are protesting, because the Ministry of Defense wants to eliminate the right to employment following graduation from the first level of the Defense School. This means that officers will only get permanent employment after they have been accepted to the second level. The Central Organization of Officers and the Norwegian Officers Union are reacting to the plan that makes officers only temporary employees for up to six years before granting them permanent employment. The defense chief and the Federation of Labor Unions are against this change. Officers enjoy particularly good conditions compared with other groups: full salary while in training, a right to a position afterward, and extremely good protection against losing one's job. Brekke said that with a restructuring of the magnitude the defense forces are now facing there has to be greater flexibility when hiring. 24,OOO Employed The defense forces have about 24,000 employees, which means about one-fourth must go. The Ministry of Defense is going to establish a resource organization to help each individual who finds himself superfluous in the transition. There will be a number of measures taken to stimulate departures. After the slimming-down has been completed, defense costs for personnel will have been reduced by about 1.6 billion kroner per year. In accordance with the long-term defense plan, these savings will be used to improve the standard of materiel. "I share the officers' view, and the consequences for the professionals' education worry me. Still, this is better than I had anticipated. I expected the government to suggest eliminating the right to a salary during training," Hans J. Rosjorde (Progress Party), chairman of the Defense Committee, said.
