FBIS3-5850 "dreas048__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-048-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 March 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI To Adopt Exports `Blanket Permit System' OW1103114394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1103114394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has decided the system of controlling exports of strategic materials, including machine tools which might be used for producing weapons of mass destruction, will be simplified successively beginning 1 April. Since the international system for controlling exports of nuclear weapons and missiles has been strengthened, many more items have now been placed under control. Therefore, MITI has decided to take this measure to lessen the office work of businessmen engaged in export, such as trading firms. In practice, a blanket permit system [hokatsu kyoka-sei] will be introduced for applications for exports to Western countries--those countries unlikely to become involved in conflicts. Once an application is approved, no further separate applications will be necessary for a period of three years. Moreover, procedures for applications will be simplified, and part of the permit-issuance authority will be transferred to local bureaus of industry and international trade. There are many varieties of materials and mechanical equipment which can be used for producing such weapons of mass destruction as nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons, and missiles; in addition to machine tools needed for producing nuclear weapons, there is equipment for producing rockets as well as carbon fiber and super alloys. Concerning the export of strategic materials, the international control system has been improved by such countries as Japan, the United States, and European nations. As a result, the number of items under control has increased, and the number of permits issued by MITI increased from less than 20,000 in 1991 to 80,000 in 1993. According to the blanket permit system, once the application is approved, individual applications for exports of materials under control will be exempted for a certain period of time. This system will be applied for a period of three years to applications for exports to Western countries which have joined international export control systems such as the Australia Group [as published] (participants in the conference on control of materials that can be used for producing chemical weapons), as well as applications for export for a period of two years to affiliated companies established in countries other than the United States and European nations with the capital of parent companies. MITI estimates that with the introduction of the blanket permit system, the number of applications for export permits will be reduced by about 60 percent. Moreover, the system of requesting preliminary examinations prior to the application will be abolished. Procedures for applications will be largely simplified and the examination period shortened. Moreover, the authority of issuing permits to applications for exports to those Western countries which are participants in the export control system will be transferred from MITI to local bureaus of industry and international trade hopefully beginning this fall. A blanket permit system will also be introduced for export of cargoes as well as for transactions in service based on the same contract. Presently in cases of applying exports of machine tools and programs for operating these tools, separate applications are requested for permits, even if exports are based on the same contract, because these permits are issued on the basis of different laws and regulations. Therefore, dissatisfaction has been voiced among those engaged in the export business.
