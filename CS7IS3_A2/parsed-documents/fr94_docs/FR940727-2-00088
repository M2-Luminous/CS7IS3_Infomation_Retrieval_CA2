If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) of certain shares of stock (the Shares) from certain individually-directed accounts in the Plan (the Accounts) to Lewis-Gale Clinic, Inc. (the Clinic), a party in interest with respect to the Plan. This proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) the terms and conditions of the Sale are at least as favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (2) the Sale is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Sales price for the Shares is based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (5) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic files Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan sponsored by the Clinic, a Virginia professional corporation owned exclusively by licensed physicians engaged in the practice of medicine. The Clinic employs 837 full-time and part-time employees of which 124 are licensed physicians. The Clinic services the Greater Roanoke Valley with a central location located in Salem, Virginia. The Clinic also operates various satellite clinics in towns and counties within a fifty mile radius of its primary location. 2. As of March 31, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $58,733,461 and 690 participants. The Plan permits each participant to direct the investments of his or her account among several funds including a fund commonly referred to as Fund F. First Union National Bank of Virginia (First Union) serves as trustee of all Plan assets except those held in Fund F. The board of directors of the Clinic serves as the trustee with respect to the Plan assets held in Fund F. 3. Fund F is designed to be invested exclusively in the common stock of the Lewis-Gale Building Corporation (the Building Corporation), which was incorporated on December 22, 1970. From the time of such incorporation until 1983, all of the outstanding common stock of the Building Corporation (the Stock) was owned exclusively by the physicians and certain administrative personnel. The primary purpose of the Building Corporation is to own and operate certain real property facilities which are leased to the Clinic and other health care providers for use in rendering medical services. 1 1 The Clinic represents that the Building Corporation is a real estate operating company within the meaning of 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(e). Therefore, with regard to any ownership by the Plan, the Building Corporation's assets are not considered plan assets. However, the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the underlying assets of the Building Corporation contain plan assets under 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(e). 4. As a condition to employment, each physician is contractually required to purchase a fixed dollar amount of the Stock. In 1983, the Building Corporation and the physicians, upon the advice of counsel, amended the Plan and the pre-existing stock restriction agreement to permit the Plan to acquire the Stock, thereby allowing the physicians to satisfy their contractual obligations to purchase the Stock by self-directing portions of their individual account balances into Fund F. 2 2 The Department notes that the decisions of the fiduciaries on behalf of the Plan, in connection with the acquisition and holding of the Building Corporation Stock are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subpart B of Title I. In this regard, the Department herein is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 of the Act which may have arisen as a result of the investment in and subsequent holding of the Stock. Because the Stock is not publicly traded, the Building Corporation values the Stock on an annual basis using its historic valuation formula under the existing stock purchase agreement between the Building Corporation and its shareholders. The valuation formula incorporates the fair market values of the underlying assets of the Building Corporation, which are valued annually by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser. The Building Corporation has consistently utilized this valuation formula to set the price per share for all sale and purchase transactions involving the Stock. Fund F has experienced an average annual rate of return of 11.3 percent, and investment in this fund is open to all participants in the Plan. As of May 11, 1994, Fund F held 16,413 shares (the Shares) of the Stock which represents approximately eighty-two percent of the issued and outstanding shares of the Stock. The remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Stock are owned by physicians and certain administrators. The terms of Fund F require a participant electing to invest in Stock to remain invested in Fund F until his or her death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment. Upon such occurrences, a number of shares of the Stock equal to the value of such participant's Fund F account balance will be sold back to the Building Corporation for cash and such cash proceeds distributed to the participant as a part of his or her Plan account balance. 3 3 The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the terms and conditions of Fund F violated any provision of Part 4, Subpart B of Title I of the Act.
