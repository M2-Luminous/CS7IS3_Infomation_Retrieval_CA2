Thank you for allowing me to interview you on behalf of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia [VGNUFC] radio. Here is my first question: Recently, the masses throughout the country were very indignant with Hun Sen for insulting His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk in a message dated 18 June 1994; what is your opinion on this matter? [Khieu Samphan] Thank you, comrade representative of the VGNUFC radio. Our nation and people know very well that it has always been His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's wish to bring about national reconciliation and to unite all Cambodian factions so that peace in the Kingdom of Cambodia can be restored. The king sees that the situation in our country has been steadily deteriorating. For a long time, he has repeatedly referred to this serious situation. If my memory does not fail me, he has talked about this situation since the end of 1992. Apart from his majesty, every simple Cambodian citizen has a duty to be concerned with and express his view on the destiny of his own nation. The king is even more duty bound toward and responsible for the destiny of the nation. The king clearly understands that there is only one way to get out of this desperately serious situation, namely, through national reconciliation. The king, therefore, has all along expressed his opinion on national reconciliation. He also proposed that a roundtable be held between Cambodian leaders; however, he was resolutely opposed by Hun Sen. Afterwards, he proposed that, since a roundtable was not feasible, at least there should be discussions and consultations. He offered himself to be the bridge so that meetings or consultations could be held to produce some results -- at least 10 or 20 percent. However, Hun Sen was still opposed to this idea. Hun Sen opposed roundtables and refused to meet with the Party of Democratic Kampuchea. Still, his majesty the king kept trying until there was the roundtable in Pyongyang, where a roundtable commission was formed to carry on the talks. Yet, Hun Sen was still working to sabotage the roundtable and the meeting of the roundtable commission. In that situation, still not satisfied with his efforts, the king granted a press interview in Beijing on 11 June in which he again mentioned the deteriorating situation of the country. He expressed the view that one cannot solve the problem through war, which can only cause death and destruction to the nation. He said that, in the face of such a situation, he could not remain indifferent and could not die with his eyes closed. Just because of that, Hun Sen wrote a letter dated 18 June to insult and disparage the king. Hun Sen said it was ridiculous of his majesty, out of hunger for power, to try and use the press to overthrow Hun Sen and call for demonstrations to topple him. Hun Sen then declared that he was categorically opposed to the formation of any national reconciliation government. Hun Sen reminded his majesty that the current Hun Sen was different from the Hun Sen he knew in the past, and he insisted that his majesty give him an answer, saying he was waiting for an answer so that he could take further action. It is regrettable that Hun Sen used such filthy language with his majesty the king. The king, at his advanced age, could easily be Hun Sen's father. There is no reason for Hun Sen to insult him like that. The king is a national leader, respected by both our people and the rest of the world. He has great experience in national government. What he did was only to kindly remind Hun Sen to open his eyes and see how grave our country's situation is and how seriously it is deteriorating. He merely asked for national reconciliation. There is no reason for Hun Sen to insult and disparage him in this way. Does he deserve to be a son of Cambodia, a minister, or a prime minister? Is there any justification for him to insult the king like that? He did not insult just the person of the king. He insulted him because he had asked for the cessation of war, for national reconciliation in line with the desire and need of our nation and people. Such a lese majeste, legally speaking, deserves severe punishment. Everybody knows how serious this offense is in the law of our country and the world. [Correspondent] In your opinion, why then did Hun Sen do what he did? [Khieu Samphan] Before answering this question, I would like to tell you that in my opinion our entire nation and people have the same view as I do. This is not just a question of Hun Sen insulting and disparaging his majesty. The substance of his majesty's statements, as I have already informed you, is that which is held by both his majesty and our entire nation and people. Therefore, this reflects the current conflict between two policies, two forces, in our country. On the one hand, there are the forces that continue to ignite the war and oppose national reconciliation; and on the other hand, there are the forces of our nation, people, and peace-and justice-loving countries in the world that want to see peace restored and national reconciliation achieved in Cambodia. In writing the letter to insult and disparage his majesty, Hun Sen overtly represented communist Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance in his opposition to the king, national reconciliation, peace, and the Cambodian nation and people. [Correspondent] As you said previously, in the 18 June letter, Hun Sen wrote that the current Hun Sen was different from the Hun Sen of the past, for this was a Hun Sen who demanded that his majesty give him an answer; and Hun Sen said he was waiting for an answer in order to take further action. In your opinion, what did Hun Sen mean? [Khieu Samphan] In my opinion, Hun Sen wanted to say that in the past Hun Sen was merely a puppet of communist Vietnam. Only communist Vietnam was his boss. No countries recognized the so-called State of Cambodia then and no countries recognized Hun Sen as prime minister. Now, following the signing of the Paris agreements, after the bad elements in the Western alliance have tampered with the Paris agreements, after the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] elections have been held, and after the bad elements in the Western alliance have colluded with communist Vietnam in conjuring up the two-headed government, Hun Sen has won the backing of both communist Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance as well as the recognition of the United Nations. Moreover, the bad elements in the Western alliance are giving him arms. It was for these reasons that Hun Sen was flexing his muscles and showing them to the king and others. Hun Sen threatened that if he did not get the right answer from the king, he would make a liberal use of his military and police forces. When he wrote that he was waiting for an answer from his majesty in order to take further action, Hun Sen meant to cow his majesty into stopping making statements about peace, the end of war, national reconciliation, roundtables, and the roundtable commission's meetings. If his majesty continued to talk about them, Hun Sen would take brutal action. In my opinion, this was not only a threat, an intimidation against his majesty. It was a threat, an intimidation, and an attempt to gag other parties and other personalities, including some ministers in the two-headed government who support his majesty, have the same opinion as his majesty, want to solve the problem peacefully, and want to end the war. In other words, Hun Sen wanted to intimidate and cow everybody with the use of brute force in the form of both the military and police forces. Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng undermined the roundtable, shut off the Democratic Kampuchea office in Phnom Penh, closed down newspapers, ordered their fascist policemen and soldiers to assassinate journalists, summoned journalists for harassment, and arbitrarily arrested, incarcerated, and shot people in Phnom Penh and the provinces. All these fascist actions were made to oppose national reconciliation and close the mouth and plug the ears of the people to prevent them from talking or hearing about national reconciliation so that communist Vietnam and the other bad elements in the Western alliance could jointly send in arms to carry on the war and destroy the Cambodian nation and people and Democratic Kampuchea. [Correspondent] If that is the case, what is the frame of mind of our Cambodian nation and people? [Khieu Samphan]) Hun Sen clearly upholds the banner of communist Vietnam, the banner of national treason, the banner of those who have sold out their nation against the king, the country, and the people. He upholds the banner of war, the banner of fascism, corruption, and oppression of the people. He orders the fascist policemen and soldiers to persecute, arrest, incarcerate, and slaughter the nation and people and allows Vietnamese immigrants to arrogantly grab our land and orchards, steal the fish in our rivers and lakes, rob us of our forests, take all our jobs, and seize even vending stalls in our markets. Our nation and people will surely fight back because they can no longer stand it. They are rising up and fighting. Our people refuse to live like a snake and die like a frog without struggling. The current situation is like a painful boil full of pus on the verge of eruption, with Hun Sen pricking it with a stick. Everybody knows that the students, teachers, civil servants, and even some ministers in the two-headed government want national reconciliation and oppose war. Our people oppose war. The soldiers of the two-headed government also oppose war. Everybody knows all about this. The foreign press in general is writing about it. The soldiers and even the officers of the two-headed government have told foreign newspapers that they no longer want to die in the place of Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng. What does all of this mean? Does it not mean that the soldiers of the two-headed government are opposed to war and those who have kindled it? The two-headed government can no long conscript soldiers. They have used fascist soldiers and policemen to surround villages and schools and still they cannot conscript many soldiers. The few who were conscripted later on deserted. Those who were ordered to go to the battlefields ended up deserting. Because it failed to conscript soldiers, the two-headed government issued a law mobilizing the militia. Yet, it could not mobilize as many of them as they wished. What can it mean other than that the people are opposed to war? Moreover, the para troops [former non-communist resistance fighters] of Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del have become very frustrated. They were integrated into communist Vietnam's puppet army and placed under the command of communist Vietnam's puppets in the most ignominious manner. Communist Vietnam's puppets have only contempt for them and treat them like their running dogs. Communist Vietnam's puppets have ordered them to fight and die in their place. When they refuse to fight, communist Vietnam's puppet leaders shoot them dead. Their wives and daughters at home have been raped and their cattle stolen. Some soldiers of Prince Ranariddh who had no land to stay on and no huts to live in once occupied a piece of land at O Bek K'am in Stoeng Meanchey [a Phnom Penh suburb]. Prince Ranariddh together with Hun Sen, Sar Kheng, and Yu Hokkri dispatched artillery pieces, small arms, and armored cars to surround and kill them. Now the para troops of Prince Ranariddh, like those of Dien Del, have been almost completely disbanded and decimated. When Prince Ranariddh and Dien Del tried to conscript more para troops in Oddar Meanchey, Thmar Puok, Preah Net Preah, and other places, they met with a stiff resistance from the people. No one wanted to join them any more. The anger of Prince Ranariddh's and Dien Del's para troops has seethed for months, and now with Hun Sen insulting and disparaging his majesty no one at all wants to become a para soldier of Prince Ranariddh or Dien Del. The former para troops are returning to their hometowns and an increasing number of them are joining the people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea in the struggle to defend their villages and hometowns. In conclusion, our nation and people oppose war and want national reconciliation. Hun Sen is upholding the banner of communist Vietnam and the bad elements in the Western alliance in igniting the war. Our nation and people vigorously oppose them. Their fate is sealed in the history of the ages. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do you have something else to add before ending this interview? [Khieu Samphan] I would like to recall and emphasize the position of Democratic Kampuchea as follows: Democratic Kampuchea is the victim and not the instigator of war. Communist Vietnam is the instigator of war. It sent hundreds of thousands of its troops to invade Cambodia at the end of 1978. Recently, it colluded to form the two-headed government and it combined forces to attack Democratic Kampuchea in Stoung, Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and other areas while Democratic Kampuchea merely exercised its right to self-defense. Although it has a complete right to self-defense, Democratic Kampuchea has continued doggedly to seek meetings and talks so as to reach a better mutual understanding with others and gradually find common points in a move toward realizing national reconciliation and securing sufficient national forces to solve the nation's major and minor problems. All of this is because Democratic Kampuchea clearly understands, as his majesty has already pointed out, that war means death, the death of not just a few people but of the entire nation and people; it means racial extinction. This is because the war gives an opportunity for Vietnam to send massive numbers of its people into Cambodia to swallow this country up. Therefore, only with national reconciliation can the nation survive. Achieving national reconciliation, as an important personality in Phnom Penh said, is like boring a hole in a piece of wood. You cannot make the hole just by merely placing the drill on the wood; you must drill it little by little until the drill is through. This means that just a couple of rounds of talks or negotiations will not make national reconciliation. We need more meetings and consultations. I firmly believe in the force of our nation and people. I believe that the force of national reconciliation will surely prevail. The truth about this has been proven by history. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to interview you today. Before taking leave of you, I would like to wish you the best of health and success in your lofty patriotic mission. Thank you.
