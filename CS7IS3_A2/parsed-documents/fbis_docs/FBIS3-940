He said the decision, effective immediately, followed a United Nations General Assembly session in October last year which expressed its concern about the indiscriminate way in which landmines caused the maiming and death of innocent civilians in several countries. "South Africa is in the forefront in the world in the field of anti-mine measures and mine-tracking abilities, but the availability of our anti-mine equipment is hampered by international armaments sanctions. The effective use of mine resistance armoured vehicles such as the South African-developed Mamba can protect and save peace-keeping forces from being maimed. Several countries such as Bosnia, Mozambique and Angola could benefit from our assistance and equipment," Mr Coetsee said.
