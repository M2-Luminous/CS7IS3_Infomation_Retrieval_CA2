Hnatyshyn Thursday to discuss promoting bilateral relations. Kim and Hnatyshyn shared the view that their nations can cooperate closely in various fields and agreed to forge a "special partnership." Hnatyshyn conveyed his government's decision to waive visa requirements for Koreans entering Canada for no more than six months, and Kim expected that the move will boost bilateral exchanges. Kim explained that Seoul is studying ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully while acknowledging Canada's support for his government's position. Hnatyshyn noted that Ottawa will continue to back Seoul's stance. They agreed that the domestic reforms in the two nations pushed by their new governments will ultimately contribute to the development and deepening of bilateral relations. Canada, with its abundant natural resources and advanced technology, and South Korea, which possesses human resources and expertise in manufacturing, have complementary economic structures and should thus develop practical links. Hnatyshyn, the first Canadian governor-general to visit, arrived in Seoul earlier in the day at the invitation of President Kim and is scheduled to stay here until Monday. Kim hosted dinner for Hnatyshyn Thursday evening.
