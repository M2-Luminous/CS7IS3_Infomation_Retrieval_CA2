Evenor made the comment after meeting with Central Bank of China Governor Samuel Shieh. During the meeting, Shieh briefed Evenor and other Nicaraguan officials on Taiwan's economic development over the past four decades. Shieh said Taiwan has developed from an agricultural economy with a per capita income of US$100 to a high-tech, export oriented economy with per capita income topping US$10,000. He added that Taiwan performed its "economic miracle" by concentrating on the development of labor-intensive light industry, and switching to technology-intensive industries once a strong industrial base had been built. Shieh advised Evenor to take economic development slowly and stressed the importance of education in making the transition from an agricultural to industrial economy.
