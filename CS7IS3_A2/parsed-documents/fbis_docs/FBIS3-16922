According to him, the situation is being especially dramatized in order to divert people's attention. He stated this during a visit to an agricultural fair on the territory of the All-Russian Exhibition Center, our correspondent Marina Chernukha reports. At the same time Aleksandr Rutskoy remarked that anything could be expected in the present situation, but he declared that, God forbid, he should again go through events like those of October 1993. Aleksandr Rutskoy is convinced that the situation in the country can be put right; what this needs is to ensure the control of the state, to determine the priorities of the development of the economy, to create stimuli for their realization, and to observe the laws.
