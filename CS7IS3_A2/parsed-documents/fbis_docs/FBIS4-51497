Nineteen representatives, whose actions were incompatible with their role, have resigned and the two parties -- FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] -- have proposed new representatives: 13 from FUNCINPEC and six from the CPP. Despite the agenda, some people have expressed concern that this issue could raise problems during the examination of the validity of the representatives. It has not yet been definitively agreed how this will be done. There is, however, a hint that the names of the representatives will be read and then adopted. Some people are not satisfied with this method, saying that this is not truly democratic. They want to discuss each new representative. It seems that some new representatives would cause problems. Let us wait, however, and see when the meeting takes place. Following is the list of names of the outgoing and incoming representatives: Outgoing representatives: FUNCINPEC 1. Duong Khem (Phnom Penh constituency), currently governor of Banteay Meanchey Province; 2. Tep Nunnari (Takeo constituency), currently governor of Prey Veng Province; 3.
