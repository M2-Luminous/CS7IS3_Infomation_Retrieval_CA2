Where do we begin? [Sexto] Well, Rodriguez just pointed out to me, so I will begin, that an invitation has been extended for a dialogue. I take this invitation as an effort by our country to build a bridge for the Cuban community abroad. This is not the first time that our country has tried to build a bridge. We recall that Cuba also tried to establish a bridge for Cuban exiles in 1978. Cuba tried to maturely understand their situation. It tried to give to that community its value and role within our history, within our set of problems, and within our then current situation. [Roque] And that strengthens the idea of a family reunion. [Sexto] Indeed. Cuba has also tried to reunite the Cuban family. It has sought a reunion, which is one of the essential causes for maintenance of the migration level in our country. That is, since the first years of the Revolution, there has been a migratory chain of relatives. This has been one of the causes of a continuous emigration over the past years. The Revolution has tried to resolve this problem of distance and separation of family members. Everyone must remember that this was attempted in 1978, and if not premature, I believe there were neither objective or subjective conditions to make this dream come true. [Roque] What we are certain about is that the Cuban Government has always favored reunion of the Cuban family. It has always been said that there were not the conditions here for receiving many of those people who wished to be reunited with their relatives. But the willingness, the idea that this existed, has always been on the negotiating table. At least I think willingness existed in 1978. [Rodriguez] I also think that in a way, the Cuban family has always been a hostage of the Cuban-U.S. conflict and policy. [Roque] Well, that is another subject we are going to discuss later. [Rodriguez] Well, yes, it is another problem, but this idea of being hostage to a policy, namely the U.S. hostile policy toward Cuba, represents a wall, a curtain, a barrier against family reunion, because the United States has used the migration issue as a spearhead against the Revolution. Undoubtedly, when a relative of yours is on the opposite side of the idea you defend, or the cause you defend, a disruption takes place within the family. But today I think we are reuniting many families divided for political reasons, families that have adopted different political stances after being separated. But this is not happening for the first time now, during this revolutionary period. It also happened during the Spanish period. There were families, well, Creoles of Spanish descent, who broke from one another because they defended different positions. Later, during the era of the Republic -- or during the pseudo- republic as we call that period of successive governments of representative democracy -- many families were also broken up for political reasons. I think the time has come to end this political disruption in family relations because with greater respect within families, with greater respect for the ideas each might hold, without humiliation or offense, the families with varying points of view can be reunited. [Sexto] I believe, Osvaldo, that except for the people who could have left the country for true political reasons, the rest of our exiled people have misinterpreted that policy or have had a mistaken idea about it. That is, Cuban exile is eminently economic. The Cuban exile who goes to the United States, the principal immigration center of America and the world, obviously seeks to improve his well-being. But to migrate to that country, he is forced to adopt a different stance, because as you have just said, the emigrants have been hostages of the U.S. policy against the Cuban Revolution. The United States has politicized immigration because right now the best means of going to the United States is by assuming a political stance against the Cuban Revolution. For instance, today it is very difficult to obtain a legal visa to enter the United States from Cuba. It is very difficult for you to be granted a visa to legally settle down in the United States. However, if you get there on a bicycle, on a raft, or a barge, you are immediately and automatically admitted into the United States because you are considered a political refugee. [Rodriguez] I would like to give you a little example of this. Not long ago I heard a casette tape, sent by a boy who had to migrate from one country to another until he reached the United States. But in the United States he had to make remarks against Cuba to be admitted. He sent this casette to his relatives, expressing regret that he made those remarks. He said: If my friends who know my way of thinking had heard my remarks, they would definitely think that I am a dishonest man. [Roque] Friends, we are discussing the invitation for a dialogue with the exile community from 22 to 24 April in Havana. I think we can discuss the ideas currently prevalent among Cubans and the exile community on this conference. [Rodriguez] I believe there are some who think this step is being taken because of a crisis situation in the country. I have heard some clear statements in this regard: that this decision was made because the country is in crisis. I do not believe the crisis has anything to do with the reunion, with the normalization of relations. In fact, the possibility of normalization had been much discussed before the crisis. Moreover, as Sexto just said, talks with the community in the United States, and with the entire community abroad, began in 1978. These talks were aborted because of the enemy's activities. My opinion is that we should not expect this community to help us economically, although it could happen. But the objective is not for it to help us economically. I think the normalization of relations with Cuban exiles is a human right, a right of the family. If I am a Cuban who decided for any reason to migrate to another country, I must be respected as a Cuban, just as I must respect my country's government and the decision of the majority of the people. It is that respect that is being sought. But I think the invitation read by the foreign minister is very clear. There will be no talks about this or another political system. The discussion will deal with the civilian and legal situation of the exiles. This must be made very clear because the invitation itself is clear in this respect. I think it will be broadly discussed soon. [Sexto] I do not think Cuba will be talking with the political exile community. Cuba will speak to the economic exile community. The economic exile community is a world phenomenon. This is what we are talking about. We must clearly note the difference between a political and an economic exile. Of course the political exiles will not be present at that conference because the political community is an organization which leaves the country with the intention of returning to impose the reestablishment of its party and its class, to restore the government or the power it had lost. That is what characterizes the political exiles. This can be clearly seen within the Miami community. There is a political community, which fights day after day -- fights, talks, kicks, and moans. It cries in the hope of returning to reimpose its idea, to reassume the government. They do not care about the interests of Cuba or of the Cuban people. They only care for their political interests. Those who will come in April are economic exiles who left the country to improve their well-being, to find ways to fulfill their aspirations and talents, but who wish to maintain a link with their people. The Cuban by tradition is patriotic. It is appropriate that this community maintains its language, its traditions, its culture. They must be respected for this, and given consideration. A link must be built between them and us. No political matters will be discussed. These people will not demand power. They will not come to ask the working class for power. They are not coming to ask the Communist Party for power. They are not coming to ask Cuba to sacrifice its national interests. They are coming to ask for what we can give them: understanding, ties with their relatives, ties with their country, and ties with their culture. [Roque] We are getting to the end of the program, and we must reach a conclusion on this invitation to the conference. But are the Cubans, the Cubans who are here, aware of the times that are coming, of this exchange of ideas, of this rapprochement with the community that lives not only in the United States but throughout the world? [Rodriguez] I think our people have been politicized. They have a fine understanding of what could happen. They are aware of the possible outcome. When you speak with a worker who has a lower cultural level -- the lowest level for us is the ninth grade -- speaking with workers, we realize that they are aware of what is happening. They are also aware of the fact that the policy on migration has changed because we know one another better. The idea we have on migration has also changed. [Roque] Do you not think that changing the idea of those who are on the other side might also change the U.S. policy imposed all along concerning the Cuban economic and political situation? [Sexto] It is possible. It is possible, but this is not the time to prophesy anything. It could be a pressure element forcing the United States to reconsider its policy. I think we Cubans who are on this side must be aware that many Cubans who are on the other side are also changing their ideas on the situation. They are becoming aware of the false idea they had that forced their migration. We must also admit and recognize that we cannot continue ignoring the U.S. policy toward Cuba, which has taken the migration issue as a pressure and propaganda element against our country and its interests. We must admit that, except for that political sector of the exile community that is fighting to return to this country as a conqueror, the rest are true Cubans who by right deserve to have an affective link with their people. [Rodiguez] Well, answering Roque's question on the nation and migration, and what could be said about it, I think we Cubans comprise a single nation. We will always be a single nation regardless of where our citizens live. This has been demonstrated by that community in Miami that has not allowed itself to be affected by another society. [Roque] I wish to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto for their participation in this discussion on the invitation for dialogue with the exile community that will be held in Cuba in April, 1994.
