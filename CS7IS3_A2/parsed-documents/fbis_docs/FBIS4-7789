From today, Adria's aircraft may fly from the FYROM only on regular flights to Slovenia and back. Air crews are allowed to stay overnight in Skopje. The FYROM is demanding from Slovenia the same conditions for its air passengers [sentence as received]. In a liberally minded way, Skopje and Ljubljana have until recently been promising great tolerance in reciprocal business and other contacts, especially in trade. Over the past few months, however, there have been an increasing number of obstacles to business between the two economies with each wanting to make a profit off of the other. [passage omitted]
