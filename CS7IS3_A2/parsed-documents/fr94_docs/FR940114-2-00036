FR940114-2-00036 FR940114-2-00021 [Project No. 2514&hyph;003 Virginia] Appalachian Power Company; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment January 10, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new license for the existing Byllesby-Buck Hydroelectric Project, located on the New River in Carroll County, Virginia, near the city of Galax, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA). In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that licensing the project, with appropriate environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. For further information, contact Jerry Ziewitz, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219&hyph;3157. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
