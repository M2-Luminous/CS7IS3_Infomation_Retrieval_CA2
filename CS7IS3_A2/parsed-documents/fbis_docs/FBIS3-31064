Establishing and preserving balanced relations with our neighbors is one of the main directions of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] efforts. Promoting historical conciliation with those neighboring countries with which Hungary's relations have become tense is the most urgent task, Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, member of the MSZP's national committee, and the MSZP's foreign affairs spokesman said at an expert debate on the MSZP's foreign policy program organized by the party's Central and Eastern Europe Section on 10 February. The program states that it is expedient to sign a basic agreement with Slovakia and Romania as soon as possible, and work has to begin on placing Hungarian-Serbian relations on new foundations. We have to continue to extend our relations with Croatia and Slovenia and, in the case of Ukraine, further efforts are needed to achieve practical results after the issue of national minority rights was settled in an exemplary way in an agreement. According to the program prepared by Kovacs, guaranteeing the country's security is the primary goal of Hungarian foreign politics; foreign policy also has to ensure that Hungarian intentions are not viewed with suspicion. From the point of view of regional stability, the MSZP finds it indispensable that an effective supervisory mechanism be established within the framework of the Council of Europe, and that sanctions be defined that are to be used if the norms defined as conditions for Council of Europe membership are violated. It is Hungary's obligation to promote through all suitable means, and by avoiding measures that are open to misinterpretation by our neighbors, that the individual and collective rights of the Hungarian national minority living beyond the border are constitutionally guaranteed, and that they prevail in practice. Out of the region's countries not neighboring Hungary, we have to pay special attention to Russia. The MSZP considers it essential that NATO plays a role in establishing the region's stability, and in the MSZP's view, this stability would be best served by giving identical security guarantees to all countries in the region, Kovacs emphasized. It was stated at the debate that, as a matter of fact, after 1990, Hungary's scope for maneuver in the area of foreign politics has been greatly extended. According to Kovacs, we also have to see that certain developments have been unfavorable for the government: Hungary's original advantage has ceased to exist, and it is also a fact that governments that are unable to cope with the economic and social problems tend to divert the dissatisfaction in the direction of some kind of domestic or foreign "enemy." Therefore, according to the socialists, Hungarian foreign policy cannot be one-sidedly made responsible for the increased tension around the country. However, ambiguous statements, the expressions of a sense of mission that aggravate the neighbors, the frequent repetition of historical grievances, and the occasional emergence of irredentist behavior in the government parties have all further fueled the tensions -- this is how Kovacs summed up the Antall- government's foreign policy. In his view, it was a general mistake to ignore the need for harmony between the priorities, namely Western integration, the establishment of adequate relations with the neighbors, and improving the situation of the national minorities.
