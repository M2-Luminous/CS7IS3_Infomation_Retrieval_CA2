Mr. Selami declared that DP has won 66.4 percent against 18 percent of the previous elections, in Greshice 67.7 percent against 17 percent against of the previous elections, in Gracan 66 percent, in Rec of Diber, the DP won 55.7 percent of votes, while in Zallherr of Tirana they will hold a second round of elections. Tritan Shehu, DP secretary general, and Ali Spahia, DP deputy chairman, were also present in the press conference. The DP, declared Mr. Selami, has made significant progress in these elections, while the SP is marking decreases. The comparison of the results is the best proof of the elections. The votes which the electors cast for the DP candidates will encourage the DP to implement strictly its program. Mr. Selami said that the program of the democratic government is one of the most successful of Eastern Europe. The elections of the May 29th were the best answer for those political forces, which have had the new elections their political motto since March 1992. Mr. Selami considered the victory of his party as very important also for the continuation of the reform. The success has also been a result of the realistic campaign conducted by DP, it had in an open dialogue with the people. Referring to the SP [Socialist Party] press conference on May 29 and its declaration, Mr. Selami said the facts revealed in it are not true. "I have stated," said Selami, "even before the results of the elections that if there is any violation of rules, competent bodies will adopt the necessary measures." Mr. Selami said that for violations noticed in two zones, responsibility should fall on the electoral commissions, whose chairmen were members of the SP and not of the DP, and unfortunately they have created conditions for mis-interpretations and tensions. Mr. Selami considered the focusing of the attention on the Nano question as a factor which has influenced in the loss of SP. He said that in all the meetings he had had with people of the remotest communes, he had never been asked about Nano case. The SP conducted its electoral campaign to defend Nano, which according to Selami, was a question which made them aim at a wrong target. Answering the questions how he considered the lower results of the SP, Mr. Selami said that SP policy has been a tensional and nihilistic one, which served those who are in trial, mentioning here the case of misinformation by the socialist press and also the cases of insults and offense towards the leaders of DP. Asked about the non-participation of DA [Democratic Alliance] in the elections, Mr. Selami said that DA happened to be in the Albanian political life due to the stolen mandate of DP. While on the insignificant victory of the other political parties, the DP leader said that Albania will continue to have for a certain period of time the system of two big parties, while the other parties will have it difficult to find their way.
