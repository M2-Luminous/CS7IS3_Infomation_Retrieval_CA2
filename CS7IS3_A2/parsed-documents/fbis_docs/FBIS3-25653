Claassen] [Text] Postmasburg Feb 23 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk was struck by a crumpled paper flag and stick while speaking to a crowd dominated by vociferous African National Congress [ANC] protesters at Postdene near Postmasburg in the Northern Cape on Wednesday. The incident went largely unnoticed. ANC supporters had been ripping paper flags glued to wooden sticks from National Party supporters' hands, and tearing or crumpling them. One of these was thrown at Mr de Klerk from behind, hitting him on the neck. There were a few minor scuffles as security men hastily ushered Mr de Klerk's party out of the area. Mr de Klerk said afterwards: "One continues to be shocked by ill-mannered and ill-directed leaders who prevent a leader from addressing his followers. "It is proof of a chilling fact: the ANC has lost control over its youthful followers." He said all those who shouted and jeered at him at Postdene were youngsters. "I think it is high time that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] now focus on one of its two main tasks, namely to prevent intimidation." The IEC's other task was to manage the election. Mr de Klerk said case upon case of sheer intimidation had been brought to the attention of the IEC, with affidavits on specific incidents, but no action had been taken as they were "too vague". "Today I have been witness to people issued with official ANC flags, placards and banners disrupting a legal meeting of NP supporters." He said if the IEC needed a witness, they were welcome to contact him. "They have the fiscal powers and I call upon them to use these powers."
