The question which exists today is about this unjustified delay in [passage indistinct] brother Lakhdar Brahimi's meetings. We have accepted brother Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative to hold talks with the other side without conditions, and it became clear to his excellency and to the world that the other side was the one which was putting conditions [passage indistinct]. Once more, we accept the contents of the Security Council's statement in an immediate cease-fire and the holding of unconditional talks under the auspices of the United Nations. At the same time, we do not want our acceptance to be taken either by the Security Council as a reason to postpone taking the necessary measures to implement its resolution, nor by the international sides to postpone recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was established to stay, and which our people have sacrificed hundreds of martyrs to defend it [passage indistinct], or for our acceptance to be taken as usual to give more time to the Sanaa regime to continue usurping our lands [passage indistinct] and our vital installations. This aggression [words indistinct] Arab and international community. The presidency council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen felt proud and exalted by this steadfastness which the history of our region has never witnessed anything similar, the high morale and the readiness to offer sacrifices [passage indistinct] aggression.
