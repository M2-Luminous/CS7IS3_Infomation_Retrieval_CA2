Applicants argue that the ability of Funds to sell their respective shares directly to Plans does not create a ``senior security'', as such term is defined under Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, with respect to any Contract owner vis-a-vis a participant under a Plan. Regardless of the rights and benefits of participants and Contract owners under the respective Plans and Contracts, the Plans and the Accounts have rights only with respect to their shares of the Trust. Such shares may be redeemed only at net asset value. No shareholder of any of the Funds has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends. 23. Finally, applicants state that there are no conflicts between Contract owners and participants under the Plans with respect to the state insurance commissioners' veto powers (direct with respect to variable life insurance and indirect with respect to variable annuities) over investment objectives. The basic premise of shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree that there are any inherent conflicts of interest between shareholders. The state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest those monies in another fund. To accomplish such redemption and transfers, complex time consuming transactions must be undertaken. Conversely, trustees of Plans can make the decision quickly and implement redemption of shares from a Fund and reinvest the monies in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments or, as is the case with most Plans, hold cash pending suitable investment. Based on the foregoing, Applicants represent that even should there arise issues where the interests of Contract owners and the interests of Plans conflict, the issues can be almost immediately resolved because trustees of the Plans can, independently, redeem shares out of the Trust. 24. Applicants state that various factors have kept certain insurance companies from offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. According to Applicants, these factors include: The cost of organizing and operating an investment funding medium; the lack of expertise with respect to investment management (particularly with respect to stock and money market investments); and the lack of public name recognition of certain insurers as investment professionals. Applicants argue that use of the Funds as common investment media for the Contracts would ameliorate these concerns. Participating Insurance Companies would benefit from the investment and administrative expertise of MFS as well as from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds. Applicants state that making the Funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts such as the Contracts which will then increase competition with respect to both the design and the pricing of variable contracts. This can be expected to result in greater product variation and lower charges. Thus, Applicants argue that Contract owners would benefit because mixed and shared funding will eliminate a significant amount of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds. Moreover, Applicants assert that sales of shares of the Funds to Plans should increase the amount of assets available for investment by the Funds. This should, in turn, promote economies of scale, permit increased safety of investments through greater diversification, and make the addition of new portfolios to the Trust more feasible. 25. Applicants believe that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Additionally, Applicants note the previous issuance of an order permitting mixed and shared funding where shares of a trust were sold directly to qualified plans.
