The 64-year-old chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) shared former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's vision of a welfare society. However, he was strongly opposed to Hosokawa's surprise proposal in February to introduce a "7 percent national welfare tax" on grounds the coalition parties were not consulted first. The tax plan designed to partly finance tax cuts was scrapped the day after Hosokawa announced it. Ouchi once called for a tie-up with Hosokawa's Japan New Party and new party Sakigake (Harbinger). He also said he favors a multiparty system but less than the current number, along with the coalition's leading Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] and new party Sakigake, while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the alliance's two core blocs, are urging coalition partners to consolidate into one party to fight the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Ouchi, however, joined a new parliamentary group called "Kaishin" (Innovation), which was formed at his suggestion hours after Tsutomu Hata was elected new prime minister. The group comprises members of Shinseito, the Japan New Party of Hosokawa, the DSP, the newly established "Jiyuto" (Liberal Party) and Kaikaku-no-kai. Together with other right-wing members who quit the former Socialist Party to found the DSP in 1960, Ouchi is known as a formulator of centrist policies. In 1976, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time from a Tokyo constituency. After serving four consecutive terms in the lower house, he lost his seat in the 1986 election, despite holding the DSP's No. 2 position of secretary general. He recaptured his seat in the lower house and took office as chairman of the DSP. In last year's general election, he was elected for the sixth time.
