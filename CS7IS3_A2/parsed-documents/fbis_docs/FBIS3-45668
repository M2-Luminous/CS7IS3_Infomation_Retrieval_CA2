Vice Governor Wen Shizhen presided over the meeting. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important speech, entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Strengthen Leadership, and Strive To Effect Sustained, Rapid, and Sound Development in Liaoning's Economy." Gu Jinchi pointed out: At present, the province is confronted with the following opportunities at least in accelerating reform and development. First, although the commencement of the series of state reform measures in finance and tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade will inevitably bring us some difficulties and clashes, these measures, when viewed from the point of view of overall interest, will be favorable to the province's development, and, in particular, will bring us an extremely good opportunity to invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, to renovate old industrial bases, to readjust the structures of industries and products, and to develop foreign economic relations and trade. Second, at present the investment made in China by foreign firms, in particular by some large foreign enterprises and financial groups that enjoy high popularity and have solid strength, is gradually moving northwards, the state strategy for developing the Bohai Economic Circle area has been carried out further, and the economic exchanges and cooperation among various countries in Northeast Asia have become closer and closer. All these have provided the province with an extremely favorable opportunity to further expand the scale of opening up and to energetically develop an export-oriented economy. Third, although the new economic growing points defined by the province have witnessed relatively good progress over the past few years, there is still tremendous potential. And, these new growth points may enter the market rapidly, thus constituting an extremely good opportunity to develop the province freely. Fourth, the market network that has already been shaped throughout the province's urban and rural areas, and, in particular, the market of means of subsistence, which ranks among the country's best in business volume and popularity, have provided extensive and very convenient market conditions for the province's textile, light industry, and foodstuff trades, which are in dire straits. Gu Jinchi said: It is not our purpose to understand opportunity. What is important is to seize the opportunity to develop ourselves. This is the only way for us to gain even greater initiative amid the waves of the new round of reform and opening up. This year, we should emphatically achieve marked results in the following three aspects: 1) Enterprise reform, the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in particular; 2) rural reform; and 3) the building of market system. We should correctly handle the relations between reform and development, between speed and efficiency, between key projects and non-key projects, and between economic work and political work and should strengthen and improve leadership over economic work in order to provide a powerful and effective political guarantee for accelerating the province's economic development. Gu Jinchi stressed: To effect a rapid progress in Liaoning's economy, we should pay attention to the following issues: First, we should firmly embrace the idea that development is the only essential criterion. Second, we should firmly embrace the new ideas and new concepts that are suitable for the socialist market economy and should be brave in and good at obtaining and creating even more favorable conditions for economic development. Third, we should firmly embrace hardwork and the pioneering spirit of making unremitting efforts to improve ourselves and should combine the spirit of being daring to try and go ahead with the scientific spirit of seeking truth and doing concrete work. Fourth, all professions and trades should consciously submit and orient themselves to the central task of economic construction and give rise to a joint force to grasp economic construction in order to promote the rapid development of the province's economy. Attending the meeting were leaders of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, including Yue Qifeng, Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo, Xu Wencai, Xiao Zuofu, Cong Zhenglong, and Gao Guozhu.
