At a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, the students made their letter public. In their letter, these students and scholars said: Withdrawing China's MFN status would not only hurt the Chinese people's interests but also American enterprises' business interests and opportunities in Chinese markets as well as American general interests in Asia. They "firmly support the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status" and held that "the MFN should not be linked to human rights." A total of 722 Chinese students and scholars signed their names on the letter. They are mainly from several universities in the United States. Some students and scholars are studying in other foreign countries.
