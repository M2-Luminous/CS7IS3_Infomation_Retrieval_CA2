He also sought approval from the Women's and Young Workers' Problems Council to add to the equal job opportunity guidelines provisions to urge employers not to discriminate against women in job recruitment and in the workplace. The ministry hopes to put the measures into effect in April following their expected endorsement by the panel, ministry officials said. The changes could affect 14 million female office workers, the officials said. Sakaguchi wants maximum overtime hours for women raised from the current 24 hours per four weeks to 36 hours. The additions to the guidelines would call on companies to stop allocating a specific share of jobs to men and women in recruitment and to refrain from other practices that discriminate against women workers.
