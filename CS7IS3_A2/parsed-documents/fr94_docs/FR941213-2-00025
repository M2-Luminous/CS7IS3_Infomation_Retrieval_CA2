FR941213-2-00025 FR941213-2-00016 [Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000] State of Louisiana Office of Conservation_Geopressured Brine Gas Well Determinations (FERC Nos. JD94&hyph;04615, et al.); Order Granting Withdrawal Request and Notice of Preliminary Finding Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. Issued: December 6, 1994. On August 2, 1994, in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000, the Commission preliminarily found that five well determinations by the Office of Conservation for the State of Louisiana (Louisiana) are not supported by substantial evidence. 1 Louisiana's determinations find that gas produced from the five wells qualifies as natural gas produced from geopressured brine under section 107(c)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). 2 1 68 FERC ¶ 61,186 (1994). 2 The five wells are the Edna Delcambre # 1 (JD94&hyph;04615), the Exxon Fee # 13 (JD94&hyph;06209), the Exxon Fee # 16&hyph;Alt (JD94&hyph;06208), the Exxon Fee # 18&hyph;Alt (JD94&hyph;06207), and the Exxon Fee # 24 (JD94&hyph;06206). On September 6, 1994, WRT Energy Corporation (WRT), the applicant before Louisiana, filed a letter withdrawing its applications for the five wells. By letter dated September 9, 1994, the Commission advised WRT that the withdrawal nullified the applications and Louisiana's determinations and terminated the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000. On September 19, 1994, WRT asked the Commission to allow it to withdraw its letter filed on September 6, 1994, and, if necessary, to reinstate the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000. WRT states that it withdrew its applications because it believed that it would not have sufficient time to effectively respond to the preliminary finding but that after it withdrew its applications, it became aware that staff would allow WRT additional time to file comments. Subsequently, WRT and Louisiana filed comments urging the Commission to reverse the preliminary finding on October 5, 1994. In addition, an informal conference was held on October 26, 1994, and WRT, Louisiana and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOCC) filed comments urging the Commission to find that gas from the five wells qualify as geopressured brine gas on November 4, 1994, November 8, 1994, and November 4, 1994, respectively. Pursuant to §275.202(d) of the regulations, the letter WRT filed on September 6, 1994 nullified both the determinations and the underlying applications on that date. 3 However, since WRT states that it withdrew the applications due to a misunderstanding and has filed additional comments to support the applications, for good cause shown, we grant WRT's request to withdraw the letter filed on September 6, 1994, so as to reinstate its applications and Louisiana's determinations as of the date of this order. However, inasmuch as the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;00 has been terminated, the Commission will process the determinations, and underlying applications, in a new proceeding and hereby makes a preliminary finding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000, pursuant to the procedures previously set forth in section 275.202(a) of the regulations, that Louisiana's determinations for the five wells are not supported by substantial evidence in the records upon which they were made for the reasons stated in our August 2, 1994 Notice of Preliminary Finding. In addition, the record in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000 is included in new Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000. 3 Order No. 567, issued on July 28, 1994, rescinded the Commission's NGPA's regulations, including Section 275 as of that date (68 FERC ¶ 61,135). The Commission stated, however, that rescission of Part 275 is prospective only and that timely filed applications for well determination proceedings still pending before the Commission will continue to be subject to the requirements of Part 275 as that section existed before July 28, 1994. The Commission will issue a final order in Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000 no later than 120 days from the date hereof. Since the final order will consider the comments filed on the August 2, 1994 preliminary finding and the comments filed after the informal conference, WRT, Louisiana and the IOCC need not file additional comments. By the Commission. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30533 Filed 12&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
