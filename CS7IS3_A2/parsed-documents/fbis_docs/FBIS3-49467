Geza Jeszenszky's ideas, which he outlined before leaving [for the Prague meeting], have been summed up by Jozsef Barath. [Barath] The series of meetings in Prague and the negotiations of leaders of the Visegrad states with President Clinton and with each other will strengthen the cooperation of the Visegrad Group members -- cooperation which derives from the shared fate of the Central European countries. This was said by [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky at his news briefing, which is still in progress. In the foreign minister's view, the Partnership for Peace is one of the important stages on the road to NATO. The current NATO summit is similar in significance to the decisions in Copenhagen last summer on the long-term possibility of joining the European Union. Geza Jeszenszky emphasized that the current summit dispelled anxieties about the possibility that NATO's function might cease. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has fulfilled the security vacuum which has developed in our region, he said. The foreign minister welcomed President Clinton's confirmation that the United States has important interests linked to Central Europe. The 16 NATO states pledged their support for NATO's expansion.
