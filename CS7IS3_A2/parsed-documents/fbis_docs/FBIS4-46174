Tiraspol officials gave the opinion on the local radio that the attempt on the prosecutor's life was advantageous for Col. Bergman, commander of the military division, who was earlier under investigation. The commander of the 14th Army declared that the attempt was probably organized by Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), as the Dniester prosecutor had authorized the arrest of Limanskiy, ex-deputy chairman of the Slobozia District Soviet.
