They started their official duties by examining documents and records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing them with on-the-spot field studies. The inspectors will change the batteries and film of surveillance equipment and seal some areas where necessary. Storage of used nuclear fuel will also come under investigation.

At present, nine nuclear power stations are operating in South Korea.
