Juppe arrived here this morning to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in preparation for a foreign ministers' meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva. Before his discussions today with Juppe, Christopher said: "The best kind of a settlement is one the parties agree on." His spokesman, Mike McCurry, added a footnote to the remarks. "It's our view that imposing a settlement on the parties is not the best way to bring it about," McCurry told a state department daily briefing. The United States also rejected French and European suggestions that the international community relax sanctions against the Serbian Republic to encourage the Bosnian Serbs to cede some of their captured territory. Instead, Washington is calling for tougher sanctions and enhanced enforcement of those already in place. "There is a strong argument to be made for increasing the pressure of sanctions, either by increasing their scope, or if not that, at least their enforcement," McCurry said. France, along with other European Union contributors of troops to the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia, has threatened to pull out if there are no prospects of a political settlement. "It's a question of weeks, maybe some months, but it will not be possible to have a new winter in Bosnia," Juppe said. "The time has come for a peace settlement, there is no military solution for Bosnia," the minister said. France has some 6,000 troops on the ground in Bosnia. During the conflict, 21 of them have been killed and more than 300 wounded, reports said. Members of the United Nations are trying to avert an escalation of violence in Brcko, another potential hot spot in Bosnia, which has seen an increase of troops and weapons by all three warring sides. The United States has pinned the major blame on the Serbs for the two-year bloody war and is sympathetic to the Muslim-led Bosnian government. The Muslims are apparently resisting a settlement for the time being in hope of rolling back some of lands conquered by the Serbs, who now control some 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We think it's reasonable for the Bosnian government to hold the view that a cessation of hostilities agreement that doesn't have a sunset or doesn't expire at some point might run the risk of keeping in place current lines of confrontation, which then makes a peace settlement much more difficult to achieve," McCurry said. The Geneva meeting will involve Christopher and Juppe, as well as foreign ministers from Russia, Britain, Greece, and Belgium.
