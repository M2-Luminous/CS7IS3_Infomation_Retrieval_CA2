FR940705-2-00167 FR940705-2-00091 In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions do not take into account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual investigators and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment procedures and to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures. Section III. Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines This section describes five categories of experiments involving recombinant DNA: (i) Those that require RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;A), (ii) those that require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;B); (iii) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III&hyph;C), (iv) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see section III&hyph;D), and (v) those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see section III&hyph;E). Note: If an experiment falls into either section III&hyph;A or section III&hyph;B and one of the other categories, the rules pertaining to section III&hyph;A or section III&hyph;B shall be followed. If an experiment falls into section III&hyph;E and into either sections III&hyph;C or III&hyph;D categories as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the NIH Guidelines. Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be initiated without the express approval of NIH/ORDA (see Minor Actions, section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2) and its subsections). Section III&hyph;A. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and NIH Approval Before Initiation Experiments in this category are considered Major Actions (see section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1)) and cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838, the publication of the proposal in the Federal Register for 15 days of comment, reviewed by the RAC, and specific approval by the NIH (not applicable for Expedited Review single patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M&hyph;VI). The containment conditions for such experiments will be recommended by the RAC and set by the NIH at the time of approval. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already approved are included in Appendix D which may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Section III&hyph;A&hyph;1. Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms that are not known to acquire the trait naturally (see section V&hyph;B), if such acquisition could compromise the use of the drug to control disease agents in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture. Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2. Certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see section V&hyph;U) shall be considered Major Actions (see section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1) and Appendix M&hyph;III), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public review. The requirement for RAC review shall not be considered to preempt any other required review or approval of experiments with one or more human subjects. Relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board reviews and approvals of the proposal should be completed before submission to NIH. Certain experiments involving deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects may qualify for the Accelerated Review process (see section III&hyph;B&hyph;2). Certain categories of experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects and that are not covered by section V&hyph;U, may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see section III&hyph;C&hyph;7). Section III&hyph;B. Experiments That Require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before Initiation Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1. Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD 50 of Less than 100 Nanograms per Kilogram Body Weight Deliberate formation of recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD 50 of less than 100 nanograms per kilogram body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, and Shigella dysenteriae neurotoxin). Specific approval has been given for the cloning in Escherichia coli K&hyph;12 of DNA containing genes coding for the biosynthesis of toxic molecules which are lethal to vertebrates at 100 nanograms to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight. Specific experiments already approved under this section may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1&hyph;(a). Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH/ORDA. The containment conditions for such experiments will be determined by NIH/ORDA in consultation with ad hoc experts. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section IV&hyph;B&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1)). Section III&hyph;B&hyph;2. Accelerated Review of Human Gene Transfer Experiments As determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, certain categories of human gene transfer experiments may be considered as Minor Actions and qualify for Accelerated Review and approval (see section IV&hyph;C&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2)&hyph;(a), Appendix M&hyph;III&hyph;A, and Appendix M&hyph;V). The RAC Chair will present a report of all NIH/ORDA approved human gene transfer protocols at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. If NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for the Accelerated Review process, the Principal Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review " 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled RAC meeting (See section III&hyph;A&hyph;2).
