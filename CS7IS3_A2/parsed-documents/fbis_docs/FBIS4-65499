Did not something go wrong? [Weizsaecker] I would like to mention two things right at the beginning: First, our foreign policy's speedy, responsible, and successful seizing of the historic opportunity and, second, my conviction that, despite all the difficulties and mistakes regarding the need for financial resources and time, we will, in the end, successfully solve the great task of unification. At the beginning it looked as if only the Germans in the east had problems. Now the west, too, is struggling for jobs, just to mention the most important example. It was difficult enough for the eastern Germans to learn that they had to change their way of thinking day by day. Now the western Germans, too, must learn something. This brings us closer together. In my view, there was one clear mistake. In winter 1989-90 there was widespread and profound readiness in the west for solidarity and material sacrifice, which was, unfortunately, not made use of. Instead, the state financed the enormous transfers preferably through gigantic debts. It is very difficult today to cope with this. The community spirit of the citizens, which in a democracy is so vital and does not make itself felt so often, unfortunately did not encounter an active political partner. [STERN] Did unification not take place in the style of an occupation? [Weizsaecker] Large supermarkets with western goods, banks, and political parties, looking for votes.... [STERN] ....marched into the eastern laender. [Weizsaecker] No. Of course, this was not done militarily. However, everybody was looking for his own advantage, just as is done on the market and among competing parties. There is no point in criticizing this. The people in the east want the market economy instead of the old, mismanaged state economy. However, they do not want to see their entire life, with its values and goals, defined overnight by the strength of their elbows or by prices. In addition, of course, they wanted pluralism in terms of party policy instead of the coercion of a single party. And this cannot be had without competition for power. However, the struggle should be conducted visibly for a better solution of the problems and not just for power for the sake of power. One must also mention the unfortunate issue of property. The Germans in the east read in our constitution that property entails obligations. Many of them, however, think that in practice property only entails rights. How can one harmonize the two legitimate sides of this matter? [STERN] Today prominent Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union politicians disparage Bonn's policy of detente in the 1970's and 1980's as collaboration with the GDR regime. You yourself have always been an advocate of this policy and were actively involved in it. [Weizsaecker] I was and still am convinced that two things had to be linked: A firm attitude above any doubt by the West, on the one hand, and a clear and credible policy of detente on the other. If today we are sometimes confronted with the bold theory that the policy of detente prevented or at least delayed unification because it contributed to consolidating and prolonging a long ailing system, this is historical nonsense. [STERN] In 1983 you were the first mayor of West Berlin to talk to Erich Honecker. Then in 1987 you received him on an official visit in Bonn. Do you regret shaking his hand? [Weizsaecker] No. In particular as mayor of Berlin I, like my predecessors, considered it our special task to make the division more bearable for the people while it existed. In particular here in Berlin, in the divided city, everyone could see every day that our political command was to make the inhuman wall more permeable and to humanize the cruel border regime. Therefore, it was our duty to talk to the people who were in power on the other side. I do not regret it at all that I did that. [STERN] GDR politicians such as Modrow or Berghofer, who helped to ensure that the upheaval happened without bloodshed, are politically degraded now. Do you think this is right? [Weizsaecker] Even peaceful revolutions bring about human injustice and wrong generalized judgments. In many states of the former Soviet sphere of influence we are today cooperating with old communists, who essentially contributed to the reforms at some time or other for more or less ethical reasons. The course of the upheaval gave us no opportunity to find out to what extent there were similar serious reform forces in the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]. However, I would like to recall that some people in the SED who thought in a humanly responsible way contributed to the great and difficult task of ensuring that the endangered mass demonstrations took a peaceful course, for instance those in Leipzig on 9 October 1989. [passage omitted] [STERN] Hitler's shadow still hangs over Germany. Your most important speech was probably the one on 8 May 1985, the 40th anniversary of the end of the war. You were the first president to call this date a "day of liberation," saying what many Germans think, but at the same time many people blamed you for it. Have we really overcome Hitler? [Weizsaecker] Let me first comment on the criticism: Among other things, I said that at that time, when the crimes were being committed primarily against the Jews, many of us, also in my generation, who were young did not open their eyes and ears wide enough to get more information about the terrible things that were happening. Not just a few people took umbrage at this statement of mine. I was told that I had failed to recognize the good faith of the overwhelming majority of the German people. [STERN] But the core of your speech was that 8 May was a day of liberation. [Weizsaecker] That is what I said and I stick to it firmly. In my speech I added clearly -- and I repeat it today -- that, naturally, I was fully aware of the fact that for a great number of people misery and the loss of their homes came only after 8 May 1945. However, this terrible suffering must not be blamed on 8 May but on what happened beforehand and, in particular, on 30 January 1933. May 8 was for us all the liberation from the unbearable Nazi regime. [STERN] Are you worried about the rising xenophobia and neofascism? [Weizsaecker] The great majority of Germans are immune to that. However, under no circumstances should we delude ourselves with carefree security. Nor should we reassure ourselves with the fact that some other countries are struggling with even worse phenomena of this kind and that there is hardly any nation in the world that is pleased to make room for large numbers of foreigners. We have every reason to be particularly vigilant. Our difficult past remains a lesson forever. The murders of Solingen and Moelln have deeply shocked and shaken us. Irresponsible slogans propagated at restaurant tables can be a dangerous seed. In addition, too many young people are left to their own devices, often without job prospects and without orientation. They are easily tempted by political rat-catchers and are easily misled to commit acts of violence even if there is no visible political program behind such deeds. [STERN] Do you not believe that there is a real, hard neo-Nazi core? [Weizsaecker] Yes, there is core, even though it is difficult to say how hard it is and what "real" means in this connection. Regarding programs, the scene is rather misty. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of people who write letters in a far more aggressive and brutal tone -- also to me -- and give their full name and address. This did not happen 10 years ago. Increased vigilance is necessary not only in politics and the administration but, above all, among the citizens, in the communities and towns themselves. And there one must note with great satisfaction that there has been a sharp increase in positive, democratic activity and vigilance. The many chains of light were the most visible sign of that, but they are not by far the only good signals. [STERN] Abroad the change in the political climate is, however, watched with the greatest suspicion. Do we Germans actually have to press to participate in celebrating the 50th anniversary of D-Day? [Weizsaecker] I have already said regarding 8 May 1945 that such days have a quite different meaning for different people. It is good for us to think about what such anniversaries mean among ourselves. I still hold this opinion. The profound reconciliation with France, Britain, and the United States that has taken place over the past decades is not in danger because of this. [STERN] Recently there were serious disagreements between France and Germany, at the core of the Western alliance. Does the new Germany have a solid foreign policy concept? [Weizsaecker] Our situation is characterized by the fact that, after Russia, we are the country in Europe that has by far the most inhabitants, is located centrally, and is surrounded by nine neighbors. In the past we were severely punished for every attempt to follow a special national path. Our central interest, which is perhaps greater than in most other European countries, is that the period of nation states is overcome and is replaced by a common European concept. We need and want security around us, open borders for trade, and the insight and ability to make responsible contributions to the survival of man and nature. This is no idealized altruism, these are our interests. At peace with our neighbors we were able to complete the unification of our state, but all around us we are watched with tense attention to see whether we recognize the concerns that others had and still have about us with the necessary sensitivity and allay them with our behavior. [STERN] Recently one has gained the impression that this sensitivity has been lost and that we are suddenly once again acting with a diplomacy that runs along the lines of "hello, now it is my turn!" [Weizsaecker] Of course, there are better and worse days, also regarding the impression that we sometimes give outside Germany. All in all, however, there is positive clarity about us also among our foreign policy friends, allies, and interlocutors. Furthermore, sometimes we are subjected to rather contradictory criticism. For instance, every time we make propaganda among our partners for strong and clear support of the reform forces and countries in the East, these partners have repeatedly told us: If you consider this so important, then do it yourself. However, as soon as we do do it -- and we have done it to a greater extent than other Western countries -- the next criticism comes immediately, namely whether we are not going it alone again with these support measures and seeking to ensure monopoly advantages for ourselves. One must cope with that, and we manage to do it. The core of our European policy is and remains the close friendly cooperation with France and, step by step, also a trilateral cooperation between France, Poland, and Germany. [STERN] You are one of the last active politicians of the war generation.... [Weizsaecker] ...almost the last. [STERN] Experience cannot be transferred to others. Does one have to fear that your generation's immunity to militarism and antidemocratic thinking will be lost? [Weizsaecker] Indeed, every generation has its own experience. This will determine its attitude along the lines of its convictions. However, the Germans' relations with their neighbors have changed fundamentally compared with the time of my youth -- despite all current concerns and difficulties, they have changed in a historically incredible, very impressive sense. The key thing is not when we get a common currency in Europe and whether we are already on the path toward a European federal state. Rather, the key thing is that the states that make up the European Union no longer settle conflicts by force, as in the past, but by coming to a common understanding and that the democratic nature of this entire European Union has been secured. The great historic change compared with the past is the fact that we in Germany are able to follow this path together with the others. And I see the strength to do that in the young Germans.
