FR940512-2-00087 FR940512-2-00053 Competitive Impact Statement Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA or ``Tunney Act''), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h), the United States submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry with the consent of Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. in this civil antitrust proceeding. I Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding On April 26, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint, under section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 25, against Tele-Communications, Inc. (``TCI''), and Liberty Media Corporation (``Liberty'') (collectively ``Defendants''), alleging that the proposed merger of Defendants violates section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18. TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States in terms of subscribers, and Liberty is one of the largest MSOs. Pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994, TCI and Liberty agreed to merge. Combined, TCI and Liberty would have financial interests in cable systems accounting for more than 13 million subscribers, or approximately one-fourth of the nation's cable subscribers. The combined firms would also have substantial financial interests in a large number of providers of video programming to multichannel subscription television distributors. The Complaint alleges that the effect of such combination may be substantially to lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, by: 1. Decreasing actual and potential competition among video programming providers, because the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to discriminate with respect to access to its cable systems, or the terms and conditions of such access, in favor of its affiliated video programming providers and against unaffiliated video programming providers. 2. Decreasing actual and potential competition among multichannel subscription television distributors, because the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to deny to competing multichannel subscription television distributors access to its affiliated video programming services, or to provide such access only on unreasonable terms. On April 26, 1994, the United States and Defendants filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger. The proposed Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, would enjoin Defendants from discriminating against unaffiliated video programmers with respect to access to its cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors (``MSTDs''), and from discriminating against other MSTDs with respect to its programming providers, where such discrimination results in an unreasonable restraint on competition. The United States and Defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. II Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation A. Description of the parties and the proposed transaction. TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States, with financial and management interests in cable systems serving more than 10.2 million subscribers. TCI also has substantial interests in direct-to-home satellite delivery of multichannel subscription television service, with both a substantial C-band satellite business and a partnership interest in Primestar Partners, L.P., a Ku-band satellite multichannel subscription television service. TCI also has financial and management interests in programming services such as The Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, E! Entertainment Television, Request Television (pay-per-view), Home Shopping Network Inc., QVC Network Inc., Starz, Rocky Mountain Prime Sports Network, and Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. (which provides Cable News Network (CNN), Headline News, The Cartoon Network, TBS and Turner Network Television (TNT)). Liberty is a large cable MSO, with financial and management interests in cable systems serving 2.9 million subscribers. Liberty also has financial and management interests in a wide range of programming services, including Black Entertainment Television (BET), The Box, Courtroom Television Network, Encore, Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network Inc., QVC Network Inc., Prime Sports Network and more than a dozen regional sports channels. TCI and Liberty intend to merge pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994. Together TCI and Liberty will serve more than 13 million subscribers, or about a quarter of the nation's cable subscribers, and have financial interests in a wide range of programming services, including a number of the most popular and widely-carried services.
