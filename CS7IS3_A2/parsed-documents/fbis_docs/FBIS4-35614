I am very happy to take part in your session today. (?You have opened) your session as usual; from the beginning, since the formation of the Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front, you have been working hard for the restoration of security, prevention of disturbances and clashes, and for the consolidation of peace in our beloved Islamic country, Afghanistan. You have again opened this grand session with this sacred aspiration [passage indistinct]. Under the present circumstances yet again we need more action and more efforts, especially from our brothers and our esteemed ulema -- those who are aware and have honest feelings in particular under the present circumstances. We must take faster steps along the road for the restoration of peace and security and increase our efforts and action. In regard to the current situation and solution of the problems, I would like to raise a number of issues with you, esteemed brothers [passage indistinct]. Of course you are aware of the political and military situation of your country. You know why the fighting flared up? Where was the problem? What were the causes of the clashes and destruction? I have said time and again, and I emphasize again that the Islamic government which is in charge now has not grasped power through a military coup and has not usurped sovereignty by conspiracy. You know yourself that a number of decisions were made prior to the collapse of the previous regime in Afghanistan. Decisions were made by the esteemed leaders, a number of whom are with us in the present difficulties. A number of them as onlookers see the events from far away and a number of them are standing in the trench of hostility against the Islamic state and their own people and they put Kabul city and other regions under their cruel attacks and embark on conspiracies, coups and anti-Islamic and anti-national actions. [passage omitted] For elections to take place as soon as possible -- we are ready for the election to be held. The settlement that was reached in Peshawar and various settlements that have been reached [words indistinct] that elections should be held on the basis of the formation of a new council to make a decision on changing political leadership in Afghanistan. At the moment the unanimous decision of all -- in all those agreements and in all of their undertakings -- is for another council to be convened in order that this council can reach a settlement about the future [words indistinct]. Here we have some options: One is that some people who say that they do not want to convene a council and make no undertaking want six or nine people to sit together and form another government -- form a transitional government for a short time. And after that -- after a transitional government is formed another council is to be formed. The reality is that their goal is not the formation of a transitional government. It is to create a vacuum or an inertia, to have a situation come about that the present administration -- before such a council is convened that has the power of decisionmaking, with all issues be submitted to it, and it should represent the whole of Afghanistan -- the regime is dismantled before such a council is convened [words indistinct] [sentence as heard]. Two or three brothers of ours are not even prepared to come inside Afghanistan and sit together. Do they want to set up this session outside Afghanistan or do they want to hold it along the border? (?Do they care) that Kabul will again be put under the rain of rockets? The elements that are lying in wait will again cause disorder and embark on plunder and new clashes. (?They do not think of this) but only aim to disrupt the situation, and whatever happens in the future let it happen; no one will be there to take the responsibility. There will be no shura [parliament], no government, or any center of decisionmaking, nothing, only an imaginary condition and illusory situation. A government of transition; what can a government of transition do? A government formed through the Hal-wa Haqd Shura [constituent council] and a government which is formed by their participation, they do not accept this government. It is not clear how this transitional government will be formed, [words indistinct] who will be in this transitional government and for how long. As far as we see, such decisions undermine the nation and make them a ground for dangerous games [words indistinct]. You are all witness to the fact that (?most of the countries), even some countries unfortunately in the east [words indistinct], are those who really do not want stability in our country. They do not want Afghanistan as a powerful, independent, and Islamic country. Nevertheless, the decision must be made by our people: What advice do they give and what decision do they make? What should we do? What kind of climate is to be created so that we can get rid of this situation? This decision to set up a shura is the decision of those leaders to which they are now disagreeing; all agree to the setting up of a shura. But why are they not now agreeing to the setting up of this shura; perhaps they say that the government might influence it; that is to say that government might select their own chosen people [words indistinct]. Such a belief is in fact an insult against the people of Afghanistan [words indistinct]. I am prepared for solving their problem, and I believe that the government should not interfere in the setting up of a shura and should choose a neutral position. Representatives can be chosen from among peace delegations, representatives from formations or alternatively no representatives should be allowed from formations for preventing struggles and conflicts. Let the peace delegations [words indistinct] and also representatives from those provinces that have jihadi councils, their representatives should take part. From among this collection, a gathering of fully neutral individuals can come into being. This neutral collective should draft regulations for the setting up of a shura and convene the shura. When the shura is gathered then the government's responsibility [words indistinct] should be handed over to this shura as a center of power. The shura will have the power to choose the future leadership of Afghanistan and take whatever decision they wish. The decision of the shura should be respected. We must respect their decision. Is it better to let six or seven people sit together far away from the country and decide about the country or let a thousand or thousand-and-a-half representatives of the people to render such a decision [passage indistinct]. Nevertheless, I believe that a way should be sought by the people themselves to get rid of this situation; a decision must be taken by the representatives of the people. You, esteemed ulema and the brothers who are present here and the rest of our brothers must consult with each other about the future of our country and render a decision representing the will of the people. You should render a decision before our country's difficulties increase. The government is at your disposal, advise it [passage indistinct].
