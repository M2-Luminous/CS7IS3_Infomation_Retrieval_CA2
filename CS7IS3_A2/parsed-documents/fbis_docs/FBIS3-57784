AS of 1 January, the civilian air traffic control office will be fully responsible for controlling the airspace over east Germany. Its modernization will involve millions of marks. Since the 16th Air Force unit was transferred recently to somewhere near Moscow, only two fighter aircraft units and one fighter bomber unit, which are deployed at the airports of Damgarten near Rostock, of Wittstock, and Templin, will remain on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic [GDR]. These units will probably also be transferred to Russia by June next year. The flight formations include Russian military helicopters that are operating at the bases of Mahwinkel south of Stendhal and of Oranienburg. Before the collapse of the communist regime, the Soviet Armed Force and the National People's Army (NVA) used 35 military airports. Approximately 6,500 military flights took place every day over the territory of the former GDR. One year ago, the Russian air fleet was reduced to 400 combat aircraft and 450 helicopters that still operated from 14 airports and carried out 1,000 flights daily. Currently, there are 250 flights per week by the approximately 120 jets, and about 100 flights by the 90 helicopters. Of the 35 military airports, the Bundeswehr wants to use a maximum of five. The MiG-29, taken over from the NVA, will be stationed in Laage near Rostock, and a unit of Phantom fighters will be transferred from Hersfeld to Laage. A total of 45 planes will be deployed in Laage for the control of the air space. There are plans -- but no decision has been made -- to station a transport unit in Holzdorf south of Jueterborg that is to be removed from Wuensdorf near Hanover. The Bundeswehr has helicopter airports in Cottbus and Basepohl near Neubrandenburg, and the Navy has concentrated its helicopters in Parow near Stralsund. As a result of the withdrawal of the Russian Air Force, the Airspace Coordination Office of the Bundeswehr has been considerably reduced. When the military air traffic control in Germany is integrated into the German Civilian Air Control GmbH on 1 January, the military air controllers of the Bundeswehr will be given leave and will work for the German Civilian Air Control GmbH. At present, the military air controllers who control the airspace in the new laender are sitting next to the civilian ones at Tempelhof Airport. The Airspace Coordination Office of the Bundeswehr will then be dissolved. A new air control system for Berlin and the new laender is currently being built; it will be based at Tempelhof Airport. This involves 150 million German marks. At the beginning of the winter timetable in autumn 1994, the new system is to start operating. The German Civilian Air Control GmbH will then be able to offer new routings, new approaching methods, new overflight possibilities, shorter routes, fewer delays, more capacities, and shorter flying times in its sphere. The new system will be responsible for the entire air traffic in the new laender and for the landings and departures at the airports of Leipzig, Dresden, and Erfurt. In the offices above the large check-in hall at Tempelhof Airport, which comprise about 900 square meters and which have so far been used by the U.S. Air Force for observing the European air and radio traffic, work stations for 74 air controllers will be created. At the same time, the control towers in Tegel, Tempelhof, and Schoenefeld will be equipped with new instruments, and additional radar and navigation instruments will be installed to ensure a three-fold radar control. New flight routes make it possible to intensify the east-west and the north-south traffic over Berlin. With the opening of the new control center, the transition period will end that started with the restoration of Germany's full sovereignty on 3 October 1990. [passage omitted]
