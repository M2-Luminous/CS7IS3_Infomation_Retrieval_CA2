FR940216-0-00181 FR940216-0-00010 (4) The following states are included in PADD IV: Colorado Idaho Montana Utah Wyoming (5) The following states are included in PADD V: Arizona California Nevada Oregon Washington §80.42 Simple emissions model. (a) VOC emissions. The following equations shall comprise the simple model for VOC emissions. The simple model for VOC emissions shall be used only in determining toxics emissions: Summer=The period of May 1 through September 15 Winter=The period of September 16 through April 30 EXHVOCS1=Exhaust nonmethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for VOC control region 1 during the summer period EXHVOCS2=Exhaust nonmethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for VOC control region 2 during the summer period EXHVOCW=Exhaust nonmethane VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile, for the winter period EVPVOCS1=Evaporative VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 1 during the summer period EVPVOCS2=Evaporative VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 2 during the summer period RLVOCS1=Running loss VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 1 during the summer period RLVOCS2=Running loss VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 2 during the summer period REFVOCS1=Refueling VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 1 during the summer period REFVOCS2=Refueling VOC emissions from the fuel in question, in grams per mile for VOC control region 2 during the summer period OXCON=Oxygen content of the fuel in question, in terms of weight percent (as measured under §80.46) RVP=Reid vapor pressure of the fuel in question, in pounds per square inch (psi) (1) The following equations shall comprise the simple model for VOC emissions in VOC Control Region 1 during the summer period: EXHVOCS1=0.444×(1^(0.127/2.7)×OXCON) EVPVOCS1=0.7952^0.2461×RVP +0.02293×RVP×RVP RLVOCS1=^0.734+0.1096×RVP +0.002791×RVP×RVP REFVOCS1=0.04×((0.1667×RVP)^0.45) (2) The following equations shall comprise the simple model for VOC emissions in VOC Control Region 2 during the summer period: EXHVOCS2=0.444×(1^(0.127/2.7)×OXCON) EVPVOCS2=0.813^0.2393×RVP +0.021239×RVP×RVP RLVOCS2=0.2963^0.1306×RVP +0.016255×RVP×RVP REFVOCS2=0.04×((0.1667×RVP)^0.45) (3) The following equation shall comprise the simple model for VOC emissions during the winter period: EXHVOCW=0.656×(1^(0.127/2.7)×OXCON) (b) Toxics emissions. The following equations shall comprise the simple model for toxics emissions: EXHBEN=Exhaust benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile EVPBEN=Evaporative benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile HSBEN=Hot soak benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile DIBEN=Diurnal benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile RLBEN=Running loss benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile REFBEN=Refueling benzene emissions from the fuel in question, in milligrams per mile MTBE=Oxygen content of the fuel in question in the form of MTBE, in terms of weight percent (as measured under §80.46) ETOH=Oxygen content of the fuel in question in the form of ethanol, in terms of weight percent (as measured under §80.46) ETBE=Oxygen content of the fuel in question in the form of ETBE, in terms of weight percent (as measured under §80.46)
