The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection that "Russia's national interests lie, apart from all else, in secure and quiet borders. [no end quotes as received] The newspaper notes that under the present conditions when the border runs near Smolensk, a situation will be disquieting if Belarus is not our friend, let alone enemy. "Any vacuum will be filled up at once. Russia should think about its own interests. "Belarus will find a way to determine its bearings. It has people and structures oriented on Russia. It is with them that we shall cooperate. Opponents of reintegration do not sleep either. According to the logic of events, they shall make the next move." In the opinion of the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper, "we can say now with satisfaction that political wisdom of Russian and Belarusian leaders is taking the upper hand over considerations of secondary importance". The TRUD newspaper stresses that "the signing on Tuesday of the treaty on pooling the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is possibly one of the greatest sensations". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an article by member of the Russian academy of sciences Georgiy Arbatov on Soviet-American relations where he notes: "It would be wiser for the United States to appraise prospects for relations with Russia not from the viewpoint of who occupies what post in the Russian Government, of how great inflation or budget deficit is (although this can be important for taking a decision on credits). "Other things are much more important for policy-makers: What is happening to the Armed Forces, what policy Russia pursues towards the former Soviet republics, what happens to the development of democracy and freedom of speech in Russia, how open our policy is, what progress is achieved in fulfilling disarmament treaties signed with the United States, what prospects are for their ratification, etc. "Sure, responsibility for the future of our relations rests on both sides." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. Commenting on the events at the base of moth-balled ships of the Black Sea Fleet in the Odessa port (Ukraine), admiral stresses: "The fact that a Russian officer was handcuffed and beaten up (I have in mind Captain Feoktistov and his deputies) is a crude violation of human rights and rights of servicemen. "These acts run counter to all Russian-Ukrainian agreements. I'm surpised that Russian sailors had enough patience not to make a single shot. However, some people were clearly waiting for these shots." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA features an interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who claims that "everything Anatoliy Chubays (eds: Chubays is responsible for the country-wide privatisation programme) is doing, leads the country to its collapse". At the same time, he states that he "has sincere relations with President Yeltsin. And I would like to say the following thing: I'm loyal to the president. No undercurrents. In future too. I do not change sides". The same newspaper runs an interview with former first deputy chairman of the Soviet KGB Viktor Glushko, describing his viewpoint on the abortive state coup in Russia in August 1991. A sensational theft took place at the grand hotel Evropa in St. Petersburg, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI newspaper. British national Luizidis Miltas fell victim of robbers. They stole his attache case from his suit with 15,000 U.S. dollars, six million roubles, a credit card, his firm's seal and commercial contracts with Central Asian countries. The Briton assessed the value of documents at 17 million dollars. In his opinion, the hotel security service did not take adequate measures to prevent the theft. The security service of the five- star hotel informed militia of the incident nearly three hours later, although the theft was reported at once.
