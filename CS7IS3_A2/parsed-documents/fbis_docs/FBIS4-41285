Vladimir Shumeyko Opposed to Parliamentary and Presidential Elections in 1996"] [Text] Delivering a report to the upper chamber of parliament on Tuesday, Vladimir Shumeyko spoke against holding elections to the State Duma and the Federation Council in 1996. The activity of the first Federal Assembly, in his opinion, should be extended by two more years. The speaker also noted that the presidential elections could also be postponed. At least, Shumeyko stated, "it would be useful if Boris Nikolayevich remained for at least one more term." The comment by the head of the Federation Council that Boris Yeltsin's presidential powers should not be restricted to one term is hardly sensational: Shumeyko has been saying that more often than anyone else. But this is the first time that the upper chamber speaker has expressed a wish for the life of the present Federal Assembly to be prolonged. Vladimir Shumeyko said that the present parliamentarians needed an "extended" term for the following reasons: "The majority of deputies are beginning to understand what is expected of them, but soon many will be starting to think more about their election campaign than engaging in legislative activity." This high-level praise of the "majority of the deputies," who are only just beginning to "understand what is expected of them" after six months of state service, is in itself dubious. But the main thing is that it is undeserved: So far the Duma colleagues' understanding of "what is expected of them" has extended only to the adoption of a single law -- on the status of deputies -- with a wide range of self-bestowed rights, privileges, benefits, and so forth. And to the amnesty granted to certain inhabitants of Lefortovo Prison. The publication of the most important laws, such as, for example, the law on the Constitutional Court, on the president, and on elections, is being delayed -- the deputies are busy with scandals, interfactional war, and incessant bickering. Against tha background of such productivity as this by the Duma, the legislative activity of the president, who has been issuing whole sets of edicts one after another, seems to demonstrate an enforced need for the head of state to take the initiative himself. Furthermore, the scale of this initiative, which seems to contain just about everything imaginable -- from major economic decisions to edicts on housing construction and the fight against gangsterism -- has given observers grounds for saying that Boris Yeltsin has launched his own new election campaign. To judge from Vladimir Shumeyko's statement, however, what is being tested is the idea of completely forgoing presidential elections by extending Yeltsin's powers for at least one more term. Without any doubt, the aim of the statement was to find out what reaction it would get in political circles and in society. The reaction was this. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced that he is ready to support his Federation Council colleague's proposal on condition that there is a perceptible stabilization of the economy in the next two-three months and the two chambers of parliament prove viable. Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, was more cautious, noting in an interview for EKHO MOSKVY that Boris Yeltsin had not been informed of Shumeyko's initiative but that, irrespective of that, the opinion of the Federation Council chairman "should be heeded." Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's representative in the Federal Assembly, gave a trenchant and forthright reaction to Shumeyko's proposal when he said in an interview for IZVESTIYA: "I would regard any initiative aimed at revising the Constitution with great apprehension, no matter how well-intentioned that initiative may be. Cancelling the Federal Assembly elections would set a precedent which would endanger the existence of one of the main elements of democracy." When asked whether this judgment also applied to the proposal to extend Boris Yeltsin's term of office, the president's representative in the Federal Assembly replied: "Undoubtedly." The idea of canceling the next presidential election has been around in the Kremlin for some time now in the form of repeated public comments on that score by Sergey Filatov and Vladimir Shumeyko. But this is the first time that the idea has been circulated politically and socially in conjunction with the proposal to preserve the present composition of the Federal Assembly for an extra two years. Clearly, it goes without saying that such political bartering will make the Duma and the Federation Council more amenable to the proposed cancellation of the next presidential election. There is also an assumption that no political party is yet really prepared for a presidential campaign and thus might have an interest in postponing it (apart, perhaps, from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and its leader, who are rapidly losing ground and realize that delay could be fatal). But so far, it seems, there has not been a sympathetic response in parliament to Shumeyko's initiative. Boris Fedorov, chairman of the "12 December" faction, has already stated that he does not intend to prolong his deputy's powers beyond the term laid down by the Constitution. In an interview in IZVESTIYA, Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov was even more categorical: "I believe that the situation in Russia has gone beyond the urgent stage. We cannot wait until 1995 for elections, let alone 1996." The implementation of Shumeyko's proposal will require the amemdment of Section Two, Paragraph Seven of the Constitution, which lays down that "the Federation Council, First Convocation, and the State Duma, First Convocation, are elected for a term of two years." However, that does not bother the upper chamber speaker. Even if it is necessary to hold a referendum to amend the relevant articles of the Constitution so as to cancel the elections, Shumeyko told journalists, that referendum will be far cheaper than the cost of an election campaign. How will this latest attempt to skimp on democracy end?
