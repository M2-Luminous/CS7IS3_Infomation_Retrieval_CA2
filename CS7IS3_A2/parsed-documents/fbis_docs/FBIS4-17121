According to him, the Palestinians hope that during Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Moscow planned for April 24-27 Russia will exert influence on Israel so that it would honor the agreements reached earlier. As 'Arafat said, in Moscow he was convinced once again of Russia's positive attitude to the peace talks in the Middle East. Evidently for Russia the Middle East is not simply a point on the map, but a close-lying area, he said. According to the PLO leader, a Palestinian delegation will arrive in Russia shortly to conduct negotiations on economic cooperation. During his "constructive" talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin and Patriarch Aleksiy II he discussed prospects for cooperation between Russia and Palestine in different areas, 'Arafat stressed. In particular he discussed Russian aid in forming a Palestinian police force. "We did not discuss that issue in detail, leaving it to technical experts", 'Arafat said. He highly assessed Russia's call for convening a peace conference on a settlement in the Middle East -- Madrid-2 -- made last February. With reference to the stand taken by Israel, 'Arafat said that Tel Aviv is playing for time. As a result the Palestinians' attempts to stimulate the talks process were futile. The commitments stated in the Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and by the PLO in Washington last September must not remain unfulfilled. The delays make it possible for the extremists forces on both sides to consolidate their ranks, and this might put an end to the peaceful political process, 'Arafat said. He said he hopes that Rabin's talks in Moscow will "stimulate" the negotiating process. "We want Rabin to make it absolutely clear whether he is for peace or not," 'Arafat said. "The time for words is over, it's time for actions," 'Arafat concluded.
