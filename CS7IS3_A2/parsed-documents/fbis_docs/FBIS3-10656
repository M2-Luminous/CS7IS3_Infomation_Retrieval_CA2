President Itamar Franco and [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso asked the government's legal advisers to present just a legally very well-founded text. Franco and Cardoso fear that some gap will allow an injunction or a habeas corpus writ to have the imprisoned speculator released in just a few hours, demoralizing the government's action when the government strongly needs to demonstrate energy. The preparation of this provisional measure demonstrates that the government finally admits to having committed a mistake in launching an economic program that merely takes care of wages. The economic team, scorched by the failure of the Cruzado Plan's price freeze in 1986, avoided meddling with prices. Challenged by indiscriminate price increases, the government now faces a much more dangerous threat to the economy's stabilization than the unclear votes in Congress, where the program's future and the future of the finance minister's candidacy for president of the Republic are at stake. This threat is so real that there already exists URV [Real Value Unit] inflation, as demonstrated by any price survey at supermarkets. Even the cries, fiscal terrorism, threats to expose the privacy of income taxes or open up the country to imports, and Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's public anger have not been enough to prevent price abuses. The government is facing the following dilemma: Either it becomes strongly involved, putting some speculators in jail to demonstrate that it has not lost the economy's control mechanisms, or the economic program and the minister's candidacy will fail. The prices issue also has become a key issue in the discussion of the economic program in Congress. Deputy Miro Teixeira, the new Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee chairman, who belongs to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] and obviously supports [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola as a candidate for president of the Republic, on 7 March asked for an expert in price monitoring to advise him. In Teixeira's opinion, URV inflation, which he believes ranges between 4 and 6 percent, has begun to destroy the reputation of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's program.
