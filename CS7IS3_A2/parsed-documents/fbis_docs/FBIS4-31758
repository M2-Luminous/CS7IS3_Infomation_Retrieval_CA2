At a press conference following the meeting, Torgyan said he mainly called the president's attention to the fact that the dominance of executive power could make parliamentary democracy, which is based on a system of brakes and counter-weights represented by the opposition, illusory. In this context Torgyan said the executive power had waged a campaign against his party over the last four years, accusing the FKGP with various charges, freezing its state support, and making efforts to break it up through smallholders created by the power. The FKGP chairman also said his family was exposed to harassment. Torgyan said he considered it necessary to relate this to the president because, in principle, there is a danger that an even stronger parliamentary dictatorship will come about alongside the ever more powerful executive power, in the wake of the election results. The danger of a one-party like system is further increased by the fact that, according to Torgyan, the revival of middle-level cadres of the former state party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, can be experienced nationwide. Although the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which won the elections, and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which came in second, are endeavouring to work out a system of guarantees, Torgyan said neither the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], nor the Christian Democratic People's party can be a genuine opposition force under the current circumstances. As regards the Federation of Young Democrats, Torgyan said the future will decide whether the party will be a liberal, or a popular-national force. Thus there is no other prominent opposition force apart from the Independent Smallholders' Party. The FKGP chairman also said his party would ensure a greater role for the president of the Republic, in order to counter-balance the executive power. For instance, as regards the media, the FKGP would empower the president with the appointment right of media leaders that would not require counter-initialling by the prime minister. Another element that would, according to the FKGP's intents, intensify the president's position would be his direct election by the people. According to the FKGP, it cannot be allowed that the media be subordinated to the government.
