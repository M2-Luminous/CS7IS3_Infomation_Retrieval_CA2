FR940606-0-00039 FR940606-0-00018 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 060194B] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting retention of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. NMFS is requiring that catches of sablefish by these persons in the BS be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary because the share of the sablefish total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), June 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael L. Sloan, 907-586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.24(c)(1)(i), the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 230 metric tons. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with ยง675.24(d)(2), that the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the BS be treated as prohibited species in accordance with ยง675.20(c)(3), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under ยง675.24 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: June 1, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13725 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 4:16 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
