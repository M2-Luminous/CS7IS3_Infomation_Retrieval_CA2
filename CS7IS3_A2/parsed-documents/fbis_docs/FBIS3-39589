But this seems to me obvious, not sensational." That is it. Ciriaco De Mita is following, from home, by telephone, the fight for power between [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary] Martinazzoli. He knows that there is talk of a statement by the secretary saying that there is no problem of his standing as a candidate. But on this matter he does not want to say anything more. Just as he does not want to comment on the concatenation of curious coincidences of recent weeks, after announcing in an interview with LA REPUBBLICA his decision to return to frontline politics: First of all, the vague announcements from Turin about his being under investigation, then the chorus of `no's' against his standing as a candidate, coming also from shores quite distant from the Popular Party and the Pact.... Nothing. Who knows whether out of vice or virtue, De Mita is insisting even in the darkest day. On speaking about politics. Sorry, talking logically about it. [Franchi] What, Mr. De Mita? Your constant intellectual pride? [De Mita] Certainly not pride. Maybe I have all the limits and virtues of the self-taught person. I claim to have been one of the first to point to the profound reasons for the corruption of the democratic system, and also to have attempted to organize a response. We have deceived ourselves into thinking that it is enough to pitch the right against the left with the new electoral law. Now we are finding out that the problem is infinitely more complex. They are struggling in each of the three poles with equally important questions: replacement [of discredited politicians and parties], new faces. But these are questions which cannot be answered without a general political framework of reference. [Franchi] What does this mean for the Popular Party? [De Mita] I have shared Martinazzoli's choice of solitude, in the conviction that the following legislature needs to be a constituent legislature,and that the important thing will be to be there, to put across our ideas. But I fear that the choice of solitude is transforming itself into a choice of absence which, you understand, is something else, and that the right is increasingly taking shape, and in forms not seen before. [Franchi] Are you talking of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's party? [De Mita] I have one question to ask them: How far have they contributed to convincing people that politics is not a question of guiding processes, but of offering a product, according to commercial rules? And why are those who have depicted this idea as an extraordinary positive novelty then surprised that the bravest in this domain has entered the field? [passage omitted] [Franchi] This is how we settled the accounts with the immediate past? But we are still far from today's crisis. [De Mita] I confess: In recent weeks I assumed the victory of the left to be inevitable. Now I am much less convinced. The Italian left has reasoned for a long time like the high jumper convinced that it did not have to win because the adversary was placing the bar far too high: the international restrictions, the agreement to exclude. Today this has all gone. The athlete has put on his running shoes, but he no longer seems to know in which discipline to compete. In particular when the shattering of politics and institutions has rendered an authoritarian solution plausible. [Franchi] You have been very much a member of this country's ruling classes. Does it seem normal to you to blame others for our mistakes? [De Mita] I do not blame anything on anyone, and I believe that I have enormous responsibilities. I know that pointing out other people's responsibilities, or taking on one's own, is no longer enough. The old ruling class can step back, but this is not enough to resolve the principal problem, which is not yet that of who should administer power, but of creating the institutional conditions for exercising it. [Franchi] And who should take on all this? [DE Mita] I ought to reply: Everyone and nobody, because it was given only to the Eternal Father to create the world from nothing. But I am also convinced that in Italy there is a great market for democracy and that if people quitting the ranks, it is because of an absence of supply. And hence the need to organize this supply. I believe the time has come for the press, the major newspapers, to discuss what they are doing, their national role, what it means to form a public opinion in a civilized country. It is the same crisis as the one which the parties are facing, that of their ability to organize consensus, to place the problem on the agenda. A high circulation is not everything. The parties too, as long as they had votes, believed that their representativeness and their influence were intact. And eternal.
