He graduated with honors from Tbilisi State University in 1969 and went to graduate school. He is a candidate of juridical sciences. For a number of years he worked in the Georgian Academy of Sciences Economics and Law Institute, first as a junior and later as a senior researcher. He has published a number of scientific works. He has served in agencies of the Procuracy since 1977: he was Procurator of Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon, First Deputy Transport Procurator of Transcaucasia, Deputy Chief and Department Chief of the Procuracy Investigative Administration of the Republic of Georgia, and Procurator of Kutaisi. In 1991-1992 he served as a judge on the Georgian Supreme Court, and was a member of the Presidium of that Court. In December 1992 he was appointed a Deputy General Procurator of the Republic of Georgia. He is now Acting General Procurator. He is married and has three children. [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what is the Procuracy like today, and what problems does it face? [Babilashvili] The transition period to Georgian statehood has also left its mark on the Procuracy. The old style and methods of the Procuracy have nearly been changed, but the new style and methods are not yet fully in place. In short, the Procuracy is a transition-stage state agency which is finding its place in the new system of state agencies. It will continue to function as the chief agency overseeing compliance with legality; its job is to see that the law is uniformly and fully complied with both by individual citizens and by officials and departments. The Procuracy has an investigative apparatus that is not very large but is very mobile and highly qualified to make its contribution to the fight against crime. As for problems, we have plenty of them. People are tired of lawlessness and are waiting for the government to help. Still, crime is the most pressing problem. It is along this line that Procuracy organs, in my opinion, need to focus all their professionalism and efforts. It's true that it is the Internal Affairs and Security agencies that are on the front line of the battle, but the Procuracy can and must make its own hefty contribution. This is proved by the hundreds of difficult crime cases by which our investigative officers have caught and instituted criminal proceedings against many dangerous criminals such as murderers, terrorists, gangsters, and other violent felons. The Procuracy's evidence is used to jail dangerous criminals; in the courts my colleagues defend the state's interests in the battle against crime, monitor the lawful punishment of perpetrators, exercise oversight of convicts' serving of time in places of incarceration and of the lawfulness of investigation procedures in the Security and Internal Affairs agencies, and so on. We regularly analyze the crime situation in the Center and the outlying areas and draw up expert recommendations. [Bitsadze] Laws enforced now were passed by the totalitarian regime. Doesn't this make your work harder? Could that be why the fight against crime has not been effective? [Babilashvili] Completely new legal relations are now becoming established in our life, and naturally they will require the appropriate legislative adjustments. However, because we are talking about crime we have to say that, in my opinion, a number of fundamental peculiarities are to be noted in this regard in the legislation that is in force: in some cases, a particular norm is clearly obsolete, an anachronism (for example, economic crimes); in other cases, however, many such norms are correct and in keeping with the times, but the necessary conditions for enforcing these laws are not yet in place. Certainly, everything must be rectified in the course of time. The implementation of normal legislation, naturally, will improve the law enforcement agencies' effectiveness in keeping order. Future legislation work will have to take account of the realities of our life, the level of legal consciousness of the republic's citizens whom the norms are intended for, our national character, and other particular factors.... There are other factors. In present legislation, for example, for some reason a situation has taken shape in which the law protects the criminal rather than the victim, against the interests of the injured party. It should be the opposite. Especially today, when the victim of a crime is virtually terrorized, under great pressure from the criminal or his associates, and there is no mechanism in the laws to protect him from it. The same thing is true of a witness to a crime. It is this factor that is one important reason why a substantial number of cases are not solved, or if they are they never come to court because the victims or witnesses recant their initial testimony. This is understandable, because the people are afraid of the criminals and the state is not protecting them. I think immediate legislative measures must be taken to rectify that situation. [Bitsadze] In your opinion, what are some of the features of crime today? What changes have there been? [Babilashvili] Clearly, crime has become more organized. Organized gangs have come into being, crime has become their way of life. They have support in the state structures, they are economically very strong and have the right connections; they control certain territories and certain types of business and trade. Many such gangs are now legalized, and some of them have acquired status and, as is the fashion these days, they have infiltrated certain official structures (the law enforcement agencies have detailed information on them). The public is aware that the process of isolating them is underway, and hopefully we will finish the job. Another peculiarity is that most registered crimes are of the violent category--murder, robbery, banditry. I mentioned murder. There has probably never been such an increase in the number of murders in the history of Georgian crime. Sometimes there are as many as 10 murders a day in Georgia, and motiveless murders are also on the rise. The criminal world has never been so well armed as today. You can find all kinds of firearms in the hands of criminals, to say nothing of communications devices, night vision devices, and so on. Most important, criminals can acquire firearms easily, securely, and without hesitation. Naturally, all of this makes it harder to fight crime and requires the use of additional detection, technical, and legal forms and methods. [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what do you think of the death penalty, also lynch law? [Babilashvili] I am personally against the death penalty, but as a jurist and a procurator I denounce the savagery of the criminal world, whose criminal actions are characterized by unprecedented violence, cynicism, and arrogance. I think that society has to do something to protect itself, including the threat of the death penalty. Naturally, this is not really a solution to the problem, because the fight against crime, as we know, requires much more than making punishment tougher. It requires an integrated solution, and one element of that has to consider the supreme penalty--the death penalty. From this position, I believe that this extreme penalty is still necessary in today's Georgia. Life itself testifies to this. I'm referring to a situation that has taken shape in recent years: there is a widespread rumor that the death penalty has been abolished, and people have reacted with mob law, stoning criminals to death. This is not befitting to a nation having the kind of legal traditions we have. As a punishment, the death penalty has not been abolished in our country. Last year, in fact, the Georgian Parliament introduced execution by firing squad, along with other penalties, for two new grave crimes, among amendments in the Criminal Code (Article 65[.sup]1[/]--genocide--and Article 66[.sup]1[/]-- for a mercenary taking part in an armed conflict or battle). The criminal world has to realize that society does have a tough tool to protect itself from their depredations--the death penalty. [Bitsadze] When the situation is real tough and all kinds of brutal and harsh crimes are being committed, how does the investigative apparatus work? [Babilashvili] The republic's investigative apparatus is working at full capacity. Investigators of the Procuracy, the Security Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry are investigating very serious cases, some of which are of great social resonance, including crimes by the ex-President's allies in western Georgia, ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Georgian population by the Abkhazian separatists, criminal violations in the monetary-credit system, the crimes of the Tatishvili brothers, the Sviri Brotherhood, the gangs operating in Guria and Lower Kartlia, and others. Not to mention the numerous cases of terrorism, murder, kidnapping, robbery, and other grave crimes. Unfortunately, the republic's investigative apparatus is not yet very effective. Almost half of the grave crimes that are committed remain unsolved, and this adversely affects one fundamental principle of the fight against crime--namely, that liability for committing a crime must be inexorable. When criminals go unpunished, this encourages not only repeat criminals but also new persons to commit crimes. It is true that a big share of the blame for this goes to the investigative and detective services, but there are reserves to be found here as well. Frequently, investigations drag on for no good reason, the quality of the investigation is rather low, and so on; naturally, citizens are justified in their complaints and dissatisfaction, and the Procuracy must exert more control in this regard. The investigative service, of course, has plenty of problems of its own, but that is another subject. [Bitsadze] Wouldn't one solution be to create a separate investigative apparatus--that is, to form a unified investigative body? The way it is today, investigations are done separately by the Procuracy, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and Security.... [Babilashvili] The suggestion to create a unified investigative apparatus is not new. It was being discussed back under the old Soviet regime, but for some reason no practical steps were taken. In the present former Soviet republics, now, there have been attempts to reform the investigative apparatuses, but it looks as if the effort has stalled. I believe that only Lithuania has a separate investigative committee. The basic argument of those who favor creating a separate investigative apparatus is that the same agency ought not to both investigate and exercise oversight (it is the Procuracy they have in mind). This argument is probably well grounded. So some post-communist countries--Russia, for example--have taken the step of granting the accused the right to appeal a procurator's authorization to jail him as well as a decree to extend his jail term; of course, there are plenty of opponents to this legislative innovation. What route we will take will be revealed by court reform. Of course, the creation of a separate investigative apparatus is no panacea. I can name several leading foreign countries in which there are more agencies having the right of preliminary investigation than we have. In the U.S., for example, more than five agencies do investigations: the FBI, the CIA, the Tax Collection Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Customs Service, and others. Eminent specialists believe, however, that the point is not which department runs the investigation but how well it performs its role in the justice system. [Bitsadze] The public is aware that cases of the allies of the ex-President are under investigation. Isn't there a danger of scores being settled with political adversaries? How effectively will the law be obeyed? [Babilashvili] Not to be too categorical about it, I will say that such a precedent is ruled out. This has been stated repeatedly by leaders of the government and the law enforcement agencies, and it has been backed up by concrete actions. We have reconciled hundreds of persons who have voluntarily turned in their weapons, and criminal proceedings against them have been stopped. These are persons who are not guilty of a grave crime. Naturally, clemency does not extend to persons who have inspired fratricidal civil war and national fragmentation and are guilty of grave sins. These people include certain deputies to the former Supreme Soviet and high officials of the former regime, the chairman of the government and certain members of the government, prefects, leaders of armed gangs, and so on who are subject to imprisonment. Some of them are already in custody, and some are being sought by the Internal Affairs and Security ministries as being guilty of grave crimes. The charges against them are criminal charges and have nothing to do with political motives. [Bitsadze] The public is aware that the republic's enforcement ministries have been carrying out major operations against criminal gangs; they have been searching homes on a massive scale, jailing suspects, and so on. Isn't there a danger of ignoring the requirements of the law? [Babilashvili] Whenever the enforcement ministries prepare for such operations, they have absolute information about the criminals, about the property they have obtained illegally, about their weapons, their narcotics stashes, wanted criminals, and other things, but for understandable reasons these do not require detailed discussion. As a rule, these operations are consulted on with the Procuracy, and we check on the legality of the plans. The operations are participated in by the appropriate investigative officers, who ensure compliance with the law and the procedural aspects of detention, searches, and confiscation of any items obtained by criminal means. In short, we have created the necessary system to ensure the protection of citizens' legitimate rights. In general, though, such operations are new to our experience, necessitated by the requirements of the time; for its part, the Procuracy spares no effort to ensure that these encouraging efforts are made in compliance with the law. [Bitsadze] You mentioned court reform. How do you envision it, and how does it tie in with the Procuracy? [Babilashvili] A special decree of the Head of State has created a commission relating to court reform, and I am one of the co-chairmen of it. Court reform is essential, and it will be carried out as soon as stability is restored in the republic, when the executive branch has real control over processes in the country. Agencies of the Procuracy will also have to be reformed accordingl--but gradually, in stages. There are a number of ideas about that, sometimes mutually exclusive ones; there are also some fashionably extreme notions about abolishing the Procuracy as a state agency and turning its functions over to various other agencies. Time will tell how this matter is to be resolved. I get the impression that there are forces in our country which are not pleased when such a legitimately academic and centralized body as the Procuracy is doing its job of protecting the state's interests. At one time these forces did everything they could to diminish enforcement departments such as the Security and the Internal Affairs agencies, and to some extent they achieved that. What we got as a result is clear to everyone. [Bitsadze] At a time when people are settling scores with each other through the use of weapons, how realistic is it to speak of law enforcement? Doesn't it add up to legal nihilism? [Babilashvili] To some extent it probably is, but let's also keep in mind that other countries on the road to freedom have been in similar and even worse shape and have still made it out of the crisis. It seems that a grave crime situation is the price society pays for democracy and freedom. Whatever difficulties we have, we must never forget the civilized form known as legal relations among men. The state and its agencies will have to do their part. We must strengthen citizens' faith in the law, while those who flout the law will have to be dealt with effectively, up to and including the use of force, and this is being done with increasing intensity. [Bitsadze] One of the culminating stages of the justice system is punishment. How do things stand in Georgia in this regard? [Babilashvili] Things are worrisome in that regard too. The system on which Soviet penitentiary policies were based--using prisoners as a cheap work force, the use of corrective labor, and so on, has been dismantled and is practically no more. The new conception, with its appropriate institutions and material base, is in the formation stage. Meanwhile, prisoners--or, rather, convicts--need to be maintained and employed, and this is one of our most serious problems right now. In fact, if the state cannot take care of a prisoner and comply with punishment procedures, its whole penal policy against crime will be in doubt. If we want to establish order, we will have to scale everything down, as they say, and take care of our prisoners in order to ensure continuity of the cycle of instituting criminal proceedings, court trial, and serving sentence. Otherwise these first two stages of the justice process will become purely a ritual, because criminal punishment will not fulfill the function which criminal law assigns to it in the fight against crime. [Bitsadze] What are the prospects of the fight against crime? Is there any cause for optimism? [Babilashvili] The fight against crime is a long and difficult process. Our task now is to bring crime under control, and our enforcement ministries really are up to that task. Once terrorism and banditry are wiped out, the crime rate curve will start to go down; hence, we really do have cause for optimism. Most important, public opinion is on our side; people want us to wipe out violence, robbery and looting and lawlessness; people want the chance to live and work normally. [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, there has been considerable hullabaloo over bank credits these days. What is your position? What is the Procuracy doing about it? [Babilashvili] By an order of the Head of State, we are tasked with coordinating all the work of checking the legality of credit issuance; this work is being done by the National Bank, the Chamber of Control, the Procuracy, and Security and Internal Affairs agencies. This work is going on quite intensively. Still, it is very difficult and time-consuming. About 20 criminal cases have been brought up to requirements and are underway. Suspects have been jailed, and investigation is underway. The disposition is such, in general, that the basic aim of the investigation is to recover the credits to the state, and persons who voluntarily pay their debt will be granted leniency according to the law. So far, billions of coupons have been returned to the state. The effort is continuing. It is made difficult by the fact that many of our countrymen have taken the hard currency gained by converting money "resurrected" from the credits (we're talking about millions) and stashed it in foreign banks. Unless they turn it in voluntarily, the appropriate legal steps will be taken to recover the illegally obtained monies. [Bitsadze] There have been frequent explosions, sabotage, and terrorist acts, and various opinions about them have been published. What can you say about them, and what is the Procuracy doing? [Babilashvili] All of these acts are state crimes according to the Criminal Code. It is because they are particularly dangerous that the State Security agencies are tasked with combatting them. The Procuracy is involved with these problems basically in terms of overseeing legality. As to recent explosions, I know that intensive work is going on in the Security Ministry, and results will surely be forthcoming. In general, along with the stepped-up assault on the world of crime a backlash is also quite possible, manifested in similar actions. Consider certain other factors as well: Do you think that in terms of safety everything has ended with the civil war? How many frustrated people are there, filled with the desire for revenge, because of their political bankruptcy and other base feelings? The war situation in Abkhazia and the fact that the republic's internal borders are unprotected make it imperative that we be alert and watchful. Consider, also, the mafia clans' struggle for spheres of influence. Hence, the various agencies have plenty to worry about. Until a crime is solved and the specific criminal is identified, therefore, it is difficult and probably awkward to assert anything categorically. Many worthy men have fallen in the fight against crime, including many law enforcement officers. Sad to say, some of their murders remain unsolved today. Consider, in particular, the treacherous murder of the Procurator of Tbilisi; serious efforts are underway to solve it, and the results are encouraging. We consider solving it to be a matter of the honor of the republic's Procuracy. [Bitsadze] Material incentives play a big part in the interests of Procuracy officers. How do things stand in that regard? [Babilashvili] Things are not very well in that regard. Practically everything these days depends on the officers' enthusiasm and professional dedication. Many of them couldn't make it and have transferred to other structures, and others are quitting now. The majority realize that almost everyone is having trouble these days, and they're waiting patiently for a better future. The Procuracy needs help if we are going to be able to work somehow. This refers to transportation, fuel, equipment and supplies, and so on. We don't have the resources to have new uniforms made, and all kinds of other things I won't talk about now. All we ask is the minimum necessary to maintain the institution and keep a qualified cadre nucleus. [Bitsadze] Batono Dzhamlet, what you have said should encourage readers who have suffered so much bitterness and pain in recent years. Can you add anything? [Babilashvili] A true Procuracy officer has always sympathized with anyone who is a victim of lawlessness. For a professional there is nothing more saddening and depressing than for someone to be in trouble and nothing can be done to help him or ease the situation because of circumstances. And, sad to say, there are such cases in our experience. Eventually, undoubtedly, everything will fall into place, and law and order, based on reason, will triumph. Naturally, this is not an end in itself. It is the means by which to open the way to constructive labor and ensure Georgia's economic and spiritual revival. My wish for our people is that that time will come soon.
