The traditional Assemblies of Production and Services will be replaced by a new type of meeting that will have the same sincere, critical, and self-analytical spirit established in the workers parliaments and will be called Assemblies for Economic Efficiency. TRABAJADORES underscores that an immediate task for labor union organizations is the implementation of plans and measures and the solutions suggested by workers during the workers parliaments. Economically feasible criteria and suggestions should be grouped according to each level of labor union organization to unleash the consequent action by enterprises, branches, sectors, provinces, and organizations, so that everyone knows his specific responsibility. In many work centers where concrete measures have been implemented, absenteeism has begun to decrease, interest in production has been reanimated, and workers make an effort to cut costs. The Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which will be held periodically, will follow up on the ideas and suggestions of the workers parliaments. The editorial goes on to say: We must maintain a constant teaching and learning presence at the centers and each contact must leave an impression on the workers. The parliaments taught us that the prestige of representing the class that governs the country is maximized through the active efforts of the labor union leader, wherever he may be, through effective communication with workers, and through the use of vivid language that conveys information, concepts, and ideas.
