FR940712-1-00043 FR940712-1-00011 Recognition of Distinct Population of the Southwestern Recovery Region In 1978, the Service recognized distinct population segments of this species on the basis of State boundaries, with bald eagles in five northern States listed as threatened, and those in the remainder of the lower 48 States listed as endangered. The distinctness of these population segments is questionable, given the dispersal capabilities of the species across State lines. In this proposal, the recognition of the southwest bald eagle population as distinct from eagles elsewhere in the lower 48 States is based on evidence that it appears to be reproductively isolated. Thus, for purposes of this proposed rule, the Service still recognizes two populations of bald eagles in the lower 48 States. Should this proposed rule become final, the southwest population segment would remain endangered, the adjacent Mexico population segment would be included in the Southwestern population as endangered, and the remaining population segment in the lower 48 States would be reclassified to threatened. Special Rule The Act allows special rules to be adopted for threatened species as needed for the species' conservation; such special rules are typically provided to reduce those protections afforded to endangered species under the Act. Section 17.41(a) is a special rule adopted at the time of the 1978 reclassification of the bald eagle. The original intent was to reduce the number of permits required for researchers working on threatened eagles (i.e., Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) under both §17.32 and 50 CFR parts 21 and 22 (bird banding and eagle permits). The present special rule at §17.41(a) reads as follows: (a) Bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) found in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. (1) Applicable provisions. The provisions of §§17.31 and 17.32 shall apply to bald eagles specified in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent such provisions are consistent with the Bald Eagle Act (16 U.S.C. 668&hyph;668d), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;711), and the regulations issued thereunder. The Service proposes to clarify the language of this special rule for threatened bald eagles. If the proposed special rule is adopted, only a permit issued under the authority of 50 CFR 21.22 or 50 CFR part 22 (subpart C) would be needed for such purposes as banding (§21.22); scientific study or exhibition (§22.21), which includes taking, possession, rehabilitation, and transport; native American religious (§22.22); and depredation (§22.23). A permit under §17.32 would only be required when a permit under parts 21 and 22 do not provide for an otherwise lawful activity. The issuance of all such permits would remain subject to section 7 of the Act and part 402 of this title. Effects of This Rule As a result of the proposed reclassification, prohibitions outlined under 50 CFR 17.41(a) would apply to bald eagles of the population reclassified as threatened. Prohibitions under §§17.21 and 17.22 would continue to apply to the endangered population. The Service could issue permits for exhibition and educational purposes, for selected research work (including banding and marking) not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for other special purposes. In allowing for a single permit, the Service seeks to foster further research and other uses of bald eagles consistent with the Act and the purposes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald Eagle Act (50 CFR 17.32, 17.41(a), 21.22, 22.21&hyph;22.23). Requirements of the Act under section 7 still apply to all Federal agencies. There are no distinctions made in the Act or supporting regulations (part 402) between endangered and threatened species. The consultation and other requirements under section 7 apply equally to species with either classification. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that the proposed reclassification correctly reflect the bald eagle's status according to the Act's definition of endangered and threatened and based upon the reclassification guidelines for each bald eagle recovery region. Therefore, information from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments are sought concerning: (1) biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) the location of any additional nests or roosting sites of this species, especially in the Southwestern Recovery Region; (3) the appropriateness of the proposed limits and status of the endangered population in the American Southwest and Mexico; (4) additional information concerning the past and present range, distribution, and population size of this species; and (5) current or planned activities within the lower 48 States and Mexico that might have possible long-term impacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation(s) on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal, including the possible complete reclassification to threatened for all eagles south of Canada.
