Speaking about holding a special summit meeting on the Bosnian settlement, V. Churkin noted that "if this summit has not been held by mid-June, say, more attention will probably be paid to Yugoslav affairs during the G-7 meeting in Naples, which will a G-8 meeting for the first time, with Russia's full participation in the discussion of political problems." Commenting on the content of today's talks in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and also with Serbian leaders from Bosnia and Krajina, the Russian deputy foreign minister noted that priority during these talks was given to two issues -- the situation in Bosnia, with the emphasis on attaining an agreement on the cessation of hostilities; and the preparations for the next Geneva meeting, as well as for the resumption of talks between Zagreb and Knin. The Russian president's special representative plans to meet with Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidium, and Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo. Tuesday evening V. Churkin was received in Zagreb by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "We had a very good discussion during which Franjo Tudjman once again reaffirmed his high opinion of Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement and Croatia's interest in continuing dialogue not only with Knin but also with Belgrade and in the overall normalization of bilateral relations, which play a key role in the complex of problems involved in the Yugoslav crisis," the Russian diplomat said.
