Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "after attempting two unsuccessful infantry and tank breakthroughs in the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste, the enemy intensified the shelling of the Brcko defense line in the afternoon. Civilian objectives were also targeted. During an hours-long, relentless shelling of the defense lines on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca route, chetniks from the direction of Cadjavac and Tadici used tanks, recoilless guns, all caliber mortars to fire several hundred shells. The chetnik artillery and tank attack did not affect the stability of our positions. The same can be said for sniper activity directed at Djukici, Vranovaca, and Boderiste." The studio announcer introduces a report by an unidentified correspondent on the situation in Breza and says that "on three occasions today, the aggressor's artillery fired at Breza." The correspondent says that "the first time occurred at around 1240 when the aggressor used howitzers from the region of Nabozici. Several shells were launched at the outskirts of Breza. It is redundant to mention that the positions from which the chetnik artillery is firing are located well inside the Sarajevo exclusion zone, that is, within the 20 km radius. Some time later, several shells again landed on the outskirts of Breza, after which a deceptive calm settled in. However, at around 1605, the chetniks again used artillery to shell the residential area of Breza with seven 122-mm howitzer shells. The general alarm signal was again sounded on the territory of our commune and is still in effect at the time of filing this report at 1758." Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps Information Service and says that "two months have gone by since the cease-fire was agreed upon in Sarajevo, yet during all this time the chetniks have not even tried to observe it. The chetniks began the day by throwing hand grenades in the district of (?Aerodrom). This was followed by machine gun barrages from Velika Kula and Baletici directed at the defense lines [words indistinct]. This affects primarily Lemze, which was targeted by Tromblon shells from the Rajlovac barracks and a portable rocket launcher from Zecja Glava and [name indistinct]. The citizens must exercise caution because the criminals may at any moment turn to shelling the city. This is implied by the movements of their manpower and hardware sighted today, and the dogged work of engineering units on the reinforcement lines."
