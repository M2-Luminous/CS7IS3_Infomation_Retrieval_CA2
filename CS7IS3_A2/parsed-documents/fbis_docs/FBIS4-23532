The question of the swearing in of UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] members of Parliament is still on the negotiating table, although it has been under discussing for five days now. The UNITA representative is still evasive, thus hindering the debate. Today's morning and afternoon sessions lasted eight hours, but as a whole it was a totally unproductive day. Tomorrow, government and UNITA negotiators will return to the Mulungushi Conference Center to try to find a solution.
