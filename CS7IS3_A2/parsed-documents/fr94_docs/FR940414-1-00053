FR940414-1-00053 FR940414-1-00010 BPT limitations for this subcategory require zero discharge of wastewater pollutants. EPA's information shows that the majority of PFPR facilities are complying with this requirement by virtue of the large numbers of facilities which reported no discharge (an estimated 71 percent of the survey population) and because nearly all facilities that reported discharging are indirect dischargers (to POTW's). The BPT technologies identified in the 1978 regulation as capable of achieving zero discharge were water conservation, reuse and recycle practices, with any residual water being evaporated or hauled off-site to a landfill. Several facilities that participated in a study of the industry for that rulemaking reported using evaporation as the principal means for disposing of wastewater from their formulating and packaging operations. Since that time, the practice of disposing of liquid hazardous wastes in landfills has been banned. (Nevertheless, one recently surveyed facility did indicate that they send wastewater to a landfill.) Additionally, EPA finds that disposal of wastewater by evaporation is now a less preferred practice, presumably because of concerns about pollutant transfers among media (e.g., air, soil, groundwater). In our recent survey, EPA has found that only a small proportion of PFPR facilities use evaporation to achieve zero discharge. Mostly, zero discharge is attained through recycle and reuse, though some facilities report hauling their wastewater off-site. Off-site destinations include incinerators, deep wells, and commercial waste treaters (in some cases, wastes are returned to the registrant or manufacturer). Some facilities that are achieving zero discharge have gone to considerable expense and installed state-of-the-art wastewater treatment to accomplish it through treatment and recycling. Because of recent revisions to the effluent guidelines for pesticide manufacturers (58 FR 50637, September 28, 1993), some of the facilities that manufacture pesticide active ingredients and also formulate and package pesticide products may have to change their current practices to comply with the existing BPT regulations for formulating and packaging. A number of the direct discharging pesticide manufacturers that also formulate and package have been combining pesticide manufacturing wastewaters with wastewaters generated from pesticide formulating and packaging and discharging the combined wastewaters. They are able to combine these wastewaters and still achieve the limits in their NPDES permits, which provide numeric discharge limits for pollutants generated in the pesticide manufacturing process. Although they are given no allowance for the pollutants present in their formulating and packaging wastewater they have been able to discharge this wastewater because the treatment systems reduce the pollutants in the combined wastewater to the level specified in their permits. The recently issued pesticide manufacturing regulation sets production-based BAT limits for specific active ingredients. These limits supersede the previous concentration-based BPT limit for ``total pesticides.'' Due to these newly issued BAT limits, it is unlikely that pesticide manufacturing facilities will be able to continue to discharge their formulating and packaging wastewater and still be in compliance with their new permits. EPA did not project any costs associated with BPT regulations for any direct discharging pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities in Subcategory C, because BPT for Subcategory C is not being amended. B. Repackaging of Agricultural Pesticides Performed by Refilling Establishments Whose Principal Business is Retail Sales (Subcategory E) As discussed above, refilling establishments generate wastewater through cleaning minibulk containers and bulk storage tanks; also, contaminated precipitation run-off often falls inside their containment systems. BPT for these wastewaters from repackaging operations is proposed to be zero discharge of process wastewater pollutants. The existing BPT regulations do not cover refilling establishments. As described above, the practice of refilling minibulks, etc. did not begin until the 1980s, i.e., after the original BPT regulation was promulgated in 1978. Further, the refillers are different from the general packagers and repackagers because of the differences in their volumes of wastewater generated and discharged, the homogeneity at refilling establishments of processes, water generation and disposal practices, and products being repackaged at refilling establishments, and the differences between the type of business (e.g., retail sales vs. wholesale sales) as described earlier. These types of facilities were not part of the data base for the original BPT regulations and were not considered in the development of those regulations. EPA finds that secondary containment of bulk storage areas and loading pads, plus the collection, holding and eventual reuse of rinsates, contaminated precipitation run-off and leaks and spills represents the best practicable technology for the refillers subcategory. The Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs has proposed a regulation under FIFRA that would require refilling establishments for agricultural pesticides to build secondary containment structures and loading pads to certain specifications (59 FR 6712, February 11, 1994). The secondary containment structures are designed to collect spills, rinsates from containers, and contaminated precipitation run-off. Today's proposal builds on this proposed requirement to contain contaminated wastewater by proposing that the contained wastewater may not be discharged. It is likely, therefore, that the wastewater will be held until such time as it can be applied as pesticide on a site compatible with the product label or used as make-up water in an application of pesticide chemical to an appropriate site. Of the estimated 1134 facilities (based on the 1988 survey) that would be affected by today's proposal, EPA's questionnaire responses indicate that 98 percent or an estimated 1101 already achieve zero discharge, primarily by holding contaminated wastewater and reusing it as make-up water. Thus, this practice not only eliminates the discharge of wastewater but also allows the facility to recover the value of the product in the wastewater. Accordingly, EPA concludes that this proposal represents the average of the best performance at existing facilities. Indeed, because the proposal is to require zero discharge, this also represents the best performance at any existing facility, and therefore EPA is also identifying zero discharge as the basis for BAT and PSES regulations (See below).
