Paul Ayemona, spokesman of the Collective of Independent Labor Unions and the Interunions Crisis Committee takes stock of the three-day strike: [Ayemona] The Collective of Independent Labor Unions has established three facts: First, that despite the untrue statements liberally made by the government, the Beninese workers widely followed the strike call. Second, the government does not seem willing yet to listen to workers or it is simply reluctant to admit the sufferings of the people. Third, Beninese workers are determined to use all legal and peaceful means at their disposal to increase their purchasing power. Should the government maintain its stand, the trade unions will feel obliged to adopt new measures. Here are more details with Mr. Ayemona speaking to a Benin radio reporter: [Ayemona] We have organized days of mobilization and information for workers and the people. As early as next week, that is as early as 16 March, the strike movement will resume with the possibility of negotiations. The issue at stake is the purchasing power of workers. [Unidentified correspondent] It seems now that the government is willing to enter into negotiations with you. What about that? [Ayemona] That is what the government thinks. Now, there is pressure from the workers because we believe that the government is not the only decisionmaking organ. We want to help it to make a decision as partners and friends. On the government's side, serenity prevails despite the strike call. There is a status quo. Timothee Adanlin, minister of civil service and administrative reform, has the details: [Adanlin] The government is observing the same attitude. It means we are available for discussions with workers and their representatives on the measures to be taken to maintain the most peaceful social atmosphere. [Correspondent] Does that mean that you are calling on workers for more negotiations? [Adanlin] We can go back to the negotiation table anytime. I am currently waiting for the workers to make contact and to tell us their position. I refer to position because I do not know what they are planning to do now. For our part, we are making every effort to prevent a strike. We believe there is no need for a strike before we discuss the issues at stake and reach satisfactory solutions for all workers. Asked on how the government would react to an indefinite strike, the labor minister said: [Adanlin] I do not believe there will be an indefinite strike. What did the government do to trigger the last strike? The government just said that the right to go on strike is a right that should be enjoyed and used within the limits imposed by the law. What the law says is that the right to go on strike should not be used to cause disturbances and to disrupt public order. I would like to express my personal satisfaction with the fact that trade unionists kept the promise made to the head of state. They promised to make every effort to prevent public disturbances during their strike and true to their word, public order was not disrupted. This is indeed satisfying.
