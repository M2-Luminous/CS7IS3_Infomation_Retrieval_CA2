FR940811-2-00024 FR940811-2-00017 DOMAC states that it anticipates in the near future it will receive additional cargoes of higher Btu LNG that will require air stabilization capability in excess of DOMAC's current installed capacity. 3 In addition, DOMAC states that it needs to be able to accept LNG of varying thermal contents at any time of the year, whether supplied through the long-term contracts of SONATRACH, Distrigas Corporation's Algerian supplier, or short-term or spot transactions with other suppliers in the international marketplace. DOMAC states that the new facilities will consist of one integrated unit of two electric driven compressors and will be constructed wholly within DOMAC's existing Everett facility and placed on a concrete pad within a weather enclosure. DOMAC requests approval on an expedited basis so that the permanent facilities can be installed and operational by January 1, 1995. 3 A 1990 Operating Agreement requires that DOMAC air stabilize any regasified LNG with a heating value in excess of 1,090 Btus per standard cubic foot prior to delivery to Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin). DOMAC's existing equipment is capable of air stabilizing high Btu LNG (up to 1125 Btu per standard cubic foot) into Algonquin at an average throughput of 45,000 MMBtu per day. DOMAC states that it will likely require additional air stabilization capacity for one or more cargoes in the fall of 1994, before a permanent certificate can be issued and the permanent equipment can be installed and become operational. DOMAC proposes to lease and install by September 1, 1994, temporary air stabilization equipment to permit DOMAC to air stabilize regasified LNG before delivering it into the J-System of Algonquin at the high throughput rates expected for that time period. DOMAC states that the leased temporary air stabilization equipment will consist of one integrated unit of two truck-mounted diesel powered compressors. DOMAC requests that a temporary certificate be issued on or before August 20, 1994, to permit DOMAC to install this leased equipment by September 1, 1994, and to operate the leased equipment pending the Commission's determination concerning the permanent authorization and until such time as the new permanent equipment is operational. DOMAC states that the estimated cost of the temporary leased air stabilization facilities will be approximately $295,000, assuming a four-month period of operation, and the cost of the permanent air stabilization facilities will be approximately $1,280,000. DOMAC further states that it will finance the facilities by using funds on hand and it will be fully at risk for the cost of these proposed facilities. DOMAC also states that any financial risk associated with the additional facilities will be borne by DOMAC alone, and not its customers. Comment date: August 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
