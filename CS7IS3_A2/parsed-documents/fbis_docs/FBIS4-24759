About 3,000 participants from 29 countries and regions, including China, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Thailand, the United States, and Hong Kong and Macao, will take part in the fair. It is jointly sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP). On display will be light industrial products, machinery equipment, electronic technology, communications equipment and products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional handicrafts, and real estate projects. The exhibition will cover more than 80,000 square meters. A large trade delegation composed of high-ranking businessmen from Hong Kong will visit the fair and conduct trade talks. During the fair, a number of symposiums will be held on expansion of electronics trade, China's current economic situation and investment environment, China's reform of its foreign trade system and investment policies, and China's financial and taxation reform. The CIEC is understood to have invested 120 million yuan (about 13.8 million U.S. dollars) in building a main exhibition hall covering 50,000 square meters for the coming exhibition. The holding of aspat'94 is to promote economic and trade cooperation among the Asian-Pacific countries, develop national economies, and explore ways for strengthening cooperation and jointly getting prosperous in a new world situation among the Asian- Pacific countries. The theme of ASPAT '94 is "progress through cooperation". ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP. ASPAT is aimed to expand and develop economic cooperation and trade relations among the Asian-Pacific countries, especially among the developing countries, and to accelerate the economic cooperation between the Asian-Pacific countries and the rest of the world. The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972 in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a complete success.
