[Words indistinct] National Assembly (Parliament), which is examining a harsh program of adjustments to reduce the budget deficit and the cash surplus. The budget deficit is currently 4.2 billion pesos and the excess working capital totals 11.636 billion, both equivalant to dollars at the official exchange rate. For over a week, long lines of people have been gathering at the doors of the so-called diplomatic stores (diplotiendas) spurred by rumors to the effect that upon making purchases their dollars will be devaluated. This devaluation will become effective with the official issuance of new bills called certificates, which the people will exchange for devalued pesos at an as yet unspecified rate, according to diplomatic sources. The purpose, according to the government media, is to exercise control over the growing dollarization of the island's economy. In August 1993 the government legalized the possession and use by citizens of freely convertible foreign currency. Managers of stores such as the Caracol Chain, Panamericana, and Tecnitiendas over the weekend required the help of police to control cases of extreme tension among people in the lines. On San Rafael Street, an ancient commercial area where state-owned establishments' display cases are empty, the multitude overflowed the sidewalks and tangible tension at times posed a threat to the glass display cases. The manager of a Caracol store in the old Free Havana hotel issued instructions to have one of the lines moved back approximately 50 meters from the facility because "they hardly allowed room for the tourists," who are given priority. At the supermarket located at the intersection of 5th and 42d Streets in the once exclusive Miramar neighborhood, NOTIMEX saw a line of Cubans with bags stuffed with various items, including household appliances such as pots, television sets, and tape recorders. These purchases, which some diplomats attributed to panic, were confused with many people's purchases for "Mothers' Day," which is celebrated in Cuba on the second Sunday in May. Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez yesterday defended the plan to collect a greater volume of dollars by selling products in those stores at higher prices and by taxing individuals whose salaries are paid in foreign currency. "The established policy is to collect the highest margins of profit through high prices, from foreign currency holders. These funds are then redistributed throughout the country for the people's benefit," according to Rodriguez. At those stores, some of which bear the acronym TRD (foreign currency collection stores), prices are (?comparable) to those in the big cities of developed countries such as Tokyo, Paris, and New York. Through the legalization of the dollar, the promotion of foreign investments, and tourism, the government is attempting to deal with the serious shortage of foreign currency resulting from the loss of its relations, preferential trade, and aid from the now defunct USSR. Since the legalization, the dollar has become the only currency with real purchasing power and for some the ownership of dollars has become a relief from the shortage of food, medicines, and other consumer goods. According to Rodriguez, the taxation of income received in foreign currency would be applied to those people who receive payment in dollars and not to those who receive money from relatives abroad, such as exiles in the United States and other countries. Having been authorized to undertake self-employment, producers who have no property and individuals who provide services are asking their clients for dollars, each of which go for 100 to 120 pesos on the flourishing black market. Rodriguez also outlined to the legislators a package of monetary measures that include price and public service tariff increases, the implementation of taxes, the cessation of subsidies and heretofore free services, without dismissing the possibility of a change of national currency. President Fidel Castro on Sunday told legislators that it is not only a matter of reorganizing the country's finances but of revaluating the money and salaries of state employees, 76 percent of whom receive an average of 180 pesos a month.
