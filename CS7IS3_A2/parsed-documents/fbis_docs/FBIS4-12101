Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the leaders of the Islamic Movement in the Gaza Strip, told IDF Radio this morning that although he does not believe in the political process, those promoting it should be given a fair chance. Our Arab affairs correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports: [Begin recording] [Semrik] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the political leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has many memories of the time he spent at the deportees' camp at Mazra'at Bayt Nawfal in southern Lebanon. This morning, we called him at his villa in the Gaza Strip and asked for his reaction to the fact that the list of returning deportees does not include any members of organizations that have rejected the political process. [Al-Zahhar, in English] Firstly, I would like to address the fact that I was one of the people who were deported since one year. I feel very happy on return, so I am appreciating and I think everybody here appreciating the return of the ex-deportees. We are happy for any Palestinian to come to his homeland. [Semrik translates above into Hebrew and continues] Taking a very moderate tone, Mahmud al-Zahhar explained why Hamas is ready to give peace what he called a very big chance. [Al-Zahhar, in English] We are going to give a very big chance for peace, but our assessment was and is still that this is not the proper way to achieve our basic demand. We will not participate in autonomy, but we will not put any hindrance for the implementation of autonomy. [end recording]
