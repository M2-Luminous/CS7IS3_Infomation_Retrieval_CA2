Some regimes permit relative, limited, freedom, others ban political parties, and others place restrictions and obstacles in the way of parties getting permission to operate. They allow parties that have no popular base and don't allow those that have a large popular base so that they can say they are applying democracy and allowing a multitude of parties. Some regimes interfere with legislative elections in favor of the ruling party. Some regimes might also appoint legislative councils. Some regimes control the official media--radio, television, newspapers, and magazines--and spend the people's money on them so that they will serve as their instruments. They draft laws restricting the freedom to publish newspapers. They also draft emergency laws restricting public freedom and prompting youths to go underground and violate the law. Such activity is met with counterviolence, which does not help solve the problem; it escalates it. We see this clearly in Algeria and Egypt. Indiscriminate arrests also help to increase the number of rebels and the bloodshed on both sides. Such cases of instability prevent an atmosphere of security for achieving reform and development from being established. They also provide the opportunity to outside forces to carry out activities and attribute them to citizens, because the continuing instability serves the interest of these foreign forces. Our advice to such regimes--if they are sincere in seeking their countries' good--is to free up public liberties, such as the freedom to form parties, the freedom of the press, and the freedom to hold conferences and symposiums. These regimes must ensure the honesty of elections so that a government representing the majority of the people can be formed and the freely elected state institutions can carry out their responsibilities and duties to achieve a good and honorable life for their peoples and solve every problem and crisis. Free elections separate the good from the bad. Much argument has raged about the dialogue, its motives, who should participate in it, the issues it should deal with, the issues that should take priority, and the conclusion that should be reached. Much doubt has been cast on the seriousness of the dialogue. The situation in society is worsening, reaching a point where it is almost intolerable. A solution must be found. There are many political, economic, security, and foreign problems and they must not remain unsolved. The ruling regime was supposed to solve them, but it couldn't, because it has lost the people's confidence. If the dialogue is meant to involve the people in finding sound solutions to these problems, the correct and natural approach is to give the people their freedom and political rights first, such as the freedom to form parties, freedom of the press, and free and honest elections of legislative assemblies that can fulfill their responsibilities in solving these problems. But if the dialogue's purpose is for the participants to come out with something like a charter that will bind the people, this is wrong, because the interlocutors are not elected by the people in free and honest elections that would have the people abide by what is achieved. The Muslim Brotherhood wholeheartedly wishes that stability and reform might be achieved in all state sectors and that all problems will be solved concretely. We hope the time will come when everyone will be convinced that Islam is the solution, because it is characterized by perfection, as it comes from God, who is perfect. God's word is the truth and he guides us on our way.
