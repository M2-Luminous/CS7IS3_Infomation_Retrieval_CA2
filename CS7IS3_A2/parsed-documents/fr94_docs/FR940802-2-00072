FR940802-2-00072 FR940802-2-00038 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Office of the Secretary [G N # 2259] Findings of Scientific Misconduct AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct in the following case: Annmarie Surprenant, Ph.D., Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology. An inquiry and investigation conducted by the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) found that Annmarie Surprenant, Ph.D., had misrepresented her academic credentials in a grant application for Public Health Service (PHS) research funds. The OHSU found that Dr. Surprenant had falsely stated that she had earned an M.K. degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1976. As a result of the OHSU investigation, Dr. Surprenant resigned from the OHSU faculty. During its oversight review of the OHSU report, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) discovered that Dr. Surprenant had also falsely claimed to have earned an M.D. on two additional PHS research grant applications. Based upon the OHSU report, as well as the information obtained by ORI during its oversight review, ORI found that Dr. Surprenant engaged in scientific misconduct by falsely claiming to have earned an M.D. in three PHS research grant applications. Dr. Surprenant accepted the ORI finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which she will not apply for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for a three year period beginning June 8, 1994.
