The final document is 19 pages long and, obviously, we have not had access to it. Judging from substantive elements contained in the final document, we consider that the balance of this fourth summit is positive. It is not all that we expected and -- this is a personal opinion -- it is not what Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian world could expect under the circumstances that currently prevail in the world; but it is evidently a step forward in the efforts for integration and joint efforts among countries of Iberian origin. I believe, and it is quite obvious, that the decision adopted by the heads of state and government who participated in the summit concerning the blockade against Cuba is a positive step forward when compared with previous summits. Regarding this, I would like to comment on what was approved yesterday at Cartagena de Indias. The presidents and heads of state decided to support the elimination, according to international law principles and the UN resolution, of economic and commercial measures which affect free development of international commerce and impair living conditions in Ibero-American nations. Obviously, the paragraph does not textually mention the United States as the factor, the agent who has imposed a blockade which has lasted for 32 years against our country. Neither does it mention Cuba as the victim of this criminal and unfair blockade, as Fidel termed it at the fourth summit. If we analyze previous agreements however, we will see that in Salvador de Bahia they took note, they only took note of the decisions adopted in other international forums. To be more precise, I would rather read what was agreed upon at the third summit; and you will be able to compare the text of the agreement adopted at the previous summit in Salvador de Bahia and the one adopted in Cartagena de Indias. Paragraph 68 of the resolution adopted at Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, states: We take note of recent resolutions adopted at international forums on the need to eliminate the unilateral implementation, by any state and for political purposes, of economic and commercial measures against any other state. The paragraph begins with a note-taking action rather than an opinion, censure, or explicit support for an accord's elimination. This time, the heads of state and government who met in Cartagena de Indias endorsed the elimination, based on international law principles, of accords which harm or are detrimental for Ibero-American nations. This is a clear allusion to the criminal and unfair blockade imposed by the United States against our country. There are other substantive elements. For example, in a world marked by neoliberalism, the document states the decision to bolster cooperation and mutual aid in the Ibero-American community, and a special emphasis was made on the need to look after the poorest sectors of the Latin American population. This decision in a world marked by neoliberalism, I repeat, represents an assumption that this neoliberalism is incapable of providing real solutions to the critical problems which afflict the Latin American world, the world of Iberian origin. Moreover, to conclude, I would like to state that within this effort for unity, cooperation, and collaboration, it is positive that Latin America supported President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's candidacy to the World Trade Organization. As you well know, this organization replaces the GATT. Only the Iberian countries in Europe, meaning Spain and Portugal, did not support the resolution because they had already pledged to support Italy's Renato Ruggiero. In other words, a differentiation was made between 19 Latin American countries and the European countries. In essence, this represents a step forward, a positive step. It is not what we expected but Ibero-American consultation has been consolidated. Actually, it has been institutionalized, a meeting of the coordination group will be held in Santa Fe de Bogota. In fact, a timetable has been announced for the agreement adopted in Madrid: Argentina next year; Chile in 1995, El Salvador in 1997, Portugal in 1998, Cuba in 1999, Panama in 2000, and Peru in 2001. I know of no precedent in which countries that will host the summit have been later rejected.
