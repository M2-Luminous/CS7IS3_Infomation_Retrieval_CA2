General Enrique Astete replaced him as the FAP commander today. Nadal submitted his resignation just as the U.S. Government halted the supply of radar obtained information to the FAP for use in the struggle against drug trafficking. According to military sources, the two are in no way connected. The same sources stated that the Air Force commander resigned for "very personal reasons." Other sources stated that he resigned for health reasons. Nadal Paiva should have retired, due to his age, in 1993 but continued following a decision by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is also commander in chief of the Armed Forces by a mandate of the Constitution. The new FAP commander was the Air Force chief of staff and prior to that director of military operations and attache at the Peruvian Embassy in the United States.
