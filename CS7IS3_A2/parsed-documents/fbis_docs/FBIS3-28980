The director, in response to U.S. condemnation of the tax system in Thailand, said Thai tax calculation is based on the quantity and price of goods purchased, much the same as in many foreign countries. However, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), taxes must be levied as a percentage of the value of the goods. Thailand uses this method because tax on some kinds of products can not be easily calculated. For example, the Customs Department sometimes fails to receive the correct prices of import products from the importers. A product may be priced at 1,500 baht, but the information given to the department claims that the price is only 1,000 baht. The system of Thai taxation has been quite effective for the most part, Somchai said, but he admitted there is still room for improvement. Economics Business Department Director General Kroekkrai Chiraphaet reaffirmed Somchai's statement and said the United States, along with several other foreign countries, is responsible for accusing Thailand of violating tax regulations as well as making some changes to its collection system which was supposedly agreed upon in the GATT. The accusations are not entirely true, he said.
