In the communique, the Group of Rio states that "the Haitian crisis can be resolved only if unrestricted respect is shown for the Governor's Island Agreement which calls for the prompt return of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide to the exercise of his constitutional powers in Haiti. The communique urges "the de facto authorities who illegally hold power in Haiti to submit to the UN and OAS decisions which mirror the firm hope of the international community." This Latin American group's reaction came two days after the military leaders of Haiti made Emile Jonassaint provisional president of Haiti, following the Haitian Parliament's declaration that the post was vacant. Jonassaint's rise has been interpreted as a sign that the Haitian military is not considering yielding to international pressure or sanctions and is not about to fulfill the Governor's Island Agreement which acknowledges President Aristide, who was overthrown in 1991, as the legitimate leader of Haiti.
