There is no doubt that in a short time Albania will present its request for associate agreements with the European Union, he added. Minister Serreqi said that the talks with his Belgian counterpart were characterized by a complete political will for the positive development and the prospective of Albania's mutual relations which are especially important for Albania in the transition period. The two ministers had also agreed in the talks to sign as soon as possible several agreements, such as the agreement for the encouragement and protection of the investments, the agreement for removal of double taxation, for economic cooperation in different fields and the extention of cultural and technical relations. According to Mr. Serreqi, the visit of Mr. Claes to Albania was important in many aspects. Mr. Claes came to Albania as a member of the EU troika, being at the same time one of the most selected partner in the talks on Albania's integration into the European structures and its cooperation with the European Union. Concerning the tense situation in the region, Mr. Serreqi said that Albania's foreign policy was appreciated in the talks and that they had fully agreed on their views and options regarding a resolution to the Balkan crisis. Mr. Claes said that a solution to the Kosova question is one of the most essential components for the resolution of the whole crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and at the same time it is the only option which can bring about a definitive solution. Mr. Claes said that the components of the crisis in the region should not be separated and this idea had been also emphasized in the troika meeting with representatives of Croatia and Bosnia. Kosova, Mr. Claes said, is one of the components and its question must be solved through granting it an extended autonomy. Answering a question in regard to the presence of the international protectorate in order to guarantee the status of the Kosova autonomy, Mr. Claes said he could not give any opinion before the negotiations. But, he added that as in the case with Bosnia-Herzegovina, the European Union will insist in observing any agreement which can be signed. Mr. Claes said that everything depends on what the parties will demand from the international community. Asked about what he meant by "an extended autonomy for Kosova," Mr. Claes said that it is not the union which will define what are the Albanians going to request, adding that he was of the opinion that Kosova must be granted an extended autonomy in political and cultural aspect. "For us," Mr. Claes said, "this concept comprises not only individual but collective rights as well." Answering a question by a Belgian reporter, Mr. Serreqi said that Kosova must never be considered as an interior problem of Serbia. The war in Bosnia, Mr. Serreqi said, has left the Kosova question in oblivion to some extend, but the crisis in former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved unless a solution for Kosova is found.
