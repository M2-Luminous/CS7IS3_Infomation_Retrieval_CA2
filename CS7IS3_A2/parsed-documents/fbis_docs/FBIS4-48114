But he said it was a new start following a sad period of intense political violence. Echoeing the words of the region's Premier Frank Mdlalose, the Zulu monarch said differences in political ideas should result in healthy debate rather than conflict. "I appeal to you to make deliberate plans to bring about peace. Let the political violence we have had not spill over into the new era." King Zwelithini also welcomed all people in the province as his people, saying: "I love all people created by God in his own image." He told the legislature to co-operate and work together for the well-being of the people. At a press conference later, the African National Congress leader in the Parliament, Jacob Zuma, said his party was continuing with legal steps into alleged voting irregularities during last month's elections in the province. But he would not say whether the ANC was in favour of a re-election in the province: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." Dr Mdlalose also acknowledged that many things had gone wrong. Both leaders, however, indicated their willingness to work together in the regional government.
