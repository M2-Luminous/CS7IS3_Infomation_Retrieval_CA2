But for the first time the traditional Liberals will not be contesting the 27 March elections. The hundreds of symbols registered do not include the PLI's [Italian Liberal Party] tricolor. [IL GIORNALE] Can a Liberal really feel ashamed to call himself a Liberal, Minister? [Costa] The absence of the party's traditional symbol must not be viewed as a renunciation. The PRI [Italian Republican Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] are absent from this contest, and so is even the PDS in the single-candidate constituencies. However, there is a high degree of liberalism among the political forces. The real issue is to move on from plans to deeds. I have my doubts about whether this will happen. That is why the Liberals are fielding their own candidates. Most of us support, and will vote together with, the moderate forces. [IL GIORNALE] Zanone and Patuelli have opted for [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. What if they prove to have been right? [Costa] Right and wrong are never so clear-cut. However, I believe that the choice that I recommended and made is a more consistent one -- and not only with regard to my own conscience. I am sure that after 27 March we will have a larger liberal-democratic parliamentary group than the present one. [IL GIORNALE] Are you running with the aim of governing or of going into opposition? [Costa] With a great desire to reverse the situation. [IL GIORNALE] To whose detriment? [Costa] I certainly do not intend to wield a big stick, to use a metaphor that someone else used recently. My aim is to reshuffle the pack, that is, to revise legislation, to streamline it, to dissolve all the unnecessary government agencies. Major reform is needed after half a century of stop-gap measures and bargains. This must end. Whether we win or whether the left wins, the important thing is to regenerate this country in earnest. [IL GIORNALE] [National Alliance leader] Fini and Bossi are not talking, but you are allied to both of them. Is the agreement a mere sham? [Costa] I believe in the role of the transitional factor. Bossi represents a major novelty, despite certain errors which I have consistently challenged. Fini symbolizes an evolution in a definitely democratic direction. The fact is that it is the Italian people who have a messianic attitude, an excessively messianic attitude, with regard to these forces, which are perceived as new. I am not burying my head in the sand. Italy is tired and is grabbing hold wherever it can. This is why I repeat that after 27 March the first thing to do is to open a new chapter. [IL GIORNALE] Will Paolo Berlusconi's house arrest earn or lose the moderate alignment votes? [Costa] We are experiencing a troubled climate, as a result of some serious events, and it is leading to a very low level of political debate. I am willing to admit that Paolo Berlusconi's arrest is politically equivalent to implicating [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema in the party funding affair. I wish the parties could discuss pensions, foreign policy, inflation, and relations with the EC. Instead we find ourselves contending with a completely tainted campaign atmosphere. The citizens are tired of attempts to poison the political and judicial climate, scandals for their own sake, gossip, and misinformation. [IL GIORNALE] Which is worse: RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] or Fininvest? [Costa] Since I am an ally of Forza Italia, my opinion is obviously suspect. But I will not for that reason refrain from pointing out that when Fininvest makes a mistake, it does so with its own money. RAI is factious even though it uses my money. The public propaganda on behalf of the PDS is intolerable. I am very disappointed in Locatelli, RAI's managing director: If it were up to me, I would never again assign him to a post that demands at least some impartiality. I had a friend, Paolo Garimberti, an excellent journalist, who is now head of Channel 2 news. I have not changed my mind about his professionalism, but I would add that his news programs do not convince me at all. [IL GIORNALE] Segni has already raised the suggestion of a "government of experts to guarantee institutions." Would you be a member of it? [Costa] Segni shows a lack of respect toward his voters. Perhaps he is realizing that they are turning their backs on him. His Pact threatens to prove a sham. I am not convinced by labels: I want clear programs and definite options -- either this or that. [IL GIORNALE] You flirted with the Republicans' La Malfa until the last moment. Are you not afraid that you went too far? [Costa] La Malfa enjoyed sufficient stature to engage in a meaningful dialogue. But now the PRI has a great future behind it.
