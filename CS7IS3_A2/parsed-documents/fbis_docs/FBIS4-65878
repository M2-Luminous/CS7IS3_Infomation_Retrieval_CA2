It deals with single-cell organisms, so-called protozoa. Such a minute thing, explained the chief of the Karlsruhe Federal Constitutional Court some time ago in conversation with Richard von Weizsaecker, reminds him of his career planning: "It lies quietly in the water; but if something happens to swim by, it will eat it if it appeals." This crass punch line, resulting from Herzog's love of mockery, amused the German head of state, but evidently it also was food for thought for the nobleman who attaches importance to seriousness. At least the top jurist believes "that after this remark, the president is not so sure about me." He suspects his party friend of having leaked the remark to the press. His opponent, Johannes Rau, learned of it via TV, and he is also mulling it over. Although the Social Democratic competitor for the move to Berlin's Bellevue castle avoids derogatory statements about the Christian Unionist, the "strange remark" does surprise him a bit. The North Rhine-Westphalian head of government does not necessarily wish to question his rival's fitness for office. But it is "difficult to understand," as he says in his favorite Wuppertal pub, the general kind of feeling and thinking which might be concealed behind this comparison: Is a man of reputation allowed to make it so easy on himself? These doubts are probably strengthened by the considerable devotion with which the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] representative pursues his goal. Apparently cool to the core, Professor Dr Roman Herzog, 60, talks his candidacy down to an "attractive possibility;" Johannes Rau, three years older, lives and suffers it. Never before in the republic's presidential elections has a candidate more openly presented his claim than does the minister-president from Duesseldorf. He considers himself the man with the necessary power of integration ("I have the gift of bringing people together"), and the great majority of Germans sees it the same way. For weeks now, hardly a day passes that Rau is not planting these virtues in their heads in interviews (or even at riflemen's festivals or boat christenings). "I want to be it," he summarizes his dream in the simplest sentence possible, then underpins it with polling figures: One only has to think of the numbers which the pollsters with great regularity have at the ready. The yearning Social Democrat speaks of the "clear signals that also reach me;" he is inspired by the force of autosuggestion to which he submits gladly. Can the Federal Assembly really dare to "pass by" such facts? In the end, "perhaps the moving van will yet come," he says hopefully at a spring festival which his local SPD club of Katernberg is celebrating. But this confidence is soon followed by a distressing drop in mood. He quietly laments the "cemented majority conditions" among the delegates. The candidate realizes that the ideas of the people and of people's representatives unfortunately do not coincide. He may be especially upset by the supposed callousness with which the favored rival, Roman Herzog, seems to accept his big chance. But the widespread impression, that the rustic Bavarian in this competition plays only the role of an almost indifferent stoic, is not correct. Like Johannes Rau, whose tough battle for approval by the electors goes much further than what his Bonn party headquarters is doing, in truth the Christian Democrat also strains mightily. The protozoa metaphor and other self-complacent utterances at best give information on the specific behavioral technique of the portly jurist. Even the conservative FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE believed that Herzog only pretends "a certain friendly indifference," after the Union had just dropped its Steffen Heitmann. Perhaps frustration--that its political favorite had been shot down--flowed into this harsh portrait, but the newspaper is not all that far off: For years, the second choice of the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] for a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker has always felt himself to be really the first choice. It is not a chief constitutional judge living in the Karlsruhe ivory tower who now vies for the highest office in the country, but a sturdy homo politicus. He knows the world and its wiles--and above all the laws of a media democracy. Numerous homey stories are proof of that. For BILD-ZEITUNG ("Washing dishes relaxes me wonderfully"), the master of the house even has himself photographed at the kitchen sink. What does it matter that he reaches into the pile of dirty plates in a snow-white shirt and starched cuffs: The performance fulfills the purpose of presenting to the insufficiently informed public a high performer in the form of a simple, average citizen. From the standpoint of psychological condition, he deals in a much livelier fashion with his candidacy than the more tired, formerly merry drinker of Pils [beer] and teller of anecdotes from North Rhine-Westphalia. And he also says it: If "Rau is certainly more popular," he "who for years had been parked in Karlsruhe, is probably less used up." So a duel has developed subtly, in which the different personality images have acquired a certain importance--but the alternatives as to substance much less so. Just as the two embattled people's parties are beginning to resemble each other more and more, their candidates for the presidential office overall represent the same objectives. In the case of "Brother Johannes," the son of a Pietist preacher, this transborder impetus is almost a characteristic. The 1987 candidate for the chancellorship, under the motto "reconciliation instead of division," cannot help himself. Again he sees himself as an "offering for all." Roman Herzog's trend toward the political center, on the other hand, derives from somewhat more profane drives. Sent to Bonn as undersecretary by Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Helmut Kohl over two decades ago, the former university president initially proved to be a strongly conservative careerist. Later as interior minister in the Baden-Wuerttemberg cabinet of Lothar Spaeth, he tried to subdue the peace movement with riot control gas. But times have changed. The societal counterforce, in the fall of 1983 holding out in front of the Mutlangen missile site, has decamped--and the roughneck from Stuttgart has learned his lesson. Meanwhile, the basic attitude of the Federal Constitutional Court's president is considered bourgeois-liberal, albeit not immune to relapses into rigid law-and-order thinking. So what choice is there? Are not both--as could be heard regretfully here and there at the beginning of their candidacy--protagonists of the old FRG that passed away? Does the gentle Social Democrat perhaps warm the heart a little more, while the Christian Unionist offers himself more as the man for everyday life that has become grayer? The office of federal president is "something so singular," candidate Johannes Rau points out, that basically there is only one question: "Who is the right one for the next 2,000 days?" Thus speaks the public favorite who knows his worth. Encouraged by pollsters, he would like to free the decision from the tangled mass of tactical dodges and superficial powerplays. The North Rhine-Westphalian government head insinuates that, if things are aboveboard, the answer is practically obvious. That is also the reason why he abstains from substantive pronouncements. Why should he "artificially puff himself up" and proclaim political guidelines which everyone already knows? The old diehard who, after all, has won an absolute majority three times in the republic's most populated land, believes he has made a sufficient impression. And moreover: For many years, has he not embodied those characteristics which the fathers of the constitution had in mind when they created this office so limited in power? Even in hours of doubt, it makes him happy to see this confirmed. "What is needed," says Rau in a strange mixture of humility and pride, "is the bonding power which I have." For the time being, Roman Herzog refrains from circulating such self-certainties. Naturally, he also sees the essence of his possible future job in working for a communal spirit--but somehow with less ardor. There will be days, the judge phantasizes drily about the work, in which he will live in the situation of an improviser: "What's coming up? What are you going to do next week?" Since the beginning of the complicated nomination procedure, the Christian Democrat has demonstrated his inclination toward self-reliance. He is his own man who will no longer move into Villa Hammerschmidt [in Bonn], but wants to represent the new Germany in Berlin. The Bavarian from Landshut drawn toward charismatic types, sees Italian Sandro Pertini as his model. Just as he, a socialist with patriarchal bearing, demonstrated fearlessness in the early 1980's, so Herzog, with conservative values, will "hit hard if necessary." He proves it impressively when he now, without many scruples, rejects dual citizenship. Is this just a sterner version of populism with which he confronts Rau's subtler stance? Or, to give it a positive spin: Sometimes it appears as if the two potential heirs of Richard von Weizsaecker ("Ritchie") personified his virtues, each one half. The "red" candidate likes himself in the role of patron and paterfamilias who values consensus above all else; the "black" candidate loves the aura of the contrary, salutary troublemaker from whom not even the chancellor may feel safe. The Duesseldorf head of government eyes this part of his rival with the distrust of the political professional polished over decades. In his cautious manner, he says that he has "a little bit the feeling that the Herzog program is called Herzog" -- in his opinion, a daring ego trip. Will he be able to last long in the fragile power structure into which the constitutional organ of the federal presidency is fitted? But then he also has other moments. Still grappling with the fact that he quit school before getting the junior high school diploma, self-taught Rau is plagued by noticeable inferiority complexes. They force him into tendential behavior anxiously rooted in norms. A "German professor" (Herzog on Herzog) is hardly burdened by that. But the Social Democrat is yet too perceptive not to know about the reverse side of his public assessment. "He's nice, a good Skat player, but offers nothing of substance...an amiable nonscorer," he bravely summarizes the list of critical remarks. Naturally, he is hurt by such accusations. It has never been his business "to pour the gravy of harmony over everything"--and he immediately offers an example of something that certainly cannot be reconciled: "American Fruit and the banana pickers!" the minister president says emotionally. But fortunately, such contrasts no longer exist in our country. Thus he reaches energetically into faraway worlds, while the situation at home worries him only conditionally. Whether the candidate speaks about genetic technology or nuclear energy, the role of the Bundeswehr or the republic within the global scale--he is always concerned with a possibly balanced position, anchored "between curse and blessing." His rival Roman Herzog, accused of "liberal unpredictability" by such as Edmund Stoiber, dares to go further. Inclined toward intervention, he thinks out loud about this and that, supports plebiscites, or advocates a limit on speed. "In politics," he demands grumpily, one must "speak in much plainer terms." This creates the impression that the highest German judge, in case he is elected, might turn to `res publica' more directly--an advantage of the more vigorous temperament. For within the scope of their understanding of the state and society, the rivals differ only in minor details. Roman Herzog ("I am a totally undramatic person") might use more of a shirt-sleeve approach with his fellow citizens than fine-boned Rau. The Bavarian thinks the fight over the holiday to be sacrificed for nursing care insurance is "simply laughable." And he wants to be able to say that, even as federal president. The amateur historian trained himself in this provocative poise through a weakness for historical dimensions, developed early on. Contemporary man, by immersing himself in the wide spaces of the respective epochs, learns to calm down--a feeling which he cultivates. The Protestant likes to relax in one of his favorite places, the Speyer cathedral. There lie the bones of Emperor Henry IV, highly esteemed by him; the emperor who went to Canossa. Roman Herzog, the highly regarded jurist, at the head of his class since early youth--but Roman Herzog also in the pose of one who no longer has to prove it to himself: At age 13, he taught Latin to his father, an employee in a snuff factory and later director of a museum; at his riper age, the constitutional judge after work sits relaxed in front of his TV, watching commercials. TV chief inspector Derrick is also welcome in his living room. In part it is the simple, archaic rules of life from which the coauthor of the famous Basic Law commentary, "Maunz-Duerig-Herzog," derives his orientation. The author headlined his "General Political Science" (1971) with a sentence from the fairy tale, Rumpelstiltskin: "I am fonder of something living than of all the treasures of the world!" However, some of Herzog's general rules--such as his maxim, "Help yourself and God will help you"--bespeak a rather rough-and-ready pragmatism permeating even questions of faith. Thereby the Christian party man probably moves closer to an increasingly secularized country than the pious Social Democrat. For Rau is certain that "this world is not living in doom: There comes something else"--a confidence which he does not associate with any work of man. That at least is demanded by the strict Lutheran who still sets the course within him. But faith can make one strong. The mild revivalist as SPD functionary has managed to pursue his own cause all the more purposefully. He has always been determined to conquer leading party and government offices through embattled candidacies, if necessary. All these years, the former publishing house bookseller and journalist has been fascinated by the "political figure of the mayor." That he also counts a head of government in this category, as its crowning point as it were, explains the remarkable steadfastness in his present political engagement. As one of the closest companions of "citizen president" Gustav Heinemann, to whose second-oldest granddaughter, Christina Delius, Rau is married, he feels himself additionally predestined. Thus he would be willing to leave his beloved Wuppertal for the job of "citizen king" (DIE WOCHE)--and even more: For the sake of the desired honor, the SPD vice chairman revealed himself last fall as an astute tactician. "One must stabilize Heitmann," the candidate urged among his circle of comrades. A transparent trick to increase his own chances. All in vain, since it now becomes painfully clearer to him that his career "is linked to Kohl's fate?" Up to these last days, Johannes Rau refuses to accept in his heart the probable defeat. But no matter whether "the mayor" or the "catalyst" (a definition of Herzog) will gain the upper hand this coming Monday [23 May]: The seventh federal president for the first time in the history of the republic will be a so-called `later-born.' The two top candidates experienced World War II--which has again entered the collective consciousness in the fourth year of the reunited country--as children. Little Johannes, 12 at that time, learned from his father, returned from the Soviet Union, about the atrocities by the Nazis, while the even younger Roman saw the catastrophe with his own eyes: "An endless line of concentration camp prisoners were marched by our house." And both experiences still have their effect. Thus one of the most convincing assets in the political balance sheet of Social Democrat Rau is his tireless effort for reconciliation with the Jews. Because of this engagement, the University of Haifa bestowed on him an honorary doctorate, and since then he has been highly welcome, and not only in Israel. The much-quoted "fisher of men" is one of those who gained respect abroad as the "good Germans." Roman Herzog is finding it more difficult when the past is concerned. He had been education minister under the former naval judge, Hans Karl Filbinger, and for years served as assistant to public law specialist Theodor Maunz--a jurist until his old age incorrigibly tied to the new Nazis. How does he feel about that? Did nothing ever strike him when his father's friend, under whom he did his doctoral work, maintained closest contacts with Gerhard Frey's German People's Union? Well, that's how it is, "...noticed nothing," says the presidential candidate and mutters a low "perverse" between clenched teeth; and that is all. To have to talk about the behavior of his colleagues in the Third Reich (and afterwards) annoys him visibly. Does this reflect the stoicism of Roman Herzog who would rather pursue the larger perception, anyway? He simply likes "broken personalities"--those of yesterday and today. The Christian party man with the cool attitude overall wants "not to get carried away." What will happen, he asks through a cloud of his cigarillo, if contrary to expectations he is not elected on 23 May? "Neither Rau nor I can ruin the country."
