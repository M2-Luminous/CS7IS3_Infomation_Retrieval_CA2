The data are gathered from a representative sample of people aged 18 and over, according to sex, age, and type of community. The latest survey took place between 28 and 31 January 1994, based on a sample of 2,000 people. The results can be affected by sampling mistakes, and this reflects the difference between these results and the results that would be obtained if we were to ask the entire population. In the current survey, the margin of error is in the range of plus or minus 2-3 percent. The number of people surveyed in previous opinion polls was as follows: 5,669 in September 1993, 1,499 in October 1993, 994 in November 1993, and 1,443 in December 1993. The opinion poll carried out by the Hungarian Gallup Institute at the end of January 1994 concludes that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is heading the popularity list. The proportion of potential MSZP supporters gradually increased in the last quarter of 1993, albeit to a small extent every month, and it showed a 4 percent increase in January compared with December. The opposite trend can be seen in the case of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the party that is currently in second place. Compared with September 1993, the number of Fidesz supporters fell by almost half. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], a party that almost doubled its percentage of supporters in the days of the funeral of its leader and prime minister, is currently in third place on the popularity list. Although the number of its supporters dropped by 3 percent from December to January, the MDF has not enjoyed such a high level of support since April 1993. The popularity of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is also increasing. The number of potential SZDSZ voters is roughly equal to the number of MDF supporters, and is close to the level achieved by Fidesz. The survey also asked the people the following question: "Which party would you vote for if elections were held this coming Sunday?" About a fifth of the people (22 percent) answered "I do not know", and 11 percent said that they would not go to vote. Thus, people who support a party make up two-thirds of the entire population, and we will call them "people who answered." The size of this group was considerably smaller in one case only, namely during the survey carried out at the time of Antall's funeral. At the time, mainly as a result of an increase in the number of uncertain people, people with a specific party preference made up 60 percent of the adult population in Hungary. The Gallup Institute also measured the people's readiness to vote with the help of a two-tier scale. The question was as follows: "The number 7 on this card means that someone is very sure he would vote if elections were held next Sunday. Number 6 means that he is sure. On the other side of the card, number 1 means that he is very sure he would not vote, and number 2 means that he is sure he would not vote. The other numbers represent the various levels between these two intentions. Where would you put yourself on this scale?" Some 68 percent of the people interviewed in January 1994 said that they were "very sure" or "sure" that they would vote. People who said they were very sure they would vote "next Sunday" make up the group of "certain voters." Every second adult Hungarian citizen was in this group in January (15 percent). The MSZP received most support from these people at the end of January 1994, namely 28 percent, or 10 percent more than the second placed Fidesz (18 percent), and roughly twice as many as the MDF (15 percent) and the SZDSZ (14 percent). A total of 8 percent would have voted for the Smallholders' Party on "that Sunday" and a decisive number (7 percent) would have voted for the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKgP]. The number of potential voters for the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is similar to the FKgP supporters (7 percent). Regarding the changes in party preferences, we must notice three elements: 1. The proportion of MSZP supporters increased from 22 percent in October-November to 28 percent in January; 2. In the same period of time, the number of Fidesz supporters dropped from 35 percent to 18 percent; 3. The MDF, which had been receiving an average of 10 percent since spring 1993, received 18 percent after Antall's funeral in December, and 15 percent in January. The percentages measured among the "probable" voters slightly differ from the above figures. The "sure" voters are divided into three groups: A third would be MSZP supporters (32 percent); half as many would support the MDF (15 percent), the SZDSZ (15 percent), and the Fidesz (15 percent), and only half as many again would support the FKgP (7 percent) and the KDNP (7 percent). Finally, let us mention the supporters of "other" parties, namely non-parliamentary parties. The overall proportion of people supporting these parties is 9 percent and, at the moment, none of these parties is in a position to get into parliament.
