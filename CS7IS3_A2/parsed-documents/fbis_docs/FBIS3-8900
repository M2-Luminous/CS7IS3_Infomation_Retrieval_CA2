We still have to pay more than half of the $13-billion debt, but most of it does not have to be paid for several years' time. Polish negotiators reached agreement with the commercial banks in Frankfurt on the night of Thursday to Friday [10-11 March]. The chief of the Polish delegation, Krzysztof Krowacki, says that the entire Polish debt (including interest) will be reduced by 45.2 percent. Poland will purchase a part of the debt this year, but at a low price. The remainder will be converted into bonds with a term of 20 or 30 years. During the four years of talks, Poland kept saying it wanted a 50-percent reduction in its debts, the same percentage waived by the Paris Club of commercial banks in 1990. But, over the past year, Krowacki spoke only of the "relativity" of the conditions necessary for a reduction. Our negotiators were not so much concerned with the size of the reduction. Of greater concern was that Poland should not repay too much, at least not in the beginning. For the time being, we are not going to pay more than $400 million per year and, after five years, not more than $0.5 billion. Following the news of the agreement, the price of the Polish debt on secondary markets fell from 46 to 41.5 cents. "If the price had risen, it woid have meant that the deal was a success for the banks," joked Krowacki. The dealers handling the Polish debt also explained the fallen price by the fact that Poland will repay its creditors less than expected, and much later than expected. Prime Minister Pawlak said that the rapid and favorable agreement is largely attributable to the German banks. "The Germans have the strongest links to the Polish economy, and that is why they wanted to see this deal concluded as quickly as possible," says James Lister-Cheese of the U.S. Morgan Stanley investment bank. "The signing of the agreement means that, as of 1995, we are going to service our debts fully. In this way, our financial relations with the West will undergo a complete normalization," says Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak. Banks and other financial institutions will be all the more willing to give us loans, and foreign investors will have more courage to enter Poland if the banks that finance them stop treating Poland as a high risk. The conclusion of the agreement with the London Club was also one of the conditions imposed on us by the IMF and the World Bank.
