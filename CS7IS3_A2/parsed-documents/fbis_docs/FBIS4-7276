FBIS4-7276 "dreas083aa_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Discusses Unstable Currency Rates Discusses Unstable Currency Rates OW2504004994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0037 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504004994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [By Kohei Murayama] [Text] Washington, April 24 KYODO -- A reaffirmed accord by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations on stabilizing exchange rates reflects Japan's concern over the adverse economic effects of currency volatility, Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Sunday. "I expressed my view that unstable rates will have undesirable effects on the stock and bond markets and cool off business sentiment to put a damper on the economy," Fujii told a press conference after a meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers. Fujii said the G-7 financial leaders reconfirmed their past accord to closely cooperate to realize stable currency rates reflecting economic fundamentals. "The stronger growth nations were referred to as the United States, Canada, and Britain, and the weaker nations as Japan and other G-7 nations." Fujii said. Fujii said he described the state of Japan's economy as "still generally sluggish," but stressed that the February 15.25 trillion yen economic package will help Japan attain a full-fledged recovery. Fujii also said that he explained that the Japanese ruling coalition parties agreed to implement multi-year income tax cuts in a policy accord agreed last Friday on forming a new cabinet. On the current account surplus, Fujii said, "the trend has clearly reversed," citing the change in the effects of external demand on Japan's economic growth. External demand pushed down Japan's real gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.3 percentage point, while domestic demand boosted it by 0.4 point to attain a 0.1 percent growth in fiscal 1993 that ended March 31, Fujii said.
