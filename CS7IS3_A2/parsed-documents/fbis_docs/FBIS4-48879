His visit has promoted the economic cooperation and trade between China and Canada and created an opportunity for further developing the bilateral relations. Zou Jiahua was one of the two Chinese vice premiers who visited Canada over the past year. The visits to Canada by two Chinese leaders during the past one year show the importance China attaches to the development of the Sino-Canadian relations. Likewise, Canada also attaches great importance to Zou Jiahua's visit. While Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Canada last May restored the momentum of development for the Sino-Canadian relations, Zou Jiahua's recent visit provided an opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss ways to expand further the bilateral economic cooperation and trade for years to come. During the visit, Zou Jiahua met with Prime Minister Chretien and all the principal members of the Canadian cabinet. A consensus among them is that the Sino-Canadian cooperation from now on will mainly be in the fields of infrastructure, such as electric power, telecommunications, transport, aviation, and petroleum and natural gas, as well as in service trade. During Zou Jiahua's visit, the two countries signed four cooperation agreements on telecommunications. According to the agreements, the Canadian Government will extend a loan of 200 million Canadian dollars (approximately $150 million) to China for the establishment of joint ventures and for scientific research projects. Zou Jiahua and Canadian leaders spoke highly of the four agreements. During his visit, Zou Jiahua met with the governors of four Canadian provinces and held discussion with Canadian entrepreneurs. They showed great interest in expanding economic cooperation and trade with China, particularly in investment in China. During his meeting with Prime Minister Chretien, Zou Jiahua pointed out: China and Canada are having an unusual opportunity to develop their relations, and a great deal can be done by the two countries to strengthen their mutually beneficial cooperation. Chretien said that both Canada and China are vast in area with abundant resources, each having its strong points; and there is a great potential for them to promote mutually beneficial cooperation. He believed that Zou Jiahua's visit would certainly promote further the economic cooperation and trade between Canada and China.
