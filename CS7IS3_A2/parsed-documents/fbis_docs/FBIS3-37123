He spoke briefly about the results of the recent Russo-Georgian talks, emphasizing that the signing of the bilateral comprehensive agreement was the most important occasion in the history of new Georgia. The head of state said that this had put an end to the political and economic isolation of the republic and initiated a legal basis in the relations between the two states. In Eduard Shevardnadze's view, the unsettled political and economic state of Georgia has a very adverse effect upon the country. A deep paralysis covers all spheres of economy in Georgia. Eduard Shevardnadze emphasized that the escalation of confrontation between Russia and Georgia has a profound effect on the issue of Abkhazia and the situation in Samachablo [South Ossetia], thus making the problem of the settlement of conflicts in the autonomous regions of the country more difficult. It also impedes an important process of the creation of the national army. Eduard Shevardnadze expressed the view that Georgia's membership in the CIS became the first step toward the Russo-Georgian treaty being signed then in Tbilisi and serving interests of the two countries. The chairman of the Georgian parliament drew the parliament's attention to the fact that Russia, in making economic commitments, would allow the republic to catch its breath, and that this really is very important. The head of state expressed the thought that it is very important that the two countries agree to have a contingent of Russian frontier forces guard the border [with Turkey] until professional Georgian cadres are trained. Otherwise, Georgia's borders will be unprotected. Mr. Shevardnadze said that arms required for the Georgian armed forces and interior troops would be received through Russian channels. As for the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict, Russia will have a decisive role in this issue, whatever resolutions the UN Security Council will have passed. Speaking of military cooperation between Russia and Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze said that this is a matter of strategic alliance of the two countries linked historically and in many other ways. The Georgian leader appealed to the deputies to take a realistic approach to the existing situation and to make an unbiased assessment of the possibilities of alternative variants when making a decision on any issue. When answering questions asked by members of parliament, the head of state requested that they demonstrate better manners and proper reciprocal respect when working at the highest legislative body of the country.
