Mogilevskiy, general director of the Sociological Scientific Research Center Joint-Stock Company, under the rubric "Social Monitoring": "A Choice for Centuries?"] [Text] Three-quarters of Petersburg voters would vote today the same way they did on 12 December. On the other hand, 7 percent of those participating in elections today would not turn out altogether, and another 10 percent are not certain they would vote the same way. Another 7 percent of voters today would vote differently. The greatest number of those who definitely would change their decision are among those who voted by party lists--4 percent. The smallest--in federal and one-seat districts--1 percent each. Thus, had the elections taken place today, the Petersburg electorate most likely would have reaffirmed its choice. The only questionable variable is the outcome of the referendum, which required a 50 percent plus one electoral turnout. The elections are an accomplished fact, however, and now Russian voters may watch their doing. It appears that their observations do not add to their joy. In any case, in Petersburg only 9 percent of respondents are satisfied with the composition of both chambers of the parliament; only 2 percent are satisfied with the composition of the State Duma, and 5 percent--with that of the Federation Council. Those not satisfied with the composition of either the State Duma or the Federation Council comprise 45 percent, and 40 percent have no opinion. Of course, different groups of voters have a different idea of the approximate composition of the parliament chambers. It is clear, however, that the deputies' authority in the eyes of Petersburg voters is low. In discussions over the past few weeks a hypothesis was advanced that the success of the LDPR, which received about [figure illegible]8 percent of the vote in Petersburg, was due to the fact that the candidates had been able to recruit new, previously passive, groups of voters. Our research does not support this hypothesis. Ninety-two percent are voters who after 1990 have participated in all or almost all elections and referendums. So most likely a certain change in the preference structure is to be explained by a shift on the part of the electorate to different political values and social expectations. Thus, on the threshold of elections to the City Assembly, voter preferences remain practically the same as they were before 12 December. The political fate of the representative branch in the city will be decided by a group of "familiar" voters, of whom more than 60 percent are women, 70 percent are persons over 40, about 70 percent have higher and intermediate vocational education, as a rule working, and more than 60 percent are workers and office workers. The assembly composition will depend on whether the candidates find arguments and political programs that will preserve or change these people's choice, for, as research shows, it is hardly possible to count on a mass influx of new voters in March. The survey was conducted by the St. Petersburg Sociological Scientific-Research Center by way of telephone polling. The sample included 1,105 respondents. The statistical error along controlled parameters (sex, age, and education) is within 3 percent.
