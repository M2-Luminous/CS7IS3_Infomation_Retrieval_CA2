Amira Yoma has been summoned to appear in court this afternoon to receive the official notification that she has been definitely cleared. President Menem yesterday [13 April] said that he regretted the way his sister-in-law had been treated since she was first accused of being part of the drug money-laundering scheme. Menem also accused the press of blowing up the statements of drug-dealer Andy de la Cruz Iglesias. Bonifatti, who has been tipped for promotion to the Federal Appeals Court, is thought to have quashed the case on the basis of insufficient evidence. Last week Federal Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli had recommended the acquittal of Yoma and other co-defendants. Stornelli is reportedly in line to succeed Bonifatti when he steps up to the Federal Court. In 1991 Amira Yoma along with her then husband Ibrahim al-Ibrahim were accused by various witnesses of having been seen at Ezeiza International Airport with suitcases allegedly full of drug earnings from the United States. The money passed through Customs without difficulty due to Amira's position as Presidential Audiences Secretary at Government House and her husband's senior Customs position, even though he hardly spoke Spanish and held a Syrian passport.
