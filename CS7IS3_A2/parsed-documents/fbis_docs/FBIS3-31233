[Izetbegovic] Mr. Redman reiterated the readiness of the U.S. Government to insist as a NATO member on the complete and consistent execution of the 10 February declaration, to be carried out without condition or change. This is what Mr. Christopher also confirmed in a telephone conversation with me late last night. He called me at about midnight to present the view of the U.S. Government on this issue. He had heard that we were concerned that a certain hesitation had emerged, and that certain misinterpretations by lower-ranking officers in the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] had been put forward. Mr. Christopher -- now that I have mentioned that conversation -- insisted that we too, for our part, observe the cease-fire. I promised him that and that is what we will do. I also said that there would be no front line changes on our part in Sarajevo. The Presidency also reiterated that point yesterday. As for the peace negotiations, Mr. Redman and I have discussed ways for furthering the talks, and (we presented various ideas) on this issue. We concluded, among other things, that the clashes in central Bosnia had to stop in order to facilitate negotiations between us and Croatia on a more constructive basis. When it comes to talks on the resumption of the Geneva negotiations, we expressed our readiness to continue with them in order to reach the finale, that is, to establish a just peace. As you know, the United States has decided to participate actively in these talks, which is a good sign and will definitely contribute to these talks being more successful and effective than has been the case so far. [Musabasic] Charles Redman first stressed that the talks in Sarajevo were very useful and productive, and added: [Redman, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] Of course a lot of people here in Sarajevo will focus on the NATO ultimatum and whether it will be followed up. I certainly hope that it will be, and I think that there are many indications that it will be realized. However, at the same time one of the main reasons for my being here is to see whether we can use this new momentum to put some energy into the peace negotiations. I believe that we all agree. We have held very serious talks on ways in which we can try to strengthen the efforts towards resolving the negotiations in order to reach finally a solution acceptable to all sides. It will not be easy. It is something that has been discussed for months, but I hope that the involvement of the United States -- with strong support and in full cooperation with the European Union, and consultations with the Russian Federation -- will help us find new ways to resolve the problems that have been preventing a negotiated settlement from being reached. So, this is still in an exploratory phase, as we consider various options. I think that we have identified some useful ideas, and I will be working on that, (and in some other places), but I will remain in constant touch with President Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and the government in Sarajevo so that we can reach a lasting peace in Bosnia.
