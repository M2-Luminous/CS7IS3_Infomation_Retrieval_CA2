'Arafat will not come alone. It now appears that two weeks ago the PLO submitted to Israel a list of 600 senior PLO activists, officials, and officers from Tunis in order to obtain approval for their arrival in Gaza and Jericho. Another list of 600 names is on its way. Altogether some 1,200 men and their families will arrive. Contrary to 'Arafat's original plan, his new move calls for moving most of the PLO bodies from Tunis to the territories. Only the foreign relations offices of Faruq Qaddumi and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] will remain in Tunis along with several other branches. These offices will constitute a powerful rear headquarters. 'Arafat will also keep his residence in (Yugorta) Street. The practical meaning of 'Arafat's move is the elimination -- at least on the face of it -- of PLO-Tunis and replanting it among the higher echelons of the PLO in the territories. 'Arafat has apparently decided not to keep too many institutions in Tunis over and above the autonomy institutions. One of the reasons for this is that he has received hints from the Tunisian president that it is time for a parting of the ways. Some of the candidates for return have decided to temporarily leave their families in Amman. Most of them want to live in the West Bank rather than in Gaza and Jericho, in which only a handful of them can be housed. Israel has not given its approval yet, but most of the requests will be approved. The lists include some important surprises. Several Fatah officials who were known for their opposition to the Oslo agreement want to come with 'Arafat. Others, such as 'Abbas Zaki and Hani al-Hasan, are still undecided. In the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine there are signs of a split. Some 40 activists from the organization of George Habash -- a firm opponent of the agreement -- want to arrive with 'Arafat. Among them are (Abu-Nidal Musalmah), a veteran official in charge of secret activities in the territories, and 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. One of the two may join the Palestinian Authority. A similar phenomenon can be noticed in Nayif Hawatimah's organization, where some 20 activists are included in the lists of those wanting to return, among them Taysir Khalid, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. At the present time all of the above will apparently be allowed to return for only a visit. The list, which is on its way to Israel, includes approximately 300 Fatah fighters from Tyre and Sidon who are awaiting the order to leave Lebanon and come to Gaza.
