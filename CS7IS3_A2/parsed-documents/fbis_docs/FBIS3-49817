Although Izetbegovic's troops are attacking western Bosnia from all weapons at their disposal, the western Bosnia defence lines have remained intact, the local news agency ZBIA reports on Sunday and adds that there are casualties on both sides. Strongly opposed to the proclamation of autonomy of western Bosnia four months ago, Izetbegovic has ordered troops loyal to him to restore his rule there by force. Bosnian Serb military sources say that Moslems and Croats are mercilessly fighting each other along the Lasva, Rama and Neretva rivers in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fiercest fighting has been reported in the areas of Vitez, Novi Travnik and Busovaca in central Bosnia, and at Blagaj near Mostar in Herzegovina, with each side suffering heavy casualties. Serb military sources say that no major changes have been reported on the Moslem-Croat frontline. The Zagreb-based Croatian radio confirms reports about major fighting near Novi Travnik on Saturday, where it says Moslems shelled Croat positions. The same source reports that ten Croat refugees, fleeing before the Moslem terror in Bugojno in central Bosnia, arrived to the Croat town of Livno in the south-west by passing through Serb-held Kupres. The refugees say that about 3,000 Croats and 500 Serbs are still detained in Bugojno which the Moslems took over from the Croats last autumn.
