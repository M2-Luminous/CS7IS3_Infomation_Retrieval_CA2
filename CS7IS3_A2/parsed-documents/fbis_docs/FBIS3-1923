At an opening ceremony of a new session of the central party school, Hu said that the Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of contemporary China, and it serves as the scientific guide for the progress of China. This session of the party school has enlisted more than 2,600 officials and army officers, including officials at minister and provincial governor level. He noted that there will inevitably be some complicated problems and difficulties in the process of socialist construction, especially in the process of accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. He said that the real understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will help unify the thinking of party members, correctly handle the relations between the reforms, development and stability, and overcome various social contradictions. He also urged the attendants to the party school to study the theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy so as to raise their capabilities in work on the socialist market economic sector.
