The provisions of this section apply only to assets for which an election has been made under paragraph (k) of this section. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: (1) Unadjusted depreciable basis is the basis of an asset for purposes of section 1011 without regard to any adjustments described in sections 1016(a)(2) and (3). (2) Unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account is the sum of the unadjusted depreciable bases of all assets included in the general asset account. (3) Adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account less the adjustments to basis described in sections 1016(a)(2) and (3). (4) Expensed cost is the amount of any allowable credit or deduction treated as a deduction allowable for depreciation or amortization for purposes of section 1245 (for example, a credit allowable under section 30 or a deduction allowable under section 179, 179A, or 190). (c) Establishment of general asset accounts_ (1) Assets eligible for general asset accounts_ (i) General rules. Assets that are subject to either the general depreciation system of section 168(a) or the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) may be accounted for in one or more general asset accounts. An asset may be included in a general asset account only to the extent of the asset's unadjusted depreciable basis (for example, if, in 1995, a taxpayer places in service an asset that costs $20,000 and elects under section 179 to expense $17,500 of that asset's cost, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset is $2,500 and, therefore, only $2,500 of the asset's cost may be included in a general asset account). However, an asset is not to be included in a general asset account if the asset is used both in a trade or business (or for the production of income) and in a personal activity at any time during the taxable year in which the asset is first placed in service by the taxpayer.
