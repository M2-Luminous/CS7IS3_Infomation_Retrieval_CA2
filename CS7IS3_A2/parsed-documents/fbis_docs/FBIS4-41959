A tentative list of issues that will be debated in the period from 28 June to 1 July was approved. At the insistence of Oleh Vitovych, chairman of the subcommission for human rights issues, deputies included in the session's agenda the issue of temporarily halting the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, with 141 votes in favor. The Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security was charged with preparing this issue for the parliament's consideration. In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Oleh Vitovych said: "We consider that the largest countries, Russia and the United States, should begin the process of disarmament throughout the world and that all other states should follow their example." In his words, the material and technical aspects of "unilateral disarmament" do not benefit Ukraine; none of the promises made by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton at the signing of the trilateral agreement with regard to the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine is being fulfilled. In Oleh Vitovych's view, the biggest tactical and strategic mistake made by the previous Ukrainian parliament was that its deputies "took the liberty of hearing the view of the well-known pacifist, Dmytro Pavlychko, who stubbornly forced the issue through." Oleh Vitovych also said that he has had a meeting with Leonid Smolyakov, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, during which he accused the Russian side of interfering in Ukraine's internal affairs, particularly in Crimea. Vitoych considers that only nuclear weapons could become the single guarantor of peace on Ukrainian lands. He said: "There will be no war in the country until the last warhead crosses the Russian border." In Oleh Vitovych's view, the inclusion in the session's agenda of the issue on temporarily halting the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine is proof that the overwhelming majority of deputies have seen common sense and that they detest President Leonid Kravchuk. People's deputy Serhiy Dovhan, chairman of the Peasant Party of Ukraine, expressed the assumption in an interview with a UNIAN correspondent that deputies agreed to consider this issue because they want information on the state of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons and on how the obligations taken on by Ukraine, Russia, and the United States during the signing of the trilateral agreement are being observed. In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, people's deputy Vasyl Durdynets said that the "inclusion in the Supreme Council's agenda -- by a small group of deputies -- of such a proposal does not in any way mean that the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine would really be halted." Vasyl Durdynets is counting on the responsibility of those who will prepare this issue for the deputies' consideration. He also said that the Center deputies' group has still not discussed its joint position on this matter. Supreme Council Presidium member Hryhoriy Omelchenko stressed that "if Ukraine signed the trilateral agreement made by the presidents and announced its non-nuclear status, then it should be consistent in abiding by this position." Hryhoriy Omelchenko noted that this also means the implementation of the trilateral agreement by all three states. The Union of Officers of Ukraine, of which Hryhoriy Omelchenko is deputy head, has still not discussed this issue at its meeting. At Les Tanyuk's insistence, the issue of using a $500 million dollar credit which was given to Ukraine's agro-industrial complex, was also included on the agenda. In Les Tanyuk's words, Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, is directly involved in distributing these funds. After this, deputies began discussing the introduction of changes and additions to Article 7 of the Ukrainian law "On the Militia". Leonid Borodych, chairman of the Commission for Issues of Legality and Law and Order, argued the necessity of introducing amendments, and said that the militia had recently been used for political purposes and that it is implementing someone's social orders. An example is Crimea where, as a result of using the militia for purposes other than what it was designated for, (protecting the president and his family) crime has shown a tendency to increase. It is proposed that an amendment be introduced to Article 7 in the following terms: "The militia is subordinate to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs and the minister exercises leadership over all militia subunits in Ukraine." It is also proposed to form a main directorate of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in Crimea and a main directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol and in the oblasts within the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Leonid Borodych is convinced that the possibility exists of introducing such a body in the system of the Internal Affairs Ministry without any forcible methods. However, some deputies stressed that such a decision could lead to the situation between Ukraine and Crimea becoming tense and that is why it is necessary to postpone it until either after the second round of presidential elections or until after the work on bringing the Crimean constitution into line with that of Ukraine's has ended. After the discussion the proposed amendment to the Ukrainian law "On the militia" was adopted with a single remark -- the directorate which is currently subordinate only to the Internal Affairs Ministry will report to the local council about its activities.
