The ruling is in effect from March 11 till 27. If the Ostankino company hasn't renegotiated its contract with Estonian Telecommunications or paid its debts by March 28, transmission of its programs will stop altogether. Ostankino owes Estonian Telecommunications about 105,000 Deutsche marks for 1993 and another 80,000 marks for January transmissions. Under the contract concluded between the Ostankino television company and Estonian Telecommunications, Ostankino itself pays for the transmission of its programs in Estonia.
