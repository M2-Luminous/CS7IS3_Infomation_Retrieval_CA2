This year 25 joint operations on the territory of the two states will take place, Ruhe told journalists. "Usually this sort of event is staged only in the second or third year of cooperation. This illustrates the accelerated contacts between the two countries' armed forces," he added. The ministers are proposing an exchange of experts, not units or joint maneuvers. The general staffs are to discuss the exchange of units, Andrejcak said. Ruhe said that Slovak and German troops would probably first meet in Poland to where they had been invited. The Slovak Army will consult Bundeswehr experts regarding the creation of a task force brigade.
