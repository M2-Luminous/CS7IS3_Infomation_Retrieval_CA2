In the event of his election as president, Leonid Kuchma considers his most important steps to be resolving issues of taxation policy, the revocation of a fixed currency exchange rate, getting banking, credit, and financial activity going, and resolving the non-payments problem. In Kuchma's opinion, one should conduct forced small privatization and return currency from abroad. The candidate for the post of president believes that land and all means of production should become goods in future, but if one were to declare land to be goods now, one could end up with nothing. Once again Leonid Kuchma expressed himself against the election of a prime minister before the presidential election, and noted that although he considers Vitaliy Masol to be an experienced individual, Masol's present views are not known, and on the whole he considers "all of this" to be "a dangerous game." At the news conference, Leonid Kuchma renounced some of the assertions he made during his previous meeting with representatives of the nonstate sector of the economy.
