(2) EPA retains the authority to require testing to enforce compliance and to prevent non-compliance with the Fuel Dispensing Spitback Standard. (g) Inherently low refueling emission testing waiver. (1) Vehicles using fuels/fuel systems inherently low in refueling emissions are not required to conduct testing to demonstrate compliance with the refueling emission standards set forth in §§86.099&hyph;8, 86.001&hyph;9 or 86.004&hyph;9: Provided, that_ (i) This provision is only available for petroleum diesel fuel. It is only available if the Reid Vapor Pressure of in-use diesel fuel is equal to or less than 1 psi (7 kPa) and for diesel vehicles whose fuel tank temperatures do not exceed 13 ○F (54 ○C), and (ii) To certify using this provision the manufacturer must attest to the following evaluation: ``Due to the low vapor pressure of diesel fuel and the vehicle tank temperatures, hydrocarbon vapor concentrations are low and the vehicle meets the 0.20 grams/gallon refueling emission standard without a control system.'' (2) The certification required in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section must be provided in writing and must apply for the full useful life of the vehicle. (3) EPA reserves the authority to require testing to enforce compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the refueling emission standard. (4) Vehicles certified to the refueling emission standard under this provision shall not be counted in the sales percentage compliance determinations for the 2004, 2005 and subsequent model years. 15. A new §86.004&hyph;30 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §86.004&hyph;30 Certification.
