During the first grand gathering of the two academies, scientists and engineers will explore China's future development in science and technology and elect the first batch of foreign academicians for the CAS, the country's top scientific body, as well as elect its president and vice-presidents. All the seven members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao -- met with the academicians present at the two conferences and posed for a picture with them. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, congratulated them on the inauguration of the CAE and the holding of the seventh academicians' conference of CAS. Jiang called the period from now until the middle of the next century a great historical period for the invigoration of the Chinese nation. He said it is imperative to rely on scientific and technological advances to achieve the economic and social development, well-being of the people and prosperity of the nation, in a country with the world's largest population, weak foundation and relatively lower stock of natural resources, he said. The establishment of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, he noted, will give scope to the creativity of engineers and help promote the research, design, construction and operation of the engineering technology, said Jiang. In his address to the conference, Premier Li Peng said China will unswervingly implement the guiding principle of Deng Xiaoping's thesis: "Science and technology is the first productive force," adhere to the principle that "economic construction should rely on science and technology while science and technology must serve economic construction". He said the target of China's scientific and technological restructuring is to build a new structure which goes with the development of the socialist market economy and the development value of science and technology, integration of science and technology with the economy so as to promote scientific and technological advances. He expressed the hope that CAS and CAE will work together to make greater contributions for the modernization of the country. Lu Jiaxi, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and honorary chairman of the Presidium of CAS, delivered an opening speech at the conference. Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAS, and Zhu Guangya, executive chairman of the Presidium of the inauguration conference of CAE, made their work reports to the conference. During the conference, the Chinese scientists will elect the first batch of foreign academicians for CAS, amend and pass "the Academicians' Constitution of CAS" and issue the Hua Luogeng Science Award. "The Constitution of CAE" will be discussed and drafted during the current conference. Among those present at today's conference were also Zou Jiahua, member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee and vice-premier, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary-general of the State Council, as well as Qian Weichang and Qian Zhengying, both vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
