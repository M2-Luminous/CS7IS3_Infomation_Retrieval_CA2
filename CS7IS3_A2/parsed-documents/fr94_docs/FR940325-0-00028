FR940325-0-00028 FR940325-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Office of the Attorney General 28 CFR Part 0 [AG Order No. 1857&hyph;94] Delegation of Authority Under the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, As Amended and Redesignated by the National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993 AGENCY: Office of the Attorney General, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 has been amended by the National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993 to include joint ventures for production within its coverage and redesignated as the ``National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993.'' The Act now provides persons engaging in eligible joint ventures for production, as well as persons engaging in joint research and development ventures, with the opportunity to reduce their potential liability for damages under the antitrust laws, provided they file with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission a timely notification concerning the organization and objectives of their venture. The Attorney General or Federal Trade Commission must then publish a notice in the Federal Register that identifies the parties to the venture and describes generally the area of planned activity of the venture. The National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993 also impose certain reporting requirements on the Attorney General. Due to the antitrust-related nature of these notification, publication and reporting functions, the Attorney General has delegated her authority under the Act to the Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Constance K. Robinson, Deputy Director of Operations, Antitrust Division; U.S. Department of Justice; 10th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., room 3214; Washington, DC 20530. Telephone (202) 514&hyph;3544.
