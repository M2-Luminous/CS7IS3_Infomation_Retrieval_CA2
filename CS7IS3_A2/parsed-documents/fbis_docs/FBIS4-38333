The statement was signed by the All-Union Tatar Social Center, the Sovereignty committee, the Marjani society, the Azatlyk youth movement, the Working Kazan movement and the Republican Party of Tatarstan. They believed that Yeltsin had failed to honor his pledge on the Tatar people's sovereignty that he had made during his previous tour of the republic. They argued that the elections of the Russian president had not been held in Tatarstan, the new Russian Constitution was not passed there and the Moscow-Kazan treaty ran counter to the people's desires expressed in the referendum. According to unconfirmed reports, two members of the Tatar independence party Ittifak and Azatlyk went on hunger strike in protest against Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan.
