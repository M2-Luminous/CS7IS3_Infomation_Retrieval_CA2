Does Germany have to accept this? [Rexrodt] Elf [Aquitaine] obviously wants to reduce its participation and throw this part at the feet of the Germans. We cannot accept that. Contracts must be fulfilled, particularly since there has been strong pressure in French politics. In addition, this would delay follow-up investments in Saxony-Anhalt and cost jobs. [FOCUS] Can Germany force Elf to build the refinery? [Rexrodt] We have made our position very clear to the French Government for weeks. The chancellor sent a letter to Prime Minister Balladur, but the answer was noncommittal. I do not want to put a strain on the German-French relationship, but we cannot be dealt with in this way. Elf must begin with the construction immediately. Then we can help to find more partners later on. [FOCUS] What can Bonn use as a threat? [Rexrodt] If the French do not build the refinery, they must give back Minol, and we will claim 1.5 billion German marks in contractual penalty. Then the French side has to see how it wants to include such penalties in Elf's stock exchange profile. Withdrawing will not work. [FOCUS] Elf loses its incentive because Minol does not yield as much as expected. [Rexrodt] In the long run, the involvement will pay off. We deliberately offered the beautiful bride Minol with its hump-back relative, the outdated refinery. If Elf had tackled Minol with real entrepreneurial elan, Minol would not have incurred such high losses either.
