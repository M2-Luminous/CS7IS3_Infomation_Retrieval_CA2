According to Menem, the issue of a law on patents demanded by the United States was not broached during his talk with his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton. However, U.S. Ambassador to Argentina James Cheek hinted to the contrary. "Ask your president," responded Cheek, when the NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS NEWS AGENCY special correspondent asked him about the subject. He nonetheless hastened to add: "I would not say that this subject was not discussed." Menem told journalists that negotiations "are developing along normal lines and dialogue is under way." When asked whether pressure was being applied to have the issue settled by 30 June, Menem underscored: "There are neither threats nor anything remotely similar." The deadline the U.S. Government established for Argentina to enact the new law on medicine patents so as not to be on the list of countries liable for commercial sanctions expires on 30 June. U.S. pharmaceutical companies have for a long time been requesting that their Argentine counterparts acknowledge intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of medicines. The Argentine executive branch has sent a patents bill to Congress, but it has not been discussed yet because several sectors involved have seriously questioned some of its points. The first deadline for the passing of the patents law had been established for 30 April. On that day, Kantor was to appear before the U.S. Congress to charge Argentina with not doing things by the book in commercial matters and to recommend sanctions against it. Nevertheless, Kantor finally relented and decided to let things ride until the end of June. Concurrent with this latent threat, several U.S. officials have visited Argentina recently -- including Vice President Albert Gore -- and they all invariably spoke of the need for the enactment of the patents law. When U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald Brown arrives in Argentina on 28 June, he will prove to be no exception. He already has announced that the protection of patents and rights to intellectual property is "one of the most important considerations that likely investors take into account to determine a country's investment climate." Kantor himself discussed this issue with Menem personally when both met in Chile for President Eduardo Frei's inauguration. Now, when everything led to a surmise that the issue of patents would be on the agenda of the meeting between Clinton and Menem, the latter took pains to deny it. "We did not talk about that subject with President Clinton. I would like to tell you that there is good news for the Argentine Republic concerning that subject and rightly before the established date, but no questions, please," he stressed. To conclude, the head of state looked at the journalists and asked them to bring up the subject "after 30 June."
