Category 4 passing applications will be forwarded for rating to Rating Panel(s). One or more Rating Panels, comprised of HUD Field representatives appointed by Headquarters, shall be convened for the purpose. Category 4 applications will be rated by the Rating Panel(s) based on Field Office analyses. Headquarters will determine the funds required to approve category 1, 2, and 3 applications and select category 4 applications based on Rating Panel ratings and recommendations. B.
