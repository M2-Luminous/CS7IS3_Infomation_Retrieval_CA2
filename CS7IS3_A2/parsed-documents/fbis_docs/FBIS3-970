Can you tell us what the objective was of your visit and your itinerary? [Domingos] My visit had two parts. The first part involved a program organized by the U.S. Information Agency. Our group included people from different nationalities. We visited different institutions, such as the Senate's Center for Strategic Affairs, the Carnegie Peace Institute. [passage omitted] [Jossias] And what was the second part of your program? [Domingos] As an official of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], I took the opportunity to hold talks with U.S. officials. As you are aware, we could not travel to the United States during the war to make contacts in favor of Renamo. Once I was in the United States, I could not lose the opportunity to establish contacts that would be useful to my party. Thus, I again returned to New York and Washington. In New York, I held talks with a number of UN officials. The highest contact I had was with James Jonah, UN assistant secretary general for political affairs. In Washington, I had contacts at the level of the State Department, and the highest contact I had was with George Moose's assistant because Moose was out of the country. I held very important meetings with people in charge of African affairs. I was very fortunate in my contacts because they were held at a time when independent voices spoke well of the progress of the Mozambican peace process and the troops' confinement. People always thought it would not be possible to reach a peace agreement with Renamo. They thought Renamo had no control over its troops. One year has passed and our troops have not carried out one unusual movement. We were able to show that we can order an effective cease-fire, that we are able to confine our men in a disciplined manner. We were able to demonstrate that there is command within Renamo and this gave us a certain credibility with the U.S. public and the State Department. When all this information is received by the United States, it gives us a certain credibility that we did not enjoy before. I had the opportunity to speak to people who in the past were Renamo's critics, like Chester Crocker. It could not be expected that he would receive someone from Renamo. Herman Cohen, with whom I met on many occasions in Rome, was also very amenable. I was also fortunate because of other reasons: My visit to the United States took place at a time when the Electoral Law had already been approved, the electoral commissions and the Elections Administration Technical Secretariat are already functioning. There is significant progress in the troops' confinement process, particularly considering that Renamo is confining larger percentages of troops compared with the government. I also had contacts with the International Center for Strategic Studies, the Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute. They were all very positive meetings. [Jossias] What was the reason for all these contacts? [Domingos] Most of my meetings were aimed at briefing the officials there about the present situation in Mozambique and to prepare the visit of my president to the United States. [Jossias] When is he visiting the United States? [Domingos] Well, at first, we thought the visit would take place in April, but we have now realized that that is not the best time. First, there will be Easter celebrations during the month of April and many people go on holidays. Second, in April, there will be elections in South Africa which will attract the attention of both the U.S. people and Mozambicans. There is a very short period between Easter celebrations and the elections. That is why we set President Dhlakama's visit to the United States for May. [Jossias] Does the choice of the date depend entirely on you or does it also depend on the United States? [Domingos] We made the last alterations together. First, President Dhlakama will visit the United Nations at the invitation of the UN general secretary. Then he is thinking of going to Washington for contacts with the State Department. [Jossias] Mr. Raul Domingos, do you think you have been able to change the image that the United States had of Renamo, that it was a terrorist movement? [Domingos] Well, at least I, myself, was not received as a terrorist. I cannot say that I was the one who changed the situation because that cannot be done in a few days. A series of actions that we have been carrying out contributed toward the change of image. The image that people had of Renamo in Washington, United States, is no longer the image of Chester Crocker's Renamo and the Gerson Report. The image that Renamo had as a result of the Gerson Report disappeared following my visit, the progress registered here with the approval of the Electoral Law, the beginning of the confinement process, and the behavior of our forces in assembly areas. All this helped to change the image. What I did in the United States was to give the true picture of Renamo. I can therefore safely say that the present Renamo's image is not the Gerson Report's image. It is the image of the Rome Accord. [Jossias] And what about the coincidence between your departure for the United States and the publication of the U.S. State Department report accusing Renamo of human rights abuse...didn't it harm your visit? [Domingos] Not at all. I was at the State Department, and I told the officials there that the accusation was false. The State Department lamented the report and also agreed that it was not true. It said there are people who collect information and write and the department has no authority over these people. The department officials believe the report was exaggerated. I believe that this is the work of forces hostile to Renamo and perhaps it was not just a mere coincidence that the report was published when I was leaving for the United States. All the same, there were other credible news sources which at the time said good things about Renamo. When I arrived in the United States, the NEW YORK TIMES had just published a series of positive information on Renamo. This established the necessary balance, which enabled us to see that our image there was positive. [Jossias] Did you meet with Renamo representatives during your visit to the United States? [Domingos] Yes, I met with some members. As you are aware, they do not live in the same city. Some of them had come here, but they were very happy to see me there. As they said, it was the first time that a Renamo leader from the bush in Maringue had visited the United States. Only Renamo officials living in Germany and Portugal had visited the United States. Thus, they said I was bringing special warmth because I was coming inside the country. During my visit to the United States, I was able to introduce my colleagues there to officials in the State Department. It was not an official introduction because of the formalities involved. All the same, I took the opportunity to introduce them as our men there and this gave them greater strength. [Jossias] Did you meet with other Mozambicans, apart from Renamo members? [Domingos] I was unable to because of my working agenda. [Jossias] What went wrong during your visit to the United States? [Domingos] Nothing really. If I had to make an assessment of my visit, I would only think of one thing that was bad, the weather. It was very cold there.
