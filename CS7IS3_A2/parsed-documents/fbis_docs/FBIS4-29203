Masatoshi Miyama testified under oath at the House of Representatives Budget Committee about the former premier's alleged shady financial deals, which partly led Hosokawa to announce April 8 his intention to resign. Miyama strongly denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political donation, adding he can "swear by heaven and earth." The former secretary carried 20 million yen in cash to Sagawa Kyubin in fiscal 1983 and handed over 10 million yen annually from fiscal 1984 until the loan was paid back in full, he said. Miyama, however, said Hosokawa did not pay back the interest on the 100 million yen loan. Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., which was later merged into Sagawa Kyubin Co., proposed to Miyama in February or March 1983 that the trucking group would pay the interest as a political donation for Hosokawa, and he accepted the proposal, Miyama said. In his resignation announcement, Hosokawa said he discovered that loan interest was received by his office as a political contribution for him under an accord with Sagawa Kyubin. About Hosokawa's alleged purchase of 300 shares in telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), Miyama supported Hosokawa's previous explanations that the 1986 transaction was carried out by the former premier's late father-in-law, not by Hosokawa himself. Miyama, however, said he did not tell Hosokawa's former financial consultant Shozo Fujiki that the stock transaction would be made by Hosokawa's father-in-law. Shortly before Hosokawa's announcement to step down, Fujiki told a news conference that he had thought it was Hosokawa's transaction when he helped the deal. "Now I feel it was insincere," said Miyama, suggesting he acted as Hosokawa's secretary when he arranged the transaction. Fujiki also said during the news conference that Miyama asked a financial company if Hosokawa can borrow money for the NTT share purchase under a different person's name. Hosokawa was Kumamoto governor at that time. Miyama denied the allegation, saying, "such a thing is not in my memory at all." Miyama also said Hosokawa has not declared to tax authorities some 57 million yen in profit made through investments via former magazine publisher Yusei Kuwahata. Miyama said most of the profits were used for Hosokawa's political activities. Hosokawa said in his April 8 announcement he used his personal funds for dealings via an "old friend" from 1981 and obtained profits in a way he said could have violated the law. After the Diet testimony by his former aide, Hosokawa emphatically said he now has a good reason to reject any call by the opposition that he testify himself, and his remarks were echoed by top officials of the ruling coalition. The testimony clearly demonstrates that the corruption charges against Hosokawa are groundless, said Masuo Matsuoka of Japan New Party, which is headed by Hosokawa. "That settled the whole issue," said Kozo Watanabe of Shinseito, another coalition party. The two main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, have no intention of stopping hounding the former prime minister. They are poised to make a renewed demand for Hosokawa to testify, hoping to set the stage for submission of a motion of no confidence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. But the ruling coalition will dismiss such a call, coalition executives said. "There is nothing left that requires further clarification from Hosokawa," one Shinseito kingpin said. The testimony by Miyama has relieved the shaky coalition of concerns about possible political repercussions from the issue, insiders said. The lingering broadside against Hosokawa's past financial impropriety "will have no impact on the political situation," said Shinseito's Watanabe. Some coalition officials also took a swipe at the SDP's move to join forces with the LDP in demanding Hosokawa's testimony. "That kind of action will make our alliance talks with the SDP impossible," one coalition executive said.
