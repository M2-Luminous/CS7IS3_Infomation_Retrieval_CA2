Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian nationalists, again spoke unfavorably about the Czech Republic last week. What is your reaction to his statement that the Czechs will soon lose Moravia and keep only Prague and breweries producing bitter beer? [Klaus] I admire his general knowledge as he says such things without the slightest doubt--once about Japan, then again about Russia's southern Asian neighbors or about Europe. I do not think there is any need to comment on this. As far as this is concerned, I am troubled by a very different thing, which was also very clearly demonstrated at the Davos Forum. The issue is not Zhirinovskiy himself because a considerable number of Zhirinovskiys can emerge provided certain conditions exist inside a country, if that country is not coping with its internal events, as Russia is not currently coping with its task of transformation, transformation of the country with its past into something totally different. And this creates fertile soil for such remarks. Thus, there is no need to make witty comments on Zhirinovskiy's statement. The issue is what small contribution can be made in order to deprive such Zhirinovskiys of their fertile soil. [Stahlavsky] What would be the Czech Government's reaction if Mr. Zhirinovskiy expressed an interest in visiting the Czech Republic? [Klaus] I would not like to formulate any official stand right now. First, I hope he will not get any such idea. I hope no one will invite him here, although I can imagine some small extremist groups that might be interested in doing so. [passage omitted] Of course, the Czech Republic is generally in favor of the free movement of people in the world. We would not like to create a precedent by preventing someone by default from entering our territory. This is what the communist regime did so many times. We need to be careful in this field. However, I must say that we are not inclined to invite this guest.
