His Excellency Khieu Samphan and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] totally support the royal appeal with a view to achieving national reconciliation and peace, thereby quickly ending the Vietnamese war of aggression. With this objective, the PDK has organized a delegation to attend the roundtable meeting without any preconditions. Nonetheless, the two-headed government, Princeling Ranariddh, and the puppet Hun Sen, while claiming to support the meeting without preconditions, have created stumbling blocks to sabotage the parley. For instance, on 20 May 1994 the prince and the puppet made a blatant statement imposing certain conditions, especially a cease-fire prior to the meeting. At the behest of the communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance, the two puppets have repeated that a cease-fire is a precondition. The following is our answer: 1. The two heads and their bosses want to fool the national and international community into believing they really want peace and national reconciliation. In reality, they are fanning the flames of war. 2. The goal of the Vietnamese and the Western alliance is to make the roundtable meeting fail, thus delaying it. This would allow them to retreat, reorganize their military forces, and wait for the military aid they are busy seeking for the two puppets' forces. These forces are on the brink of collapse because of a lack of combat troops. They are retreating and regrouping their forces by drafting people to serve as militiamen and reserve troops they call local self-defense units. This is a maneuver to force people to serve as soldiers and fight while at the same time inflaming the war. 3. Princeling Ranariddh and the puppet Hun Sen have vociferously asked for military aid for the sole purpose of further fomenting the war and killing their fellow countrymen. The communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance have ordered them to do this. They do not want to see national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. This is the true nature and the root cause of the ongoing war triggered by the communist Vietnamese and the alliance, who are the ringleaders. The persistence of the communist Vietnamese and the alliance in continuing the war clearly shows that the roundtable will be sabotaged by every means. The communist Vietnamese and the alliance and their two puppets intend to use the roundtable while they retreat and reorganize their forces to further attack the people and Democratic Kampuchea. The nation, people, and Democratic Kampuchea can see through the scheme of the two-headed clique and its bosses. They are determined to join hands more closely and continue their struggle against these schemes. We want to achieve national reconciliation and genuine peace, thereby allowing the people to live peacefully, work on their farm land, and earn a living.
