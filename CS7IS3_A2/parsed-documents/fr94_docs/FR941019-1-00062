FR941019-1-00062 FR941019-1-00009 D. Legal Topics E. Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources I. Statutory Provisions This notice announces the commencement of a review of regulations for assessing natural resource damages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) (CERCLA) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (CWA). Under CERCLA, certain categories of potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are liable for natural resource damages resulting from a release of a hazardous substance. CERCLA sec. 107(a). Natural resource damages are monetary compensation for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(a)(4)(C). CWA creates similar liability for natural resource damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters. CWA sec. 311(f). Only designated natural resource trustees may recover natural resource damages. CWA recognizes the authority of Federal and State officials to serve as natural resource trustees. CERCLA recognizes the authority of Federal and State officials as well as Indian tribes to act as natural resource trustees. CERCLA defines ``State'' to include: The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction. CERCLA sec. 101(27). Damages may be recovered for those natural resource injuries that are not fully remedied by response actions as well as public economic values lost from the date of the discharge or release until the resources have fully recovered. All sums recovered in compensation for natural resource injuries must be used to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). Trustee officials may also recover the reasonable costs of assessing natural resource damages. CERCLA requires the promulgation of regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting either from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under CWA or from a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(1). These regulations are to identify the ``best available'' procedures for assessing natural resource damages. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2). CERCLA requires that the natural resource damage assessment regulations include two types of assessment procedures. ``Type A'' procedures are ``standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(A). ``Type B'' procedures are ``alternative protocols for conducting assessments in individual cases.'' CERCLA sec. 301(c)(2)(B). Assessments performed by Federal and State trustee officials in accordance with the natural resource damage assessment regulations receive a rebuttable presumption in court. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(2)(C). The promulgation of these regulations was delegated to the Department of the Interior (the Department). E.O. 12316, as amended by E.O. 12580. The natural resource damage provisions of CWA were amended by the Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) (OPA). The authority to sue for natural resource damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters was extended to not only Federal and State natural resource trustees but also Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees. OPA also authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop new natural resource damage assessment regulations for discharges of oil into navigable waters. The Department is coordinating its rulemakings with NOAA to ensure, to the maximum extent appropriate, that consistent processes are established for assessing natural resource damages under CERCLA and OPA. OPA provides that any rule in effect under a law replaced by OPA will continue in effect until superseded. OPA sec. 6001(b). In particular, Senate committee report language makes it clear that ``[t]he existing Interior Department rules *␣*␣* may be used with a rebuttable presumption in the interim'' until NOAA promulgates new regulations. S. Rep. No. 101&hyph;94, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1990). Therefore, until NOAA promulgates its regulations, the Department's regulations may be used to obtain a rebuttable presumption for natural resource damage assessments under OPA. The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations must be reviewed, and revised as appropriate, every two years. CERCLA sec. 301(c)(3). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments as well as technical type A and type B procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. The purpose of this advance notice is to announce the beginning of the biennial review of the administrative process and all but one of the type B procedures. II. Overview of the Department's Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations The Department has published various final rules for the assessment of natural resource damages: 51 FR 27674 (Aug. 1, 1986); 52 FR 9042 (March 20, 1987); 53 FR 5166 (Feb. 22, 1988); and 53 FR 9769 (March 25, 1988). These rulemakings are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 43 CFR part 11. The Department also recently published a final rule revising the administrative process and the type B procedures that has not yet been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. 59 FR 14261 (March 25, 1994). The Department's natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments. The administrative process consists of four phases: The Preassessment Phase, the Assessment Plan Phase, the Assessment Phase, and the Post-Assessment Phase. The regulations also provide technical type A and type B procedures to be used during the Assessment Phase for the actual determination of injuries and damages. During this biennial review, the Department intends to examine all aspects of the Preassessment Phase, Assessment Plan Phase, and Post-Assessment Phase, as well as all but one of the type B procedures available for use during the Assessment Phase. The Department is providing the following brief summary of its existing regulations to assist commenters. Commenters should consult 43 CFR part 11 and 59 FR 14261 to obtain more detailed information about the administrative process and type B procedures. A. Preassessment Phase The Preassessment Phase covers the activities that precede the actual assessment. Upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials decide whether further assessment actions are warranted. The Department's regulations provide a number of criteria to assist trustee officials in making this decision. The trustee officials' decision is documented in the Preassessment Screen Determination. For more information on the Preassessment Phase, see subpart B of 43 CFR part 11, as amended by 59 FR 14281. B. Assessment Plan Phase
