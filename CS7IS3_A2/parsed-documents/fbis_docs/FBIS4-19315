They had participated in the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda. The military spokesman denies the AFP Press Agency report on an announcement by Belgian Ambassador in Kenya, Christian Fellens, that the Belgian troops departed from Kigali. However the spokesman confirms that the Belgian "intervention contingent" has finished the mission of evacuating foreigners, and he reports on an incident that occurred with the Rwandan Armed Forces on Friday morning. [passage omitted] Colonel Gilbert Hertoghe has told the BELGA Press Agency that an incident took place Friday morning at the Kigali airport, when a rp-14 multiple rocket launcher of the Rwandan Armed Forces [government armed forces -- editor's note] was positioned within 50 meters of the airport enclave, violating the agreement concluded Thursday evening with the warring parties. The truce was allowed humanitarian flights and planes for troops' evacuation. This piece of artillery towed by a truck has been positioned 50 meters away from the enclave, while the agreement stipulates that this kind of weapon should remain at a distance of 500 meters, the spokesman says. The rocket launcher was fired twice in the direction of Kigali and the Belgian Armed Forces twice demanded its withdrawal. Since the request not being met, the paratroopers commandant ordered warning shots over the artillery piece. At that moment, the rp-14 was moved from its position, Colonel Hertoghe adds.
