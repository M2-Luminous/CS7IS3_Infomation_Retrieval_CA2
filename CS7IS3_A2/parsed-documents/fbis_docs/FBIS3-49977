Mudresa: "Not in Montenegro's Interest"] [Text] Podgorica -- It is certain that the international sanctions will remain in effect for some time. Therefore, the healthy part of the economy that can produce and sell its products must be stimulated. The new economic program for the revival of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been drafted by a team of experts and it would be good if the federal government shared the responsibility for the program's implementation. This was stated by Vojin Djukanovic, president of Economic Chamber of Montenegro at a meeting with businessmen and trade union leaders in Podgorica yesterday. However, the majority of businessmen drew attention to a number of unknowns contained in the program. Slobodan Lekovic took the view that the elaborate program did not take into account the interests of Montenegro, above all, those in the maritime economy, tourism, and transportation infrastructure. "Relations between the two federal units -- Serbia and Montenegro -- in their joint state of Yugoslavia have not been presented fully and clearly," Lekovic said. Dr. Janko Radulovic expressed the view that reaching a political consensus is a very important factor for the realization of the program. He stressed that the program must be accompanied by a number of operational and legal regulations, adding: "The program is more turned toward the Republic of Serbia and if it has any pretensions toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it must respect the specific characteristics of the Montenegrin economy more." Danilo Popovic, head of the Montenegrin Confederation of Trade Unions, said that it was not questionable that we needed a program to solve the crisis, but expressed the doubt: "Who will pay for it if it fails. A large number of workers, pensioners, and disabled people, according to statistics, are paupers, because they are surviving on about 10 German marks a month when it is known that the minimum amount of money needed to survive, according to international standards, is about 30 German marks a month. Trade unions will demand wages to be paid in a stable, convertible currency, or the new dinar, or in kind." Popovic said that the Confederation of Trade Unions would today officially inform the public about its objections to the program. This will also be done by the Economic Chamber of Montenegro in its assessment that will be sent to the federal government today.
