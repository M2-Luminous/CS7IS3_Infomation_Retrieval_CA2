FR941205-2-00074 FR941205-2-00043 In response to the applicant's comment, the Department notes that Section II(c) was not intended to limit the ability of Client Plans to deal with M&I account representatives on Fund matters and is not meant to prohibit purchases or sales of Fund shares that are placed through M&I personnel when such personnel are acting as agents for the Client Plans. With respect to 12b&hyph;1 fees, Section II(f) of the Proposal provides that M&I may not receive any fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. The applicant states that this condition is consistent with the representations made by M&I. However, the applicant notes that Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Proposal (the Summary) overstate the representations made by M&I with regard to 12b&hyph;1 fees and require minor clarification. Paragraph 3 indicates that the Client Plans will invest only in ``Trust Shares'' of the Funds. The applicant states that at the current time only the Marshall Money Market Fund has established a category of ``Trust Shares'', as distinguished from ``Investment Shares'' that are charged with 12b&hyph;1 fees. The applicant notes that the remaining Funds, while capable of establishing 12b&hyph;1 plans, have not done so, and currently use only a single class of shares. The applicant represents that if any of these Funds does establish a 12b&hyph;1 plan, it will create a separate class of shares analogous to the Marshall Money Market Funds' ``Trust Shares'' that will not be charged 12b&hyph;1 fees, and investments by Client Plans will be limited to the class of shares not subject to 12b&hyph;1 fees. In Paragraph 4 of the Summary, the third sentence reads, ``*␣*␣* In addition, M&I does not and will not receive fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 in connection with transactions involving any shares of the Funds.'' The applicant states that this statement should be clarified to limit it to transactions described under the exemption, because M&I may receive 12b&hyph;1 fees in connection with transactions outside the exemption involving separate classes of Fund shares. The Department notes the applicant's clarification. With respect to the authorization of credits in the form of Fund shares, the applicant states that the Second Fiduciary's authorization of the fee credits may not necessarily include an authorization to purchase additional shares with the credited fees. Therefore, Section II(i) of the Proposal should include the phrase ``if applicable'' as part of the clause ``*␣*␣* and the purchase of additional shares of a Fund by the Client Plan with the fees credited to the Client Plan by M&I''. The Department has amended Section II(i) to include this phrase. In addition, Paragraph 8 of the Summary states, in the middle of the first paragraph, that ``*␣*␣* Such authorization will include in the future an election for the Second Fiduciary to purchase additional shares of the Fund with the fees credited to the Client Plan by M&I.'' The applicant states that this should be clarified to provide that such authorizations may , rather than will, be included in the future. The Department also notes this additional clarification. With respect to the use of broker quotations and pricing services for valuing the securities transferred to a Fund, the applicant states that the reference in Section I(b) of the Proposal to the use of ``*␣*␣* at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&I *␣*␣*'' for securities described under Rule 17a&hyph;7(b)(4) is consistent with M&I's representations. However, the applicant notes that the third paragraph of Paragraph 6 of the Summary indicates that unlisted securities were valued based on quotations obtained from three brokers independent of M&I, without referring to the use of a fourth quotation in the event of an aberration in the three quotations obtained or the use in some cases of independent pricing services in place of brokers. The applicant requests that this matter be clarified for the record. In this regard, the Department notes the applicant's clarification regarding M&I's use of broker quotations and pricing services for valuing unlisted securities involved in the in-kind transfers to the Funds and also notes that such procedures were consistent with Section I(b) of the Proposal. With respect to the frequency of reports made to the Client Plans on Fund transactions, the applicant states that Paragraph 8 of the Summary should be clarified to state that such reports are provided to Second Fiduciaries monthly or quarterly, rather than just monthly. The Department also notes this clarification. In addition, the Department has added as a condition of the exemption (see Section II(m) above) a requirement that M&I provide the Second Fiduciaries of Client Plans investing in the Funds the following:
