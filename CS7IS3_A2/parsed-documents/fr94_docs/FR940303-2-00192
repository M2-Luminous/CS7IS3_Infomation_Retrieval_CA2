Background/Objectives of This Program Within the past two years, political and social evolution in the Middle East has produced democratic elections in Jordan and Yemen, the re-emergence of civil government in Lebanon, an agreement intended to bring about Palestinian self government and the responsibility for providing and administering social services that entails in Gaza and the West Bank, and the gradual emergence, in a number of heretofore closed political systems, of more responsive and accessible governmental institutions. Essential to the success and fruition of these political experiments is the development, in each society affected, of responsible and responsive administration in public institutions and the perception, often absent in developing societies, of a public office as a public trust. The primary objective of this program is, initially, to instill in a group of public administrators, with responsibility for a variety of civil administrative and management functions, a sense of civil administration as a crucial element in the emergence of a viable civil culture, and secondly, to broaden and refine their ability to fulfill their duties and to contribute to the development of a cadre of enlightened, self-conscious, and responsible public administrators in their home countries. Participants Participants for the U.S. component of this exchange will include mid-level public administrators from various sectors health, education, housing, security, and general social welfare_from Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, whose English-language skills are sufficient to enable them to function successfully during the U.S. internship phase of the program. Participants will be nominated through coordination among USIA, U.S. Information Service personnel in the region, and overseas partner institutions. USIA and the participating USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants and to accept or reject participants recommended by grantee institutions. American participants in the program, both those institutions which will host foreign public administrators in the United States and those individuals who will subsequently travel overseas as resource persons in the second component of the exchange, will be selected by the American grantee organization in consultation with the Office of Citizen Exchanges. The consultants travelling overseas should be fluent in the language of the country in which the seminar is presented or the American grantee organization should undertake to provide simultaneous interpretation.
