It invited Standing Committee members of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan Guoquan and Li Gang, and National Committee members Yan Ruifen, Zhao Changbai, Zhang Junsheng, and Wang Jie to answer questions. We now broadcast excerpts of the recorded news conference. [Begin recording] [unidentified moderator] Ladies, gentlemen, and friends, the NPC-CPPCC Press Center is hosting a news conference for Chinese and foreign correspondents here this afternoon on the themes of establishing a modern enterprise system and improving state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. We are honored to have been successful in inviting six Standing Committee members and members of the CPPCC National Committee here today. Please allow me to introduce them to you, they are: Wan Guoquan, Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Li Gang, Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, vice chairman of the Economy Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, and adviser to the China National Automotive Industry Corporation; Yan Ruifen, member of the CPPCC National Committee and general manager of Guangdong China Guanglian Enterprise Company Limited; Zhao Changbai, member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice-chairman of the Board of Directors of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation; Zhang Junsheng, member of the CPPCC National Committee and board chairman of (Hehe Meiling) Company Limited; and Wang Jie, member of the CPPCC National Committee and professor of the Economics Department of the CPC Central Party School. We now invite questions. [Ye] I am Ye from the (?SHANG YE JIN RONG BAO) [?COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL JOURNAL]; my question is: Quite a number of shareholding enterprises have claimed that their switch to shareholding status means they have already changed their operating mechanisms and see no need to change them again under the current call. What do you think? [Moderator] We would like to invite Committee Member Li Gang to answer this question. [Li] Thank you. This is a very meaningful question. There are quite a number of factors that currently make large and medium state-owned enterprises unable to enliven themselves. One of these is shortage of funds. However, we feel the most fundamental reason for the poor performance of large and medium state-owned enterprises is one of mechanism and system. Although capital may be injected through share issues, in the final analysis, the success or failure of enterprises depends on whether or not we can enliven our system. [(Li Ruisheng)] I am a reporter from RENMIN RIBAO, my name is (Li Ruisheng). I would like to direct my question to board chairman Zhang Junsheng of the (Meiling) Company. [words indistinct] [Zhang] To a developing nation like China, I think admission to the GATT will have far-reaching impacts; in the meantime, however, it will play a big role in pushing China's economic development. To we Chinese enterprises, admission to GATT presents both a challenge and an opportunity. As far as our company is concerned, our (Meiling) refrigerators are well prepared to compete with refrigerators produced by any country on an open, just, and fair basis. We are confident we will get our deserved market share. [(Chen Yunping)] I am (Chen Yunping) from the Central Television Network. I would like to direct my question to Zhang Junsheng. It is argued that there are two ways to enliven large and medium state enterprises; one is implementing the share-holding system the other is private ownership. What are your views? Do you think these arguments are correct? [Zhang] From the perspective of historic development, the development from private ownership to public ownership is inevitable; history should not reverse itself. According to the operating characteristics of the market economy, the superior will win while the inferior will lose. Under these circumstances, private ownership may (?accommodate) public ownership and verse versa. Therefore, I would say that the question of introducing private ownership in China does not arise. In addition, in his government work report delivered yesterday, Premier Li Peng emphatically stressed keeping public ownership as the mainstay of the economy. [(Wen Shizai)] I am XIN MIN WAN BAO [XINMIN EVENING POST] reporter (Wen Shizai). The enforcement of the Bankruptcy Law will bring unemployment to some workers. My first question is: Are we going to control our unemployment rate? And my second question is: If the answer is yes, to what extent should we exercise control? [Moderator] Shall we direct these questions to Committee Member Wang Jie? [Wang] Once the Bankruptcy Law comes into effect, some workers will inevitably face temporary periods of waiting between jobs. In the process of developing a market economy, and in the course of promoting fair competition, the "superior will win and the inferior will lose" law will certainly apply to every enterprise. Some workers, therefore, are bound to spend some time job-waiting. It can be argued, though, that this job-waiting is different from previous western-style, long-term unemployment phenomena. As far as our socialist system is concerned, the working people are the masters of our nation and we will make every effort to get jobs for them. Hence, our party and governments are now vigorously developing tertiary industry, township and village enterprises, and small and medium cities, and towns. All these are designed to provide a secure [words indistinct] workplace for the working people who are temporarily out of job. It has been my personal view that, in light of deepening of reform and the development of a socialist economy, there will be more job opportunities. This point [words indistinct] has been proved by history. [(Li Rao)] My name is (Li Rao) from the ZHONG HUA GONG SHANG SHI BAO [CHINESE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL JOURNAL], I have a question for committee member Wan Guoguan. At present, large and medium enterprises are the main components of our country's economy, their success or failure will have an impact on the development of the whole national economy. For the past few years, we have been introducing contract systems, implementing regulations on transforming operational mechanisms, and now we are active in developing a modern enterprise system. As doubts and anxieties still exist over whether these measures are really helpful to the invigoration of large and medium enterprises, can we ask the views of Wan Guoquan, the executive chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a representative of democratic parties, on these issues? [Wan] I think this is a very important question, an issue of deep concern for us. Before discussing it we must, first and foremost, affirm the contributions made by our large and medium state enterprises to the country and people in the first few decades after its founding. Meanwhile, we should also recognize large and medium state enterprises as the mainstay of the national economy. They have played a dominant role in national economic construction in the past, play a similar role now, and will continue to do so in the future. Because state enterprises were founded on the enterprise system under a planned economy, the introduction of a socialist market economy in China has indeed put them in a predicament. However, I have ample confidence that state enterprises can be invigorated, for four reasons: First, central government has adopted a clear-cut goal and policy measures to enliven state enterprises, which are reflected in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and Premier Li Peng's government work report. As Premier Li Peng explained, the goal and policy measures can be summarized as follows, the requirement that large and medium state enterprises deepen reform and change operating mechanisms, including, of course, the establishment of a modern enterprise system, under which property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise management are separated, and scientific management is established. Based on my experience as a manager when enterprises did not have managerial autonomy and were not responsible for profits and losses, I am fully aware of that if an enterprise is shackled by many restrictions it will lack vitality. If state enterprises operate according to central government policy and the Company Law, which will come into force soon, they will be full of vitality. Second, even though the equipment of some enterprises is outdated, others have upgraded or, more importantly, have been equipped with internationally advanced facilities. The latter can play an effective role in promoting socialized mass production. Third, state enterprises have a large contingent of talented people, including senior engineers and veteran workers. They are an invaluable asset of ours. Moreover, through more than a decade of continuous exploration, we have accumulated experience in bringing state enterprises more into line with our socialist market economy. The entrepreneurs present here today are typical products of such exploration. Fourth, central authorities have set great store by, and the people have shown a keen interest in, reform of the large and medium state enterprises. Now is the time to reform them or they will not survive. This is a demand of our socialist market economy. Reform must be carried out and will certainly succeed. That Premier Li Peng devoted a whole section of his report to this question explains the great importance attached by the State Council to reform of state enterprises. Therefore, I am fully confident that enterprise reform will succeed, but it will take some time. [Correspondent] I am from Hong Kong's KUAI PAO [EXPRESS]. During an interview a few days ago, an economist propounded a theory that the performance of large and medium state enterprises was not bad, but that their vitality had been diverted into other areas. Do you agree with this theory? [Moderator] Shall we direct this question to Professor Wang Jie? [Wang] There is some truth in the theory that the poor performance of state enterprises does not indicate a decrease in their efficiency, but rather the diversion of efficiency to other areas. At present, some large and medium state enterprises have to undertake a heavy burden. For example, they have debts and apportionments for social undertakings and various expenses, which must be paid from their profits. It is true, therefore, that in the final analysis their efficiency is low. However, we must admit that the overall efficiency of enterprises is not high; and the reasons, as mentioned in Premier Li Peng's report, are many. The fundamental one lies in the shortcomings and defects of the management systems and operating mechanisms of state enterprises. How are the shortcomings and defects reflected? They are reflected mainly in the failure to clearly define the property rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises, and in their administrative (?interference) with operating mechanisms. For this reason, all enterprises have limited management autonomy and are weak in market competition. It is precisely because of these shortcomings and defects that the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has explicitly proposed a step-by-step reform of state enterprises, and has defined the establishment of a modern enterprise system as the objective of reform. I believe that once property rights and the rights and responsibilities of enterprise are clearly defined, once government administration and enterprise management are separated, and once scientific management is established in accordance with the objective set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, state enterprise efficiency will surely be gradually enhanced, and they will bring into more effective play a role commensurate with their dominant position in the national economy. [Correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. There appears to be something of a contradiction in Premier Li Peng's government work report. On the one hand, he demanded that state enterprises rely on themselves to achieve development through reforms, while on the other he pledged more government financial aid to these enterprises. For example, they are no longer required to pay funds for energy and transportation construction projects and budgetary regulatory funds. Moreover, the government will also provide financial aid to enterprises to help them resettle surplus labor. If the government continues to provide assistance in terms of funds to state enterprises, how can they be encouraged to make reform and enhance efficiency? [Unidentified CPPCC committee member] The premier's report is not contradictory. What is essential is that enterprises rely on themselves by deepening reform and changing their operating mechanisms. However, during the transitional period, the state will implement an interim preferential policy toward enterprises, especially to guarantee the livelihood of their workers and staff. If an enterprise rely on the preferential policy without deepening reform, it can go nowhere. Government support will not last forever. The only way out for an enterprise running in the red over a protracted period is to declare bankruptcy. [(Chen Tiebiao)] I am (Chen Tiebiao) from the (?Cable Television). My question is about the tax assignment system, which is a new state policy. As the Finance Minister explained in the budget report, the new system may encounter contradictions in the course of implementation. Will such contradictions be those between the state enterprises and local governments, or between the enterprises themselves? Please clarify. [Unidentified CPPCC member] Implementation of the tax assignment system is a very important step in our tax reform. It is not a system unique to China, and is also implemented in many other countries. At present, there are national and local taxes. However, under the tax assignment system, the central government, in order to make allowances for local governments, will reimburse them a certain amount of tax revenue to tide them over difficulties during the transitional period. Of course, it is entirely possible that a reform of such a great magnitude will affect the interests of a certain sector. What we can do is to proceed from the overall situation and take into consideration both national and local interests.
