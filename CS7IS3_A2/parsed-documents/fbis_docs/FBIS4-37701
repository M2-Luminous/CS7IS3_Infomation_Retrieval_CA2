I am very happy to see that. [Correspondent] Your Highness give us more details on the recent announcement on the establishment of a military base in the south? [Al Sa'ud] First, the announcement was not made recently; it was made two years ago. Studies and surveys have already been done. If a number of foreign stations and radios have linked the announcement the current situation in Yemen, it is false reporting. The announcement was made two years ago; surveys have been completed. The base will open next year, God willing. [Correspondent] Will Your Highness please expand on the problem of the Iraqi refugees? Although the kingdom has spent around two billion Saudi riyals since the setting up of the refugee camps in Rafhah, foreign media has nevertheless been saying that the Kingdom mistreats the Iraqi refugees. How do you answer that? [Al Sa'ud] Anyone who feels sorry for them should take them to his own country. [Correspondent] What about compulsory conscription? Is the idea going to be revived? [Al Sa'ud] We do not need it; our youth have shown more than enough enthusiasm. We have to accommodate the young enthusiasts first. [Correspondent] Did the Ministry of Defense benefit during the Gulf war from the Saudi brothers who volunteered to serve in the army? [Al Sa'ud] A lot. It has benefitted a lot; many of them joined military academies. [Correspondent] What about al-Yamamah project? [Al Sa'ud] It is still on track. [Correspondent] What about relations with Iran, who has asserted that the Kingdom mistreated the pilgrims? [Al Sa'ud] Pilgrims were never mistreated. We hope that our relations with Iran will be excellent. This is the policy of the custodian of the two holy mosques. [Correspondent] What about prisoners from Gulf Cooperation Council countries still held by the Iraqi regime? [Al Sa'ud] This matter is being examined by the UN Security Council. We hope with God's help that every man will return to his country. Thank you. [Correspondent] Your Highness, when will the academy move to the new building? [Al Sa'ud] Work is progressing normally; the academy will move there in two years' time.
