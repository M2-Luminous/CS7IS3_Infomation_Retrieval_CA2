Shafiq al-Hut, the PLO's representative in Beirut, told Quds Press "the agreement puts the Palestinian people's fate and cause on the line." Al-Hut, who resigned his PLO membership to protest the September signing of the Declaration of Principles agreement, criticized the results of arduous negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. The agreements that spelled out the declaration of principles have confirmed the opponents of the Oslo accord in their assessment that there has been a climbdown on key issues. Al-Hut said that, initially, the Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat balked at signing the detailed annexes of the agreement seeing that they had unforessen concessions that took him by surprise, thus pointing up the existence of differences blocking a final deal.
