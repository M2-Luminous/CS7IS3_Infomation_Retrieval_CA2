That question will pop up and be asked again and again. It is not simple, if only because of the emotional baggage trailing a body that was regarded until yesterday, and which some still see, as Israel's sworn and most hostile enemy. Many people still are not convinced that it will not make an about turn and that the Palestinians, led by the PLO or another of their organizations, will not again seek war against Israel. Many in the right camp want the agreement to fail and put an end to the "concession process." They would like to see a civil war and bloodshed on the other side. The approach taken by others combines scorn with vindictive satisfaction. They say that chaos reigns among the Palestinians, that the PLO has come in unprepared despite all the pleas that have been made to it and that its leaders do not care about the common people. This is an arrogant view, as though only Israelis are capable of managing independent existence. These people are willing to offer assistance to the Palestinians, but from an attitude that is paternal and sometimes insulting. Many of these people foresee failure and say that no level of aid will help the Palestinians, not because they do not want to succeed but because they are doomed to fail. Within the Israeli Government, and particularly among senior defense officials, a leading, important group contends that the little experience we have teaches that there is someone to talk to. They are referring, first of all, to the Palestinian leadership in the territories, to the police command and to prisoners released from Israeli jails (but not to the intellectual class). We must show patience, they say; it will not be long before the Palestinian system begins to stabilize. Of 10, including the prime minister, who spoke at a conference held in the Defense Ministry for newspaper editors and other journalists, eight used such language or similar terms to state that Israel must help the Palestinians maintain the agreement. Even the other two speakers did not dissent. They are ready to aid the civil administration in particular. More than any others, they recognize the difficulties and how unprepared the Palestinians are. Still, they explain that this is not just the Palestinians' problem, and that failure on the Palestinian side is liable to create a problem for Israel, too. This group advances the argument that the Palestinians must be helped to maintain the agreement. It is persuading the political branch of the need for help in basic matters in order to prevent hardship in the territories, which would benefit Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad. Aid is sometimes seen in the territories without approval from above. Even so, even this group does not concede testing on the ground and the need to progress in stages under the agreement. The premise is that along with assistance, every detail in realization of the agreement must be strictly observed, that no possibility of deviation from the gradual process can be allowed and that Israel must react to every violation. Some say that the monitoring should be done by those responsible in the territories and not by lawyers who, by their nature, are inclined to dot every i cross every t. But even as everything is set for inspection, we also cannot ignore certain worrisome signs. At the top of the list stand 'Arafat's statements, which have received extensive coverage. 'Arafat also stands behind the instruction to break off agreements and relations with Israeli companies. That is his right, but that also is a formula for increasing hardship among residents of the Gaza Strip. Until recently, 'Arafat had led the way towards an agreement and blocked opposition to conciliation between the two peoples. And now, the new and worrisome line he took in his declaration is a continuation of the dispute--not an end to it. Some of us are prepared to justify and offer pretexts in advance for every PLO violation of the agreement. The discussion is not being carried on with them. In any event, they are a marginal faction. The discussion is being carried on with the Palestinian leadership, which seeks conciliation. When lame excuses are heard from them, such as that it was the Kuraysh tribe that violated the agreement with Muhammad, and not the other way around, so that 'Arafat's statement was correct--it must be said that after so prolonged a dispute, there are no naive Israelis. Right from the start, even before the ink was dry on the signatures, the PLO chairman has been comparing the Oslo and Cairo agreements to the truces called by the Prophet Muhammed, and it makes no difference at all who breaks the agreements. 'Arafat is ignoring the essence of the agreement in principle, which speaks of a process towards a permanent peace and reconciliation. That is another good reason to make a forceful demand for abrogation of the clauses in the Palestinian Covenant denying the existence of Israel, as 'Arafat pledged but has not done. We cannot forget, however, that Israel has an interest in the success of the agreement. Otherwise, we would not have embarked on this course and the Oslo agreement in principle would not have been signed. Therefore, we must help the PLO to abide by it and to overcome opponents of the agreement. The main condition is an end to the killing of Israelis, and the PLO must make every effort to stop it. It cannot be expected that Palestinians will kill us and that we will help them or, even more, give them financial support.
