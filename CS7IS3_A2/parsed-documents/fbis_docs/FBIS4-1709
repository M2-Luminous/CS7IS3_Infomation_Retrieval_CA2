Of the population of 37 million in the mountainous province, 10 million are ethnic minority people. According to a survey in 1986, some 40,000 families lived in shabby houses, most of whom were ethnic minority people in remote mountains. Since 1984, the central government has allocated three million yuan to Guizhou every year to build houses for the farmers in poverty-stricken areas. From 1986 to 1993, the province allocated 24 million yuan for housing construction for 24,994 households with 93,052 people. Local officials said that the provincial government will continue the housing program by allocating special funds in the next few years.
