This has been stated in an interview with foreign journalists by Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of Ukraine's Navy. He emphasized that the protocol signed in Massandra by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk was only a protocol of intent. The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet has never been a way out of the situation that has come about. According to the commander, the issue has been studied and rejected. The handover of the Ukrainian part of the Fleet to Russia is no longer being discussed. Instead, both sides are in agreement on creating a commission to inventorize the ships and other fleet property for the purpose of dividing them up in accordance with the yet earlier accords between the presidents of the two countries. In Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy's opinion the Fleet should be divided equally before the end of 1995.
