FR940223-2-00016 FR940223-2-00013 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Army Notice of Availability, Preparation of a Final Supplement to the 1989 Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Actions at U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) AGENCY: Department of the Army, DOD. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: This notice of availability is for a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) to the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the United States Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) (United States Army Strategic Defense Command, 1989). The FSEIS has assessed potential environmental impacts for two proposed actions: To increase the level of missile defense test and evaluation activities to support the development for deployment of missile defense systems; and to adopt new environmental standards for USAKA. Lead Agency: U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC). Cooperating Agency: Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). Proposed Action: The first Proposed Action involves a substantial increase in USAKA activities required to support the development in missile defense systems. These activities would consist of a substantial increase in flight test activities with a corresponding increase in the USAKA infrastructure and support capabilities. USAKA is a national range at which the performance of component, sub-system, and integrated system testing has occurred. The second Proposed Action involves the adoption of new environmental standards for USAKA, which are derived from existing United States and Republic of the Marshall Islands regulations and statutes, and are tailored to protect the specific environmental conditions of the Kwajalein Atoll. The development of these new standards is provided for in the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
