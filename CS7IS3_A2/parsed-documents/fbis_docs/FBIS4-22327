Over half of them (55 percent) worked at enterprises of state or municipal ownership, a third--at enterprises with mixed form of ownership, and 11 percent--at private enterprises (in 1992 these figures were 57 percent, 33 percent, and 10 percent, respectively). While production volume decreased 16 percent in 1993, the number of employees in the sector diminished by 5 percent. This is related to the fact that enterprises are in no hurry to reduce their excess labor force, hoping that current economic difficulties are temporary in nature. Even under conditions of shortages of materials, raw materials, fuel, and component parts, and problems in the marketing of production output, many enterprises, in their striving to retain personnel, are effecting transition to operations with reduced work periods and are affording employees supplemental unpaid or partially paid leave. As of 1 January 1994, more than 7 percent of the people employed in industry were working less-than-full work periods. This includes 14 percent of workers in the light industry sector and 11 percent of those in machine building. From 5 to 14 percent monthly of the workers at enterprises where work was halted were on supplemental leave at the initiative of the administration. For workers in light industry, this figure reached up to 20 percent for certain months. The following table characterizes the data on changes in numerical strength and wage level of employees in the main sectors of industry in 1993: Strength increase (+) Average monthly wage or decrease (-) Number of Percentage In In Factor of workers, of 1992 rubles, rubles, increase: 1993 level 1993 December 1993 over 1993 1994 [as published] Industry -977,700 -4.8 64,000 145,700 9.0 (total) including: Electric power +44,200 +6.8 120,400 298,800 9.3 industry Fuel industry +28,300 +2.4 137,700 339,700 8.6 Ferrous +3,500 +0.4 78,600 158,500 8.3 metallurgy Nonferrous +4,900 +0.7 111,600 263,300 8.1 metallurgy Chemical and -49,500 -3.7 56,700 116,500 7.8 petrochemical industry Machine -814,200 -9.2 46,800 103,300 9.3 building and Metalworking Lumber, -136,400 -7.6 52,900 120,700 8.2 woodworking, and pulp and paper industry Building -56,500 -5.9 65,500 141,400 9.9 materials industry Light industry -83,600 -4.6 42,400 86,100 7.9 Food industry +17,600 +1.2 78,500 177,500 9.9 Under the influence of intensified sector wage differentiation, the level of wages in the fuel industry and electric power industry in 1993 being triple the wages in light industry and machine building (in 1991 the factor increase was 1.5- to 1.7-fold), an intersector modulation of numbers of employees is taking place. This is increasing appreciably in the electric power industry and fuel industry, and decreasing in the lumber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry.
