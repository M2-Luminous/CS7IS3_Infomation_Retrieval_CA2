He said China, which imports 769,454 tonnes of palm, had potential to overtake Pakistan as the biggest consumer of palm oil in the world in view of its large population. He (?told) a press conference that a three-week mission would be sent to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong next month to explain the uses and advantages of palm oil. He believed the mission would be successful because the use of palm oil in China was currently confined to making noodles and soap. Palm oil is not sold as cooking oil in China. The campaign will concentrate on the housewives and if it is successful, the use of palm oil will increase manifold, he said. Dr. Yusof also said that Indonesia was expected to rival Malaysia as the biggest palm oil producer in world by the year 2010 when its production caught up with Malaysia's at 10 million tonnes. Malaysia produced 7.4 million tonnes last year and 7.5 million tonnes this year. However, this would not affect Malaysia's exports as most of the Indonesian production was for local consumption and the world demand for palm oil was increasing yearly, he said. On the anti-palm oil campaign in the United States, he said the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) had extended by three months to Aug 28 the deadline to remove the no palm oil lable on cans and foodstuff. He said consumers in the U.S. had now changed their attitude and were beginning to try out palm oil while some big fast-food chains like Burger King in Florida had asked for samples for trial tests.
