Two others have been arrested pending legal moves to hold them under administrative detention. However, Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who heads the authorities' wanted list, remains at large. Summing up the situation is reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: Currently in jail on a three-month administrative detention warrant are Shmu'el Ben-Yishay, Shmu'el Ben-Ya'aqov, Eyal Noqed, Bentziyon Gobstein, and No'am Federman, the spokesman for the Kakh movement. Kakh leader Barukh Marzel remains at large. He is the No. 1 wanted man at the moment, and his wife Sara told reporters today that she remains a declared Kakh activist and she taunted police to come and arrest her along with the wives of the other activists who are currently in administrative detention. Two people who are currently under arrest, but not in administrative detention are Barukh Ben-Yosef, a Kakh member, and Mikha'el Ben-Horin, a former Kakh member who is the self-styled president of the State of Judaea. Both these people must appear before a district court if they are going to be put in administrative detention. Ben-Horin appeared at the Nazareth District Court today. He was kept under arrest until next Sunday, when the court will decide whether in fact he will be put in administrative detention. Ben-Yosef is due to appear before the Jerusalem District Court tomorrow with regard to his case. Another development today was the questioning by police of Rabbi Moshe Levinger of Hebron and his wife on charges that they had been involved in various disturbances several months ago in Hebron. Levinger is due to appear tomorrow in court to answer police charges. That is the situation at the moment. Police say that other arrests could well come in the days ahead but they are keeping very quiet on who it may be and where the arrests may take place.
