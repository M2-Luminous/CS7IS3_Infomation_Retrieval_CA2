"The time for making excessive demands is over," the DIHT stated on Monday [20 June] in Bonn. "What we now need are consistent planning of tasks, an economic budget policy, and efficient spending control. This must go hand in hand with the strengthening of the market forces and of competition in Europe." Centralism and overregulation must be counteracted. From the German EU presidency -- from 1 July to 31 December 1994 -- the DIHT expects a stronger coordination of the economic and financial policy of the EU member states and clearer prospects for the Central and East European reformist states. "After the accession of Austria and the Scandinavian countries, the community needs some respite," the DIHT stated. Nevertheless, the reformist states need a concrete long-term perspective for the time up to their accession to the EU. They must be granted room to adapt to competition and the level of integration in the EU. Excessive hopes regarding the time of accession have to be avoided. The most promising help is the opening of the markets. "Free trade will make it easier for the reformist states to make the necessary changes of their production structures, promote privatization, thus supporting the introduction of the market economy system," the DIHT argued. It must be prevented, under all circumstances, that the convergence criteria, which were agreed for the third stage of European monetary union, are watered down. The stability of the monetary value must not be put at risk. "Quality is more important than sticking to the calendar," the DIHT said with reference to the set date for monetary union, 1999. Moreover, the DIHT called on the Federal Government to fight for the speedy elimination of the transitional solution regarding the value-added tax [VAT]. The transition from the principle of country of destination to that of country of origin would be a sign for a real European single market. For the economy it is important to treat deliveries to other EU countries in the same way as domestic transactions as far as taxes are concerned. For the consumers there would be no changes, because since the beginning of 1993 they have always had to pay VAT rate of the EU country in which they bought and can no longer claim any possible difference to the lower German VAT at the border.
