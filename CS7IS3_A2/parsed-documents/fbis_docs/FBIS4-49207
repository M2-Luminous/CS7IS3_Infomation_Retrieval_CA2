In CPC organs, the answer is "yes." It is hard to find such an opinion: A crisis is hidden behind the vitality. It is even difficult to hear the authorities admit that vitality with hidden crises is not healthy vigor. Recently, a CPC document sounded the alarm bells and analyzed in detail the crisis the CPC is facing. Not just one, but three crises exist. It was an investigation report, and the report was written by former PRC president Yang Shangkun. The 23,000-character report was submitted personally by Yang Shangkun to the Political Bureau. Between mid-January and mid-February of this year, Yang Shangkun inspected six cities in Guangdong, namely, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shunde. In mid-March, he further inspected six cities in Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian, namely, Zhanjian, Maoming, Haikou, Sanya, Xiamen, and Quanzhou. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice to the party committees in the three provinces, stating that Comrade Yang Shangkun was going to make inspections and investigations in a number of cities at the request of the CPC Central Political Bureau. In early April, Yang Shangkun submitted an investigation report in his own name to the Political Bureau. The CPC Central Secretariat added a note to the report, which said: "After more than one month of inspections and investigations, Comrade Yang Shangkun has summed up a report which points to the existence of major problems in our work. Leading cadres at all levels should give deep thought to the seriousness and harmfulness of the problems." The report, entitled "Party Building, Political and Ideological Education, and Social Morals Are All Facing Crisis," was issued to party and government leading bodies at the provincial and ministry level on 11 April. The investigation report was divided into three main parts. The first part was about party building and the quality of party membership. The report pointed out: In the last seven to eight years, party building has always been the weak link. Party rectification is often superficial and ineffective, and at most just solves or temporarily solves some partial problems. The fundamental problem in party building has been obscured. Party building directly concerns the party's destiny, the relationship between the party and the people, and the party's mobilizing force and leading authority. At present, party cadres, including the party's senior leading cadres, have no interest or courage to handle party building, saying that it is not easy to achieve marked results in party building and that they do not know what to do in this regard for fear that this may be regarded as backtracking toward old practices. The hesitancy of leading cadres and their perplexity about such a matter of primary importance has become an urgent problem we are facing right now. The situation of party building will directly affect the healthy development of economic construction, reform, and opening. The success or failure of the ruling party in its own party building will eventually determine the future of the country. Yang Shangkun told the truth on this matter. At present, the Communist Party is corrupt and is rotten from top to bottom and inside out. To exaggerate slightly, the CPC has become a sheet of loose sand. In such circumstances, how can it effectively conduct party building? Party rectification has not achieved any major results, neither will the anticorruption campaign. Yang Shangkun's report did not mention or dared not mention this, but it is thought that he is also aware of this. The second part was about political-ideological education and propaganda work. The report pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee correctly summed up and negated previous "leftist" practice in political-ideological education and in propaganda and pointed out that this was unsuited to national conditions and the development of the times. However, after that, a set of integrated guidelines for political-ideological education and propaganda suited to national conditions and the socialist system was lacking. This led to serious mistakes in work. Undoubtedly, in this regard, as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out several years ago, both of our hands should be tough, and we cannot only keep one hand tough and leave the other hand soft and weak. However, we did not handle this issue personally, and it has become a major difficulty. In recent years, leading bodies have been encouraged to pay attention to this issue, and the central leading body took the lead in doing so. However, due to obstructions in the people's minds and the influence of new social conditions on people's thinking, party workers have failed to conduct effective political-ideological education and have not given vigorous publicity to socialist ideology and communist ideals. It seems that socialist ideology, communist ideals, and the party's objectives have all become outdated and are no longer suited to the present days of reform and opening, and the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief in socialism and communism. This is an extremely dangerous tendency and signal at the moment. In this part of the report, Yang Shangkun also reflected the true situation. The CPC's so-called political-ideological education and propaganda work are dying away indeed and "lack vitality." Who should be blamed for this? Mao Zedong once said: "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism- Leninism." Now, history and reality both show that Marxism-Leninism, especially Leninism, is seriously antiscientific, and the theoretical basis of the Communist Party has collapsed. The ideology and beliefs of Communist Party members have collapsed. What can be used to conduct political-ideological education? Who is still willing to listen to sermons about Marxism-Leninism or to chant the scriptures of socialism and communism? An informed theorist said: "Yang Shangkun told the truth. Political-ideological education and propaganda work is indeed completely lifeless. He was right in saying that `it seems that socialist ideology, communist ideals, and the party's objectives have all become outdated and are no longer suited to the present days of reform and opening, and that the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief in socialism and communism,' but the words `it seems that' are not used properly and should be replaced with `it is because.'" The third part concerns social morals and public conduct. The report said: Social morals are becoming rapidly corrupted, and this has aroused serious attention and concern among people in all social strata. Upright people in society are calling for civilization and morality in view of the increasing degeneration of public conduct, but this is not forming a strong force of opinion. Problems are obviously occurring inside the party and the government, and are reflected in the behavior of party cadres and party members. The party's revelation of and struggle against lawbreaking and disciplinary violations, and criticism and condemnation of corrupt and decadent conduct in society has not been noticed or supported by public opinion and propaganda organs. This cannot but be regarded as unusual and abnormal in people's China under the leadership of the 53-million-member Communist Party. Along with the development of human society and civilization, social morals and public conduct should make corresponding progress and should be enhanced. Violence, corruption, decadence, and amoral cultural tendencies that have engendered and developed in Western capitalist societies have aroused the serious attention of their governments. The present worsening public conduct and public order should arouse our party and government's serious attention and consideration. However, up to now, problems which could ruin human civilization, social construction, and Chinese culture and morality, and which could affect the growth of future generations, have not yet aroused sufficient vigilance among the people. This part of the report also told the truth. Social morals and public conduct in mainland China are indeed becoming worse now to a much more serious degree compared with Western capitalist societies. The informed scholar said: "Yang Shangkun was not wrong to complain that the party and the government are not paying sufficient attention to social and moral crises. However, if the current system and structure is not changed, the CPC will not be able to head off these crises. Yang Shangkun called for `vigilance' against the crises, but what should be done after `vigilance' has been aroused?" In facing these crises, the former state president did not know what to do, and the current CPC leadership are also at a loss about what to do. Even the chief architect does not know what to do. The appearance of these crises has profound causes. A student of CPC history pointed out that, at present, the general public, as well as the CPC rank and file, have strong doubts about socialism and even hold a negative attitude. People generally hold that the experiments with socialism has failed, and the CPC and China should find another course, move out of the utopian realm, and comply with the trend of the times by thoroughly changing the system and structure. However, the big shots in Zhongnanhai, especially the hardheaded old guard, are still grasping power tightly and are unwilling to make even one little move ahead in political reform. Thus, it is no wonder that the CPC is deeply mired in a crisis-laden predicament.
