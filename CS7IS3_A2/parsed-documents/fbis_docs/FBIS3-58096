There can be no question of this, Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said in Bonn today. The leader of the right-wing extremist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has "obviously got the wrong idea" he said. Kinkel said recently that it is necessary to come to terms with the political ideas of Zhirinovskiy's party. But no meeting or any other type of encounter is envisaged, Erdmann said.
