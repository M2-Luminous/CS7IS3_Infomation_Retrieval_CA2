[U.S. official] We did not decide at this meeting, but it will probably be in mid-November. [Reporter] You stated that quantitative indices will be used to observe the change in the Japan market. What level do you think the foreign share in Japan should be? [U.S. official] The table I just showed you represents the breadth of foreign shares in the G-7 nations, and it indicates how apart Japan is from this breadth. We hope that the gaps will be bridged. If the points of concern regarding the Japan market, which I explained today, are adequately solved within the framework of insurance reform, the logical result is that Japan's insurance market will approach those of the other G-7 nations. Specifically, in terms of openness and the competitive aspect, and with the foreign companies able to display their ability to offer technical innovations in Japan, Japan will approach the other advanced nations and, when that is achieved, the figures themselves will naturally change. [Reporter] You stated that the United States has no intention of indicating specific figures, and that you do not intend to retaliate although the figures may not be achieved. If the gap is not bridged and the Japan market does not change despite the use of other indices, what will happen after that? [U.S. official] A memo was handed by Ambassador Kantor to Ambassador Kuriyama concerning the comprehensive framework agreement, and in it is written that the United States will reserve the right to use the trade act. The U.S. trade act includes Article 301 and also Article 1377 concerning the telecommunications agreement. The trade act also includes a law called "Title VII" which encompasses government procurement in the foreign countries. Consequently, if the framework talks do not progress smoothly, it is clear that the United States will reserve the right to use the trade act. However, I believe that the situation will not evolve to that point. The reason is that the Insurance Council has issued the report from various angles, and the content of the U.S. proposal closely corresponds with the content of the report. Also, the Hosokawa cabinet is treating the easing of controls as a priority task and, if so, the insurance issue should also be included. Therefore, we do not believe at all that the situation I just described will come to pass, and I believe that we can achieve great success. [Reporter] Are you optimistic about expanding the 2-percent share to a double-digit level? And if you consider a double-digit level to be desirable, what is your target timeframe in terms of years? [U.S. official] We would prefer a triple digit over a double digit (laughter), but that is unrealistic. We believe that the present gap should be bridged in broad form from a medium-term viewpoint. By medium-term is usually meant three or four years as pointed out by the OECD. However, despite new rules and regulations, we do not believe that a nation's market can change overnight. First, the attitude and behavior within Japan's market must of course change, and also financial investments and agreements by the foreign insurers will be necessary. So, in terms of generally bridging the gaps between Japan and the other G-7 nations, we believe that we can easily adopt a medium-term viewpoint--that is, expect the gaps to be bridged within three to four years. [Reporter] Are you considering the indication of indices in areas other than the talks on the insurance problem? [U.S. official] Our purpose is to work together with the Japanese Government and to agree on a combination of qualititative and quantitative indices. In measuring the results, our goal is to achieve them without a trace of ambiguity. This aspect will be part of the talks to take place within the next several weeks or months. Our desire is to agree on these indices between the United States and Japan. However, if it is unsuccessful, we will unilaterally formulate qualitative and quantitative indices. The reason is that it is necessary to measure whether we have succeeded or whether there have been results, and we would like of course to proceed jointly with the Japanese Government in an agreed form. However, if that is not feasible, we will be compelled to proceed independently. [Reporter] Is there a basis on which you indicated the shares of the foreign companies? Also, the Japan side is protesting the basis for the calculation of the figures. What was the response by Japan? [U.S. official] By foreign insurers, we mean cases where more than 50 percent of foreign capital is invested. Some informed sources say that it is preferable to use OECD figures. However, in reporting statistics to the OECD, various nations submit them on the basis of their respective and different definitions. Therefore, we believe that the OECD statistics lack credibility. We indicated the figures to the Japanese Government today, but the Japanese side has not had the opportunity to read them carefully. We believe that the Japanese Government will probably review the background sources of the figures and the data. We also believe that it will eventually understand what the figures represent. Perhaps a debate on these criteria will take place at our next meeting. However, we feel extremely comfortable with the figures. For example, the share in France is indicated as 10 percent, but it is not a major problem whether it is 11 percent or 9 percent. The problem, after all, is that the gaps between Japan and the other advanced nations are excessively large, and that these gaps must absolutely be reduced. [Reporter] Do these figures cover both life insurance and nonlife insurance? [U.S. official] They cover both life and nonlife insurance. However, the 2 percent for Japan is perhaps too high. The reason is that the figure for postal insurance is not included. If it is included, the denominator will be larger and the result will be less than 2 percent. We are presently requesting data on the figure that includes postal insurance.
