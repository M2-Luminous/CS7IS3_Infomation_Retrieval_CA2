Without denying that the Serbs' humanitarian rights have been violated on a large scale in Croatia, as confirmed in the latest reports by the U.N. special rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the U.S. State Department, in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Granic attempted to find an excuse in saying that "Serb armed forces still hold one-third of the Croatian territory." Granic said that human rights have been violated as 6,900 people had been killed, 26,000 others wounded and 7,600 people perished in war (which broke out following Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia), and that there were currently some 550,000 refugees and displaced people in Croatia. Granic, however, failed to explain what this had in common with mass evictions of Serbs from their homes, with destruction of their property, with discharging them, and especially with banning the non-Croat children to attend classes, all of these listed in Mazowiecki's report as drastic examples of violation of human rights. International humanitarian organizations, including the Croatian Helsinki Committee for the Protection of Human Rights, have warned intermittently that these actions spurred on ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Serbs, 300,000 of them already expelled from Croatia. This was why 10,000 Serb houses have been blown up and scores of Christian Orthodox churches destroyed in Croatia. Granic assessed that the normalisation of relations with "the Serb minority in Croatia, especially in the U.N. protected areas" was "a key to stability in the area and in overall Croatian-Serb relations," and threatened in a familiar way that there should be no delusions that the Croatian Government would negotiate Croatia's territorial integrity. In 1991, Serbs in Croatia proclaimed the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), now a U.N. protected area, within their ethnic and historic territory in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce their status to that of a national minority. Serbs in Croatia also decided to take such a step because they were afraid of a relapse of the genocide committed against them in World War Two, when in the Nazi puppet "independent state of Croatia," more than a million Serb civilians had been killed.
