In statements made exclusively to AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I, the information minister said that pan-Arab security requires a decisive stance to review the current formula, which no longer consists of military security, stockpiling of weapons and arsenals, or mobilization of troops. He said that the new formula is centered on economic, political, military, security, media, and educational areas. Safwat al-Sharif noted that the GATT agreement, acts of violence and terrorism, and cultural confrontation targeting the identity of the Arab nation are the main reasons why a new concept of pan-Arab security is necessary. Responding to a question on the Egyptian role in the new formula, the information minister affirmed that President Husni Mubarak's meetings with King Husayn of Jordan and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih focused on how to overcome Arab differences and find a way to implement the new pan-Arab security plan. The information minister said that Egypt, led by Mubarak, is the nerve of pan-Arab security and the force behind the Arab nation in the areas of education, manpower, economy, and military. Al-Sharif described the current formula of pan-Arab security as a fragile one based only on the bonds of language and history. He warned about the challenges and dangers of the future awaiting the Arab nation. On the acts of violence in the Arab region and the export of terrorism by Arab countries, the information minister said that terrorism is also present in those countries that are currently exporting it. He demanded inter-Arab cooperation to confront terrorism by using all possible means to bolster security in the Arab region. Regarding the pan-Arab security project recently proposed by the Arab League, the information minister said that this project, with some amendments and modernization, increases the Arab nation's ability to confront future challenges. He affirmed that current developments make it essential that Arabs overcome their differences and erase the effects of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
