Under the conditions that the Cl[.sub]2[/] flow rate is 30 mmol/s, the I[.sub]2[/] flow rate is 0.3 mmol/s and the cavity pressure is 200 Pa, the power outputs of linearly polarized light were obtained from the experimental data: maximum values of power output are 178W at the half extracavity and 70.4W at the full extracavity.
