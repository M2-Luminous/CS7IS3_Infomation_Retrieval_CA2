FR940429-0-00063 FR940429-0-00010 The Secretary believes this overall approach retains the principal strength of the current accrediting system_a system of peer review that focuses on the unique mission of each institution or program and that fosters educational improvement consistent with that mission_but effectively addresses the concerns with the current system that Congress raised when it created the Program Integrity Triad to strengthen institutional oversight. To illustrate the effect of this overall strategy, the Secretary offers as an example the changes to ยง602.26, Required accreditation standards. This section now contains only the statutory language for the 12 required standards. In this ``minimalist'' approach, the regulations achieve the objectives of Executive Order 12866. By no longer requiring institutions to provide annual audits to accrediting agencies, the regulations reduce the paperwork burden on both accrediting agencies and institutions at the same time they remove a major source of costly duplication of effort by accrediting agencies and the Department. By allowing agencies flexibility in establishing standards for the 12 required areas, the regulations minimize any added costs to institutions necessitated by the new requirements. Accrediting agencies are no longer required to establish and maintain costly and duplicative systems for collecting and maintaining specific information about the institutions or programs they accredit. Now agencies may tailor their systems to the mission, needs, and circumstances of those institutions or programs and the students they serve. The overall effect of the changes to this one section of the regulations is to reduce cost, reduce burden, reduce paperwork, reduce duplication of effort, and free accrediting agencies and institutions to focus on the quality of education in all its manifestations. The Secretary acknowledges that there is a potential risk with this strategy, however. By giving accrediting agencies maximum flexibility in these regulations, by giving SPREs corresponding flexibility in the regulations for the State Postsecondary Review Program, and by retaining authority for the Secretary to set specific requirements implementing the certification process, the danger exists that institutions will be burdened with reporting requirements that are similar, but not identical, thus increasing not only the reporting requirement but the recordkeeping requirement and cost as well. For this reason, the Secretary strongly urges a coordinated approach to any reporting requirement that may be imposed on institutions by the regulations implementing the Program Integrity Triad. Specifically with respect to accrediting agencies, the Secretary urges agencies to impose reporting requirements on the institutions or programs they accredit only after they carefully examine any publicly available information related to those requirements, any similar reporting requirements imposed on institutions by either the Department or the State Postsecondary Review Entities under the State Postsecondary Review Program, and any methodologies currently used, or mandated for use, by institutions in calculating the required information. The Secretary hopes that by bringing this potential risk of increased burden on institutions to the attention of the entire higher education community_without specifically addressing it in regulation_the community can work together to prevent undue burden at the same time it ensures proper accountability. The Secretary expects to take a leadership role in implementing a coordinated strategy to manage the triad, with the goal of maximizing effectiveness while minimizing burden, duplication, and inconsistencies among accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the Department. As several commenters raised the issue of Secretarial approval authority over an accrediting agency's standards, the Secretary believes it is necessary to respond. It is the Secretary's belief that section 496(a) of the HEA statute gives the Secretary explicit approval authority over an agency's standards in the context of the Secretary's overall responsibility for determining whether the agency is a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by the institutions and programs it accredits. Finally, with regard to the issue of whether the regulations properly focus on vocational institutions, the Secretary wishes to note that Congress found abuses in all sectors of higher education, not just the vocational sector. For this reason, the regulations apply to all institutions, with the exception of the requirement of unannounced inspections to institutions that provide vocational education. Changes: The specific changes to the regulations are discussed below.
