Xu Hongyuan, an official with the centre's economic forecasting department, predicted that investment in fixed assets this year might hit 1,500 billion yuan ($172.4 billion), up nearly 27 percent from a year ago. Last year, capital spending grew by 50.6 percent from 1992. Xu believes the higher level is needed because the current market demand is very much related to fixed assets investment, which is also a major factor in maintaining high economic growth in the future, as the government has envisaged. After a careful study of economic developments and in light of growing confidence that inflation will be kept at bay, economists now believe that demand should be spurred a little bit more than what was targeted at the beginning of this year. The centre, an arm of the State Planning Commission, believes this could be done through larger fixed assets investment. By doing so, Xu said, the gross national product (GNP) could expand by 11 percent this year, 2 percentage points higher than what was envisaged at the start of 1994. The latest statistics show that while inflation and fixed assets investment are moderating, personal savings and official revenues are growing rapidly. The year-on-year increase in fixed assets investment was 36.2 per cent in March, down 34.5 percentage points from a year earlier. The yearly growth in capital spending is expected to subside to about 32 per cent by June, down 29 percentage points from a year earlier. Individual savings in the country's banks are currently 186.2 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) higher than last year. In addition, the government had already withdrawn 3 billion yuan ($345 million) in currency during the first quarter of this year. The growing savings and the government's active money withdrawal have helped curtail inflation, which slipped 1.4 percentage points from March to April. Xu said he believed that despite the rising prices of some agricultural products, the current market demand is generally weakening compared with the growing supply of goods, which may dampen factory production as well as economic performance. He also explained that the inflationary pressures that have cast a pall over the economy are mainly side-effects of the price and tax reforms of last year, and should gradually fade in the months to come. As a result, the State Information Centre believes that the growth in fixed assets investment is reaching an acceptable level because consumer spending relies on the stimulus of fixed assets investment. But, he added that the government should keep a watchful eye on the growth in fixed assets investment, which customarily peaks in the fourth quarter.
