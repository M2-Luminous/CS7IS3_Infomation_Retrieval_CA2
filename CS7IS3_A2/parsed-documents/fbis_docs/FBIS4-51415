Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, in reply to an interpellation on the floor of the legislative chamber, said he felt gratified upon hearing the news and that he hopes the Clinton administration will pay heed to the resolution. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution saying that the United Nations should be encouraged to permit Taiwan to participate fully in UN activities. The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), now goes to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate. It also calls for cabinet-level exchanges between Taipei and Washington, which it said would be in the interests of both countries. Taiwan in September made its first attempt to re-join the United Nations since it was forced out in 1971. Seven Latin American countries submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in September, requesting that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly, but the request was voted down. Chien told the lawmakers that a similar proposal will be submitted to the 49th General Assembly, but that a different strategy would be used -- namely, trying to get countries from different parts of the world to support the bid. However, he also admitted that getting Taiwan admitted to the United Nations would not be an easy task, considering that the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with only 29 countries. He said the ROC could easier gain admission if it had diplomatic links with between 45 and 55 countries.
