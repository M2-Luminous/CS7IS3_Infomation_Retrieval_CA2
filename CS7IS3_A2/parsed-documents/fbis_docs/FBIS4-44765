The world's number one in telecommunications is federating its optical activities, thus preserving its technological independence and making its entry into the free marketplace. Alcatel's optoelectronic components are now prospering and are highly regarded. The group is combining its activities and creating a specialized subsidiary, Alcatel Optronics. The new company will employ 290 persons and has set its goals at a revenue of 250 million French francs [Fr] and a sales growth of 20 percent in 1994. A streamlining had become indispensable. The group's capabilities had become numerous and too dispersed. Alcatel-CIT is a major player in underwater communications system components. Several of its Marcoussis Research Center laboratories are highly reputed for their developmental work in optoelectronics. Its German subsidiary SEL has been active in this sector for many years. Based at Nozay, in Essonne, Alcatel Optronics will be responsible for the group's activities in the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of optoelectronics components. Its ultramodern plant will produce the active components (lasers and photodetectors) whose production until now has been split between its Marcoussis and SEL's German plant sites. The latter will henceforth concentrate on passive components (multiplexers), while the Lannion plant will do the assembling and testing of products designed for underwater use. In thus bringing all of its skills in this sector into a single entity, Alcatel affirms the strategic nature of optoelectronic technologies. Alcatel's president, Pierre Suard, has always kept a close watch over the group's technological independence..., especially in its core specialties. With optics becoming the heart of telecommunications, Alcatel, the world's number one in telecommunications finds it unacceptable to be dependent upon American and Japanese suppliers for its needs. Alcatel Optronics will supply the needs of the group's other subsidiaries in the fields of transmission (Alcatel-CIT, SEL, Telettra, Alcatel Network Systems) and, tomorrow, switching (Alcatel Bell and Alcatel-CIT). "Our objective is to cover the quasi-totality of the group's needs, versus the half that is currently being covered," says Philippe Bregi, Alcatel Optronics's commercial and marketing director. 20% to 30% of Sales To Be Outside of Group in 5 Years Beyond its captive markets, consisting of the group's subsidiaries, the company has decided to enter the world market in optoelectronic components for telecommunications, thus positing itself as a challenger of AT&T, which currently has 15 percent of the world market, and Japan's NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi (between 10 and 12 percent), and finds itself running neck and neck with Hewlett Packard (8 to 10 percent) and outdistancing Ericsson and Northern Telecom (5 percent each). In the minds of Alcatel Optronics's management, the objective is clear: Within 5 years, 20 to 30 percent of its sales must be outside of the group. This will double its revenue. In the optoelectronic components sector, as in that of conventional semiconductors, one of the factors making for success is large-scale production. Nozay's Production Capacity To Be Quintupled In April, the first optoelectronic components will be rolling off of Alcatel Optronics's ultramodern Nozay plant's production lines. Although its capacity is still being kept secret, the unit's 6,000 square meters--with its 140 employees--is virtually certain to enable the company to quintuple its present production rate. For this site, with its Class-100 clean rooms, the engineers have chosen a process using slices of organometallic compounds (InPAsGa) 50 mm in diameter instead of the 12.5 mm wafers previously used. This will enable the manufacture of 12,000 lasers on each slice. After being produced, assembled, then tested, these laser semiconductors, photodetectors, and optical amplification modules will be used in fiber-optic transmission systems, both terrestrial and underwater. The components that will constitute the heart of the optical PABX's, on which the group is currently working, will also be produced at Nozay.
