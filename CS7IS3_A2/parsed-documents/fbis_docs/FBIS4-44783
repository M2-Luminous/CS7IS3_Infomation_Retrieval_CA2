Strongly product-oriented plans are at the center of the funding program. Although in past years the microsystems periphery has also profited from Bonn's money, up until 1997 allocated funds will be put exclusively into microsystems technology. The Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) has added five measures to its project requirement specifications to which it wants to pay particular attention: a number of institutes are to be funded, such as the two nuclear research centers in Karlsuhe and Juelich as well as the Fraunhofer Society. Joint industrial projects in which at least two companies and one research facility are involved are also enjoying the financial infusion. Also being taken into consideration are basic research; the funding of scientific cooperation with other countries; and the deep involvement with qualifying measures, organizational development and the marketing of technology. Funds in the amount of DM600 million are going in approximately equal parts to the funding of joint [projects] in which companies and institutes cooperate and into the pockets of large research facilities. The latter, however, may only use the money for research in microsystems technology. With the new [funding] concept, attention is no long being paid to indirect-specific funding in which individual companies were also sponsored. A not insubstantial portion of the money for the joint [projects] funding benefits projects which already received the go-ahead within the last three years and where the first products have been partly developed. One example: a fiber-coupled interferometer based on integrated-optical waveguide structure, primarily useful in positioning in mechanical engineering with precision processing machines and manufacturing equipment for microelectronics. The firms of IOT -- Integrated Optics Technology -- and Euchner took part in this project. New Sensor Technologies Predominate It is notable that the majority of the projects in microsystems technology lead into new sensor technologies. Thus, the University of Magdeburg worked with three other firms in developing mass-sensitive sensors for environmental and process analysis. The Freiburg Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Metrology together with 13 medium-sized companies and one Russian cooperating partner worked out tin oxide gas sensors in thin-layer technology which is useful for the quantitative identification of CO[.sub]x[/], NO[.sub]x[/], CH[.sub]4[/], C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH, H[.sub]2[/] and NH[.sub]3[/] in complex gas mixtures. Magnet-resistive sensors for length and current measurement are the result of cooperation between the Wetzlarer Institute for Microstructure Technology and Optoelectronics (IMO) and seven medium-sized companies. The high degree of participation of research facilities and companies from East Germany is notable. In all, companies from the nine German states participated in at least 70 percent of all projects and received 20 percent (DM48.4 million) of the BMFT funds. The second BMFT Microsystems Technology Funding Project runs until 1997: Approximately DM260 The link between the Bonn ministry and the companies interested in funds is the Teltower VDI[Association of German Engineers]/VDE[Association of German Electrical Engineers] Technology Center Information Technology. Responsibilities range from theme verification to application. Since the founding of the Center, 4,600 projects have already been taken care of by its 100 colleagues. Christoph Stoppok, Program Director for Microsystems Technology in the Teltower VDI/VDE Center, points out that matters which concern the initiators of the funding concept include "making the results of [funded work] accessible to everyone, since the projects were after all funded by public money." Thus, companies could also participate indirectly in the BMFT's financial beneficence. Dr. Hans-Peter Lorenzen from the BMFT mentioned at the presentation of the new funding program that "meanwhile there are perhaps already too many institutes in this country working on microsystems technology." He is trusting to market mechanisms to take care of this excess. The new concept should above all concentrate on supporting pre-competitive joint projects following the model of the Japanese concept of promoting economic development. Was Is Microsystems Technology Anyway? With all its good plans and intentions, the BMFT certainly still has problems with the definitions of microsystems technology. For Lorenzen it is the integration of sensor functions, signal processing and actuator structures. To this extent it is not surprising that microsystems technology in Germany primarily means sensor technology. The VDE/VDI Technology Center Information Technology, like Prof. Anton Heuberger, Director of the Berlin (the future Izehoer) Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology, expands the definition somewhat: accordingly, microsystems technology is the integration of microelectric and other functions (such as optical, electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and biological) in a miniaturized solid-state system. Criticism of Funding Disparaging words regarding BMFT funding could be heard especially from Prof. Heuberger. He is critical that there are still delays at the intersection between technological developments and the translation [of such advances] into products. It is not least for this reason that he--in contrast to the naive prognosis of the BMFT, which still speaks of a leading roll for Germany--sees that the true potential for microsystems technology has already moved to Japan. The number of Germany's missed opportunities, following microelectronics and precision engineering, could continue with microsystems technology. Not least [in significance is that] with microelectronics the Japanese industry dominates the most important prerequisite for microsystems technology. How could the industrial landscape here [in Germany] escape from this dilemma? Heuberger finds the philosophers' stone in so-called technology brokers. These could be facilities, institutes or companies which slip into the roll of being service providers while at the same time taking responsibility for the product to be produced. A good understanding of the landscape of international suppliers of technologies and services is required here. Similarly as with ASIC production, these technology brokers are concerned not only with the design but also with the production and assembly of the microsystems technology products. In contrast to the Fraunhofer and other research institutes, the brokers refer to all internationally available technology and do not limit themselves only to in-house developments. Heuberger forcefully urges the support of a German supplier of software tools, without which the microsystems technology industry in this country would be made dependent on foreign suppliers. Convert Results Rapidly and With Determination It is certainly hopeful when Research Minister Paul Krueger, viewing the annual distribution of funds after 1994, considers a drop indefensible and announces corresponding measures. What will be decisive in the future, however, will not be the funds from Bonn's cornucopia but rather the functioning cooperation between institutes and industry and the rapid conversion of results into marketable products.
