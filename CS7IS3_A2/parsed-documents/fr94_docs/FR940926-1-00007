FR940926-1-00007 FR940926-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Part 53 [FAR Case 91&hyph;78] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Small Business Subcontracting Reporting (SF 295) AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council have agreed to a proposed rule to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to authorize the addition of a column to the Standard Form 295, Summary Subcontract Report, to report the number of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business enterprises. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 25, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets NW., Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;78 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Shirley Scott at (202) 501&hyph;0168 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;78. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) issued Policy Letter 91&hyph;1, Governmentwide Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Goals for Procurement Contracts, which requires agencies to report the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small businesses. Currently, the SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report, which is used to compile agency-wide data for subcontracting programs, collects dollar value of subcontracts awarded but does not collect the number of subcontracts awarded. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because small businesses are exempt from the requirement to submit the report form. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR Case 91&hyph;78), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a revised information collection requirement concerning Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number 9000&hyph;0007 is being submitted to OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Public comments concerning this request will be invited through a Federal Register notice appearing in this same issue. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 53 Government procurement.
