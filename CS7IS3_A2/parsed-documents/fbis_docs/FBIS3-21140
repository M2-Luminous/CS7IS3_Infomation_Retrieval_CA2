(IHI) has established the possibility of developing system control technology for a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) plant scheduled to be built in FY97, four years from now. This is because of their success in establishing design technology and obtaining basic data for simulations for a 1,000kW class plant based on start-up and stopping, load change, emergency stoppage and other tests using an 100kW class system control test facility, which is a step toward moving up to the 1,000kW class. Along with the fact that control of interpolar pressure differences in the fuel cell itself are important in this, reduction in the start-up time and reduction of high-temperature valves, which are expensive and are a source of thermal dispersion are necessary, since the fuel cell operating temperature is approximately 650ï¿½C. IHI began developing MCFC fuel cells in 1983, and since 1987 it has participated in the MCFC Research Association and has been working on the development of system and control technology. Since 1991, when the 100kW class system control test facility (with a mock fuel cell) was set up at the MCFC Research Association's comprehensive laboratory in Akagi, data that will affect the design, construction and operation of a future 1,000kW class pilot plant has been acquired. This research is being carried out as part of a research consignment to the MCFC Research Association from the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO) as a part of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) Moonshine Project. ``Load change rate,'' ``fuel cell interpole pressure differences,'' ``start-up time,'' ``operating time'' and ``NO[.sup]X[/]'' value were brought up as results of this research. The test facility has sufficient capacity for the 100kW class and the 1,000kW class, and the basic configuration is the same. Since at the time the facility was set up, the fuel cell was still being developed, a mock fuel cell was used. This is made up of anode (fuel pole) and cathode (air pole) heaters that simulate the heat generated and a fuel cell receptacle that gives the reference pressure for interpole pressure control. The voltage and output for fuel cell performance are computed in real time through incorporation of an equation in the controller and measurement of inlet gas formation and flow. The results of the tests were that there is a necessity for considering a layout that greatly reduces the radiant heat loss from the distribution pipes, temperature maintenance and pipe support system for reduction of the time from the ignition of the reformer to the start of reformation and changing the operating temperature of the anode gas blower that circulates the N[.sup]2[/] gas for heating to a high-temperature specification. It was confirmed that increasing the amount of fuel, taking the output and using the heat generated in the fuel cell, while continuing to raise the temperature of the fuel cell, was effective for decreasing the time from fuel cell intrusion to 100% output. Since the MCFC is normally in a molten state, there is a necessity for maintaining the interpole pressure on the electrolyte at several kilopascals or less in order to prevent electrolyte loss. The results of the tests confirmed that there was sufficient margin for the limit values during ordinary operation. In order to keep the interpole pressure difference during emergency stoppages for problems within the target of eight kilopascals, construction of a system for simultaneously shutting down the cut-off valves before and after the fuel cell was necessary. Besides this, in minimum load tests, it was made clear that stable operation down to 15% was possible with the planned control method, for the target value of 30%. At IHI, this control data will be supplied as effective data for design of the 1,000kW class MCFC pilot plant that is scheduled to be constructed by the end of FY97.
