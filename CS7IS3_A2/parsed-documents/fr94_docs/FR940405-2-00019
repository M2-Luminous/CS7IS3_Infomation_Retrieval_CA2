FR940405-2-00019 FR940405-2-00008 Minority Business Development Agency Business Development Center Applications: Beaumont-Port Arthur MBDC I.D. No. 06&hyph;10&hyph;94007&hyph;01 AGENCY: Minority Business Development Agency, Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with Executive Order 11625, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995 is estimated at $169,125. The application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The MBDC will operate in the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas geographic service area. The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions. The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; offer a full range of management and technical assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business. Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to any one evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award. MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project costs through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered. Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000. Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities. DATES: The closing date for applications is May 7, 1994. Applications must be postmarked on or before May 7, 1994.
