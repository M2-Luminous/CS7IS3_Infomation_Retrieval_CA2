The paper continues: "Public opinions in Asian countries and even in the United States protest against the decision. Many people held that the setting up of 'Radio Free Asia' in the form of Cold War is no longer useful and suitable, especially when the economic relations between the US and Asia are increasing". The paper recalls that spokespersons for the Foreign Ministries of Vietnam, China and Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Myanmar [Burma] have expressed their indignation against that move. "Asia has emerged as a region of relative peace, stability, cooperation and dynamic development, the common aspiration of all nations in the region is to expand multilateral and diversified cooperation in order to defend peace, security and socio-economic development on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, without interference into each other's affairs, and cooperation for equal benefit", the paper notes.
