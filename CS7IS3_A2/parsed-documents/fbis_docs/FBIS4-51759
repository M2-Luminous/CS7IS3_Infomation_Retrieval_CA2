FBIS4-51759 "dreas085_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 South Korea Sends Second Letter to DPRK Sends Second Letter to DPRK SK0305002694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0013 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305002694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Berlin, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] sent another letter to North Korea Monday urging the communist state to let IAEA experts undertake inspections when it changes fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, sources close to the agency said. Such inspections are necessary under the nuclear safeguards agreement, the IAEA has reportedly pointed out. The agency sent a second letter after determining that North Korea's reply on April 29 to its first letter was unsatisfactory. Monday's letter was sent to ascertain North Korea's true intentions, the sources said Tuesday. In its reply, Pyongyang told the nuclear watchdog that the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor must be changed soon and requested an early dispatch of IAEA inspectors. It made no commitment, however, on IAEA requests laid down as conditions for the presence of its inspectors at the refueling. North Korea only agreed to allow the inspectors to be present when it removes spent fuel rods from the reactor. It gave no clear reply to "the IAEA's flexible technical and compromising plans" on taking samples in order to determine the extent of plutonium extraction and the reactor's operating condition. The IAEA, in its initial letter sent early last week, told North Korea it was willing to compromise and take random samples of the spent rods, seal them and analyze them later. Although the North Koreans themselves suggested that the IAEA be present during the refueling of the five-megawatt reactor, they have failed to make an offer that would allow satisfactory inspection activities, the sources said. As a result, the IAEA sent the second letter seeking to confirm North Korea's exact intentions, they added.
