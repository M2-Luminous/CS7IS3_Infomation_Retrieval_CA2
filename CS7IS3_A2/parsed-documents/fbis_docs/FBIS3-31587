The composition of our delegation, which includes Finance Minister Julius Toth, Economy Minister Jan Ducky, Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik, Vladimir Masar, the governor of the National Bank of Slovakia, and representatives of commercial and business circles, forecasts the aim of this Asian journey. It is signing an agreement on trade and economic cooperation that will supplement the agreements signed so far--for example, that on prevention of double taxation, on the support and protection of investments, on economic and technical cooperation, and on the 1992 protocol on mutual trade. Whether or not the fact that China was one of the first countries that recognized the independent Slovak Republic can be understood as a certain guarantee that that country counts on us for the future as its business and economic partner will be clearer for us only after the end of mutual talks. Martin Bartisek interviewed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in this connection before his departure for China. [Begin recording] [Bartisek] Chinese products are not unknown on our markets. This country is at present undergoing what I would term a quiet economic boom. To a certain extent it is helped by the United States, and the West European and advanced Asian countries. Has our economy any chance in this strong competition on the Chinese market? [Meciar] The first condition is for us to be there, to be able to cope with the environment, to master the new conditions because businessmen from all over the place are going to China now. Nowadays there is room there for a chemical industry, a textile industry, consumer goods. It is a market with an enormous number of people. In other words, it is an opportunity for us to be there. On the other hand, we offer the possibility of cooperation with our firms for Chinese businessmen, the possibility of cooperation in that they could get to our markets, the possibility of cooperation in that we might think of joint actions in third countries and that there could even be a certain form of capital interlinking that would be advantageous for us. All these are facts that are important for us, and that is why I consider the visit to China very significant. After it, the visit to Thailand will follow. It has a different aim, but opening the doors to great China is an opportunity for Slovakia. [Bartisek] Prime Minister, your delegation, apart from Economy Minister Jan Ducky, includes a number of businessmen, heads of state enterprises, and private companies. I ask whether conditions have been created today for our small private businesses to establish concrete agreements in China. [Meciar] The basic conditions are being created, but let us say that it is customary that, during my travels, I am accompanied by representatives of employers' unions. It is because each trip has to be highly efficient, used not only in the political and economic part I am presenting but also in the part that is presented by representatives of the unions, industry, and so on. They gain practical experience of an actual partner and then implement what I agree. Thus, the time between my visit and their visit is shortened to zero. China now buys a lot of goods abroad [words indistinct] sell our work. [end recording]
