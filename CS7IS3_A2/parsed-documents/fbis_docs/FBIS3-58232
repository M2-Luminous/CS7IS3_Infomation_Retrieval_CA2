"A statement by President Clinton is not enough...we must wait and see what resolutions are adopted in Brussels and on that basis which decisions will be adopted by the Security Council," he told a news conference here. Stressing that the Security Council had the power to order action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Butrus-Ghali said the it was up to the Security Council "to give a mandate to NATO or withhold it," he said. "As long as the (member) states do not want to use force, and the states do not want to, we only have negotiation as a solution and a mediating action that must continue," he went on. [passage omitted] Butrus-Ghali, who was speaking after appearing before the French parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, repeated that it was not up to UN field commanders to ask for authorisation for air strikes against bases around Sarajevo. On Friday, the secretary general's spokesman said that Butrus-Ghali had refused a request from French General Jean Cot, the head of peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia, for the decision on air strikes to be delegated to him. Butrus-Ghali said that it was up to his special envoy responsible for military and humanitarian operations, and also depended on Geneva negotiations set to resume on January 18.
