It is known that UNITA deputies who are presently in Parliament face the risk of losing their seats to new elements trusted by that organization. This stand does not agree, however, with the law in force in the country. The mediators have presented a proposal which does not differ much from the government's views. It now remains to be seen what arguments the UNITA representatives will present on 6 June. Angola Radio Nacional learned that mediator Alioune Blondin Beye has been holding contacts with UNITA men with a view to finding in advance an effective stance [words indistinct]. In brief, it was a day without substantial changes in the peace talks, despite appeals from the international community to speed up the process in order to end the war in the country and reduce the suffering of the people, particularly the less privileged.
