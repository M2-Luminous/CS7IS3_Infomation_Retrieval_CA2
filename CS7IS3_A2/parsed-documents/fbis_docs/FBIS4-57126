The request for his removal from office, which was recommended by the Budget CPI, had already been rejected by the Constitution and Justice Committee but it had to be voted by the House plenum. It was voted down 208 votes for, 232 against, with 15 abstentions. The Chamber of Deputies thus acquitted Deputy Fiuza, who was accused of being implicated in the Budget mafia. To have him dismissed, the request had to be carried by 252 votes. Few deputies commented on this vote at the end of the sitting. Deputy Fiuza, former social welfare minister and former leader of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], heaved a sigh of relief upon learning the result. He said he will retire from public life. [Begin Fiuza recording] I did not resign and I answered everything. I am now in a position to say that I will no longer stand as candidate for anything. I will retire from public life. I am the first victim of the fascist repression in Brazil. [end recording] [passage omitted]
