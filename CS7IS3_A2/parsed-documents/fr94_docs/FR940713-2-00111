SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On December 17, 1993, Congress passed the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993. This legislation dissolved the Tribunal and established a new system of copyright arbitration royalty panels (CARPs) to be supported by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. The first proceeding to be initiated under the new CARP system was the distribution of the 1992 and the 1993 digital audio recording technology (DART) royalties. The 1992 DART distribution proceeding was begun by the Tribunal but was suspended when the Tribunal was abolished, and needed to be started anew. The 1993 DART distribution was begun by the Copyright Office under the new authority conferred by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993. On March 1, 1994, 59 FR 9773, we began the process of distributing DART royalties by asking the claimants to the 1992 and 1993 DART funds for comments on the following questions: (a) Do any controversies exist concerning the distribution of 1992 and/or 1993 DART royalties? (b) If controversies do exist, which subfunds do they exist in? (c) If settlements have been reached, which parties have reached settlement and which have not? (d) Do the claimants believe it would be advisable to consolidate the 1992 DART proceeding with the 1993 DART proceeding?
