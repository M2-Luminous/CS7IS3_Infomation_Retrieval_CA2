The authors of the report consider that the term "juridical status of state for Dniester," can be interpreted as "the creation of a confederation union on the basis of an agreement between two autonomous entities with equal rights for sovereignty." References of the type "departing from the existing political reality," which are often used in the declaration, could serve as a definite juridical basis for the legalization of the illegitimate structures of Dniester, including the armed forces, says the report. The experts of the Euro-Atlantic Center consider that the 28 April declaration allows the leaders of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic to negotiate about the interests of Tiraspol without having to give up any positions. At the same time the authors of the report doubt the legitimacy of the signing of the declaration on the behalf of Dniester by the Russian citizen Igor Smirnov. According to the cited source, the definite refusal of Chisinau to allow the representatives of Romania and the Ukraine to participate in the solving of the Dniester conflict may lead to an aggravation in the relations between Moldova and these states. The experts of the Euro-Atlantic Center gauged the results of the 28 April negotiations as a voluntary passage of Moldova into the Russian area of interests, which could generate essential problems in its relations with the West, including economic ones.
