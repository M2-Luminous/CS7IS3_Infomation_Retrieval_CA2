FR940725-1-00066 FR940725-1-00010 Proposed new §23.1583(c)(6) would establish the zero wing fuel weight of §23.343 as a limitation. This would provide the pilot with information necessary to prevent exceeding airplane structural limits. Proposed new §23.1583(d) has editorial changes only. Proposed new §23.1583(e)(1) and (2) would delete references to ``characteristically incapable of spinning.'' As discussed under §23.221, requirements for ``characteristically incapable of spinning'' would be deleted. Proposed new §23.1583(e)(3) and (4) would replace present paragraph (e)(3). Proposed §23.1583(e)(4) would add the requirement for specifying limitations associated with spirals, six turn spins, or more than six turn spins. The requirement for a placard has been deleted since the requirement would be covered in §23.1567. Proposed new §23.1583(e)(5) would be based on current paragraph (e)(4) for commuter category airplanes. It would be revised to define the maneuvers as those proposed for commuter category airplanes in §23.3. Proposed new §23.1583(f) would revise the heading of the paragraph and add the limit negative load factor for acrobatic category airplanes. The limit negative load factor is essential for safe operational use. Proposed new §23.1583(g) would make editorial changes with no change in requirements. The paragraph would reference the requirements of flight crews in §23.1523. Proposed §23.1583 (i), (j) and (k) are the current §23.1583(k), (l) and (m), as redesignated. Proposed new §23.1583(l) would require furnishing baggage and cargo loading limits. Proposed new §23.1583(m) would require furnishing any special limitations on systems and equipment. This would provide the pilot with information necessary for safe operation of the airplane systems and equipment. Proposed new §23.1583(n) would require a statement on ambient temperature limitations. Maximum cooling temperature limits have been required for turbine powered airplanes by §23.1521(e); however, the requirement for the limitation has never been specified in §23.1583. Proposed §23.1583(n) would require furnishing both maximum and minimum temperature limits if appropriate. A minimum temperature limit would provide the pilot with information necessary to avoid airplane damage during low temperature operations. Proposed new §23.1583(o) would require furnishing any occupant smoking limitations on the airplane. This would enhance safe operation of the airplane. Proposed new §23.1583(p) would require the applicant to state what runway surfaces have been approved. This provides the pilot with a positive indication of which runway types may be used. Section 23.1585␣Operating Procedures This proposal would rearrange the current material in §23.1585 and add additional requirements as discussed below. Proposed §23.1585(a) would contain the requirements applicable to all airplanes. The requirements would be arranged in a different order from the current requirements in paragraph (a). The requirements for information that must be included cover_unusual flight or ground handling characteristics; maximum demonstrated values of crosswinds; recommended speed for flight in rough air; restarting an engine in flight; and making a normal approach and landing in accordance with §23.73 and §23.75. All of these requirements are in current §23.1585(a) except for restarting a turbine engine in flight, which is in current paragraph (c)(5) pertaining only to multiengine airplanes. The FAA decided that a restart capability is not required for single reciprocating engine airplanes for the reasons given in the preamble discussion of proposal 3 in Amendment No. 23&hyph;43 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993). The requirement for providing restart information should apply to single turbine engines, since turbine engine designs incorporate a restart capability and inadvertent shutdowns may occur. Normal approach and landing information in accordance with the landing requirement in proposed §23.73 and §23.75 is new. This is necessary to enable pilots to achieve the published landing distances and, if necessary, to safely transition to a balked landing. Proposed §23.1585(b) would be a revision of §23.1585(b) on gliding after an engine failure for single-engine airplanes. The proposed version would reference requirements in proposed §23.71.
