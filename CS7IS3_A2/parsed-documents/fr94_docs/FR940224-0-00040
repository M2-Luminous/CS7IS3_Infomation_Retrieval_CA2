FR940224-0-00040 FR940224-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Territorial and International Affairs 15 CFR Part 303 [Docket No. 931090&hyph;4048] RIN 0625&hyph;AA06 Limit on Duty-Free Insular Watches in Calendar Year 1994 AGENCIES: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce; Office of Territorial and International Affairs, Department of the Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends 15 CFR Part 303, which governs duty-exemption allocations and duty-refund entitlements for watch producers in the United States' insular possessions (the Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa) and the Northern Mariana Islands. The amendments establish the total quantity and territorial shares of duty-exemption for 1994 and adjust the wages considered creditable towards the production incentive certificate (PIC). EFFECTIVE DATE: February 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Faye Robinson, (202) 482&hyph;1660. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The insular possessions' watch industry provision in Section 110 of Public Law 97&hyph;446 (96 Stat. 2331) (1983) (19 U.S.C. 1202, note) requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, acting jointly, to establish a limit on the quantity of watches and watch movements which may be entered free of duty during each calendar year. The law also requires the Secretaries to establish the shares of this limited quantity which may be entered from the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Regulations on the establishment of these quantities and shares are contained in §§303.3 and 303.4 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations (15 CFR 303.3 and 303.4). Section 303.6(h) gives the Secretaries authority to make the changes in §303.14. The rule also modifies §303.14(a)(1)(i) by increasing the dollar amount of wages per person that the Departments can consider in calculating the producers' allocations and PICs. The limit is raised to $35,000 in order to help attract and retain the managerial talent necessary to operate efficient watch assembly plants. We publish these revisions in proposed form on December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65294) and invited comments. We received no comments. The Departments establish for calendar year 1994 a total quantity and respective territorial shares as shown in the following table: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Virgin Islands 3,600,000 Guam 500,000 American Samoa 500,000 Northern Mariana Islands 500,000 n,s Total 5,100,000 Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), the effective date of this rule need not be delayed for 30 days because their rule relieves a restriction. The restriction is relieved by raising the amount of wages per person that the Departments can consider in calculating the producers' allocations and PICs. This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. This final rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Fewer than ten entities are directly affected by this action.
