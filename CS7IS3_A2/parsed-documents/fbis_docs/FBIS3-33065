President Fujimori said this during a news conference he held in Santa Fe de Bogota shortly before returning to his country following a two-day official visit to Colombia. He said: "I will be honest; I am personally going to talk to some presidents to make this candidacy strong, with possibilities of winning." Fujimori underlined President Gaviria's "leadership in international forums" and stressed that Gaviria "has defended Ibero-American interests, democracy, and the steadiness of his position." The Peruvian ruler added that he will support President Gaviria's aspiration to occupy the OAS post, if he decides to run, and that he will do so "not only because of our friendship, but because I believe he is a good candidate for the job." Although journalists were forewarned that only the visiting head of state would answer questions, Gaviria attended the same news conference. A few hours earlier, however, Gaviria had indicated he would make a decision about his eventual candidacy for OAS secretary general in the next few days. Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin on 14 February told the media that if the election for OAS secretary general were held today, Gaviria would win. Regarding Sanin's comments, the Colombian ruler, whose term ends on 7 August, said: "I hope she is right." He added: "In any event, we have to wait and see." President Gaviria said that he is going to "evaluate all opinions and requests from friendly countries before making a decision" about running. He said that he is very thankful nonetheless for "President Fujimori's advance support" for his eventual [as received] candidacy.
