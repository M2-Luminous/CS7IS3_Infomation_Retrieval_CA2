FBIS4-13874 "drnes079cc_94005" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Islamic Affairs Bin-Ladin's Associate on Proselytization Bid Bin-Ladin's Associate on Proselytization Bid NC2304095894 NC2304095894 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 15 April publishes a 2,500-word report on an interview with a "repentant filmmaker" who became involved with a regional scam that used bribes to lure Arab artists into joining the Muslim fundamentalist movement. The filmmaker, Anis 'Abd-al-'Ati, is interviewed by 'Adil Sa'id. 'Abd-al-'Ati says that he studied film direction at the Cinema Institute in Cairo from 1981 to 1986. He reveals that he made one documentary during his student days that received some media notice. Having left the institute without completing his studies, 'Abd-al-'Ati traveled abroad in search of work: "After I left the Cinema Institute, I went to Jordan to seek my fortune. Then I went to Iraq. There, I thought of making a film about Saddam Husayn and calling it 'Knight Faces Persia.' I met 'Udayy, Saddam Husayn's son and head of the Olympic Committee in Baghdad. I had with me some newspaper cuttings about my career. 'Udayy was forthcoming. He made me a gift of a Jeep-type vehicle full of books about Saddam Husayn's life and career. However, the peace agreement between Iraq and Iran was signed and the film project was discarded. I decided to return to Egypt." 'Abd-al-'Ati then related an aborted attempt in "a neighboring Arab country" to find a producer for a film about the Palestinian issue. He then traveled to another country, which he does not name, and was introduced to several people in the advertising and recording business. Among them was Usamah Bin-Ladin, the Saudi businessman that Egypt and other countries blame for funding the fundamentalist movement and who currently lives in Sudan. Another was Salih al-Sharif, who owns al-Muslim Recording Company. 'Abd-al-'Ati expresses the belief that Bin-Ladin actually "controls" al-Muslim company and that al-Sharif is just a "front man." 'Abd-al-'Ati, making a 3,000-riyal per month [$600 or $700] working for al-Muslim Company, began to follow the strict dress code and lifestyle favored by his employers: "Meanwhile, I went regularly to pray and perform religious rites with them. I let my beard grow and donned a shorter dress [a knee-length shirt-like dress favored by fundamentalists in presumed imitation of early Muslims]." 'Abd-al-'Ati then met a friend of his employers, a mosque preacher, 'Abd-al-'Aziz Hamdan, who asked him to preach in a mosque. In his sermon, 'Abd-al-'Ati spun a lie about himself being a world-renowned filmmaker persecuted by international Zionism. The sermon was recorded and became an immediate hit "all over the Gulf, Europe and America." 'Abd-al-'Ati finds it "regrettable" that the public fell for this "yarn," but bemoans the fact that he "did not receive one cent of the takings." An acquaintance of Bin-Ladin, whom 'Abd-al-'Ati does not name, then asked him to approach top Egyptian actors and actresses with offers of five to 10 million pounds [$1.5 million to $3 million] if they would renounce their careers and lead a life of religion. 'Abd-al-'Ati says: "He offered to increase the offer if they were ready to reform their ways and renounce their careers." The same, unidentified, acquaintance then seeks to involve 'Abd-al-'Ati in a wider scheme: "He then revealed to me an impressive proselytization effort -- Bin-Ladin's official scheme. He asked me to take charge of the finances of Islamic groups and to run an office in London for this purpose. He wanted me in this job for two reasons: First of all, being an Egyptian, this would confuse the public as to the identity of the real financiers. Second, they really trusted me. "Initially, 250 million [currency not specified] were earmarked for that project. From experience, I tell you that most of the money came from people who were unaware of how it would be used, who thought they were just donating to some charity." 'Abd-al-'Ati then fell out with the proselytization racket because he failed to meet their expectations. In one instance, 'Abd-al-'Ati refused to meet with Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, because of "fear," which he does not explain. In another, he declines to get involved in a plan to bomb the Cairo synagogue: "I met a man by the name of Muhammad Taha. I still remember his face. He asked me to put him in touch with some of my acquaintances because he planned to bomb the Cairo synagogue, but I refused." Miffed at this lack of enthusiasm, the Bin-Ladin group sent 'Abd-al-'Ati for further education: "My punishment was tactical. I received orders to move to another area [not further specified] for nine months of further education in religious matters and to do some soul-searching. "There, I made the acquaintance of 'Abdallah al-Jilali, 'Abdallah al-Jafir, and Salam al-'Awdah, all of them Bin-Ladin's friends. "After the nine months were over, I discovered that I was given a one-way exit visa [mughadarah niha'iyah] from the country [not further specified]. "Before I left, one of Bin-Ladin's friends asked me to take some letters to Afghanistan and Pakistan. I then discovered that, with the type of visa I was issued, I could not go back to Egypt or stay where I was. When they asked me to go to Afghanistan I began to fear for my life. I discovered that I was part of a new game and was virtually stateless. "I got the plane tickets after they explained to me the circumstances that forced them to terminate my residency. My travel itinerary was to take me to Damascus, then Tripoli in Libya. From there, I was supposed to go to [Rached] Ghannouchi, the extremist leader, in Tunisia. From there I was to go to Algeria and then London. "Once in Syria, laden with heavy suitcases and accompanied by my wife and son, an unexpected thing happened: An air embargo was slapped on Libya. I must have been a bit of a spectacle with my beard, clothes, and a top-to-toe-covered wife. My only option was to go back to Egypt. I was surprised to find that the Egyptians let me into the country without any problem." Having entered Egypt unchallenged, 'Abd-al-'Ati somehow traveled, also unchallenged, to the "same country" that gave him the one-way exit visa. There, he got another job offer: "Back in Egypt, I read all that the papers wrote about me and was shocked by the magnitude of the problem I had caused. A few months later, I returned to the same country with my wife and met the same people. They gave me a forged residence permit that I still have here in my pocket. "I went to give a lecture at an air base and there I met a Sudanese commander named 'Abd-al-Rahim Hammad, who came to collect donations. He offered me a job in the media, through which I would attack Egypt and get paid $20,000. I learned that Bin-Ladin had gone to Sudan." 'Abd-al-'Ati does not elaborate on his rift with the Bin-Ladin scam. He simply states that he returned to Egypt and relates the story of his estrangement with his wife, who went on to marry someone else "having stolen the common-law marriage certificate, a photocopy of which I still keep." This, AL-MUSAWWAR writes, "ends the story of the repentant filmmaker."
