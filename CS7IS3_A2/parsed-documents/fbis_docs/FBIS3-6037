Senior members of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, comprising both ruling coalition and opposition parties, held sessions on and off to set a schedule to deliberate the 73.08 trillion yen national budget for fiscal 1994, which starts April 1. Deliberations were earlier expected to start as early as Monday. However, negotiations broke down after the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) stuck to their demands for the government to submit detailed documents concerning 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed from leading trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co., officials said. The dispute could force the panel to delay budget discussions until late next week, they said. The government on Friday submitted to the panel some documents relating to the loan but the two parties were dissatisfied, saying the documents were not sufficient to clear their doubts on the matter, they said. The two parties renewed their demands that the government offer further detailed documents, the officials said. Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo submitted to the Diet that he borrowed the money from Sagawa Kyubin in September 1982 to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture. The premier said he repaid the money by January 31, 1991. Sagawa is a leading parcel delivery firm which was involved in a money-and-mobster scandal which implicated former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and fallen LDP power broker Shin Kanemaru.
