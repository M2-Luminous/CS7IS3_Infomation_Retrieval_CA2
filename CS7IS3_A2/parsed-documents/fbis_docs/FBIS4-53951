The organizer is the Cable TV Conference, formed by Japan's cable TV Industry Association. Using cable TV networks, the organizer seeks to provide a wide range of services, starting with personal handyphone systems (PHS) initially, and gradually diversifying into personal computer communications and broadcast shopping information. In the face of rapid technological shifts to multimedia communication, the 22 companies, mostly cable TV operators such as Tokyu Cable Television Co., and common carriers like DDI Corp., want to explore the many possibilities, the officials said. The firms also include KDD, NEC Corp. and leading trading house Mitsui and Co., they said. Japan's phone services industry is currently dominated by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), but the project will create another large communications link in the near future, they said.
