He said that his movement has liaisons under way with the goal of forming a broad front, bringing together cells of the opposition, and working towards the realization of a democratic arrangement in the country, after President Idriss Deby's failure to do so. Medella accused the French Government of offering support to President Deby because he resorted to increasing the French companies' share in Chadian oil. But he at the same time took into consideration that there is no comprehensive solution to the Chadian crisis without French sponsorship of any agreement that is achieved. He believes that the Chadian people have not enjoyed any type of democracy and stability since independence. He accused Deby of duplicity in his positions "because, when he is in France, he makes statements that it does not take him long to renounce when he is in Sudan, for example." The opinion of Medella, who held the post of minister of health and social affairs in the era of former President Goukouni Oueddei, is that Chad is presently in a dilemma because of the economic situation that he described as "below zero" and because of the emigration of about 60 percent of the people to the neighboring countries because the civil war in Chad is continuous. He mentioned that, in facing this reality, the movement is striving, for the sake of democracy, for the polarization of the greatest number possible of the Chadian cells opposed to "the formation of a broad front striving for a settling of the situation existing presently in the country. If it becomes clear that the settlement is not possible beyond compromise with the system, nothing will remain before us except the use of a military solution." He added that the liaisons have produced positive results up to this point. He said that the opposition cells will hold a meeting within a week or two, in a location he refused to disclose, to work toward the agreement on the establishment of a broad front, "keeping away from religious, tribal, and ideological memberships and supporting anything that has to do with the interests of the Chadian people." He attacked the national conference that was held approximately one year ago in Chad. He said that his movement rejected participation in it in light of President Deby's authority over the military, political, and economic installations in the country, "which means that the conference was no more than an occasion throughout which the participants expressed their viewpoints without reaching any decisions." He said that his movement, which presented a positive initiative on the occasion of the holding of the national conference and announced a truce in its confrontation with the governmental powers, found itself subjected to attacks on the part of these powers the evening of the conference. He pointed to the fact that the goal in organizing the conference was "to mislead international public opinion and to help Deby appear on the exterior as a democratic man at the same time that he was gathering all the power into his own hands and was not leaving any area open to others to participate in the decisionmaking." Concerning the elections expected to take place next spring, Medella said that the Chadian opposition cells found in the country, whose number is estimated to be around 45, are seeking the materials required for participation in the elections. He said that the armed opposition represented in his movement, present in the Lake Chad region, in addition to other groups of armed opposition found outside the regions of governmental authority, is refusing to participate in "formal" elections such as this. He confirmed that the issue of the elections will be at the heart of the discussions that the opposition cells will carry on during the coming meeting and that they will demand national reconciliation, defining the groundwork for reestablishing the army, and working toward the return of the emigrants and the exiled before any elections take place. He confirmed that the opposition cells are all joining each other in the view that holding elections under the present circumstances is impossible. The Islamists in Chad Concerning the scope of the importance of the Islamic cells, he said that Chad is facing several problems, such as ignorance, poverty, and conflict, among the political elements, each of which want to play a prominent role. He made it clear that among these elements are those striving to use the Arabic culture against the French and those striving for the opposite. There are also elements calling for the establishment of an Islamic system. He added that whoever knows the composition of Chad realizes the impossibility of establishing any republic having a religious character, be it Islamic or Christian. "Our issue is a national issue and not a religious one, and we do not accept the establishment of an Islamic system." French Interests He accused the West, specifically France, of supporting Deby, believing that he would apply true democracy in Chad, "but the latter is subject to a narrow view in his practice of governing, especially after he worked to strengthen the influence of the individuals of his family toward government in a way that is alienated from the public interest." He stated clearly his belief that the continuance of French support for the present system, in spite of its failure to achieve practical advancement in the area of upholding human rights, "might be attributable to Deby's undertaking to strengthen the share of the French oil companies in Chad." He pointed out that France's share in Chadian oil presently ranges between 22 and 25 percent, at a time when former Chadian President Hissein Habre had refused to give the French companies a share that they were demanding, calculated at 11 percent. He said that Deby took this risky step to guarantee the support of the French for his remaining in power, but they were getting to the point where they were realizing the scope of his failure. He confirmed that any dialogue existing in Chad for the sake of attaining a settlement of the existing situation must be by the sponsorship of France, in its capacity as the side capable of guaranteeing the attainment of what is due. Concerning the sources of his movement's funding, he said that it is self-financed and "that it is difficult to verify that." He made clear that the basic source of this funding is the residents of the Lake Chad region, which is subject to the movement's authority and which is known for its natural resources and animal wealth. He said that these residents are paying taxes to the movement, on their exports of local products, the value of which is estimated at half the value of the governmental taxes. Likewise, a large portion of the arming of the movement has its source in what it captures from the government forces.
