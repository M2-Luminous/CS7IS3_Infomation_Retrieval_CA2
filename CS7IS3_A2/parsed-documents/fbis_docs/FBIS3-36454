The counsel, Aleksandr Asnis, told Interfax on Friday the scientist had even refused to discuss the matter with him. Asnis said the Moscow City Court had continued questioning Mirzayanov on Friday afternoon. The scientist "agreed to give evidence because he still hoped to make it clear to the judges why he does not consider himself to be guilty," Asnis said. He said he hoped the interrogation of Mirzayanov and witnesses would persuade the counsel for the prosecution, Leonid Pankratov, to ask for an additional investigation of the case. Mirzayanov's interrogation will be continued at the next court session at 10:30 on February 7. The prosecution against Mirzayanov was started in 1992, after the newspaper Moscow News carried his story "Poisoned Policy," which said Russia was creating binary weapons.
