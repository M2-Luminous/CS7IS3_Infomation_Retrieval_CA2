Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney led the talks held over breakfast. Gen. Gary Luck, chief commander of the UN Forces, and Kim Sam-hun, chief aide to Han on nuclear affairs, also attended, officials said. The meeting was arranged just after the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution referring the North Korean issue to the UN Security Council. Inside sources said Seoul and Washington reaffirmed the early deployment of Patriot missiles, 36 of them sometime next month. The two sides, however, held off on a Team Spirit decision while agreeing that the drill will be staged when deemed necessary, they said. They also discussed what to expect at the UN Security Council once it takes up the North Korean issue, the possibility and effectiveness of sanctions, and Seoul and Washington's readiness to counter any North Korean threat, sources said.
