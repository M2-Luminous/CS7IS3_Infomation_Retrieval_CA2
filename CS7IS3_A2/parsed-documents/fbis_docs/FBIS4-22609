Judging by the audience reaction, the misquote was to the liking of many, reflecting the Duma's cautious attitude toward this program. The matter here is far from being one of conservatism or anti-Western sentiment of a significant portion of the deputy corps. It is difficult to expect a different reaction when the parliamentarians learn of Russia's joining in the "Partnership" as being an accomplished fact by reading about it in the newspapers. However, I will try to express in brief their doubts and questions. 1. Is the West not trying to use the "Partnership" to help fill the vacuum formed in Eastern Europe after the USSR, and later Russia, rejected the "Brezhnev doctrine," agreed with the unification of Germany and withdrew its troops from this region? After all, the non-expansion of NATO was one of the conditions for many of these unilateral steps. 2. It is understandable why NATO needs the "Partnership," but it is not quite understandable why it is needed by Russia. There are no real external threats from which it would be protected by participation in the program. Or is it necessaty for defense against the territorial aspirations of certain Baltic states? 3. For the countries of Eastern Europe, the "Partnership" is a step along the path to NATO, a sort of understudy membership in the North Atlantic block. Under such conditions, can we speak of Russia's participation in the program on an equal basis, since it turns out to be in the NATO dressing room together with Romania and Lithuania? And why act as the understudy, when Russia has the power to play for primary membership, to which it will hardly be accepted in the near future. 4. NATO was created and acted primarily as a means of containing communism. The world has changed. Would it not be better today to use the mechanism of the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe] to ensure European security, supplementing it with cooperation in the military sphere, and also to present prospective guarantees of security to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on the part of Russia and the West? 5. Will the "Partnership in the Name of Peace" not inflict a serious decline upon the military-political integration within the framework of the CIS? The Commonwealth countries will participate in the program in an individual order, and this may not always correspond with their obligations within the CIS. 6. What are the possible domestic political consequences of the "Partnership" for Russia, and primarily for the export capacities of our VPK [military-industrial complex]? After all, the countries of Eastern Europe will still gravitate more toward the Western arms markets. Moreover, the "Partnership" is not free. Each country pays for participation in it from its own budget. The deputies have not yet seen an estimate of the cost of Russian participation. 7. Have the domestic political consequences of joining in the "Partnership" been evaluated? We cannot exclude the possibility that the unfavorable attitude toward NATO retained in the consciousness of many people will evoke an upsurge of nationalist rhetoric, which will play into the hands of forces which are far from being reformist. Of course, we may also view matters from another perspective. What would happen if Russia does not take part in the "Partnership?" In this case, can it change something in the realization of the program itself or achieve anything other than self-isolation? The latter question is of key importance, since the acceleration of Russia's integration into the all-European structures and the strengthening of international stability are associated with the realization of the "Partnership." It is quite obvious that the State Duma will strive to achieve real participation in ratification of the agreement. Two paths of further action are emerging for the executive power. First, to ignore the legislators and move into the "Partnership." Technically this is possible if we present the "Partnership in the Name of Peace" as the framework of an international program, and not as a treaty which requires ratification. However, politically this is fraught with subsequent complications. The second means, which is more complex, is to try to convince public opinion and parliament of the expediency of the "Partnership in the Name of Peace" for Russia, and not only for NATO.
