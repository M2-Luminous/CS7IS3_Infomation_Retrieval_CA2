FR941011-2-00112 FR941011-2-00073 10. Allocation of adequate resources to execute permit responsibilities. In the event that either permittee believes that policy, programmatic, and funding decisions made by the NSF for the USAP prevent the adequate allocation of resources to meet permit obligations, the permittee must notify and send a letter by certified mail to the Director, Office of Polar Programs, with a copy to the contracting officer, within ten days of the identification of the resource allocation problem and state what additional resources are required to enable full compliance with permit requirements. The NSF will diligently respond to any such notification. 11. Fuel blending. The blending of used oils with new product for fuel shall be done only after representative testing of the used oils to verify that the proposed fuel management technique meets comparable standards for management of used oils set forth in 40 CFR Part 279. 12. Management of radioactive wastes. All low-level radioactive wastes shall be managed, stored, packaged, manifested, and shipped in accordance with applicable Federal regulations (e.g., NRC, DOT). Final disposal of the wastes in the United States will be in accordance with appropriate NRC and EPA regulations and any additional requirements imposed by the local jurisdiction receiving these wastes. All waste subcontractors shall be duly permitted to handle, pack, ship, or treat the wastes. The final disposal facility shall be licensed and permitted to receive and dispose of those low-level radioactive wastes. Any short-lived radioactive wastes held for decay to background levels shall be stored in a secure designated facility appropriate for that purpose; once sufficient time has passed, those wastes will be handled in a manner consistent with their other, non-radioactive characteristics. Appropriate management controls will be implemented to minimize the generation of ``mixed wastes'' (wastes with radioactive and hazardous characteristics). 13. Air emissions reductions. The standard emissions control equipment provided at the time of manufacturing for sale of vehicles and equipment in the United States shall be maintained on all vehicles and equipment operated by the permittees for the USAP. Vehicles and equipment with defective or missing emissions control equipment as determined by visual inspection must have that equipment replaced within 24 months of the issuance of this permit. Vehicles and equipment which cannot operate under antarctic conditions with the factory installed, or equivalent, emissions control equipment must be replaced with vehicles or equipment with properly functioning emissions control equipment or taken out of service within 24 months of the issuance of this permit. 14. Designation of a waste manager. The permittees shall provide to the NSF within 15 days of the issuance of this permit the name, title, and appropriate contact information for the principal individual and an alternative individual responsible for compliance with this permit. This individual shall be the official point of contact for all matters relating to the use and management of designated pollutants and wastes in Antarctica and compliance with the permit.
