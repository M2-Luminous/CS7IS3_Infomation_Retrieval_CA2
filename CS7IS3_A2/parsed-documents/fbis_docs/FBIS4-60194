It is regrettable that the announcement was no more than empty (?words) to mislead the public. It also mislead those Arab leaders and some friendly countries who called for the cease-fire out of respect for these sacred days and to prevent further bloodshed of our innocent sons and brave armed forces who found themselves in a position where they had to defend themselves, the homeland, and the citizens on battlefields. They are now resisting with rare courage the forces of the war general 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih which direct blows against them and inflict on them horrible loss of life and equipment. These forces have begun to be defeated and are now fleeing in different directions leaving behind them hundreds of corpses and considerable war materiel, some pieces destroyed but others still serviceable. The Ministry of Defense and the armed forces wish to confirm their support for our people's sons in the southern and eastern governorates on the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Yemen announced by the militant patriotic leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They are ready to make sacrifices and protect the sacred land of this dear homeland with all that is precious against anyone who conceives of trifling with its security and stability. God give us success, he is our best friend and supporter.
