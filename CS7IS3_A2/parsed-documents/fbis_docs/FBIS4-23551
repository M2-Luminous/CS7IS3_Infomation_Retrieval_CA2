THE GUARDIAN, in a major headline writes: "Diya Seeks Dialogue on Crisis." The paper reports that the Federal Government has not sued for dialogue as a viable means of resolving the political crisis in Nigeria in which prodemocracy activists want the military regime to hand over power to civilians based on the annulled 12 June presidential election results of 1993. THE GUARDIAN observes that the new approach by government became visible following the meetings Nigeria's chief of general staff Lieutenant General Diya had with traditional rulers in the eastern and western regions of the country. The SUNRAY reporting in the same vein has it that foreign nationals in Nigeria are becoming jittery because of tension created by M.K.O. Abiola and the National Democratic Coalition to form a parallel government in the country. The SKETCH on its part reports that the former governor of Anambra State, Chief C.C. Onoh, arrested by security agents in connection with the political situation in the country, has been released. It said the former governor regained his freedom yesterday Wednesday and that he refuted all allegations against him. The paper also reflects on the airport interview Chief Onoh granted journalists at the Enugu Airport in which he urged Nigerians to allow peace to reign in order to find a lasting solution to the country's problems. While the TRIBUNE reports that Chief Anthony Enahoro, a former minister in the First Republic, and Chief Bola Ige, former governor of Oyo State, have regained their freedom, it reports the arrest of other politicians but the paper failed to say who they were. It says their release was [words indistinct] the intervention of the minister of justice, Dr. Olu Onagoruwa. However, THE GUARDIAN reports that Chief Bola Ige was still being detained. Both papers may have published at different times. It however reports that 23 former civilian governors out of 30 of them who served during the last military regime in Nigeria have called for a dialogue among the different interest groups in the country to resolve the political stalemate without resorting to war. The CHAMPION, reasoning in the same way, reports that the ex- governors felt that this step will help reduce tension. The DAILY TIMES echoing in the same angle reports that other prominent Africans like Dr. Akinola Aguda, a former director general of the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and Dr. Mole Nkose, director, South African Institute of Economic Policy, have joined others to appeal to all the contending groups to use dialogue to handle the political situation in Nigeria. The TIMES also reports this by stressing that Nigeria's chief of general staff, Lt. Gen. Diya, has appealed to Nigerians to give the Abacha regime a chance to prove its sincerity.
