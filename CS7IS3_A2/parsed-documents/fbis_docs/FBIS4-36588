And that the sons "of south Yemen, who fought British imperialism for many years, will fight the new imperialism wrapped in the cloak of unity." In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT prior to his departure for Kuwait after a brief visit to the [United Arab] Emirates accompanied by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the DRY, al-Asnaj said that the south is not just Aden and the battlefield with the Sanaa forces extends to all the territory of the DRY. Asked whether he expects open Gulf recognition of the DRY, al-Asnaj said: "The issue at present is the consolidation of the cease-fire, which Sanaa tries to get around every time." He said that what Sanaa says publicly conflicts with what it is doing on the ground, as it is continuing the aggression, hitting residential areas. He added that the DRY has appealed to the UN secretary general to compel the Sanaa rulers to respect Security Council Resolution 924 and to observe the cease-fire by deed, not word. He pointed out that DRY services have intercepted telephone conversations in the voice of the Sanaa ruler, in which he urges his forces to speed up their military operations and destroy villages and residential areas. Asked whether al-'Attas will request Gulf and Arab recognition of the DRY during his current tour, al-Asnaj said: "The recognition issue depends on our steadfastness on the ground." He pointed out that fraternal and friendly states "are awaiting [the outcome of] current developments in Yemen to announce that." He said that the international community sympathizes with the right to self-determination for south Yemen. It also condemns the aggressive operations launched by the Sanaa government. Al-Asnaj praised the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] resolution issued at the GCC foreign ministers meeting. He said the resolution contains an open call for a cease-fire and for renouncing the use of force, and is in line with Security Council Resolution 924. Asked whether southern forces have received military aid from Arab states, al-Asnaj said, "we are aware of regional conditions and do appreciate them. We are asking for nothing at this stage beyond condemnation and work to halt the continuing war launched by the Sanaa rulers." On his assessment of the U.S. role, al-Asnaj said: "We are in touch with the United States and the permanent member states of the Security Council." He also said: "We are satisfied with the U.S. position, which is in line with the position declared by the GCC states." [passage omitted]
