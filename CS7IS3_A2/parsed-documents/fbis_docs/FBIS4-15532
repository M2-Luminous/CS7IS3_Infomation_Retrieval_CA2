The statement was made by the chief of the information department of the Tajik Foreign Ministry Zafar Saidov at a briefing in Dushanbe. He believes that the process of the return of Tajik refugees to their homeland is becoming steady. However, this does not suit the interests of the armed Tajik opposition and its militants are trying to frustrate the process. Saidov said that the check point of the Russian border guard troops, was shelled in the morning of April 7, from the vicinity of the port of Sherkhan (Afghanistan) where about 700 refugees are amassed waiting to return to their homeland. Saidov said that the Russian border guards showed restraint and did not retaliate. This is another manifestation of who wants to restore peace in Tajikistan and who does not, he added.
