The four planes had been shot at only after two warnings had been given, Vogel told journalists in Bonn today. NATO had adhered strictly to the UN resolution on the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The shooting down was the "bitter, but necessary" consequence of the conduct of the downed pilots and their commanders. The federal government was confident that the peace process in the former Yugoslavia would not be held up by the incident. A spokesman of the Federal Defense Ministry confirmed that German servicemen were also aboard the AWACS reconnaissance aircraft that coordinated the NATO operation. At the same time, he stated that the deployment of German servicemen on AWACS aircraft had been declared constitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.
