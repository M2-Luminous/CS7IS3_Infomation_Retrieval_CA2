FBIS4-5464 "dreas070_m_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Thailand ADB Ceases `Soft Loans'; Economic Growth Cited ADB Ceases `Soft Loans'; Economic Growth Cited BK1104030394 Bangkok THAILAND TIMES in English 11 Apr 94 p B1 BK1104030394 Bangkok THAILAND TIMES English BFN [Text] Bangkok -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has announced it has stopped granting "soft loans" at a low interest rate to Thailand, saying the economic growth of the kingdom is now at a level where it no longer qualifies for these concessionary interest rate loans. The bank said Thailand's annual economic growth rate had remained consistently high and the average yearly per capita income was now US$2,300 per annum which now disqualifies it from receiving the low interest rate soft loans. The maximum income per capita allowable is US$1,800. ADB had previously sent a report to the Finance Ministry, saying that in the next decade Thailand looked set to become a new major industrial force in the region, bringing it up to the status of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. The bank said it was obligated to distribute concessionary loans of this kind to more deserving cases, countries which have less developed economies and lower income rates than Thailand. According to the report, the bank plans to grant soft loans to east European and Latin American countries. Initially, it will allocate around US$500,000 million for the granting of such loans. The bank will, however grant soft loans totaling US$500 million to Thailand's state enterprises, although it did not go into detail about this. Somchai Ruchupan, director-general of the Fiscal Policy Office, said the withdrawal of this loan privilege will not seriously affect Thailand's development as Thailand can seek loans from alternative sources. A source at the Finance Ministry said ADB ceased granting loans of this type as of February this year.
