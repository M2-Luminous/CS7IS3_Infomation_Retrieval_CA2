In his opinion, the inflation rate this year will only be about 17 percent. An economist, he believes that changes in wages play a key role in the development of inflation. Therefore, employees are no better off when their trade unions focus attention on higher nominal wages. When interviewed by our reporter, Almos Kovacs dwelt on the inflationary threat that compensation poses. His conclusion is that the extent of this threat is inversely proportional to the compensation notes' quoted price on the stock exchange. [Ferencz] When economic research institutes and central agencies prepare their inflation forecasts, they often arrive at different conclusions. How exact are the methods of estimating the inflation rate? [Kovacs] In the final outcome, the inflation rate is a weighted average that reflects the rise of various types of costs. Hence it follows that, when estimating the inflation rate, certain assumptions must be made regarding the changes in costs--including wages, interest rates, taxes, and imports. Changes in wages play an eminent role in calculating the inflation rate. Namely, the changes in wages affect inflation not only through the changes in production costs, but also through changes in consumer demand. Interestingly, during the past three years--even though central wage regulation had ceased--very accurate estimates have been made of the development of wages, and of the extent of the resulting inflationary pressure. The market mechanisms appear to be working well in this area: Wages have not "run away" in the competitive sector. [Ferencz] In Hungary, are the effects of wages on inflation the same as in textbook economies? [Kovacs] Superficially, the proportion of wages among the costs would not seem excessively high. But in the final outcome, if there were no import, the rise of every cost could be traced back to changes in the costs of the primary factors, namely capital and labor. This is a classical Marxian theorem, but it happens to be true. [Ferencz] Then will it depend on the employees' self-restraint whether or not inflation takes off? [Kovacs] The economy's gross domestic product, or rather the proportions of earned incomes and capital incomes within it, determines the level of real wages. Thus our only option is whether real wages are obtained at a lower or higher rate of inflation, and hence at nominal wages expressed in smaller or larger numbers. The trade unions are not giving up anything even when they accept smaller increases in nominal wages, because the inflation rate will be lower and thus the same increase in real wages will be realized. It is worth noting that in Hungary--despite all appearances to the contrary--the proportion of earned incomes within GDP has increased considerably since 1990, while the proportion of capital incomes has declined substantially! Which shows that the employees' situation relatively improved, while GDP declined. [Ferencz] How does the forint's devaluation affect inflation? According to a frequently cited rule of thumb, every percentage point of devaluation raises the inflation rate by half a percentage point. [Kovacs] This rule is based on the assumption that the higher costs resulting from devaluation are reflected in the prices and are then passed on. But the question is whether this rise in costs actually has a ripple effect? It is indisputable that imported materials become more expensive after a devaluation. However, it is not so certain that the prices of finished products containing also import materials will likewise rise. For a rise in the prices of such finished products depends also on changes in other factor costs (including wages, among others). What happened in Italy in 1992 is very edifying: Despite a devaluation of the lira by more than 20 percent, the inflation rate was lower than in the preceding year. Behind this was the trade unions' self-restraint. They realized that, in order to maintain the country's competitiveness and preserve jobs, they had to accept a redistribution of incomes favoring the exporting industries. [Ferencz] Usually compensation is included among the factors causing inflation. Is not the effect of the mass of compensation notes, by now more than 100 billion forints' worth, the same as printing money? [Kovacs] Let us assume one extreme: None of the recipients of compensation want state assets, all the compensation notes are converted into cash, which is then spent on consumer goods. In this case the cash (the proceeds from the sale of the compensation notes at the quoted market price, and not the notes' combined total face value) constitutes additional purchasing power and generates inflation. If some of the recipients of compensation use their notes to buy state assets, the inflationary effect will be that much smaller. But the critical question is whether the purchasers of compensation notes, who then use those notes to buy state assets, are deferring their consumption? If they are, then aggregate demand will increase only slightly or not at all, and inflationary pressure will subside. And if we assume the other extreme--that the investors defer their consumption by exactly as much as the recipients of compensation who sold their note increase theirs; or that all the investors are foreigners--it may even be said that the inflation rate does not increase at all. Obviously, the real case lies somewhere between these two extremes. [Ferencz] Does this mean that the lower the market price of compensation notes, the smaller the threat of inflation? [Kovacs] In the final outcome, yes. In my opinion, however, it is not at all the state's intention to suppress the market price of compensation notes. After all, the expansion of the scope of assets that can be bought with compensation notes has the exact opposite effect. [Ferencz] Will the state budget's rising deficit not cancel the optimistic estimates of the inflation rate? [Kovacs] As a percentage of GDP, the state budget's deficit will be lower than last year. A large deficit is undesirable primarily because it ties down savings in the economy, diverting them from the entrepreneurial sphere. The deficit's magnitude in itself is not an inflation-generating factor. What leads to inflation is the deficit's increase, at least an increase of the deficit as a percentage of GDP. When the budgetary deficit as a percentage of GDP increases from one year to the next, this indicates a rise in aggregate demand, which is a potential inflationary threat. In any case, it produces negative effects. However, we cannot automatically conclude even from this that the inflation rate will rise; because domestic savings could also increase--that was the situation in Hungary in 1992--or import could expand--as happened in 1993--and, instead of the inflation rate's rise, the balance of payments could worsen and the structure of demand could change unfavorably. [Ferencz] What can be said of the domestic inflation rate's trend? The rate's steady decline that was typical of previous years seems to have stopped. [Kovacs] Hungary's inflation in recent years stemmed to a decisive extent from the fact that price ratios had to change. In theory, of course, this can also be accomplished in such a way that some prices decline, other rise, and the price level remains unchanged. But this has never succeeded in practice. In most areas, however, the price increases were commensurate with the cost increases and with the dismantling of price subsidies. These factors could fully explaine the price increases, and an inflationary spiral of the Latin American type was not triggered. From which it also follows that henceforth the rise in consumer prices is able to be in line with the change in producer prices. During the past two years--due to a number of factors that include, for instance, also the change in VAT [value-added tax] rates--there has developed an estimated 10-percent difference between the rise in producer and consumer prices, respectively. But this year we do not have to reckon with such "deflecting" effects. Consequently, the inflation rate could even drop as low as 17 percent.
