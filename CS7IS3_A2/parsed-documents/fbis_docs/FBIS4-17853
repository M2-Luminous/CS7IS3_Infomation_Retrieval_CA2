Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this today at a news conference which was held after his consultative meeting with Germany's Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. "It seems to me," he added, "that the important thing now is for Russia, the United States, the EU, and the UN to work out a coordinated approach." This is necessary in order to make the conflicting parties in Bosnia aware that there is a reasonable alternative to war, and that they will not succeed in playing on differences between various states. "It should be clear to the conflicting sides in Bosnia that it is no longer possible for them to play the game in which one side or another puts forward deliberately unacceptable demands -- for instance, as regards territory. That will not work," Kozyrev said.
