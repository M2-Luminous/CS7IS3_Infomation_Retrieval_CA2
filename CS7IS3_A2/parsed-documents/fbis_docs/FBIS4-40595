Station commentator Solton writes as follows. Pyongyang still has a chance to avoid sanctions. This is possible if Korea changes its present position of encouraging suspicion that it already has a nuclear weapon or intends to have one. The Moscow proposal for the convocation of a multilateral meeting is producing results. This meeting will be able to prevent sanctions. The international meeting can formulate measures for effective steps that will safeguard the sovereignty and security of the North and the South on one hand, and ensure the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula on the other hand. Pyongyang and many other countries admit the appropriateness of the meeting, but the Korean action, particularly the withdrawal from the IAEA, leads people to suspect that it is leading to the North's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If this is true, the international community has no alternative but to resort to sanctions. This development is very disadvantageous. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev agrees. The resolution is to contain such measures as an arms embargo, restriction of financial transactions, and suspension of UN assistance. Yet even if this resolution is adopted, the sanctions will be taken not at one stroke but step by step. Pyongyang has time to prove to all people that its nuclear project is peace-oriented. Wielding weapons affecting not only Pyongyang, but Washington and Seoul as well, can bring about consequences seriously aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and the entire Northeast Asian region .
