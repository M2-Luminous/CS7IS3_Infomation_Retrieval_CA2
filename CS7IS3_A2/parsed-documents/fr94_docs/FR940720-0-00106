D. Definition of Farm Equipment The NPRM defined ``farm equipment'' to mean any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in the commercial production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products. Several manufacturers and trade groups were concerned that the definition was too narrow. These commenters thought it necessary to change the words ``primarily used in'' to ``designed for use in''. They asserted that the designer is the only one who knows what tasks a particular machine was meant to perform. They also thought that the definition should include engines used in post-harvest processing and storage that take place on the farm (the U.S. Department of Agriculture had a similar comment) and transportation which takes place on the farm. Caterpillar, Inc., PPEMA, EMI and others were concerned that the word ``commercial'' might exclude equipment used in the public sector ( e.g., state agricultural programs) or on cooperative or communal farms. CARB, SDAPCB, and MECA, on the other hand, thought the definition was too broad. CARB and SDAPCB believed that the word ``commercial'' was not only necessary but needed to be defined. Suggestions for the definition were supplied. MECA suggested that the definition should be site and use specific. CARB also thought the wording should be changed to ``production and harvesting'' in place of ``and/or''. CARB provided their characterization of typical farm equipment (self-propelled and operated independent of other equipment) and a partial list of pieces of equipment that should not be included under the definition of farm equipment (utility vehicles used by a farmer to check his crops or portable power units used to generate electricity for another piece of equipment). EPA does not believe that ``designed for use in'' should be added to the definition of nonroad engine. While a machine's designer may have designed the machine with certain tasks in mind, EPA believes that the intention of the designer is less important than the actual use to which the equipment is put. A machine may have been designed to assist farmers in some process, but if more than 50 percent of these machines are now used by homeowners, it may fairly be considered other than farm equipment. Requiring that equipment ``be designed for use'' on a farm would also leave the categorization of farm equipment entirely up to the manufacturers who might, in turn, choose to categorize products as farm equipment merely to avoid state regulation. Additionally, although requested, commenters have not provided examples of where the absence of ``designed for'' in the definition would make a difference in the preemption of some engines. EPA also did not agree with CARB's description of farm and non-farm equipment because it did not address the machines which are likely to be used in both situations. Classifying equipment that is uniquely farm or non-farm related is straightforward. The more difficult equipment to characterize is multiple use equipment. Whether and when such equipment is preempted from state regulation is addressed under Section G_the Application of Definitions, Primary Use Test section of this rule. CARB's further comment, that EPA should require that equipment be involved in both production and harvesting in order to be considered farm equipment, does not account for the specialization of farm machinery. Most farm equipment is used for a specific job: cultivating, planting, harvesting, etc., rather than for tasks involving both production and harvesting. The impetus for CARB's comment is the desire to separate the harvest of tree farms from that of natural forests which might contain no element of production and to ensure that landscaping and groundskeeping are not considered farming. Under EPA's definition, however, harvesting trees from a natural forest is considered farming. Plant nurseries would also be considered farming, as plants are a product that is grown and gathered. The American Association of Nurserymen supported the proposed definition. At the same time, CARB's concern that landscaping and groundskeeping might be considered farming is alleviated. Although cutting and trimming are involved in these operations, production and harvesting are not, so equipment used would not be farm equipment unless used primarily on farms.
