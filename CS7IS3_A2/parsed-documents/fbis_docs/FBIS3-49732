The fruitless attempts to find a compromise with Taci, who proclaimed the leadership illegitimate at the Gostivar meeting last month, have, after all, been the elementary reasons for the repeated postponement of the congress, announced for 15 January. The efforts for a compromise between the two currents (the Committee and the "hard current") have, as a matter of fact, been urged by the Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. The idea was to fuse the Committee and the commission composed of members of the "Gostivar meeting" into a new body, which would then be in charge of the preparations for the Congress. For that purpose mediators from the Coordinating Board of Albanian parties (in former Yugoslavia) were elected. However, the meeting in Pristina two days ago ended without success, because representatives of the "Gostivar meeting" did not arrive. This was stated in the report signed by the Pristina mediators Femi Agani, Izmi Islami, and Riza Halimi. Thus, it seems that these negotiations have ended, nevertheless, well-informed sources claim that the Taci group is proceeding with its contacts with Tirana. A delegation of this group, headed by Aliriza Loga, paid another visit to its "sponsors," as our sources said, and recently "a new envoy from Albania" visited Debar [Macedonia]. It is even claimed that the Taci group is not very interested in the congress, because it intends to form its own party. The assemblies of the Tetovo, Gostivar, and Struga branches have not taken place (it is a precondition for the congress) and they are expected to be held by the end of this week. If that happens, the congress could be postponed for a week or two. The Congress Preparatory Committee has to put forward presidential candidates for the PDP. As we have stated several times, delegate Abdurahman Aliti, vice chairman of the Macedonian People's Assembly Djeladin Murati, and head of the PDP delegate group Muhamed Halili were mentioned as candidates for this function.
