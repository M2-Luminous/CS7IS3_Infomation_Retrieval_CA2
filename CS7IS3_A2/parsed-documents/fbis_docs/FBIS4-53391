Harmoko, general chairman of the Functional Group (GOLKAR) DPP [Central Executive Council], declared that GOLKAR has a strategic plan for victory in the 1997 general election and for success in the 1998 General Session of the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly]. "As of today, all GOLKAR echelons have a strategic plan for victory in the 1997 general election and for success in the 1998 General Session of the MPR, and the plan subsequently will be the principle and guideline for achieving objectives," Harmoko declared Wednesday, 30 March, as he closed the GOLKAR DPP national working conference. Harmoko explained that people at all echelons of GOLKAR fully understand the importance of the strategic plan, because it has a legal basis, targets, challenges, opportunities, and strategic points, although it contains only general points on steps that must be taken. Election Targets The subject of GOLKAR preparations for the 1997 general election took up almost all of the press conference held after the national working conference adjourned. In reply to a reporter's question about GOLKAR targets in the next election, Harmoko said GOLKAR will try to get as many votes as possible through honorable means. GOLKAR will fight to win the most votes, Harmoko continued, because GOLKAR's guiding principle is the upholding of the state of the Republic of Indonesia, which is based on Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] and the 1945 Constitution, on dynamic national stability, and on a national leadership firmly held by the New Order. "GOLKAR cadres have carefully integrated their operations, positions, and actions for the sake of achieving a threefold success, namely consolidation, REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan], and the 1997 general election," Harmoko declared. When asked whether internal and external problems will affect the winning of votes, Harmoko responded quickly that any organization, especially a sociopolitical organization, is sure to have problems. Nevertheless, Harmoko declared, GOLKAR is confident that through the programs and positions of GOLKAR cadres such problems can be resolved and will not affect the winning of votes. "GOLKAR is optimistic," he added. With regard to the honorable methods GOLKAR wants to use to win an election victory and with respect to the negative comments that have been made about GOLKAR victories, Harmoko said that general elections are conducted on the basis of the General Election Law. "GOLKAR has never deviated from the provisions of the General Election Law, and GOLKAR has never acted unfairly. It is very wrong for anyone to say that GOLKAR wins through dishonorable means," Harmoko declared. Harmoko also said that the other election participant organizations, namely the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] and the PPP [Development Unity Party], are not opponents but are GOLKAR's partners in developing political life. Statement of GOLKAR Position An election target is one of the eleven points in GOLKAR's position statement. The fourth point of the position statement says that the winning of the most votes in the five general elections is an expression of public confidence. This has put GOLKAR in the position of sole majority in legislative institutions and has developed and strengthened the political structure and culture on the basis of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. Other points are GOLKAR's consistent position, the dual function of ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces], succession, and maintenance of discipline. Harmoko said that issuance of this GOLKAR position statement is a new policy and will be made a tradition for each national working conference. Member Discipline With regard to the issue of discipline among GOLKAR cadres, which has recently surfaced through the quarrel over selecting regents/chiefs of second-level regions in several regions, Harmoko said GOLKAR will maintain organizational discipline on the basis of existing legal provisions, including the taking of firm action against cadres who deviate from guidelines laid down by GOLKAR. "The concept of organizational discipline will be a GOLKAR priority in the future, because without discipline an organization will not function but will disintegrate instead," Harmoko declared. He added that GOLKAR will act both to persuade and to educate, except that firm action will be taken toward recalcitrant cadres. In reply to a question about cases of bad debts and several social and legal problems involving some GOLKAR cadres and executives, Harmoko said that GOLKAR will give "equal treatment" to cadres in both "superstructure" and "infrastructure." "Thus, the maintenance of 'clean and strong government' is a part of upholding law and justice. Therefore, legal action must be taken against any cadre who acts in an aberrant way," Harmoko stated. As for the matter of discipline problems among members of FKP's [Development Function factions] in first-and second-level DPRD's [regional legislatures], which produced quarrels over the selection of regents, Harmoko explained that FKP members are extensions of GOLKAR and must follow the policies laid down by the GOLKAR DPP. "Those problems were discussed thoroughly in this national working conference," he said. Harmoko explained that after the quarrels over selection of regents were examined, it turned out that the quarrels were cases of political "engineering" by people with personal interests. "After going into the field, the DPP knows precisely that personal interests were present," Harmoko added.
