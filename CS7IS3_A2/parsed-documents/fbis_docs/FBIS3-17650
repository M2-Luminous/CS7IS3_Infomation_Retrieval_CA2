Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is, perhaps, the strongest politician among CIS presidents, proved to the Kremlin these months which are far from being a honeymoon, that it is necessary for Russian to reckon with him. [sentence as received] "Besides, experts united in praising the successes of the Kazakhstan president's Western tours, including his visit to the United States. "Of course, there is a way to `neutralise' Nazarbayev by undermining stability in his coutnry -- and some in Moscow already tried to do that. "However, no other country in the world should be more interested in a strong and stable Kazakhstan than Russia, since the newly-independent state has become the most reliable buffer between Russian and explosive Central Asia. "It is now Kazakshtan, not Russia, that `keeps the shield' between Europe and Asia while setting an example of well-wishing cooperation between the two continents on one territory". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Nazarbayev's visit: "Life itself unavoidably prompts our two countries to cooperate. If the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan succeed in laying a political basis for joint work, transnational financial-and-industrial groups may well become the locomotive which will haul the economies of the two countries from the crisis." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the Baykonur future: "The social welfare sector functions and spacecraft are launched due to Russia's space defence forces. The world-known space port is almost completely maintained by Russia. "But it is noteworthy that while Russia has been maintaining Baykonur, Kazakhstan was conducting negotiations on how to entice either the United States or Ukraine into leasing it. It was not fortuitous that at first there was talk in Alma Ata [Almaty] that the 1992 agreement does not accord with Kazakhstan's interests. Later on, there emerged an idea of establishing an international consortium on the basis of Baykonur with no prospects for Russia's advantages either over ex-Soviet republics or the other space-faring nations headed by the U.S." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on a Cossack picketing of Kazakhstan embassy: "The Cossack Union arranged the picketing of the embassy of Kazakhstan. The picketing coinciced with Nursultan Nazarbayev's arrival in Moscow. B. Suprunyuk, leader of the Russian Community of Northern Kazakhstan, and V. Latynin, ataman (chieftain) of the Moscow branch of the Cossack Union, handed over a message, addressed to the presidents of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, to the embassy. "The message points out in particular that participants in a recent roundtable meeting in Omsk on the subject `the problems of the Russians in Kazakhstan and of Kazakhs in Russia' believe that Kazakh laws and the consitution have wrongfully divided the country's law in provisions concerning the `indigenous' and `non-indigenous' population. The Russians in that republic are denied dual citizenship. Kazakhstan is the world's only country where the activities of the Russian community, Cossack and Slavic associations are banned juridically." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian First Lady Naina Yeltsin who said, in particular: "Reading newspapers, one gathers the impression that Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin] does not want people to live a better and easier life. But how can this be done for everyone and at once? Who will find a magic way to turn millions of people into millionaires? Alas, no such programmes have been suggested". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea five years ago: "A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is more than probable. This is an ecologicl time-bomb which may go off in a matter of days, not months or weeks. "In the event of multiple discharges of plutonium from the sunken submarine's nuclear missiles -- such discharges may continue for several years -- strong underwater currents, which in the area reach a speed of 1.5 metre per second and which change their course several times a day, would lead to a rapid contamination of several thousand square kilometres of the seabed. Considering that plutonium's period of semi-decay is 24,000 years, the sea in that sector would turn out to be unfit for fisheries over a span of 600-700 years". TRUD runs an interview with Yuriy Shchapov, deputy chairman of the Committee for Economic Reform, who said as follows: "People who are now in power at all levels do not want, naturally, to lose it. What can they do to secure that? First of all, to impose a state of emergency and introduce a dictatorship. The president is unlikely to become a dictator.... "The second way is to stir up inter-regional conflicts which may lead to a civil war. Neither the former nor the latter should be allowed to happen." PRAVDA on coup rumours in Russia: "A coup scenario has been regarded too gravely in the top echelons of power in Russia. Political detection came into play right away... "Those who assumed the emergence in their minds of designs which were read prior to realisation reacted anxiously and painfully to the coup scenario".
