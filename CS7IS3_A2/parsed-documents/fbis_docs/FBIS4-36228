The truce, declared unilaterally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's government in the capital Sanaa, had come into effect at midnight (2100 GMT) but firing had gone on unabated right up to the deadline. Salih forces and those of the southern breakaway state declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid began shelling each other at 6:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) on a battle front just 20 kilometres (12 miles) from this city. The collapse of the ceasefire was followed by an intense artillery bombardment of the area around the airport, which the northerners have been targeting to destroy it as a base for southern planes. But southern fighter-bombers were still taking off on combat missions, as a military spokesman accused Salih's troops of launching a widespread offensive on all fronts. He said the onslaught had begun at midnight "the very moment he (Salih) was announcing to the world he had declared a ceasefire." The northerners were "lying" and had dispatched columns of tanks to several of the war fronts shortly after the truce was announced, he charged. The breakaway southern state was still committed to the ceasefire: "all we are doing is defending ourselves and repulsing the northern offensive," he said. As the ceasefire collapsed, Sanaa Radio broadcast messages to the population of Aden saying "the hour of liberation has come." The United Nations Security Council called on June 1 for an immediate ceasefire in the civil war which erupted on May 5 between north and south, four years after they were unified. The former South Yemen proclaimed itself independent again on May 21. [passage omitted]
