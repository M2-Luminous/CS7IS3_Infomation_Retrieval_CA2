The president said the treaty negotiations with Mexico are going well: "I believe that the negotiations have advanced considerably." Cristiani stressed that negotiations for the trade agreement are not being carried out bilaterally between El Salvador and Mexico, but also include Guatemala and Honduras. "There is willingness by the Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran Governments to establish the mechanisms to conclude the treaty with Mexico as soon as possible," he said. The Salvadoran president explained that the free trade agreement (FTA) with Mexico is on course, and that proof of this is the creation of 12 work groups to give simultaneous consideration to different FTA issues. In addition, President-elect Armando Calderon Sol announced on Thursday that the agreement with Mexico would be signed at year's end, a statement that prompted reactions from the country's business sector. For businessman Pablo Tesak, the date given for implementation of the FTA is "impossible" to meet because Salvadoran private enterprise must modernize "a lot" to be able to compete with Mexican industry. Regarding this issue, President Cristiani said there is no problem in complying with the date set for the signing of the trade agreements: "perhaps the difficulty lies in the Salvadoran businessmen's participation." According to president Cristiani the businessmen's participation is fundamental to the efficient operation of a trade agreement of this nature, "because the businessmen will provide the dynamics needed for the proper development and operation of the trade agreement." The president said the role of the government is to create the operational framework to set up the economic agreement, the rest is up to the nation's productive sector. Meanwhile, the Corporation of Exporters of El Salvador (Coexport) points out in a communique that the conversations on the possible signing of a trade agreement between Mexico and Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, "should not be conducted in haste." Coexport asks the government to be "cautious" during negotiations for a new trade agreement with Mexico, because the latter has experience in this area as a result of NAFTA.
