What is unclear is why they flew so close to the ground when their route was authorized by the Colombian Air Force at 22,000 feet. The two U.S. military airplanes overflew Barranquilla for eight hours and endangered air navigation in Colombia, according to Henry Jimenez, supervisor of the Ernesto Cortizos Airport control tower. The pilots never reported their position or altitude; all they did was identify themselves with the names of Cajun 680 Alpha and Cajun 57 Alpha. [Begin Jimenez recording] They never answered our calls. That is why they might have caused a collision with controlled civilian aircraft. No one could tell what were the aircraft's positions or altitude at a given moment. [end recording] According to the official, the U.S. aircraft were in a critical airspace coordinate, meaning a route designated for civilian aircraft on the Barranquilla-Santa Fe de Bogota-New York route, crossing through Curazao and vice versa. The military aircraft left for Howard Air Force Base, Panama, at 1900.
