FR941213-2-00086 FR941213-2-00054 The Educational Development The educational development program should be a non-credit, intensive program of approximately 40 hours a week designed to meet the stated program objectives through interactive lectures and discussions, workshops, and hands-on learning experiences using university and community resources and opportunities. This course should not only emphasize EFL teaching skills, teacher training and management skills, but also American culture and most importantly, how to integrate the teaching of American culture in EFL classrooms. The curriculum should be designed to challenge the participants to grow professionally. In addition, it should provide them with practical, hands-on learn-by-doing experiences. The students should receive materials that they can immediately adapt to their BNC classes in Brazil. Time should be allowed for students informally to pursue topics of personal interest. The Brazilian teaches participating in this program are among the best English teachers in Brazil. Most already have a highly developed background in EFL based on years of teaching experience and exposure to materials and specialists from the U.S. Thus, the entire program should reflect the high academic level, sophistication and professional development of the participants. Proposal should contain evidence of on-going evaluation and ability to make program adjustments, as well as evaluation of the entire program. The Cultural Enrichment Program The two goals of the Cultural Enrichment Program are to: 1) strengthen the participants' knowledge of U.S. life and culture through carefully designed interactive classes and community cultural activities and 2) provide an insight into the use of ``cultural material'' in the classroom. The relationship between language and culture should be explored. The cultural component of the program should allow students to explore the variety of American culture in both small towns and larger cities, experience the richness of the visual and performing arts in the U.S., and interact with local citizens. Program Administration All Institute programming and administrative logistics, the management of the Educational Development Program and the Cultural Enrichment Program, local transportation, on-site university arrangements (including housing, host-families, ordering and shipping of educational materials, general program support, etc.) and maintaining current information regarding Internal Revenue Service regulations will be the responsibility of the Institute grantee. Participants should be housed in the same facility, preferably a modern dormitory with no more than two persons to a room, adequately climate-controlled for the area and sufficient bathroom facilities. Three hot meals a day must be provided. Extra-curricular activities such as field trips, Fourth of July celebrations, brief homestays and other social and recreational activities should be provided. Each participant will arrive with valid U.S. health insurance. Describe the available health and/or local health care system and plan to provide health care access. Transportation to and from the airport and local transportation between the cultural activities must be provided. Timing Grant will begin May 15, 1995. Note: the participants will arrive in July, 1995. The grant start date allows for time to prepare for the students' arrival. No funds may be expended until the grant agreement is signed. Goals The goals of the program include providing an overview of the state of the art of American EFL, identifying sources of information for materials and curriculum development, and designing a challenging individualized academic program for each participant which will promote an increased understanding of U.S. culture and society.
