There were no other infringements of the cease-fire, however. Neither was there any sign from the Serbs, who are maintaining their position, although NATO has made it clear that the ultimatum would not be extended beyond the Sunday [20 February] midnight deadline. Our special correspondent in former Yugoslavia, Philippe Lamair, met with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. [Lamair] [Question not heard] [Karadzic] If all that NATO is trying to do is make us withdraw our artillery without also controlling the Muslim infantry, then there will be a strategic imbalance and the war will continue. I believe the threats should stop and diplomacy should go forth. If the international community treats both sides on equal footing, then there will be a peace accord. If the sanctions against Serbia are lifted, for example, then the Muslims will sign a peace [agreement], not before. [Lamair] [Question not heard] [Karadzic] I believe that the United States wants to flex its muscles, humiliate Russia, and scare other countries. NATO is just like a young man who has lost his job; he is flexing his muscles, he is showing that he can hit anyone. It is obvious that they can hit us. We are only 4.5 million people, so they can hit us very easily. But it will be a moral disaster for the NATO countries. You will see, in the event there are air strikes, many NATO countries will distance themselves immediately from this immoral move.
