Replying to journalists' questions, the speaker of the upper house called the situation which had arisen during the ballot "routine teething troubles." In his opinion, they were due to the fact that, on the one hand, members of the Federation Council did not want to bring matters to the point of confrontation, but, on the other hand, there are people among them with different, at times diametrically opposed, political views. The speaker stated that he would seek to exclude various lobby intrigues from the Federation Council. Vladimir Shumeyko also dwelt on the question of relations between the upper house and the State Duma, in particular, in the event that the lower house adopts, for whatever reasons, an unconstructive stance. He recalled that, under the Constitution, in addition to the president, the government, and State Duma deputies, the Federation Council as a whole and individual members of the Federation Council also possess legislative initiative. In that case, he stressed, it is possible, in cooperation with Duma deputies who really desire to do something, to elaborate legislative acts in joint committees and commissions and adopt them straightaway right here. Vladimir Shumeyko clarified that he was talking of "an extreme case" and "bitter necessity."
