Unfortunately, this has not always come about harmoniously and there are problems in the text itself. However, the main point is not that it has been produced but the way this document will "work." After all, this important document should be "built into" a certain system of relations, therefore its fate is still not determined even if its signing goes off smoothly. The problem for the accord's potential participants, all branches and centers of power on Russian territory, is for the document to actually "begin to work." This means that there should be a certain mechanism for its implementation. Such a mechanism could be a genuine accord in parliament, in particular, between several factions. A broad nationwide accord is not even necessary but a more local one so as to adopt a package of essential laws connected with security (on the whole, personal security), and other laws, in particular, on economic reform, as well as criminal and civil codes, and much else as concerns legislation. For this it is necessary that, on the basis of the treaty, efficient coalitions are formed in both of parliament's chambers, and it is also, of course, necessary for a genuine accord to exist between Moscow and the Federation components. So, a dynamic center is necessary to implement the accord so that it does not remain only on paper but becomes a fact of political life. Such a dynamic center could take the form of permanent consultations at the highest level between representatives of the various power structures. It would be better if this is a permanent working group with a high level of cooperation. Because, despite the fact that an important and essential step has been taken, what is most important -- precisely that which lies at this document's heart -- still lies ahead.
