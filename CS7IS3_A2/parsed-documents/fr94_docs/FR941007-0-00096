FR941007-0-00096 FR941007-0-00024 Small Entities No comments received addressed the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. The Coast Guard expects that few new costs will be associated with this rule because few small entities own ships of the gross tonnage to which this regulation will apply. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains collection-of-information requirements in §§151.26, 151.27, and 151.28. The Coast Guard submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and OMB has assigned approval number 2115&hyph;0610. The Coast Guard has consolidated this information collection (OMB approval number 2115&hyph;0610) into the information collection for response plans (OMB approval number is 2115&hyph;0595). The Coast Guard is currently awaiting approval of this consolidated information collection requirement. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule is expected to contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of ship-generated oil spills in the marine environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES.
