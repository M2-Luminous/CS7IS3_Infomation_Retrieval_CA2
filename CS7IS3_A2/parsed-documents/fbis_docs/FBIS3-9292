Here is a commentary by Omer Ibrahimovic: [Ibrahimovic] I do not doubt the good intentions of those proposing this convention. However, it is obvious that this proposal was not a result of more elaborate thinking. I suspect that it was someone's hasty idea that was instantly turned into a conclusion of this important body. The initial reaction to this proposal must be a question: Why should these three people seek reconciliation when they have not been involved in a conflict against one another? Even the birds know the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the consequence of a dispute between three peoples living there, as the aggressor has been trying to present to the world all this time. This is a classical aggression by three neighboring states -- Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia -- over territorial integrity, independence, and state sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was also confirmed by the international community. The fact that the aggression was joined by the collaborators and members of the fifth column from the ranks of its own citizens, members of all three peoples, which were led by Karadzic, Boban, and Abdic, does not mean that the peoples were in the conflict themselves and that they should now seek reconciliation. With their thesis on the conflict among the peoples, the authors of the convention for reconciliation, even though they did not intend it, are, objectively speaking, marginalizing the aggression and minimizing the responsibility for aggression. If anyone should seek reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it would make more sense that the Bosnian Serbs, who remained on the free territory and suffered the burden of the war together with the other two peoples, establish the conditions at their upcoming convention under which they would reconcile with their compatriots who, by joining the aggressor, fired at them and their children, held them under a siege without elementary conditions for living, tortured them with all kinds of blockades, and kept them under the psychological pressure of their propaganda machinery. The same applies to the Bosnian Croats and their extremists, who worked against the interests of their people and their country, like the Bosnian Serb extremists did by taking part in the realization of the policy of territorial partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, trading with its territory, and the so-called human exchanges of their people, committing at the same time the crime of genocide against the other two nations through the so-called ethnic cleansing of their national territories. Even after two years of human suffering, all types of fascism that emerged in this region are referred to in general terms, as if the term fascism could not be bear the name of the people who promoted it. Therefore, the primary question today is not the reconciliation of these three peoples. They continued to live on the free territories, as was the case in the past. The primary question is under what conditions will the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats reconcile with their compatriots who were killing their children and destroying their houses and property. The Bosnian Muslims have already taken their stand by directly confronting the supporters of [Fikret] Abdic, since all appeals to reason were understood as the weakness of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, instead of calling for a convention of reconciliation among the three peoples, it would be more sensible to ask one's own people on the occupied territories, as patriots of their homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to turn their rifles against the fascist leaders and their followers, who have committed so many crimes against their own people. Everyone must understand that, regardless of whether this convention of reconciliation was held, there will be no peace in Bosnian until the last refugee returns to his home, even if this home was burned down, and until the last criminal, regardless of his nationality, is punished for his crimes. I would, therefore, recommend to those who proposed the convention and setting up of various commissions for building confidence among different peoples to keep clear of bad business, but to direct their political energy and influence in the people on the mobilization of people to stand against fascism and its executors in their own ranks. Clinton himself recently said that Serbian fascism is the most responsible for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although one should not exonerate the Muslim and Croat fascists either. Our people do not need new illusions and political fog in the form of reconciliation conventions but an active struggle against fascism in one's own ranks.
