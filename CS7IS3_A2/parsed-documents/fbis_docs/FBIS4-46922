The state publishes edicts and decrees, looking for resources as much as possible. And social protection seems to correct the rules of the game that are imposed on us by the market. In Novosibirsk, social protection departments have been established in all rayons of the city. In the first quarter, R110 million have been allocated from the city budget for providing material assistance (already more than R250 million in the second quarter). Seven people work in this department in Tsentralnyy Rayon. Employees of the department looked after 465 families at the beginning of the year. Material assistance was received by 1,392 people. Among them were pensioners and invalids, large families and single mothers, and people who were victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. The provision of daily bread always remains the overriding task. The distribution of acquired resources cannot be resolved with a simple measure. Therefore, officials of the social protection administration turn directly to the producers of food products and conclude contracts for deliveries. Simultaneously, contracts are concluded with stores, and money is transferred there for the purchase of commodities (interest-free loan) so that the poorly provided for residents of the rayon would make purchases of food products in the Energy and Echo municipal enterprises at prices that are 15 percent lower than retail prices. But in the Hermes and Dawn stores, 490 people received food products free of charge. For these purposes, R2.5 million were allocated. According to a contract on cooperation with the Clothing trade-production firm, people acquired goods at a 20 percent discount (40 critically needy families received knitted underwear here free of charge): The Shveybyt joint-stock company helped mend and make clothing as good as new for half price. The rayon administration allocated credit of R10 million for these purposes. All told in the first quarter, more than R9 million was expended on material assistance, R2.7 million was received from the city budget, and the rest of the resources drawn in by the rayon administration were received from sponsors. Daily bread is a problem that is common to everyone--daily, constant, but far from the only one. All of the data on the people, and on their needs, are entered into a computer. Everything about life, and what it is like: Swimming lessons were covered for 36 children; 13 families had refrigerators repaired; 140 families received seeds and books on vegetable gardening; fares for the transport of invalids, for students of large families, and for families where there are two and more invalids, were paid for. As usual, everyday life is brightened by celebrations and holidays. One hundred and forty participants in the Battle of Leningrad and blockade-runners came to a meeting where there was a concert, the presentation of commemorative souvenirs, and a festive dinner. In celebration of 8 March, gifts totalling R3 million were presented to women from large families and incomplete families, invalids, and single pensioners. The holiday Spring was organized at the end of March for pensioners and invalids. Using the occasion, workers of the housing administration of the rayon and the Central Savings Bank clarified the situation on allowances for the payment of housing. Fifty-seven pensioners and invalids rested in holiday hotels and sanatoriums. Two single elderly people formed school boarding houses. It turned out that making living arrangements for elderly single people is the most difficult problem to resolve today. Two hundred and nine of them, who have ended up facing life alone, are provided services at home. Three social assistance sections, in which women work, were established for this in the rayon. Each of the women has up to 10 wards. What is behind this? Most of all, helplessness and old age. Sometimes the physical load is easier to bear than communication with people who are out of favor with fate. Of course, not everyone survives. Many work out of hopelessness--they were laid off from service. Elderly people spoke with gratitude about the work of Marina Aleksandrovna Sheina, Svetlana Stepanovna Manuylova, and Olga Veniaminovna Rozovska. Others were also mentioned, but these women requested that they not be named: The children are embarrassed by the work of their mothers. Some day they will understand that the most onerous but also the most noble burden fell to the lot of their mothers--to take into their hands the concerns of their fellow citizens. We often hear the phrase: "The level of a civilized state is determined by the attitude in it toward old people and children." But the state--this, after all, is us?
