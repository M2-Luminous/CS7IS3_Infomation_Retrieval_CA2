FBIS4-56436 "drlat086_c_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 MEXICO Roundup of Economic Developments Roundup of Economic Developments PA0305202594 PA0305202594 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports on economic developments monitored through 3 May. Marco Antonio Slim Domit, director of the leading financial group Segumex-Inbursa, has said the implementation of NAFTA will result in growth in the assembly plant industry. He said "30 new industries have already opened this year, and it is expected 140 other plants will open before the end of the year." This represents a 19.2-percent increase over 1993. Industrial specialist John Christman has reported the industry "could be worth approximately $28.5 billion" by December. The big winners, he added, "will be the auto industry, textiles, and garments," the exports of which are expected to hit $20 billion by 1999. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 26 April 94 p 22) Carlos Eduardo Represas, president of the Private Sector Economic Studies Center, has said economic growth and investment projects for 1994 have already been affected by interest rate increases and pressure on exchange rates. Following his participation in a seminar entitled Mexican Industrial Policy, he proposed the government devise a number of economic, social, and political measures aimed at restoring confidence. Represas denied, however, the current conditions forecast a drastic drop in the currency exchange rate. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 pp 1, 31) Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international trade negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat, Secofi, has reported Mexican exports to the United States increased 23 percent during the first quarter of 1994. This, he said, "is a result of NAFTA." The assembly industry, for its part, increased exports by 28 percent during the same period. Blanco said Mexico deems workers' rights and the environment to be very important issues, but "we will never accept their being used for the imposition of measures for commercial protectionism." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 22) Secofi Secretary Jaime Serra Puche has said foreign investments reached $5.22 billion during the first quarter of 1994, 89 percent higher than the same period in 1993. During an impromptu news conference following his participation at the seminar on Mexican Industrial Policy, he said oil exports were 20 percent higher in March and could reach 25 percent under NAFTA. He reported, however, foreign investment in general dropped approximately 50 percent in March with regard to January 1994. While U.S. imports from other countries rose 11 percent, imports from Mexico grew twice as much. Serra Puche concluded generally speaking, "implementation of NAFTA and lower import tariffs have produced encouraging results for the country." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 7) Imports of computer technology increased 28 percent, following the implementation of NAFTA and the lifting of trade tariffs. Mexican computer and software exports, meanwhile, are relatively low in comparison to imports. Industrial leader Antonio Medina Mora said the industry will require more financial support to reach its goals. Projections for 1995, under the present free trade market conditions, show $2 billion in sales. Software is expected to grow by 28 percent, services by 18.9 percent, and hardware by 16.6 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 26) The financial group Asemex-Banpais has stated $4.95 billion was transferred out of the country during March. He added international reserves dropped to $24 billion compared to the $29 billion available in January and February. The main routes were through the Mexican stock market, with 36.24 percent of the total, and the currency exchange market, with 34.69 percent. Banking notes, negotiable documents, and open shares followed. The group noted, however, that "even if all economic agents were to trade in their pesos for dollars, the reserves would still be sufficient to cover the demand;" therefore, the document concludes, "there is no call for a devaluation of the peso." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 17) The Bank of Mexico has reported loans granted to the manufacturing sector dropped 3.5 percent during the first month of the year. The bank granted loans totaling 60.43 billion pesos in December 1993. That amount dropped to 58.17 billion pesos in January 1994; this, the report states, affected other areas such as insurance, accounting services, rentals, and other related activities. Credit requests from these fields dropped proportionally. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 19) The government and private sector's firm control over labor unions has prevented Mexican workers from freely and democratically organizing unions, while 5 to 6 million people are unemployed, and approximately 12 million have part-time jobs. This information was disclosed by the Authentic Labor Front, FAT, and corroborated by the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). Furthermore, according to FAT, workers' buying power has deteriorated, and their meager participation in nongovernment unions proves there is a lack of freedom in that respect. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0943 GMT 28 April 94) The National Chamber of Electrical Appliance Manufacturers [Caname] has disclosed the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) has substantially reduced its local acquisitions to control its budget and reduce its foreign loans, which dropped from 2.8 billion new pesos in 1991 to 1.4 billion pesos in 1992 and 1.2 billion pesos in 1993. Caname says that due to the problems that emerged with the implementation of NAFTA early this year, the CFE's local purchases totaled 132 million pesos, which is an insignificant figure. Meanwhile, CFE imports in 1993 totaled 453 million pesos, down from 665 million pesos in 1992. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 32) The Mexican Telephone System (Telmex) has reported the loss of 718.75 million pesos during the first quarter of 1994 due to fluctuations in the exchange rate and a substantial increase in interest rates in the United States over the past few months. In its quarterly report, the company has disclosed its net profits during the same period amounted to 1.850 billion pesos (approximately $560 million), 14.3 percent less than it earned in 1993. An EL FINANCIERO study indicates investors recovered some of their confidence, but the uncertainty of the past few months still had an effect; nevertheless, Telmex sales, up until March, totaled 6.630 billion pesos (approximately $2.09 billion), 13 percent more than during the same period in 1993. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 10) A report by the Indosuez Bank presents Telmex as the most attractive telecommunications company on the Latin American market. Indosuez says compared to other Latin American telephone companies in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, Telmex offers the best value. The comparison was based on the macroeconomic conditions of each country, the possibilities for growth, corporate efficiency, debt, and the flow of funds. The purchase of Telmex shares was strongly recommended in the report because the company is rapidly replacing its old lines with digital equipment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 10) In an immediate response to the reduction of treasury bond interest rates, the Mexican stock market closed with an increase for the second consecutive day, thus accumulating a two-day advance of 6.38 percent. On 27 April, the index of prices and quotations increased 48.65 points, 2.13 percent, closing at 2,332 points and 78 trading units. Financial analysts have said the stock market is reacting favorably to the agreements signed by the economic secretaries and ministers of Mexico, Canada, and the United States to strengthen the currency. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 28 April) The Mexican Network of Action In Response to Free Trade has said the first quarter of NAFTA negatively affected Mexico. The agricultural and forestal sectors suffered adverse economic effects, the country's trade deficit increased by 20 percent, and there was an unexpected increase in imports of consumer goods. The group adds complaints of labor rights violations were also filed at the NAFTA Labor Commission based in Dallas. Network representative Bertha Lujan says her organization will demand the renegotiation of NAFTA. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 29 April 94 p 59) Today during a meeting with the leaders of small- and medium-sized businesses in Mexico City, Commerce and Industrial Development Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said Mexico's exports to the United States increased 22 percent during the first two months of 1994. He explained this is due to NAFTA and is very encouraging for Mexico. Serra Puche said that during the first quarter of 1994, foreign investment in Mexico amounted to $5.2 billion, which will increase as Mexico increases its products on foreign markets. He added Mexico intends to strengthen trade with the Central American nations. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 29 April 94 p 57) A report by the Presidency of the republic indicates that thanks to NAFTA, nonoil exports increased during the first quarter of 1994, achieving a growth rate of 23.9 percent. Imports increased overall by 19.7 percent, surpassing overall exports, which increased by 17.5 percent. The report indicates the effect of releasing tariffs was reflected in the growth of bilateral trade with the United States, which increased 22.4 percent, and trade with Canada, which increased 48.5 percent. Meanwhile, nonoil agricultural exports in January and February surpassed those of the same period in 1993 by $1.4 billion. (Mexico city EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 29 April 1994 p 24)
