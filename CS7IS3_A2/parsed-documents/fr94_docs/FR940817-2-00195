The determination of the applicable rate of interest with respect to nonqualified withdrawals was computed, according to the joint regulations issued under the Act (46 CFR 391.7(e)(2)(ii)), by multiplying eight percent by the ratio which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of such taxable year bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable rate so determined was computed to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. SO ORDERED BY: Maritime Administrator, Maritime Administration.
