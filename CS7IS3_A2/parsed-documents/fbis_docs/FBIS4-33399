FBIS4-33399 "drlat108_t_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Venezuela Subcommittee Chairman Endorses Increase Subcommittee Chairman Endorses Increase PA0306235594 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 3 Jun 94 PA0306235594 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] [Text] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Oil, Energy, and Mine Subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, has endorsed the increase in gasoline prices, saying it is no longer possible to continue registering losses in the profit margin of the oil sector. Convergence Senator Luis Ramon Matos did not agree, saying this is not the opportune time to announce an increase. He has said the country is experiencing a devaluation of the bolivar, a rise in speculation, price increases, and a deterioration in the mass transit system, all of which make difficult the acceptance of this decision. According to Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce and Services] President Berend Roosen, the reduction in the price of the dollar does not entail a reduction in products of mass consumption, because most of the raw materials have already been imported. He has added a study is being conducted on suggested top retail prices to achieve stability between merchants and customers. Roosen has recalled that due to the dollar's stability, the internal market has been restocked.
