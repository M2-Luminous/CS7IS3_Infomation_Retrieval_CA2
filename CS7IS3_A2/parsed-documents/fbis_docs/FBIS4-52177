They [Khmer Rouge] [KR] must now stop fighting. Since they have claimed to be the people's representatives, they should not be afraid of the election. If they dare to take part in a democratic election, I dare to ask Samdech Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, Samdech Chea Sim, and Samdech Son Sann to agree to a new election. The pevious election was claimed to be incorrectly held because it was organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], by the foreigners. They said that. Now, we propose that a new election be held with Sihanouk overseeing it. [applause]. Sihanouk will supervise it. I would like to take this occasion to inform venerable monks of this message. That is, Sihanouk will supervise and rearrange (?with his neutral attitude) an election. They should be happy with all the seats that they will get. Supposing that they can get 50 seats, they will be able to control a large portion of the power. Fifty seats will be a large portion. If they get 70 seats, they will be very strong. If they get 80 seats, they will be able to do anything they like. Therefore, they should agree. Speaking before the venerable monks at this third congress of Buddhist monks, we are not joking. Let us hold another election since they said the previous one was organized by the foreigners, the UNTAC. Now, it will be held by Sihanouk whom they recognize as their king. They have not yet rejected Sihanouk. They said they only reject Samdech Ranariddh, His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim. They do not reject Sihanouk. Now, Sihanouk is willing, (?at this age), to chair, to organize it. Sihanouk will go to all provinces to see that the election is held correctly. Whoever will win or lose, we will control the power in line with the laws and Constitution. [Words indistinct] they must have heard about this now because they have informants. They always hear about everything we say. They are very smart. They have informants. They always hear about everything at once. Now, I would like to make this appeal that venerable monks have also expressed their welcome just now. Now, if Samdechs Ranariddh, Hun Sen, and Chea Sim have the spirit of sportsmanship, of a so-called [preceding word in French] sportsman, they should agree if the Khmer Rouge [KR] stop fighting. Everyone should observe a standstill wherever he is. They should be anywhere they are and stop oppressing, stop killing the others. We should play the game correctly. We should play the sport correctly. That is, we should play the game of genuine democracy by holding the election, the general election in all provinces. We should hold the election again (?with all parties taking part). [passage omitted] On this occasion, they should think whether to agree, to accept a reelection or they accept my other formula that they should return all of their autonomus regions and then dissolve their army, not 100 percent, [changes thought] to integrate it into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] like the armies of H.E. Son Sann, H.E. Sak Sutsakhan, Samdech Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun Sen which are now KRAF, and then they themselves join the Royal Government to share the power. However, some have said that the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independence, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] or the Cambodian People's Party disagreed. They said that it would be against the Constitution for them to join the government. Even if the constitution is amended, we can still refuse to accept them. In the Sangkum Reas Niyum, not only those elected party members were made ministers. The outsiders, such as experts, were appointed ministers. The Constitution in that era did not prohibit this. That was done to achieve peace, to eliminate the impasse, the autonomous state. If the Khmer Rouge agree to negotiate with this side, if this side kindly agrees to accept them into the government, there will certainly be a way out. There will be a way out, but we have continued to say no. Not only saying no and refusing to allow them to join the government, but we have even (?rejected) them through legal means by drafting a law declaring the Khmer Rouge as the outlaws. By so doing, they will become even more cruel. At present, can we prevent them from entering the villages and communes that belong to the FUNCINPEC and to the front of H.E. Sak Sutsakhan to slash the throats of women there; can we protect our people? Since we cannot protect our people, we should agree to form a coalition with the Khmer Rouge. It does not mean that we must agree with it unconditionally. We will agree to do so only when the Khmer Rouge stop fighting, stop killing, and stop having an army. They should intergrate their army into the KRAF so that there will be only one army. Our government will be a government of peace and national reconciliation by including them in it. With that statement, I was accused of desiring to help the Khmer Rouge. It is not that I want to help the Khmer Rouge. I would not dare to lie before the venerable monks here. Samdech Sihanouk only wants peace for the nation. That is all. [passsage omitted] Now there are these two options. Should we hold another election, or should we refrain from the reelection and turn to reconciliation by accepting the Khmer Rouge in the government and their army in the KRAF? But will they agree with it? If they disagree, national history (?will punish them). As for us, we must now calculate what is right or wrong so that if children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren suffer any loss of life again, we will know clearly who are the wrongdoers.
