The abnormality detection system, which uses a microphone developed by PNC, will be installed in a former Soviet-type reactor (RBMK), and Japan and Russia will conduct demonstration tests together. There are also plans for cooperation on a comprehensive leak detection system that uses microphones and piezosensors to maintain the soundness of reactor piping. This cooperation will be conducted under the framework of the Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement. The estimated budget for the project for 1993 [sic] is about Â¥960,000,000. Japan and Russia have held three meetings of specialists and conducted discussions on the framework for cooperation and technical items. The result was a basic agreement on the contents of the cooperative project in July. Thereafter, diplomatic negotiations continued, and a letter of agreement was signed on 12 November. The abnormality detection system will be installed inside the reactor containment vessel, and it will alert operators to abnormalities by detecting signals through the microphone.
