The new informative service of the General Police Inspectorate is headed by Colonel Traian Dima and became operational with the new restructuring of the services and directorates within the General Police Inspectorate. From the name of the new service, which is not subordinated to Military Unit [UM] 0215 Bucharest, one can infer that its duty is to carry out an intelligence supervisory watch on the activity of the General Police Inspectorate and to brief the Inspectorate leadership on relevant operational developments. The initiator of this intelligence unit is Major General Ion Pitulescu, head of the General Police Inspectorate. The first attempt made by Major General Ion Pitulescu to set up such an intelligence service within the Inspectorate's structure was last March, when his initial proposal was turned down. By claiming that UM 0215 Bucharest -- a specialized unit designed to defend state secrets in the Ministry of Interior and ensure the protection of the police personnel -- "cannot fulfill such duties in the sphere of the police bodies' activity," the head of the General Police Inspectorate, Major General Ion Pitulescu, emerged victorious and obtained the approval for setting up the new unit. Therefore, to the five already existing domestic intelligence services, one should now add a sixth one, namely the Directorate for Operative Supervision and Intelligence of the General Police Inspectorate.
