FR940906-2-00049 FR940906-2-00043 The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life. This announcement focuses on all priority areas of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'') Authority This project is authorized under sections 301(a), [42 U.S.C. 241 (a)] and 318(a), [42 U.S.C. 247c (a)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and Executive Order 12832 dated January 19, 1993. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicant Assistance will be provided only to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to NAS. The mission of CDC is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease and disability. To accomplish this mission, CDC works in partnership with public, private, and voluntary organizations that may be for profit or not for profit groups operating at the State, local, national, and international level to: 1. Monitor the status of diseases. 2. Detect and investigate health problems. 3. Conduct research to enhance prevention. 4. Develop and advocate sound public health policies. 5. Carry out strategies for the prevention of disease. 6. Promote healthy behaviors. 7. Foster safe and healthy environments. 8. Control risk factors leading to the development of disease. In defining the scientific basis and operational direction for achieving its mission, CDC must frequently obtain independent advice that is inherently acceptable to the American public, of unparalleled objectivity, and unquestionable quality. Occasionally, these conditions can only be met by using a unique relationship and mechanisms established for these purposes by the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government. NAS was chartered by the U.S. Congress under an Act of Incorporation and approved by the President in 1863. The Act required the Academy to ``.␣.␣. investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art, the actual expense of such .␣.␣. to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose. .␣.␣.'' Pursuant to the charter, IOM was established in 1970. NAS and IOM operate in the national interest by assembling the Nation's eminent scholars in a variety of commissions, boards, offices, and committees to furnish advice and guidance of unparalleled objectivity. The findings and recommendations of IOM, NAS, are accorded a degree of acceptance unequaled by any other body of American scholars. During FY 1993, CDC conducted individual reviews of the technical and scientific merits of two requests for assistance submitted by IOM. Independent funding mechanisms were implemented to support IOM research in the areas of Comprehensive School Health, and Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths. These studies, listed as Projects 1. and 3., are now well into their second year and cannot be duplicated by any other organization without significant unnecessary cost to CDC. In March 1994, the IOM convened a one-day meeting to consider plans for an IOM study of efforts to control STDs in the United States, as well as directions for future public health policy and research in this area. The planning group agreed that such a study could make an important contribution to the STD and public health field and could offer useful guidance in shaping future programs and policies to contain the epidemic of STDs in the United States. The planning group encouraged IOM staff to proceed in further developing plans for this study. As a result, the IOM submitted a proposal for the study, Project 2., to the CDC. The proposed study is consistent with the mission of the CDC. Completion of the study and efficient implementation of its findings and recommendations requires that the work be performed with an unquestionable level of objectivity, that it have immediate credibility, and carry a high degree of public acceptance. IOM is the only body of American scholars fulfilling the requirement for this study. In accordance with Executive Order 12832, when CDC determines that IOM, because of its unique qualifications, is the only source that can provide the expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet program requirements, services of the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
