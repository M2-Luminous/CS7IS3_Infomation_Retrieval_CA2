At the "small party congress" of the FDP in Hildesheim the majority of the delegates adopted a guiding motion for merging the Ministry of Women and Youth and the Ministry of Family and the Elderly. In addition, the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Ministry of Education are to be merged. Regarding its statement on a coalition following the Bundestag election on 16 October, the FDP does not want to let itself be pressured by the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. Its chairman, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, stressed in Hildesheim that a corresponding statement will be made only after the summer recess: "We do not let anything be imposed on us." On Friday CSU Chairman Theo Waigel had called on the FDP to commit itself to the CDU/CSU as a coalition partner in Bonn before the election of a new president and had announced that, if the FDP does not do so, the CDU/CSU would pursue an election campaign against the FDP. The FDP chairman harshly criticized the SPD. The SPD has "swallowed foreign policy chalk," Kinkel said. He will "remind" SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping "again and again that his party is blocking the urgently necessary amendment to the Basic Law for blue-helmet missions by the Bundeswehr." The SPD is not capable of ruling. The red-green coalition in Lower Saxony has proved to be a "discontinuing model." [passage omitted]
