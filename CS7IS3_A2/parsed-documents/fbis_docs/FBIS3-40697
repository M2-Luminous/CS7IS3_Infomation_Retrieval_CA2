Protagonists of the new treaty say that India has all the policy instruments in place to increase its share to at least the 1950s level of 3.6 per cent. The question is, what are the likely gains for India's exports? Can India capture a share of the additional expansion of world trade following the Uruguay Round by AD 2005? The GATT secretariat offers a clue when it says that the largest increases in trade will come in textiles and clothing and in agriculture--areas in which India is competitive. Movement of personnel is another area in which India is expected to gain. On the other hand, what is of grave concern is India is the impact of the new intellectual property regime on the drugs and pharmaceuticals industry and prices. A look at the sector specific implications reveals the following: Services A gain for India. The US has made one of the best offers allowing global movement of 65,000 skilled professionals annually in the software services sector, medical and educational fields. However, Indian negotiators are disappointed that the offers do not cover semi-skilled workers. Australia and Canada have also offered no caps on movement of skilled personnel for individual professionals. Using a crude indicator, even if 10,000 personnel move to the US in one year and save $1,000 per month, the total remittances that could accrue to India are $120 million, and that just from the US. However, these gains could be substantially diluted if India does not offer "significant" market access in financial services. A "comprise" clause says that countries can modify their offers, if there are no improvements in access for financial services. Textiles By far the biggest gain for India. The gains will, however, be long term ones. India's potential as a leading exporter is evident from the fact that out of the average imports by developed countries in the six year period of 1986 to 1991, which was to the tune of $66 billion, the share of the developing countries, despite the import quotas, was half, at $33 billion. A measure of India's strengths in this sector can also be gauged from the fact that in 1990-91, this accounted for a quarter of India's merchandise exports. According to industry analysts, India's main rivals--South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia--are expected to lose their competitive edge due to high wage costs. India and China are expected to emerge as the major players, says one of India's chief negotiators. TRIPS Trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) will have the most serious implications for the Indian drug industry and consumers who will have to pay higher prices. "Prices will go up by as much as 10 to 15 times," according to B.K. Keayla of the National Working Group on Patent Laws. The rise in prices is estimated on the basis of comparisons with drug prices in Pakistan which recognises product patents. Mr Keayla argues that Pakistan is the most relevant comparison as it has comparable living standards. A complex world will be ushered in where Indian firms will exploit the process patent regime, an area where it has considerable expertise. Transnationals will exploit both the process and the product patent regime. As a result, an "anti-competitive situation will develop amongst both Indian firms and transnationals." This tendency will be more acute among the latter. The benefits of the transitional period--10 years--for India has also been considerably diluted as process and product patents registered after the enforcement of agreement, will be granted exclusive marketing rights. Mr Keayla also warns that "transnationals can develop new processes claiming less toxicity and side effects and secure exclusive marketing rights," even though their products may have been registered before the date of the enforcement of the agreement. More importantly, industry sources say that as imports will be granted the same patent rights as domestic production, enhanced protection for intellectual pro-party will not lead to significant foreign investment inflows in this sector. Micro-organisms, which are useful for varying purposes, including raising agricultural production to pharmaceutical applications, are not covered under the IPR provisions. At the same time, says a former Indian trade negotiator, "There is no express clause that these will be excluded, leaving room for dispute." Seeds will become patentable, but farmers will have the right to store and re-use seeds. Estimates by the agricultural ministry show that seed prices will go up marginally by 5 to 7 per cent, but farmers will be compensated by higher yields. Agriculture Agriculture is expected to be the fastest growing sector in the post-Uruguay world, according to Anwarul Hoda, deputy director-general of GATT. This could open up India's opportunity for exports of wheat and sugar, if production is according to expectations. There are welfare gains in this as well, as these are labour-intensive crops. However, it is not clear to what extent US and the EC will cut subsidies on these crops, as the cuts apply on overall volumes and not specific crops. This will enable the countries to manage the cuts in such a way that their export competitiveness is not hurt. The cuts on subsidies are expected to help Indian farmers as world agricultural prices will rise by 10 per cent. The gap between international and domestic prices is expected to widen, making exports attractive. For instance, using indicative figures, the present domestic price for wheat is Rs 4,000 per tonne, whereas the expected international price could be well over Rs 5,000 per tonne. Customs Duties Developed countries will have to cut import duties on industrial goods from an average of 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent over five years. On top of this, over 40 per cent of the imports by the rich countries will be duty free. Duties will be scrapped on items like steel, pharmaceuticals, furniture, paper--areas where India enjoys a competitive edge. Take a look at our potential: According to experts, our integrated steel producers will gain as we are competitive in semi-finished products like billets, blooms and plates. Our export price of plates is approximately Rs 11,000 a tonne, whereas the international price is Rs 12,000 a tonne. Our export price of HR coils is $250 a tonne, whereas the international price is $270 a tonne. Chemical exports like dye stuff and oleo-resins should also increase sharply due to the drastic cuts in tariff rates by countries like the US from a weighted average of 7.2 per cent to 4 per cent over a period of five years. New Trade Body This will give teeth to enforce the GATT commitments. The powers of the US to take recourse to unilateral action under Section 301 will also be significantly diluted. If a member country does not comply with the commitments offered in the new GATT discipline, a complainant will have to seek a consensus from other member countries whether such a charge is just. Again, even if the findings are in favour of the complainant, a country cannot retaliate without a "multilateral authorisation." However, the US is expected to find new ways to apply Section 301 to areas which are not covered by the GATT discipline, according to a senior member of the GATT secretariat. Balance Sheet In the final analysis, the new GATT package offers a mixed bag of pluses and minuses for India. Whether India will be able to capitalise on the opportunities will be determined by the course of events and the support of countries like the US and those of the EC. Imperfect as the GATT package may be in addressing the concerns of developing nations like India, it will be unwise to step out and lose the benefits that multilateralism confers on member countries. If India opts out, pressures to yield much more in bilateral negotiations will intensify for acquiring similar benefits embodied in the new GATT treaty.
