[Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that after the Oslo accord there is no longer any chance left for a meeting. There is no significance or benefit to such a meeting. As to why this meeting did not take place before the accord; the main reason is political. We have been witnessing a continuous retreat in the political position in return for nothing. [Shuraytah] How do you envisage the future of the self-rule areas from the economic and political perspectives? [Al-Shaqaqi] Israel has always tried to get rid of the Gaza Strip. The dream or idea of throwing Gaza into the sea is not Rabin's or Peres'. Since the fifties at least, it has been Ben-Gurion's dream and idea. In practice, the Gaza Strip was excluded from the Labor Party's platform. Even Shamir perceived Israel's problem to be the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants, not the Arabs as a whole. He said so in one of his statements a year before his party lost to Labor in the recent Knesset elections. As for the West Bank, the picture is completely different. The strategic importance of its range of mountains, its location, its religious Jewish heritage, and the settlements in it will make withdrawal from it now or after five years more complicated. Therefore, I believe that there will be two different models of self-rule even if the accord is implemented. One in Gaza, and the other in the West Bank. In both cases, the Israelis will try their utmost to prevent this self-rule from being transformed into a Palestinian state. As for the economic aspect, according to the declaration of principles and our understanding of it, the self-rule area will remain tied to Israel's economy. [Shuraytah] What effect will the Gaza-Jericho agreement have on Jordan? And what is the reason for Jordanian apprehension concerning this agreement? [Al-Shaqaqi] On the surface it seems that Jordan is the biggest loser. Geopolitics does not permit the establishment of three entities between Iraq's western borders and the Mediterranean Sea. The setting up of some sort of an independent entity in Jericho, the rest of the West Bank, and Gaza will be at Jordan's expense and will lead to severe tension in Jordan as half the population there is Palestinian. Since the agreement does not give the Palestinians anything and does not satisfy them, Jordan will remain the solution as the alternative Palestinian homeland. If we take into account that the West and the Jews believe that since its inception Jordan's role has been to absorb the effects of the inauspicious Balfour Declaration, this role now seems to be in its latest stages in the wake of an agreement that has given most of Palestine to the Israelis. Moreover, Jordan not only fears losing its role in the region, but also fears disintegration. This fear is reflected in the alarming concessions at the talks with the Israelis. The agreement's Palestinian team is competing with Jordan in making concessions to acquire this role. [Shuraytah] In the event that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] participates in the self-rule elections, what will be your position in view of the fact that you will remain almost alone in confronting the current plan? [Al-Shaqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have reiterated to us that they oppose and will boycott these elections and that their position on this matter is final and decisive. In any event, our own position stems from our principled commitment to our homeland, people, and nation. It also stems from our understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine, of the facts, and of the meaning of this inauspicious agreement in terms of forging an alliance with the enemy against the nation and the entire region.
