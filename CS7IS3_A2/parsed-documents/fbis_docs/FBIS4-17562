Russian delegation head Sergey Zotov told journalists that the talks about the last adjustments to the treaty will be taking place in Riga for no longer than two days. [Begin Zotov recording in Russian with superimposed Latvian translation] First I want to say that the agreements initialled by us have been misunderstood in Latvia. I repeat, Russia itself will take care of the social guarantees for the military personnel discharged from its Army, and the payment of pensions will also be our responsibility. We do not ask that the Russian military be given special privileges. However, I will add that the international obligations which your country has undertaken to guarantee at the United Nations for the citizens of another country must be observed. Reports by the mass media on the interstate agreements initialled between Latvia and Russia, as well as their discussion by the Saeima, have been distorted. Russia will withdraw the Army by 31 August. We are ready for the meeting of the two countries' presidents and the signing of the treaty. Russia is not interested in changing its stance, which has already been in force for two years. [end recording]
