Orban made the remarks at a rally held in Budapest on Tuesday [26 April]. The Fidesz chairman's firm position is interesting in light of the fact that numerous conjectures have appeared in press in the past weeks, whereby the liberal SZDSZ and the Socialists would reach agreement and enter into coalition. As four liberal parties -- Fidesz, SZDSZ, Agrarian Federation, and Entrepreneurs' Party -- have already formed an election alliance, a possible agreement between the SZDSZ and the MSZP would question this agreement. Reacting to the guesses so far, several Fidesz leaders have firmly stated they are not willing to cooperate with the MSZP. "In order for the SZDSZ to agree with the MSZP, they would have to betray us first," Orban said. According to Orban, the MSZP is not in the favorable position it presents itself to be. He predicted that the alleged advantage of the MSZP will further dwindle in the remaining period of the election campaign.
