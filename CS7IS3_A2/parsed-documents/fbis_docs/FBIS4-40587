No decisions to the effect have been taken, the minister told Duma deputies here today. "The question of treaty prolongation will be raised in fall 1995," said the minister. In his words, the Russian president will take a decision after possible consultations with the parliament. A more updated interpretation of the treaty, including Article 1, with due account of today's realities is being discussed, he added. The thing is that some document wordings "reflected political thinking of two socialist states and include terms of that period -- on protection of common socialist values and so on. That is why, we certainly have a modern interpretation of the treaty text," said the minister.
