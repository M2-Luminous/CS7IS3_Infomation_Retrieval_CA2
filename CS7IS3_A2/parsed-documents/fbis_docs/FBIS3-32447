As everyone knows, the initiation of the peace dialogue between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN is imminent. The fact that the dialogue is being held in a conflict area implies provocation risks that could hinder or bog the talks down. With the purpose of minimizing unwanted rifts between the parties in conflict, it is necessary to form around the talk site a security or peace cordon, which can prevent the pressure or intimidation of one of the parties in conflict. We know the so-called nongovernment organizations have remained neutral in the present conflict, and they have always been concerned about the need to alleviate the serious conditions of the civilian population as well as to promote the peace efforts with dignity as sought by our forces and all honest Mexicans. For the reasons mentioned above, we would like to respectfully ask you to form a peace cordon that can prevent both federal troops as well as those from the EZLN from meddling in the region surrounding the negotiation table. Let it be understood that this does not represent any commitment or support for our struggle's cause, and that we will continue to respect and greet your neutrality and humanitarian duty.
