Good morning, Mr. Faydi. [Faydi] Good morning. [Announcer] First, is there any news about those negotiations in the UN, with that offer from Great Britain and Norway, who could participate in a possible monitoring mission and above all a mission protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories? [Faydi] Well, the fact is we are working with them, we are holding contacts with all the forces and the countries of the Security Council, and we hope to achieve that, because it is the only way to be able to sign or to achieve peace. [Announcer] It seems that these nations are prepared to participate in a commission of observers, but without weapons. To be unarmed, which is what Israel wants. [Faydi] We are asking for armed forces because forces without weapons would have to protect themselves, not protect us. So we need armed UN forces to protect us. [Announcer] How did the Hebron mosque massacre affect you here? [Faydi] The truth is that here we have all put our faith in peace, we are optimistic and waiting for good news, because many of us want to go back home now. With the massacre we lost something -- a faith that we held with much hope. And the truth is that we are waiting for Israel to make an important declaration on withdrawal, on disarming the settlers and on the protection of the Palestinian people, in order to breathe life into the peace process and begin to achieve that stability in the region. [Announcer] But things are getting very difficult because the settlers have done a series of things, like the Hebron killing and a series of other things, that are hard to control, even for the Israeli army itself. [Faydi] Well, you know it is a fait accompli, brought about by successive Israeli Governments (?in) the occupied territory, and I think it is the Israeli Government's problem. Because it is the government, it must control them and find a solution to this. I think that in order to be able to continue negotiating peace, Israel must take important measures for its own security and of course for our security. [Announcer] Where exactly does the problem lie? In the Israeli extremists, in the Palestinian extremists -- who also exist and who are also causing a series of disturbances, seeking almost to stop the peace dialogue continuing -- or in both? [Faydi] Well, in reality the problem...[pauses] there are several important points that we must resolve. First point: the seriousness of Israel in the negotiations. Israel is not taking the peace negotiations seriously. It should have withdrawn on 13 December and did not and raises difficulties in those negotiations. Second point: the settlements. The settlements have shown that 140,000 settlers are rather aggressive and fanatical and act violently, as if they were paramilitary groups. Third point: the passivity of the Army. The Army saw the actions of the settlers, saw them shooting and killing Palestinians, and did not defend them -- tremendous passivity. Fourth point: The left-wing forces in Israel must put pressure on the Israeli Government for these problems to be resolved. Those are the obstacles that we face. Anyway, the way forward depends on Israel. [Announcer] Today there is a meeting in Cairo between Yasir 'Arafat and Mubarak, the Egyptian president. Do you expect any interesting, positive consequences or conclusions for the peace process? [Faydi] Mr. Mubarak is indeed the president of Egypt, and the ones who must provide means or resolve the problems are the Israelis. And I think it is good and positive to negotiate with our Arab brothers and talk about how the peace process can be saved. But it is the Israeli Government that must provide explanations and means and concessions. [Announcer] But can Mubarak perhaps act as a mediator with the Israelis too? [Faydi] Yes, but I think that mediators are no longer needed, because we are in constant contact with the Israelis at head-of-state level and foreign minister level, and I think that after what happened in Hebron, Israel must be aware that it is necessary to find a rapid solution in order to be able to convince our people (?about) the peace process, in order to be able to convince the whole of international public opinion that the only solution is negotiation. But not as if nothing had happened. There has been a massacre and it is necessary to find solutions in order to be able to stabilize the region, the situation. [Announcer] Might not everything that is happening now be a reflection of the weak position in which 'Arafat apparently finds himself within his own organization, within the PLO? He is being called into question for the way he acts, for his excessive authoritarianism too, in a way? [Faydi] Well, it appears that recently there is talk of authoritarianism and all that. I believe that...[pauses] look, the PLO is the only national liberation organization to have come into existence with a parliament to guarantee democracy and rights and self-criticism, critical self-criticism. But we are of course away from our occupied land. We have to work every day, constantly. We have Palestinian (?organizations) and we all participate within the Palestinian institutions in the democratic process and within the PLO. So I think that lately they are talking about...[pauses] it is necessary to wait until we have the state and see how government is going to be carried out there. In any case the situation is complicated, not because of the situation of the PLO, but because of the situation that has come about and the massacre that occurred in Hebron. All the solutions must come from Israel, not us.
