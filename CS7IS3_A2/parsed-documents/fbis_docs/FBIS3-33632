Vittorio Alloco, EU ambassador to Central America, signed the agreements at a ceremony during which it was underscored the Central American region is the "first partner" of the development promotion policy being fostered from Brussels. The European diplomat said with more than 500 projects underway, worth more than $600 million, Central America is in first place, on a per capita base, among the regions the European aid is benefiting. The Panamanian Electoral Tribunal will receive from the EU more than $500,000 to conduct a nationwide campaign to inform citizens about the new single-ballot voting system, which will be used for the first time in the upcoming 8 May general elections. Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes has said the highest Panamanian electoral authority is also expecting complementary European aid to buy vehicles to be able to reach the remotest communities in the country. The EU representative signed another agreement with Kuna "Indian Chief" Carlos Lopez to improve the traditional production sectors of the Indian communities and to promote sustainable development. Another agreement was signed with the Justice and Peace Commission, which Stanley Muschett, Santa Maria La Antigua University president, heads. This agreement will enable the commission to conduct a poll during the elections. The tour of the EU ambassador, who is headquartered in the Costa Rican capital, will end with the signing of another agreement with the Panamanian Foreign Ministry.
