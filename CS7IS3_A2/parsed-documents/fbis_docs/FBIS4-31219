An all-out alert has been sounded in the town. According to incomplete reports, the attack was launched from the Croat positions at Vucilovci around Orasje, some seven kilometres northwest of Brcko. There are no reports on casualties, but material damage is extensive. This was the seventh artillery attack on Brcko in the past four weeks, and the fourth launched from Bosnian Croat positions. In all four attacks, the Croats used 128-mm shells. The Moslems mostly use tank shells. The first six attacks left seven people dead and 40 wounded, including several children. U.N. observers, who have been deployed in Brcko since May 7, have conducted their own investigations into all the attacks on Brcko, which is situated at the neck of the vital corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. The Serbs on May 7 proclaimed a unilateral truce in the Brcko area and reached agreement with U.N. peacekeepers on the deployment of U.N. observers in the town. Early in May, the local Croat commander in Orasje announced an all-out attack on Brcko by the combined Croat-Moslem force whose only aim, he said, was to cut the Serb corridor along the Sava River.
