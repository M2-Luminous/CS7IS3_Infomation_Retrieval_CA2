What is to be done, however, with the nearly 8,000 tons [t] from fire extinguishers and extinguisher systems? Solutions are now looming for the elimination of the especially stabile chemical substances. The use of halons as a fire extinguishing agent in the event of a fire was a sure recourse for a long time for chemical firms, computer centers, the federal railway and even for many automobile operators. Halons extinguish quickly and reliably, they do not produce toxic gases and do not damage systems and equipment. Their special contents deserve the credit for all of that: chemical compounds that release chlorine, bromine and fluorine at high temperatures, putting a stop to the combustion process. Those times are gone: since the start of the year, the ordinance prohibiting fluorochloro-hydrocarbons [FCKW] has banned the production, circulation and use of fully halogenated halons as an extinguishing agent. For such substances, similar to FCKW, are so chemically resistant that they rise undecomposed to an altitude of 20 kilometers [km] and destroy the protective ozone layer there, doing so considerably more rapidly than FCKW. Halon 1211 has been assigned an ozone destroying potential [ODP] that is triple that of R 11, the comparable FCKW substance; halon 1301's ODP, in fact, is higher by an order of magnitude. Additionally, both of them contribute to a large degree to the greenhouse effect. For practical purposes three different halons basically matter: bromochloro-difluoromethane (halon 1211), bromotrifluoromethane (halon 1301), that had been used mostly in the former laender, and chlorobromomethane (halon 1011) from the new laender. Making it particularly difficult to eliminate halon is its strong chemical resistance. Although in principle elimination in special waste incinerators is feasible, such a facility still can handle only limited amounts of input. "After all, halons are fire extinguishing agents," as Dr. Holger Brackemann, halon expert in Berlin's federal department of the environment, tosses out for consideration. More promising in this respect is a process of Plasmactor Umwelttechnik limited company [GmbH] from Britz in Brandenburg. In cooperation with Martin-Luther University in Halle, Merseburg college and a research institute in Minsk, White Russia, the firm has developed a plasma process that was just introduced for the first time at the Hannover fair. In it the halon molecules are broken apart in a plasma jet. The plasma jet is generated in a plasma arc torch with air serving as plasma gas. At 10,000 degrees Celsius [C] the airborne oxygen splits up into avid radicals. Those radicals react in a reaction chamber that is approximately one meter in length with the halons and split off chlorine and bromine. Left over as resultants are hydrochlorine (HCl), hydrobromine (HBr), hydrofluorine (HF) and carbon dioxide. In the second step, a sodium hydroxide solution is introduced through a nozzle at the end of the reactor chamber. HCl, HF and HBr acids react with the sodium hydroxide to yield sodium salts. This is followed by a cooling down to under 200�C. Solid-state salt that can be recycled in the industry is recovered from the salt solution via intermediate condensers and a number of filtering steps. "Plasmactor's" special feature is use of a rotating plasma jet generated by two plasma torches in a staggered formation relative to one another. They ensure intense turbulences that powerfully intermingle air and halons so that reaction time is minimized and the conversion rate is increased. Plasmactor managing director Reinhardt Schulz succinctly states: "99.9 percent of the halons are converted." Selection of materials that have to be especially resistant to heat is critical for the operation of the plasma reactor. The reactor consists of a double casing of high-grade steel through which the coolant flows. It envelops a 10-millimeter [mm] thick interior tube of aluminum oxide that is blended with a limited amount of other oxides. According to Schulz: "The interior tube is capable of withstanding reaction temperatures of nearly 2,000 degrees C without any problem." On the one hand a cooling jacket, and on the other hand the high flow rate of the gas in the tube counteract any overheating. According to Schulz, disposal costs are about seven German marks [DM] per kilogram [kg]. The "Chemical Reverser" of the Concentric Maschines [CM] firm in Treuchtlingen in Bavaria operates according to the same principle. In this case too, halons are broken apart in a plasma torch, this time under pressure at approximately 2,000-3,000�C. CM uses natural gas as plasma gas. The gas releases reactive hydrogen radicals that split apart chlorine, fluorine and bromine from the halon molecules. The resulting hydrogen halides are neutralized with a solution of caustic soda or caustic potash and cooled to 60�C in the process. Zettner's secret material is an inner lining of "a non-oxide ceramic" for the reactor that is to aggressive halides. Like Plasmactor managing director Schulz, CM developer Michael Zettner too hopes that the resulting potassium or sodium salts will find industrial customers. In cooperation with Deutsche Aerospace AG [DASA], two CM facilities, each with 1,000 tons yearly capacity, are supposed to start operating on DASA sites in Treuchtlingen and in Schrobenhausen in Bavaria. According to Zettner: "The authorization process for one of the facilities is under way." In this connection he is pinning his hope on the effect of the new law facilitating investment that is supposed to scale the period for authorization down to a few months. Zettner's prognosis is: "We could get going with the disposal in the second half of the year." But elimination of the substance solves only one side of the halon problem. Just as important is a dense network of collection and return centers for extinguishers. And that could be problematical: most of the 1.6 million portable fire extinguishers in private residences, business and vehicles in West Germany, in which close to 6,000 t of halon 1211 are lying dormant, are unregistered and as a result are beyond any monitoring. And whether the nearly 3,000 fixed extinguisher systems containing nearly 2,000 t of halon 1301 will be properly disposed of depends not least on the environmental awareness of the respective owners. It will be even harder to bid adieu to the ozone destroyers in the new laender. Partially halogenated halon 1011 that is widespread in them is not encompassed by the Montreal Protocol and its production and use continues to be permitted.
