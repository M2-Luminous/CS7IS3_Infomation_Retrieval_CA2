It endorsed the party's program and rules and elected the central bodies. The leader of the Officers Union Stanislav Terekhov was elected chairman of the party. Last February, Lieutenant-Colonel Terekhov was released from the Matrosskaya Tishina prison on an amnesty declared by the Duma for all participants in the events in Moscow in September-October, 1993. Military investigators claim that he led an attack on the CIS Army Headquarters in late September, 1993, as a result of which a policeman and an elderly woman were killed. Addressing the congress, Terekhov declared that his party would work to revive Russia and its armed forces spiritually and patriotically. The party intends to interact with left-wing communist parties and the Russian Orthodox Church, he said.
