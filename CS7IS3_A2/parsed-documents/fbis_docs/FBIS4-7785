Their shells, like the whirlwind -- which is the name of the latest Chetnik offensive on the Gorazde territory -- have been claiming human lives almost every hour. There are hundreds of wounded people. Streams of blood and tears are literally pouring down the streets of Gorazde and the surrounding villages. The Drina River valley is resounding to the sound of explosions of destructive shells of the largest calibers [words indistinct] murdered, mutilated, and forlorn. Terror can again be seen on the faces of the survivors. Distress, tears, cries can be heard in the war hospital in Gorazde. The rooms and corridors in medical institutions are crowded. Additional facilities in the village and communal areas are also packed as the wounded keep arriving. Some 30 seriously wounded are ready for evacuation, two of them are urgent cases. Two surgeons, one anesthetist, and one anesthesiologist from the Medicins sans Frontieres, with the few but always present local doctors and medical staff have been doing miracles. Many lives have been saved even with the minimal conditions that exist in the Gorazde hospitals. There is no adequate medical equipment, not enough medicine, no sanitary material, no water, but there are many volunteers giving blood who have done a lot so far. One should say that the medical staff, although few in numbers, has been deployed in all the field hospitals and are with the brave Gorazde defenders on the most prominent positions facing the cutthroats of the aggressor's army.
