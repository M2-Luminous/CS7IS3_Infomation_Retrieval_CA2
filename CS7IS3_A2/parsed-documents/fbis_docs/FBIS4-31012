Noting the current growing tendency of the bilateral trade, the Indian president pointed to the need for speeding up that process. The guest appreciated the Romanian-Indian relations as a bridge between Asia and Europe, considering that Romania could become in future an economic leader in Eastern Europe. The Indian party's interest in developing economic relations with Romania resulted also from the fact that the delegation included four members of the Indian cabinet -- ministers of the interior, foreign affairs, tourism and agriculture, as well as the president of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Premier Vacaroiu evoked the traditional friendship between the two countries and emphasized the necessity of extending the current legal framework, so that the fine political bilateral relations should be matched by economic ones. The creation during the visit of an adequate legal framework is a component of utmost importance of the government's policy of relaunching and expanding the traditional economic and commercial relations of Romania, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu added.
