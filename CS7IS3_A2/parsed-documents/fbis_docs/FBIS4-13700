FBIS4-13700 "drnes078_s_94008" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Iran Further on IAEA Director's Visit, Comments Further on IAEA Director's Visit, Comments Commentary Views Visit LD2004225194 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in English 1930 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004225194 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran English BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] Mr. Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is currently in Tehran on a visit for holding talks on cooperation between the agency and Iran's Atomic Energy Organization. During his visit to Tehran, Mr. Hans Blix and his team--besides inspecting Iran's nuclear facilities and holding talks with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization--also met with Iran's first vice president and foreign minister. Periodic visits of the IAEA experts to nuclear installations of its member states take place on a regular basis. For this reason the trip of Mr. Hans Blix to Tehran too has pursued the same goal. The visit of the IAEA experts to Iran is also significant because it gives an opportunity to Iran's officials to express the views and to confer on important regional and international issues related to nuclear energy. For this standpoint, during the meeting of the IAEA chief with Iran's first vice president and foreign minister, the country's views on the need for the peaceful use of nuclear energy were reiterated. The Iranian officials, meanwhile, have not missed mentioning the point that--notwithstanding the false propaganda of the West, especially the U.S., about Iran's nuclear program--it is the Israeli regime's indifference toward observing the principle of nuclear nonproliferation that is posing a real threat to peace and security in the Middle East. At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the peaceful use of nuclear energy--which in the modern world has various applications in the fields of medicine, industry, and research--should be recognized as a natural right of all the world countries and that nuclear technology should not be allowed to become a political tool for putting pressure against any country. Undoubtedly the responsibility that the world bodies, especially the IAEA, have in this connection demands that the agency should deal with various countries on equal footings insofar as nuclear arms control is concerned. This is essential because only then one can speak with greater certainty about the various countries' cooperation with the IAEA programs and the positive reports of the organization experts about countries, including Iran--those having continuing cooperation with the agency--can be used in the international community in a desirable manner.
