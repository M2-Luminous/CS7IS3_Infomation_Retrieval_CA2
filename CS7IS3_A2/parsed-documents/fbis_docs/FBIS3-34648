"On February 22 or 23, PLO officials will come to the Gaza Strip to begin to apply the Cairo agreement," Furayh Abu-Middayn, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, told AFP. "They will perhaps be accompanied by units of the Palestine Liberation Army," added lawyer Abu-Middayn, chairman of the Gaza Bar Association and a close associate of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat. The soldiers are to join the Palestinian police force which is to ensure order during autonomy. The statement came after Israel and the PLO settled their differences on security aspects of the September 13 Declaration of Principles for Palestinian autonomy. The security deal opens the way for autonomy to be implemented, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has warned it will take at least another month to sort out other issues, such as the economic side of self-rule.
