The contract expires next year, and both parties have started preparing a new contract for exporting uncut diamonds. At the very onset, they agreed to maintain strict confidentiality while the contract is being worked on. Raymond Clark, the new director of the Moscow office of the firm, in his first interview in Russia, told about some of the circumstances surrounding these negotiations. [Boxed item] Important Parameters of the Current Contract Between Russia and De Beers on Export of Uncut, Gem Quality, Natural Diamonds: --Russia's quota, based on De Beers' annual sales--26%; --Direct export of diamonds through De Beers--95% --Conditions for competitive sales of control lots (5% of total export volume): At least eight foreign buyers are invited to the competitive sales, which take place in Moscow; the price of a basic lot is calculated on the basis of total sales; --Russia is free to export industrial diamonds only after De Beers declines to acquire them; --Correction of the current purchase price takes place once a year. [End box] New Acquaintanceships With Old Partners Ray Clark announced that De Beers does not yet have a working copy of the agreement, the proposed duration of which would be from 1996 to 2000. He let it be understod that the first stage (spring and summer of this year) will consist of collecting information and establishing contacts; the second stage (autumn and winter) will have consultations on general principles and the outline of the future contract; and the third stage (spring 1995) will consist of exchanges of the first drafts of the contract. In the very near future Mr. Clark intends to familiarize himself with the general position held by three parties involved in the Russian diamond business: First, the Russia-Sakha Company (ARS), many directors of which are well-known to De Beers because of many years of cooperation between the company and the Yakutalmaz NPO; second, the government of the Republic of Sakha that De Beers is acquainted with through the drafting of the 1992 agreement; and third, Roskomdragmet, which in 1993 received supplementary authority. "In addition, I would like to go into detail on personal positions held by important people such as Mssrs. Bychkov, Gurevich, Kotlyar, (Roskomdragmet), Golovatyy (Ministry of Finance), Kirillin, Ulin, Kovylin (ARS), Nikolayev, and Shtyrov (government of Yakutiya)," said Ray Clark, "because at present we have only a general idea about who really has power in the Russian diamond industry." All this indicates that the De Beers management has decided to get away from the practice of making individual contacts with the most important people in the country (as it did during the days of the USSR) and is diligently trying to figure out the positions of interested departments and the personal preferences of VIPs in the Russian diamond business. Referring to the oral agreement with Yevgeniy Bychkov, chairman of Roskomdragmet, about maintaining strict confidentiality, Mr. Clark declined to discuss possible points being negotiated in the new agreement. Nonetheless, he mentioned two proposals that are absolutely unacceptable to De Beers: Increasing purchase prices by 30 percent and giving the Yakut government the express right to sell uncut, gem-quality diamonds abroad, amounting to 1-3 percent of the total Russian diamond export ($10-30 million per year). [Boxed item] Proposed Negotiation Issues for the Next Contract: --To increase the share of free sales from 5% to 20-25%; --to conduct competitive sales in any world diamond center; --to reexamine the "formula" used for recalculating prices; --to increase the current purchase price by 10-30%; --to give Yakutiya the right to export some of the diamonds independently; --to develop a unified standard for gem-quality diamonds; --to introduce limitations on diamond cutting by Russia for customer-supplied diamonds from abroad; --to develop stringent measures for preventing the illegal export of diamonds through diamond processing enterprises; and --to obtain permission to monitor De Beers' selling prices through inspectors' purchases of diamond lots at De Beers sites. [End box] Possibilities for Loan Operations With Diamonds as Security Turning to the subject of a possible addendum to the contract--loans, using diamonds as security--Mr. Clark at first expressed his satisfaction with how the current contract (1990-1995) has been carried out for the sum of $1 billion between Russia and De Beers. He explained that one of his tasks was to clarify Russia's needs for these kinds of loans. "However, this question can be discussed only if the government of the Russian Federation requests it from the management of De Beers." With regard to a proposal by the American firm of Lazares-Kaplan International ("X" wrote about this in detail on March 2nd), Ray Clark noted that banks would hardly give money for large deals with diamonds as security unless De Beers is a participant in these deals. The Status of the Diamond-Cutting Industry in Russia De Beers experts, already working on the beginning stage of an analysis of the Russian market for decorative jewelry, have given a high assessment to its potential. In general, of course, De Beers constantly monitors the status of the world diamond market, because it is this market that is the determining factor for the sale of uncut natural diamonds. The Company did not ignore Russia either and is collecting information on production volume, various specializations of plants, and the status of diamond export. Ray Clark also announced De Beers' plans to build a small diamond-cutting enterprise in Yakutiya, possibly jointly with Sakhakomdragmet or the Tuymaada Diamond Company. [Boxed item] The new representative of De Beers in Russia is Raymond A. Clark, born on September 28, 1949 in London, England. He received his education at Farnham, Surrey. He began working at De Beers in 1969 as a diamond expert. Notwithstanding his appointment as Director of the Moscow Representative Office of his company, he remains a member of the De Beers London Group for Strategic Planning. Mr. Raymond Clark is married to Julia, a native Muscovite. He likes the Compaq laptop computer and the pocket Psion microcomputer. He is indifferent to expensive automobiles. He is interested in music, preferring classical and jazz, amateur photography, fishing, and tennis. [End box]
