Thompson, chief of the ICL representative office in Russia and the CIS, by Zhanna Khidiyatullina; place and date not given: "ICL Is Together With the Government of Tatarstan"] [Text] ICL is the first large Western company that has resolved to make a major investment in the economy of Tatarstan. It is a computer company with the second largest volume of profits in the world. ICL was formed in 1968 by a merger of several companies. However, it became truly competitive and came to possess state-of-the-art technologies 12 years ago when a contract was signed with the Japanese company Fujitsu, which now owns 80 percent of ICL stock. The company employs 24,000 people in 80 countries of the world. ICL consists of 26 autonomous divisions or production facilities which operate under general leadership on an integrated plan, implementing a common strategy. A correspondent of the TATAR-INFORM information agency asked Stewart M. Thompson, chief of the ICL representative office in Russia and the CIS, to discuss prospects for cooperation between ICL and Tatarstan. [Khidiyatullina] When talks began in Tatarstan last year about transforming the ICL-KPOVS joint venture into a joint-stock company with the participation of the Government of Tatarstan, this news surprised many people. Whose initiative was it? [Thompson] Our joint venture feels quite confident in Kazan. As recently as a year ago we were not planning any radical changes. The initiative in organizing the new joint-stock company belongs to the government of your republic. However, ICL's management showed understanding for the government's desire to participate in the profits of an enterprise located in Tatarstan. As far as I know, your government already has such business experience. [Khidiyatullina] Indeed, the Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers acted a few years ago as cofounder of the first Tatarstan-Turkish joint venture, Taturos. However, in that instance it made its contribution to statutory capital in the form of crude oil. [Thompson] Apparently the same will occur in our case. The proportions of investment will change so as to take into account the interests of your republic in the distribution of eventual profits. You must pardon me for being unable to give precise numbers before the meeting of the board, which will most likely be held within a few days. Only after this will it be possible to schedule the date for signing the principal contract. [Khidiyatullina] It may be surmised that business contacts will not be restricted to the framework of the joint-stock company.... [Thompson] Of course not. They are much broader than that even now. In the fall of this year we will mark the 25th anniversary of operations in the market of CIS countries and Russia. Much has been accomplished during this time. Our computers and banking and retail trade equipment are installed not only in Russia. The large oil enterprises of Tatarstan, the Administration of Kazan, and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan have been able to duly appreciate the advantages of working with our computers and programming. [Khidiyatullina] Why are you convinced of the advantages of ICL products? [Thompson] Last year ICL was perhaps the only large computer company to make a profit. Of course, it was less than expected--only $4 billion, increased sales notwithstanding. This is a general problem. Nonetheless, it can be understood that close linkage to progressive developments by the specialists of the Japanese company Fujitsu made it possible for ICL to not only make a spurt in technical development but also to sharply reduce production outlays. One does not have to be a specialist to understand that the superior quality of the company's products was complemented by the ability to reduce prices. Owing to the development of so-called "open systems," we help enterprises to ensure communications and management of production processes with finely developed programs while using the previously purchased computers of various companies. In the process, we not only deliver, install, and provide training for specialists but also stand ready to provide assistance in the continuous upgrading of programs. As early as 1985 ICL understood that the development of services is the future of computer companies. All our advantages are based on the growing volume of services. [Khidiyatullina] It is a pity that despite a respectable duration of operations on the market of Russia, the ICL brand is not as widely known as the names of not only other large companies but also small companies. In Tatarstan, you are likewise little known. [Thompson] It is hard to disagree with that. However, ICL is now mounting an extensive advertising campaign in your country. An invitation to a group of journalists from Russia and Tatarstan to visit London has become one of the programs. We hope that you will be able to tell your readers in detail about the ICL corporation. [Khidiyatullina] Many people believe that for companies such as yours Tatarstan is of interest primarily as a cheap labor market. [Thompson] Each company is mindful of its profits. Nobody will strive for higher costs. For example, it is important to select the location for the construction of a production facility correctly. However, you must really perceive that, according to assessments by the leading economists of the world, the territories of North America and Central and Eastern Europe will have the decisive role in profit generation. The objective of any company, ICL included, is not just to produce but also to sell. This is why Russia and Tatarstan are primarily our business partners and a market for product sales.
