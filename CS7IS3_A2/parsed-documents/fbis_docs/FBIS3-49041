The Croat delegation said the announcement would be made at noon (1100 GMT), on the second day of discussions in the old imperial palace at Hofburg. The talks were expected to focus on a ceasefire, internal borders and access to the sea for the Bosnian Moslems. The Vienna-based U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Victor Jakovich, was at Wednesday's opening of the talks, but the international mediators Lord Owen for the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the UN, who attended on Tuesday, were not present. The two delegation chiefs, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, both described their discussions on Tuesday afternoon as "constructive." They said "real progress" had been made on the passage of humanitarian convoys and prisoner swaps. Silajdzic also said he was "encouraged" by a Craotian pledge supported Bosnian proposals to allow residents of Mostar, a southern Bosnian city hit hard by the ethnic conflict, to return home. The talks here follow a recent escalation of fighting between mainly Moslem Bosnian and Bosnian Croat forces in central Bosnia.
