FBIS4-51 "cr00000024294001" 27 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-057--Russia RUSSIA: Blitz Raises Profile in Mideast Diplomacy RUSSIA: Blitz Raises Profile in Mideast Diplomacy In the wake of the Hebron massacre and the resultant disruption to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, the Russians launched a carefully orchestrated diplomatic blitz with the apparent goals both of getting Israel and the PLO to continue their negotiations and of restoring Russia's role as a major player in Middle Eastern and international diplomacy. A pair of high-level foreign ministry officials and a presidential representative shuttled to Israel and Tunisia to bring the parties back together. Fully supporting the PLO's request for an international presence to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, the Russians pressed hard for a UN resolution, eventually adopted, condemning the massacre and calling for an international presence. Additionally, seeking in large part to increase Russia's role in Middle Eastern diplomacy, the Moscow envoys proposed convening of a second international conference in Madrid to discuss new directions in the peace process. After the violent murders of reportedly more than 50 Palestinians worshipping in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque by Israeli settler Dr. Barukh Goldstein on 25 February, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, and presidential envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk were dispatched on shuttle diplomacy missions to the Middle East at--it was pointedly noted in each case--President Boris Yeltsin's instructions. In announcing Ivanov's dispatch to the Middle East, the Foreign Ministry declared Russia's support for measures to ensure the security of Palestinians in the territories, and, in a major initiative, called for a renewal of the Madrid conference to get the peace process back on track. Radio Rossii broadcast a Foreign Ministry statement reporting that Ivanov had been sent to the Middle East to meet with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli leaders "at the personal instruction of the President of the Russian Federation" and that "Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security Council to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring security on the occupied territories. The idea of international protection for the civilian population on the occupied territories deserves most serious attention." The statement also proclaimed that "a new international impetus is needed for the cause of reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis to proceed further. A second plenary meeting of the Madrid conference on the Middle East at the foreign minister level could be this impetus" (Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 1100 GMT 2 Mar 94). Russian media reported that Ivanov delivered a personal message to 'Arafat from Yeltsin who expressed "Russia's firm intention to promote the attainment of comprehensive peace and security in the Middle East in every way." Upon his return, Ivanov reported that the issues of ensuring the safety of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories, the PLO proposal to send international observers to the territories, and the holding of a second Madrid conference on Middle East peace at the foreign minister level were discussed "during intensive talks in both Tunisia and Israel" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0921 GMT 6 Mar 94). Kozyrev Mission Although Ivanov was the first diplomat to engage in shuttle diplomacy, Kozyrev reported on 1 March that "at the president's instructions" he made contact with 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and asserted that both the PLO and Israel had requested active Russian participation to get the negotiations back on track. Kozyrev stated that "the important thing is to provide for both sides a maximum political, and if necessary, material assistance, if you like, so that they can not only rescue the peace process but could also move onwards after this shock, this tragedy. This is because we want peace to prevail in the Middle East, and we cannot allow a bandit, or even a group of bandits, to disrupt this process." Kozyrev observed that while Russia is not repudiating cooperation with the United States, its co-sponsor in the Middle East peace process, "it is clear that without an active Russian participation--both 'Arafat and the Israeli leaders have asked for that--this process cannot be saved" (Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian 2015 GMT 1 Mar 94). Kozyrev left for Israel and Tunisia on 11 March, bearing "a personal message from the Russian president on the problems of ensuring a lasting peace in the region" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1217 GMT 10 Mar 94). In a conversation with ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Zhudro, Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with his discussion with Israeli leaders and observed that "Russia is making unorthodox efforts for the sake of saving the peace process in this region." After the Hebron incident, Kozyrev said "it was necessary to take extraordinary measures for saving the agreements reached between Israel and the PLO earlier. This visit, which is aimed at persuading the Israelis and the Palestinians to return to the negotiations table, was one of such measures" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1740 GMT 11 Mar 94). While in Tunis, Kozyrev indicated strong Russian support for the PLO's position and optimistically predicted that talks would promptly resume if the UN approved the resolution condemning the massacre and providing for international protection. Kozyrev reported on 12 March that 'Arafat "confirmed the PLO's firm adherence to the peace process" and expressed PLO commitment to resume talks with Israel, contingent upon the adoption of the UNSC Hebron resolution condemning the murders and calling for international protection in the occupied territories. Kozyrev commented that "the decision of the Palestinian side demanded great political courage on the part of the PLO and of Yasir 'Arafat personally" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 0640 GMT 12 Mar 94). In a 12 March statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry reiterated Kozyrev's observation about 'Arafat and welcomed the PLO decision to resume negotiations. In reference to the UNSC draft resolution on Hebron, the statement made an appeal "to all sides to make the necessary efforts to have this resolution urgently approved by the Security Council. This step would clear the way for a prompt resumption of talks aimed at concluding an agreement on Gaza and Jericho, and on other issues on the basis of the Declaration of Principles" (Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1518 GMT 12 Mar 94). Posuvalyuk Mission Posuvalyuk, Yeltsin's special representative and director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Near East and North Africa Department, began his diplomacy mission on 7 March even before Kozyrev's arrival and remained after his departure. Posuvalyuk had a number of meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis and reportedly delivered "an important message from Moscow addressed to the PLO leader and related to Russo-Palestinian consultations held in connection with the aggravation of the situation in the Middle East following the al-Khalil (Hebron) massacre" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0857 GMT 14 Mar 94). Implying that Russian diplomacy was playing a central role in resolving the crisis, Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin reported that the PLO-Israeli agreement on continuing peace talks and a final agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho had been formulated during Posuvalyuk's contacts "with the PLO leadership, the Israeli delegation, and U.S. and Norwegian high-ranking diplomats in Tunis." Karasin stated that Posuvalyuk conveyed a personal message from Kozyrev to 'Arafat calling for the renewal of peace talks and confirming Russia's intention to assist in the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which was approved on 18 March (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1739 GMT 22 Mar 94). Results and Prospects A 19 March Foreign Ministry statement hailed the adoption of UNSC Resolution 904 and the potential for successful continuation of the talks, attributing the success in large part to Russia's concerted diplomatic efforts: "The initiating steps taken by the Russian co- sponsor--personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders of Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives in the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council--not only facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution, but also laid the foundation for further progress in the Middle East peace process" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1343 GMT 19 Mar 94). Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia intends to continue playing a large role in Middle East diplomacy. He also stressed Russia's claim to a major role in the Mideast: "Russia occupies its own ample niche in the Middle East region, to which, by virtue of its distinctiveness, primarily historical and spiritual, no one else can lay claim." He asserted that Russian diplomacy intends to play "an essential role" not only in the Middle East, but also in other areas of international turmoil, increasing its efforts to resolve conflict situations (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 12 Mar 94 p 5). In an early April statement he also promised that "the Middle East theme will continue to dominate our foreign policy" (Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1543 GMT 7 Apr 94). While making clear their desire to reclaim a major role, Russian officials have at the same time pledged to continue cooperation with the United States. The 12 March Foreign Ministry statement expressed such intent: "Russia will continue to coordinate its own efforts with all interested parties. We attach special importance to close interaction with the United States, which along with Russia, is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process." In the 7 April ITAR-TASS report, Posuvalyuk denied that the peace process "has acquired some element of competitiveness with the United States." Although he admitted to "disruptions" in the co-sponsors' work on the peace process, he noted that "they were not caused by malicious intent on either side" and that both participants "must act extremely carefully while looking for ways of reaching peace between Arabs and Israelis." Acknowledging that the United States and Russia pursue their separate interests in the region, Posuvalyuk commented that "this should not affect their efforts to help restore peace in the Middle East" and noted that future consultations between Russian and American officials in Washington are intended "to attain a greater degree of coordination in their joint work." Madrid Revisited Revival of the Madrid Conference forum is apparently one of Moscow's strategies for enlarging its role in regional diplomacy. Ivanov, who first raised the idea during his shuttle mission, said that 'Arafat was immediately supportive, but Israeli Foreign Minister Peres and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering were not. Peres and Pickering, he said, had to be persuaded that "Moscow's initiative does not mean giving up the achievements and formulas agreed upon at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, but is an attempt to find a new approach to Middle East realities which have changed in the past two years" (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 11 Mar 94 p 3). Admitting that the U.S. and Israeli initial reactions to the conference proposal were "cool," Ivanov emphasized that Russia sought to establish new objectives for ensuring continuance of the peace process. "We are confident that the present Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are close to completion and that we need to be thinking even today about the future. Stage one has been negotiated, and definite experience--both negative and positive--has been accumulated. We now need to meet and think about how to further advance the peace process in all directions," said Ivanov (Moscow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI in Russian No 10, 6-13 Mar 94 p 5A). Other Russian Foreign Ministry officials nevertheless subsequently played down the proposal for a "Madrid-2," suggesting that convening the conference is a long-term rather than immediate goal. After his Vladivostok meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Kozyrev appeared to reduce Russian emphasis on the initiative, stating that "Russia is no longer insisting on the immediate holding of a second international conference on the Middle East," and that "the most important thing now was to complete work on the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho" (Moscow Radiostantsiya Moskvy in Russian 1605 GMT 14 Mar 94). However, it appears likely that the issue may resurface in the future, since Viktor Gogitidze, deputy director of the MFA's Near East and North Africa Department, stated that "Russia's call for holding another international conference on the Middle East in Madrid remains in force." Gogitidze asserted: "This is a long-term proposal. The first stage of the peace process is almost concluded. It is necessary to pass to the second stage, since, in addition to 'the Palestinian direction,' there are the 'Jordanian,' 'Syrian,' and other ones. There is a need to work in all these directions, and the Madrid-2 conference could play a positive role in this" (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1559 GMT 16 Mar 94). (AUTHOR: KENSKI.
