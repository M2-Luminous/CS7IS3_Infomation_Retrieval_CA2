In 1993, the total volume of China's import and export accounted for over 35 percent of its GNP, measured with the internationally accepted indicators, Li told the Australia-China Business Council in Melbourne this noon. "Since 1979, China's total volume of foreign trade has been growing at an average annual rate of 16 percent," Li said in a speech at the luncheon in honor of him by the Council. Li said that this rate is higher than the growth rate of China's GDP and that of the world trade during the same period. Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his tour to New Zealand. He told the host that China has maintained favorable trade terms and its foreign exchange reserve is kept at the normal level, reaching 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last year. Li said that it is China's basic national policy "to further expand its opening-up to the outside world, vigorously develop its foreign trade and widely involved itself in international cooperation and exchanges." Last year, China's total import stood at 104 billion U.S. dollars and is estimated to reach 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in the next seven years. "China's development cannot be achieved without cooperation with other countries," Li said. He also said that "China's development and cooperation with other countries are also important for the promotion of world's economic and trade development and the maintenance of global peace and stability." On the Sino-Australian bilateral economic relations, Li said that last year, the two countries enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion U.S. dollars, up nearly 29 percent on the previous year. Australia has so far invested in over 1,300 projects in China, with a total contracted investment of 1.25 billion U.S. dollars, making it the ninth largest investor in China. China has also set up over 70 non-trade enterprises in Australia, with a total investment of 400 million U.S. dollars. Li said that the two countries have broad prospects for cooperation in the fields of economy, technology, culture and education.
