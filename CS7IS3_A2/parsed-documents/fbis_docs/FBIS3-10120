IUTE leader Luis Lara told EFE that the health, education, roads, and public works workers, among others, will not lift the strike until the government meets their demands. The government workers have turned down an annual bonus of 360 quetzales (approximately $62) that President Ramiro de Leon offered them to lift the strike. One union leader said, "We want our basic salaries raised, not bonuses that will not help us resolve our economic problems." In view of this, De Leon announced that the economic cabinet will present a new proposal to the workers, but he warned he will not issue currency without backing. Finance Minister Ana de Molina said the new proposal will be directed at the National Federation of Public Employees (Fenasep), which is not on strike and which has been negotiating with the government for pay raises since last week. De Molina also announced that, beginning in March, the government will withhold the striking workers' salaries for the days they remain on strike. Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the Presidency, has admitted that the government workers' salaries are low, but he said the government has failed to raise the salaries not because it does not want to meet their demands, but because there is no money. In addition, Alberto Villar, a leader of the National Federation of Unions of Guatemalan Government Workers (Fenasteg) told EFE that some 70,000 Fenasteg workers have lifted their strike to give the government a chance to reconsider its position. Villar warned, however, that if De Leon refuses to discuss their demands, the organization does not rule out the possibility of calling for another nationwide strike to pressure the government. "We are waiting for the government to invite us to negotiate the pay raise," the union leader said. He added that, although the strike has been partially lifted, the demand for a 40 percent pay raise stands. The strike was also called to reject the government's plans to privatize several public institutions, such as the electric energy sector and hospitals, and to demand a larger budget for education and health. Villar said the president so far has not shown political willingness to resolve the labor crisis in the government. He said his group plans to demonstrate in Guatemala City today to demand serious talks with De Leon who, nevertheless, has advised he will not sit down to talk without any sector because of pressure. The president has also rejected the mediation of the Catholic Church and the Central American Parliament in seeking a resolution to the labor crisis.
