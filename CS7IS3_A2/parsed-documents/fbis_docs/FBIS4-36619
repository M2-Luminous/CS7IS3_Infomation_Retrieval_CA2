Why has he put off his arrival in the autonomy? [Reshef] We neither asked him nor got an answer to that question. At the same time, 'Arafat and his men reiterated that they intend to come to Jericho within the next few weeks. In fact, we saw that the entire entourage has completed its preparations for its arrival in the land.... [Ronen, interrupting] Their land. [Reshef] Our land, their land; the land both of us will have to share, as all of us realize at this point. I must say I encountered a very optimistic approach and a great deal of faith that as soon as they arrive things will work out, that their dialogue with their people and our people will be better. The atmosphere here is very encouraging for an Israeli. You expect to arrive at the headquarters -- a quasi-military command -- of an organization that fought you for many years, but you encounter an administrative system getting ready to deal with daily affairs as government ministries in our country do. [Ronen] As you probably know, what worries Israelis is that 'Arafat and his men intend at a very early stage to try to bring the negotiations forward, including on the question of Jerusalem. Did you discern any such intentions in your meeting with 'Arafat? [Reshef] The purpose of our meeting was to convey a rather tough message to 'Arafat concerning the reverberations in Israel of his remarks in Johannesburg and elsewhere, and to tell him that through such talk he is destroying the peace process with his own two hands. We told him that the faith of the Israeli people in the peace process and its willingness to make progress was largely up to him. I think his answer to us, one of total commitment to the peace process, was a kind of reaction to our message. We explicitly asked him about the battle for Jerusalem and when Jerusalem would be put on the negotiating table. 'Arafat categorically replied that all the administrative functions of the autonomy would be located in Jericho and that Orient House was going to keep a very low profile. He emphasized that he does not want to create a crisis over the issue of Orient House because there are no intentions to upgrade the profile of its activities. Quite the contrary, he said, Jericho is going to become the center. [Ronen] Does 'Arafat plan to come to Jerusalem to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque, as he has said several times? [Reshef] He did not say anything of the sort, and we did not ask him about it. At the same time, the messages he conveyed throughout the conversation were ones of great faith that the process will advance. We also presented the difficulties expected in the interim arrangement, such as the continued existence of the settlements. He told us in English: Where there is a will there is a way [previous nine words in English]. In other words, he believes all the difficulties, such as the settlements and other issues, will be overcome. I have the feeling that the very fact that they are getting a piece of land to start administering and that they see some light at the end of the tunnel puts them in a much more optimistic mood and they see a rosier picture of the chances of pursuing the process than we do. In this respect, we found a very conciliatory man who very much wants to pursue the process. This far exceeded our expectations before the meeting. [Ronen] Tzali Reshef in Tunis, thank you very much and have a safe journey home. [Reshef] Thank you and see you soon.
