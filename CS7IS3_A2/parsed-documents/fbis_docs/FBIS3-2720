"Is it an innermost thought?" the independent Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao asked in a headline over a story reporting the gaffe made by the Chinese premier as he read his lengthy government work report. Li corrected himself immediately, saying it was the British side that was to blame for the breakdown of the 17th round of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's democratization process. The British colony reverts to China's rule in 1997. Another Chinese-language newspaper, the Hong Kong Daily News, described Li's slip as "extremely intriguing," while the Taiwan-run United Daily News noted that Li did not apologize for his slip up. However, his mistake elicited the briefest of smiles from the British ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing Thursday. McLaren, who headed the British team in the now broken-off negotiations with Beijing over Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms, said later it was "a Freudian slip." Meanwhile, a Hong Kong government spokesman declined to comment, saying "it is inappropriate." The major Beijing-run newspapers Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung failed to report on Li's gaffe. The talks collapsed in acrimony in November, and the Patten- backed reform package was introduced on Wednesday in the colony's Legislative Council. China threatened to sack the legislature, apparently resigned to the fact that there would be no cooperation with Britain on the transition to 1997.
