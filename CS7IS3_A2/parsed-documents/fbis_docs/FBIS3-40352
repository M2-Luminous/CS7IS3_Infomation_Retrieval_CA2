Seibert: "The EMIR-1 Program - A Basic European Microgravity Research Programme"] [Text] 1. Background and Objectives In June 1992 the ESA Microgravity Programme Board adopted a Resolution on the future structure of the Programme, which requested that in future the Agency's microgravity activities be split into two distinct financially independent elements: -- A basic European Microgravity Research Programme (EMIR); -- A programme to develop the facilities required for microgravity experiments to be carried out in the Columbus Attached Laboratory (MFC = Microgravity Facilities for Columbus). This Programme Board Resolution was approved by the Council at Ministerial level on 9/10 November 1992 at Granada. In May 1993 the Microgravity Programme Board approved the transformation of the ongoing extended Phase 2 of the ESA Microgravity Programme into the EMIR-1 Programme by re-orienting its scientific/technical content towards fundamental research. The Subscription Levels of Participating Member States to the EMIR-1 Programme Scale of Subscriptions of Participating Countries in the EMIR-1 Programme -- Germany: 25 percent -- Austria: 0 percent -- Belgium: 3.81 percent -- Denmark: 1.96 percent -- Spain: 2 percent -- France: 12 percent -- Italy: 15.86 percent -- Ireland: 0 percent -- Norway: 0.34 percent -- Netherlands: 4 percent -- United Kingdom: 1.15 percent -- Sweden: 4.50 percent -- Switzerland: 4 percent -- Total subscription: 74.62 percent -- Not covered: 25.38 percent The motivation of Member States to establish a basic microgravity research programme EMIR is based on the desire to ensure modest but assured funding for basic microgravity research activities independent of possible programmatic changes in large infrastructure elements such as Space Station/Columbus and Hermes. It is assumed as a general guideline that Short Duration (Sounding Rocket, Parabolic Aircraft Flights etc), Shuttle-related and non-Shuttle related activities are of approximately equal importance and are therefore funded at similar levels. 1.1 Scientific Aspects The main features of microgravity are the elimination of gravity-driven convection, sedimentation and fluid-static pressure. The feasibility of containerless processing is another advantage of this unique environment. Density gradients in liquids and gases arise wherever temperature or concentration gradients exist. This is the case with any heat treatment and any process involving phase transitions or chemical reactions. Density gradients and their corollary, buoyancy-driven convection, prevail thus in fluids on Earth. The effects of convective flow may dominate heat and mass transfer and limit the control of numerous processes such as crystallisation. It prohibits conducting defined model experiments for testing theoretical models. Under microgravity conditions gravity-driven convection is virtually eliminated. Consequently a new generation of experimental research in Fluid and Materials Sciences becomes feasible in space. Fluid dynamics phenomena can be investigated without the interference of gravity-driven convection. Results from such studies are expected to provide important feedback for the testing and development of theories describing three-dimensional laminar, oscillatory and turbulent flow generated by various other driving forces. In space, diffusion-controlled heat and mass transport conditions in fluids can be achieved. This was demonstrated with a variety of experiments, whereby exceptionally precise data on self-diffusion, hetero-diffusion and thermo-transport were obtained. In crystallization, the control of heat and mass transfer presents a major problem, and microgravity is therefore of great interest for the solidification of metals and alloys and for crystal growth in general. Virtually all crystal growth processes from melts, solutions, and vapours involve thermal and concentration gradients driving buoyancy flow on Earth. The crystallisation under conditions of diffusion-controlled heat and mass transfer in microgravity should enable to optimise these processes and finally to better control the product. Chemically homogeneous semiconductors have been obtained and crystals grown from the vapour phase and from solutions have reduced defect density. One of the very promising projects is the crystallization of proteins. The molecular structure of only several hundred out of an estimated million of different proteins has been unravelled. The difficulty lies in obtaining sufficiently large, and sufficiently perfect crystals for X-Ray diffraction analysis. There are clear experimental indications that the crystallisation of proteins is enhanced in space. Recent experiments yielded a variety of protein crystals of a quality superior to those obtained on the ground. In space, the behaviour of mixtures of liquids with gases and solids can be investigated without sedimentation causing separation of the components according to their densities. The elaboration of composites such as high-porosity alloys or particle and fibre dispersions which cannot be obtained on the ground, can be investigated in space. The absence of fluid-static pressure and of gravity-driven convection provides optimal conditions for the investigation of capillarity phenomena, phase transitions, and critical point phenomena in fluids. As the critical point is approached, the compressibility of fluids increases by orders of magnitude, and on Earth a fluid is therefore compressed under its own weight. The fluid is stratified according to density, and homogeneous bulk samples needed for investigating phenomena near the critical point can only be obtained in space. In the absence of gravity, melts can be positioned and manipulated without containers. Containerless processing is of interest since crucibles can be the source of contamination, heterogeneous nucleation, and mechanical stress. So far very few microgravity experiments on glass formation have been undertaken. There is the possibility of studying under cooling, nucleation, and the formation of metastable phases in the containerless mode. Combustion is an example of a process where microgravity has dramatic effects. There are complex chemical reactions with large temperature and concentration gradients and, therefore, with strong convection. Microgravity is the only means by which combustion phenomena can be investigated under diffusion-controlled conditions and without sedimentation (droplet and particle burning). There is a new class of experiments emerging using the near-weightlessness condition for fundamental physics investigations. Besides tests of general relativity (e.g. STEP project), there are projects on developing an ultraprecise atomic clock with the long-term perspective of application in Global Pointing Systems, studies on fractal materials, aggregation phenomena and thermal radiation forces. It can be expected that more physicists will discover microgravity as a tool for research in the future. Space life sciences experiments aim at identifying the part which gravity plays at all levels of life from the organization of a single cell to the nature of gravity-resisting and detecting mechanisms in more highly developed organisms including man. In the life sciences, microgravity provides unique experimental conditions that are unavailable on Earth. Microgravity studies on the underlying mechanism in cellular processes add a new dimension to our basic knowledge in biology. Studying higher organised life forms such as plants, small animals or even man himself, can reveal gravity-dependent processes, or gravity responses to gravi-sensing mechanisms, all of which can be considered as an extension of ground-based research. To the biologist, microgravity offers a whole new area of research: Life has evolved within the limits of the particular physical conditions on Earth, where most of these conditions - with the exception of gravity - are variable. Most of our understanding of the functioning of living organisms was obtained by varying these conditions in a controlled manner, however, always against a background of at least 1 g. Investigations under reduced gravity forces therefore represent a completely new field for biological research. Initial studies were performed in plant biology, where microgravity proved to be a unique tool for research into mechanisms of graviresponse. Studies in developmental biology and cell biology have generated many new and open questions. On a macro-scopic level, most biological processes appear not to differ in a microgravity environment. However, results clearly show that on the level of individuals cells or tissue, unexpected and often rather drastic differences occur. These results are intriguing. They provide a strong basis for obtaining insight in the (unexpected) role of gravity in fundamental cell biological processes, in regulatory mechanisms and their influence on the level of whole plants or animals (including man). Further research in these fields will also contribute to the field of exobiology. Questions about the origin of life on Earth, the likelihood of life having originated on other celestial bodies, the possibility of interplanetary (or interstellar system) transfer of living organisms will all be addressed by this discipline, that is included in the programme. The finding that gravity may influence cellular, or even molecular processes, therefore has strong relevance for the study of those fundamental questions. Furthermore, there is a group of processes of adaptation to the absence of gravity, the study of which could well illuminate the normally-occurring process. In the absence of gravity bone becomes demineralized and muscle proteins are broken down faster than they are built up. The cardio-vascular system has to function differently in the presence of different hydrostatic forces. Prolonged bed-rest can simulate some of the gross effects of weightlessness, but microgravity has already been shown to produce additional effects, presumably because of the elimination of actions due to differences in the magnitude and direction of force on individual components of the body. The study of the interaction of cosmic-ray particles with living matter is another area of research. While a considerable part of this work can be conducted with particles generated using Earth-based accelerators, the full spectrum of HZE particles, however, is difficult to produce simultaneously. There already is some experimental evidence that space flight factors such as weightlessness enhance the biological effects of radiation, and the mechanisms of this could cast much light on the functioning of the genetic apparatus. It will also assist with the evaluation of the radiation hazards to man during prolonged space missions, in terms of both, their immediate and their longer-term effects. 1.2 General EMIR Programme Objectives The main objectives of the EMIR Programme are: -- To promote fundamental and applied research in materials, fluid, physical and life sciences in space; and -- To establish the necessary knowledge base of research and engineering results in order to provide the firm foundation upon which future activities with a more applied or commercial thrust can be built. These objectives shall be met by: (a) The Development of Research Facilities Multi-user Facilities and dedicated specific experiment equipment will be developed for sounding rockets, Shuttle, Spacelab, Foton/Nika type retrievable carriers and MIR in such a way as to reflect the evolving scientific needs. (b) The Provision of Flight Opportunities A balanced programme of flight opportunities using short-duration suborbital flights (parabolic aircraft flights, sounding rockets, etc.) Spacelab, retrievable carriers and MIR, will be provided in such a way as to ensure the regular availability in the short and medium term of the microgravity environment to the scientific user communities. This is considered a prerequisite for the further evolution of basic research in the microgravity environment. (c) The Nurturing of the User Community Ground-based research which may ultimately require further experimentation in low-gravity conditions will be encouraged at the European national level or via ESA Prodex programmes whenever possible. 2. Operating Principles of the EMIR Programme (a) Scientific Emphases The Agency's EMIR Programme will give equal importance to life sciences and materials/fluid/physical sciences. Scientific excellence will be the overall guidelines determining priorities. The Agency will pre-select, with the help of independent scientific peers, the experiments on the basis of scientific merit and space relevance and will submit lists of pre-selected experiments to the Microgravity Programme Board for approval. With the help of its Microgravity Advisory Committee the Agency intends to identify areas of scientific priorities and to initiate a grouping of experiment proposals into focuses, which will, in general, be centred around proposals of exceptional quality. (b) Use of Existing Facilities The selection of flight opportunities will be made on the basis of cost effectiveness, and so maximum use will be made of existing multi-user and dedicated experimental hardware. (c) International Cooperation Since the orbital flight opportunities are rather scarce at present, the Agency will continue to expand the international cooperation with the United States of America, Russia and other countries pursuing microgravity activities. For instance in the immediate future this means that the Agency intends to expand its use of the NASA spacelab missions and the Russian Foton/Nika type retrievable carriers and MIR missions. This cooperation covers also joint basic microgravity research and joint use of the experimental flight hardware. (d) Technology Development The ESA EMIR Programme will pursue and extend, in its Supporting Technology Element, the development of advanced technology required for the development of high-quality experiment equipment, its automation, the application of telescience and robotics. (e) Data Base In the frame of the ESA Microgravity Programme a Microgravity data base of scientific results has been established. This data base is available to all users from academic and industrial research laboratories. It is expected that via a data dissemination system a wide spectrum of the research community can be reached. (f) Scientific Reporting/Education A further means to promote microgravity research will be the presentation of results at conferences of scientific and professional associations and the support of "microgravity summer schools" which aim at the involvement of young scientists in future microgravity activities. (g) Advisory Bodies The Agency intends to continue to utilise expert advisory bodies, i.e. the Microgravity Advisory Committee and discipline working/expert groups which are made up of top level scientists. These groups regularly review the programme, support the Agency in selecting the best research proposals (use of scientific peer groups), and suggest - based on the results of experiments - new studies, the introduction of new research fields and also focusing on prioritized research fields. 3. Overall Description of the EMIR-1 Programme Elements The proposed EMIR-1 Programme is a merger of Phase 2, and of the Second Extension to Phase 2. For EMIR-1 two basic options concerning the programme content can be identified. The two options referred to as Option A and Option B, relate to the fact that the Spacelab Mission E1, which the Microgravity Programme would like to use to the maximum extent, has not been approved yet. It is uncertain, at present, if Member States will agree to "sufficient" funding in the framework of these Columbus Precursor Missions to finance the E1-Spacelab Mission. Option A reflects the programmatic content and the proposed adjustments of the Second Extension assuming that the E1- Spacelab Mission will be funded. This option is the clearly preferred one and has been a key planning hypothesis over the past years. Option B reflects a situation where the E1-Spacelab Mission would not be funded. This option has not been studied to the same extent as Option A in view of the indication given by the States participating in the Precursor Missions in the past, that preference would be given to funding of the Spacelab E-1 mission. Therefore, Option A was discussed as planning baseline. In the following subsections the various programme elements are described, and where relevant, the alternative flight opportunities are identified if no E1 Spacelab missions would be funded. The various programme elements are grouped in the following activities: -- General Activities, covering studies, technology, data base and expert working groups etc.; -- Mini Missions, covering sounding rockets, parabolic aircraft flights, GAS and drop tower/tube experimentation; -- Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights, covering the following individual facilities: a) Biorack reflights on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab missions; b) Bubble Drop and Particle Unit reflight on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab missions; c) Critical Point Facility on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab missions; d) Anthrorack reflight on the E1 Spacelab Mission; e) Advanced Fluid Physics Module reflight on E1 Spacelab Mission; f) Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility on Spacehab 1, IML-2 and two other missions; g) Advanced Gradient Heating Facility on Spacelab missions such as E1 or equivalent. -- Spacelab Independent Payloads, covering the development and mission costs of the diffusion measurement Facility (a GAS), and mission costs of the APCF on Spacehab (June 1993); -- Payload Development/Refurbishment, covering the planned development of the Fluid Physics Facility (derived from LSF), of the Floating Zone Stability Module for Foton, the costs associated with the utilisation of existing facilities on MIR, and the development of the Breath Analyzer and BIB-incubator for the MIR-95 mission. (BIB = Brunel Institute of Bioengineering.) In addition, the refurbishment costs for the reflights of Biobox and Biopan are included in this programme activity. For new developments for Foton an attempt will be made to apply the technology used for sounding rockets; -- Mission Costs for Retrievable Carriers/MIR, covering missions costs for ESA payloads on Foton/Nika-type missions and potentially special payload services for the MIR missions; -- Participation in NASA Spacelab Missions, covering at present the development of the Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD) and Neurorack for the NASA Spacelab Missions SLS-3 and SLS-4, but could be extended to cover ESA payloads on other Spacelab missions of NASA; -- Phase B Studies, covering the Phase B studies of multi-user facilities for Columbus (i.e. the Biolab, Materials Science Lab and the Fluid Science Lab) which will later become part of the MFC programme. In the following sections, short descriptions of those programme elements or activities shall be given which still play a major role in the future. 3.1 Future Studies Since the amounts obtainable from General Studies are more and more reduced, there is a strong need for this activity to be maintained within the EMIR Programme. In 1993 the funds needed are especially high because parallel Phase A studies had been initiated in 1992 for the microgravity facilities for the Columbus APM. Past experience has shown that parallel studies are in the best interest of the Agency from a cross-fertilisation viewpoint and in order to maintain competition up to fixed-price offers for the Phases B and C/D. Other areas which require studies are: -- Analysis of scientific, technical and operational requirements of proposed experiments; -- Payload accommodation studies for retrievable carriers; -- Investigation of required gravity levels across all Microgravity disciplines; -- Feasibility studies of multi-user facilities (e.g. Neurorack); -- The implementation telescience. 3.2 Supporting Technology In order to remove technological, schedule and hence cost risks, a supporting technology programme element is needed to ensure timely development in potentially critical areas. At the request of the Microgravity Programme Board the originally planned amount for supporting technology has been reduced and to the programme element "Mission Costs for Retrievable Carriers/MIR" has been increased accordingly, because no funds were originally planned to support the suddenly upcoming Euro-MIR 94 and 95 missions. This means that the planned early breadboarding of MFC within the Supporting Technology Programme can no longer be performed. 3.3 Microgravity Data Base (MG-DB) The MG-DB entered its final test phase in March 1993, after the building up phase of collecting and formatting the data had been concluded. The first release of the MG-DB to the large user community is planned for the autumn of 1993. The User Support Centres MARS, MUSC, CADMOS and DUC were involved in the establishment of the data base and have ensured the largest possible coverage of microgravity experiments. Between March and June 1993, a selected number of users were given the opportunity to examine the application, easy access, man-machine interface as well as the quality of the data. The ESA MG-DB contains at present the description and results of about 180 European and 600 NASA/United States experiments. By the end of 1993 the MG-DB will contain all the European microgravity experiments flown and a short description of the objectives of those experiments which are planned to be flown in the near future. The Agency reached an agreement with NASA to share the experimental data of both sides and to develop and use compatible formats and application procedures. 3.4 Experts, Advisory/Working Groups, Purchase Orders This programme element includes a number of general activities which in the past fell under ESA internal costs, but which in reality do not belong there. The following expenses are covered by this programme element: -- Experts and consultants, scientific advisory/working and expert groups, peer groups for experiment evaluation, symposia support, etc.; -- Use of facilities, laboratories and computer services; -- Purchase orders (this type of procurement procedure is often used for smaller equipment items because it strongly reduces the administrative effort and associated delays). 3.5 Sounding Rockets Sounding rockets have played a significant role in microgravity experiments, particularly in Europe through the German national programme TEXUS (Technologische Experimente Unter Schwerelosigkeit), in which ESA participates at a level of about 50 percent. In the United States and Japan sounding rocket programmes were also carried out for microgravity research, but in a more sporadic manner. In addition to the normal two TEXUS rocket flights per year, the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), with major ESA participation (about 90 percent), started a sounding rocket programme called MASER (Materials Research Experiment Rockets) in 1987, with a flight frequency of one payload every 18 months. Five successful Maser flights were carried out to date, and the sixth is planned for November of this years. Apart from the established usefulness of such flights for materials/fluid sciences, sounding rockets offer good opportunities for experimental study and assessment of the gravity relevance of some key bioprocesses which do not require long exposure to microgravity. Sounding rocket experiments are especially appreciated by the scientific community because of the short lead time between experiment selection and flight, and because of the frequent flight opportunities. In the TEXUS programme 30 sounding rocket payloads were flown since 1977. Microgravity durations of the order of six minutes are achieved by payloads of about 360 kg (250 kg pure experimental hardware) flown to an altitude of 250 km. Launch and recovery takes place at ESRANGE near Kiruna in Northern Sweden, the launch vehicle being a Skylark 7. The payloads of Texus and Maser consist of up to six autonomous experiment modules, each with its own power supply, data handling, and in some cases, video monitoring and telecommand for real-time experiment control. New module types are continuously under development, depending on the experiments selected during each call for experiment proposals. The use of longer-duration sounding rocket flights using larger rockets, is attractive for many experiments. Therefore MBB/ERNO and SSC established the Maxus sounding rocket programme and considered the following design criteria: -- Re-use of existing Texus/Maser hardware; -- Microgravity time off up to 14 minutes; -- Experimental payload of about 440 kg. The first Maxus flight partially failed, however, the payload was safely recovered. The reflight in November 1992 was successful. The programme element sounding rockets has somewhat suffered from the: -- Stretching of approved MG programmes within the same financial envelope; -- From the increase of the mission costs (flight ticket and payload), because for geographic return reasons, new unexperienced contractors for the development of payload modules had to be involved. Considering the present budget for sounding rockets, which has not been reduced or blocked as a consequence of the low subscription to the approved Extended Phase 2, the mission scenario looks as follows: a Maser (6) and a Texus (31) flight in November 1993, a further Texus flight in 1994, a Maxus 2 flight in Spring 1995, followed by Maser 7 in Spring 1996. It is assumed that new funds will be available from the EMIR-2 programme for the 1997 sounding rocket activities. 3.6 Parabolic Flights For many years, in the United States and in recent years also in Europe, aircraft flying parabolic trajectories have been employed to produce low gravity conditions. In the early years this was mostly for astronaut training and similar activities. More recently, these parabolic flights have been used for microgravity activities, especially precursor experiments, equipment checkout and experimental parameter optimisation, in materials sciences and the life sciences. From the life sciences perspective, parabolic flights are useful not only for testing new procedures and equipment, but they also provide the opportunity of crew involvement. Furthermore, the periods of hypergravity, which occur during re-acceleration and climb to altitude in such flights, are also useful, for example, for the construction of physiological models over a wider range of gravity levels, and for understanding instantaneous dynamics of physiological reactions to transient g-levels. Several types of aircraft were used. ESA was able to use the NASA KC-135 aircraft six times, both as precursors to Spacelab flights for experiment optimisation, and also, more generally, for experimental opportunities for interested microgravity researchers. The disadvantage of the KC-135 flights was that its campaigns were performed as JSC Houston, so that all experimenters with their equipment had to travel to Houston. Therefore the French company NOVESPACE, with major investments of CNES, made a Caravelle airplane available which ESA has used twelve times since February 1989. In 1994 the flight certificate of the Caravelle (the aircraft is some 20 years old) will probably expire and a new solution for parabolic aircraft flights has to be found. In this context the procurement of an Airbus A 300 was proposed; however a procurement of leasing would cost between 14.5 and 20 MAU [million accounting units] for 4 to 8 years' leasing options. In addition, the Airbus has a very large capacity (about 12 tons, 50 passengers) - too large for it to be used fully and efficiently for the ESA MG programme. The advantages of Caravelle's frequent flight opportunities -- so much in demand -- would be lost to the users. Another alternative to Caravelle might be the commercial offer of the company "Elbe Space and Technology Dresden", proposing parabolic flight services with a Russian aircraft IL-76 MDK. However, the safety aspects, which are also based on the flight history of a plane, might pose a problem. The technical capabilities of the IL- 76 MDK are somewhat larger than those of the Caravelle and its utilisation is therefore slightly more expensive. The budgetary planning of parabolic aircraft flight campaigns in the EMIR-1 Programme (each consisting of some 90 parabolas with about 20 seconds of 10-2 periods) assumes two campaigns per year until 1997. 3.7 Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights This major element of the programme covers the developments in the past and the refurbishment and reflights of some ten different independent multi-user facilities. Since all these facilities were described in detail in PB-MG documents (e.g. ESA/PB-MG(89)9), a document of 85 pages, most of them also in "Microgravity News" and in many external publications, no full description of these facilities will be repeated here. However, remarks to the status of flight opportunities, especially where the not yet approved Precursor Mission E1 is concerned, will be given below. 3.7.1 Vestibular Sled The Vestibular Sled, already developed prior to the start of Phase 2 of the Microgravity Programme, was designed to support the investigation of the functional organisation of man's vestibular apparatus and orientation system and the vestibular adaptation process in the absence of gravity. The Sled was flown on the German Spacelab mission D-1 in 1985. It provided a linear acceleration (0.2 g max) with a well-defined level and profile, on an astronaut attached to a seat which moved on rails along the centre aisle of the Spacelab, the Astronaut could be oriented in three planes with respect to the acceleration vector. The vestibular system of the astronaut could be stimulated both thermally and optokinetically during the experiment. Mainly due to its heavy demands in terms of resources (total Spacelab floor) and due to disturbances generated during its operation, Sled could not find further Spacelab flight opportunities. However, both Sled models were used successfully in terrestrial research laboratories. No further expenses for the Vestibular Sled are planned in the MG Programme. 3.7.2 Biorack The Biorack is a multi-purpose facility for experiments in cell and developmental biology and radiation biophysics. Its first two flights were on the German Mission D-1 in 1985 and on IML-1 1992, and it will be reflown on the NASA International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2 Spacelab Mission in July 1994. The main elements of the Biorack are incubators, a cooler/freezer and a glovebox. It also includes special canisters for transporting and maintaining sensitive biological samples under a well-defined thermal environment. Experiments are in general housed in small experiment containers of standard dimensions. The experiment containers are provided to the investigators who accommodate their biological samples, nutrients, etc. according to their specific requirements. In future, after IML-2, it is planned to refly Biorack on the E1 Spacelab mission. If this mission is not approved, there is a good chance that Biorack will be selected for a NASA Spacelab mission. In the "Call for Experiments" for the NASA Spacelab mission SLS-4, Biorack is offered to support research areas in cell and molecular neurobiology and developmental processes at cellular level. 3.7.3 AFPM (Advanced Fluid Physics Module) The AFPM evolved from the Fluid Physics Module. It was successfully flown on the German Spacelab mission D-2 in April 1993. It is designed, like the FPM, for investigation of liquid bridge stability. Marangoni convection, drop coalescence, surface and interfacial forces, capillary phenomena and the behaviour of containerless immiscible fluids. The system and diagnostics are more sophisticated than the original FPM. The core of the AFPM is an interchangeable test chamber with two coaxial discs (up to 100 mm diameter). Liquids can be injected through one of the discs so that a liquid column can be mechanically stimulated either by rotating the discs or by axial vibrations. The discs can be heated such as to establish the temperature gradients required in the liquid. Illumination of meridian or cross-sectional planes permits the observation of phenomena within the liquid. Images can be recorded by two TV cameras. A thermographic camera permits also the determination of the surface temperatures. In future, after D-2, it is planned to refly the AFPM on the Spacelab Mission E-1. Should this mission not be realised, the following near term alternative exists: The Floating Zone Stability Module, planned to be developed for a Foton flight in 1996, could be extended to cover the essential capabilities of the AFPM. The remote control capabilities of Foton are rather limited. Therefore an effort should be made to improve this capability of Foton. 3.7.4 BDPU (Bubble Drop and Particle Unit) The BDPU is dedicated to the study of the behaviour of bubbles, drops and particles in transparent liquids. The unit is modular consisting of a test container with test cells, a fluid injection system and a fluid reservoir. The test container can be replaced in orbit. The temperature of the fluid can be controlled and thermal gradients can be generated. Acoustic and mechanical means for mixing of the fluids are provided. The diagnostic means include direct observation by TV, cine and still cameras, a Point Diffraction Interferometer and a Schlieren Optics System. Temperatures are monitored by ten sensors in the wall of test cell, and surface temperatures are determined by a thermographic camera. The BDPU will fly on the Spacelab mission IML-2 in June 1994, during which about half of its utilisation is given to United States investigators in return for a free flight ticket (i.e. mission and integration) on IML-2. NASA is also interested in sharing the utilisation of BDPU on the E1 mission and would compensate this by reducing the Shuttle costs for the E1 mission. Should there be no E1 flight opportunity, the BDPU could probably refly on one of NASA's Spacelab missions, which are planned by NASA as successor missions - with international participation - of the national USML-1 and USML-2 missions, or on Space Station Precursor missions. 3.7.5 CPF (Critical Point Facility) This facility is designed to investigate phenomena occurring near the critical point in transparent fluids under microgravity conditions. It has flown on IML-1 in 1992 and is scheduled for flight on the IML-2 Spacelab mission in June 1994. The major elements of this facility are a precision thermostat with an experiment-dedicated fluid cell. Various stimuli, such as acoustic stirring, heating and cooling can be applied. Thermal and optical diagnostic systems permit observation of flow and of phase separation. The thermostats can be exchanged in orbit so that different systems can be investigated. The temperature in the thermostats can be controlled in the range of 30-70 Degrees Celsius with an accuracy of 1 milli-Kelvin and a stability of 0.1 milli-Kelvin. The optical diagnostics consist of a Schlieren optics system, a Twyman-Green type interferometer, a small and wide-angle light scattering measurement system and a light-attenuation measurement system. In future it is planned to fly the CPF on the E1 Spacelab mission. Should this mission not take place CPF could probably fly on one of NASA's missions, under similar conditions (IML-conditions) as on IML-1 in 1992 and IML-2 in 1994. There is considerable interest in the United States of America to continue joint ESA/NASA flights on the CPF. 3.7.6 Anthrorack The Anthrorack is a multi-user facility for research in human physiology, which was successfully flown on the German Spacelab mission D-2. The concepts is to measure interrelated body systems (e.g. cardiopulmonary metabolic etc.) simultaneously on the same subject, thereby allowing the intercomparison of data in a whole body analysis. Such an approach allows sets of high quality extensive science data to be acquired, and it mitigates the effects of the serious lack of mission opportunities and the low number of test subjects, which have precluded a normal statistical approach. Specific system-stimulation devices are provided in order to perturb well- regulated and balanced body systems e.g. heart rate and fluid distribution, in a calibrated and reproducible fashion. Anthrorack contains specialised equipment for monitoring, on a non-invasive basis, the cardiovascular adaptation, deconditioning and pulmonary function. It has provisions for sampling, processing, conservation and acquisition of signals representing the biopotentials (ECG, EMG, EOG, EEG), blood pressure, body temperature and ambient conditions. The experiments on the first mission covered three major groups, namely cardiovascular, pulmonary and hormonal research experiments. There are two major monitoring and diagnostic systems: the Respiratory Monitoring System, based on a mass spectrometer for analyzing the pulmonary functions, and the Ultrasound Monitoring System for studying cardiovascular functions. The major body stimulation equipment is a Bicycle Ergometer mounted on the centre aisle of Spacelab. A high-speed centrifuge is included to permit the processing of blood samples on board. It is planned to refly Anthrorack on the E1 Spacelab mission. Should this mission not take place, the Anthrorack could be converted into an ESA-Neurorack for the NASA SLS-4-Neurolab mission. For a Neurorack it is planned anyhow to use similar infrastructure and service elements as for Anthrorack. Anthrorack would have to be modified for the specific needs of the Neurolab mission objectives. In particular re-use of the following Anthrorack sub-elements is foreseen: -- Central computer unit for data acquisition and transfer; -- Modular support equipment with plug-in modules and the modular support system for experiment specific equipment (ESE); -- Automated blood pressure measurement system; -- Remote signal conditioner units for support of EMG, EOG, ECG, EEG, strain gauge dynamometer/potentiometer, and temperature sensors; -- Ambient conditions monitoring system; -- High-resolution colour video monitor. In this case of conversion of major hardware elements of Anthrorack into a Neurorack, which serves a different physiological science community, i.e. the neuro-physiology community, it would be desirable to extend the experimental opportunities on the MIR-94 and MIR-95 mission to serve the "traditional" Anthrorack user community in the cardiovascular, pulmonary and hormonal research fields. 3.7.7 AGHF (Advanced Gradient Heating Facility) This facility is a Bridgman-type furnace for crystal growth and directional solidification. Relatively large samples of up to 18 mm diameter and 300 mm length can be processed under well-controlled conditions of thermal stability, solidification rate and interface planarity. The cartridges containing the samples can be exchanged so that a series of samples can be processed. Electric pulses can be applied to the samples causing instantaneous growth rate variations for interface demarcation. To minimise microgravity disturbances, the cartridge remains stationary whilst the furnace is translated. NASA and ESA had planned to fly and utilise the AGHF during the NASA USML-2 Mission in 1995. However, NASA was not allowed to fly AGHF on the United States-National Spacelab mission USML-2. It is now planned to fly the AGHF on the E1 Spacelab mission with the same set of selected ESA and NASA experiments, as planned for the USML-2 mission. Should the E-1 mission not be realised, a joint re-flight of AGHF on a NASA Spacelab mission is envisaged. NASA is very interested in using AGHF. 3.7.8 APCF (Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility) This facility is designed for the growth of protein crystals. The two APCF flight units fit technically into two Shuttle middeck-lockers and can accommodate 96 (= 2 times 48) protein crystallisation reactors at closely controlled temperatures (+4 Degrees Celsius and +20 Degrees Celsius for IML-2). APCF consists of two completely independent identical modules. This means that a one middeck-locker size APCF facility could be flown and operated at any desired temperature between + 4 Celsius Degrees and some 30 Celsius Degrees. This APCF provides the possibility to utilise the three crystallisation methods favoured by the investigator community: -- Free interface diffusion; -- Dialysis; -- Vapour equilibrium. High-quality video observation and recording is available for 20 reactors, which will allow the study of growth rates and mechanisms and determination of the size and habitus of the grown crystals prior to re-entry (possible damage). There also is a simple light-scatter nucleation-detection device, which may be developed into an advanced diagnostic system for crystal growth at a later stage. APCF successfully flew for the first time on the Spacehab 1 mission in June 1993. It will refly with two modules (two FM's) on the IML-2 mission in 1994, and two more flights were agreed with NASA in the 1994/95 time frame, in exchange for NASA's use of the ESA glovebox on the USML-2 mission. In future, no problems of flight opportunities of the APCF are expected, because the facility is compatible with standard Shuttle middeck lockers and with Spacehab lockers. 3.7.9 Glovebox The glovebox concept was derived from the Biorack glovebox, an enclosed space penetrated by gloves, which isolates the internal content from the glovebox' environment. The glovebox protects the astronauts' living environment from the experiment and the experiments from each other. This is accomplished by a constantly filtered air flow and a slight underpressure with respect to the Spacelab cabin. Residual leaks will draw clean air in to be filtered rather than allow contaminated air out. The Biorack glovebox was so successful that NASA requested a next-generation version for the USML-1 Spacelab mission, which flew in 1992. This new glove-box was aimed more towards materials/fluid science experiments. The improved technical capabilities included video channels for downlinking and on-orbit recording. In return for NASA's utilisation of the glovebox on USML-1, the Agency already obtained the APCF flight opportunity (two middeck lockers) on the IML-2 mission, and will obtain two more flight opportunities (one middeck locker each) for APCF on future Shuttle flights, in return for the utilisation of glovebox on the USML-2 mission in 1995. NASA's life science office have specifically requested that ESA's glovebox fly on the SLS-4 mission in order to replace the originally planned large NASA General Purpose Work Station (a Spacelab Double Rack). The glovebox would permit biological sample preparation and handling in a safe and contained environment. In return, the ESA investigators selected would be offered to use NASA facilities during the SLS-4 mission. 3.8 Biobox and Biopan for Foton The two facilities were developed by the Agency for flight on Russian retrievable Foton type satellites. Biobox is a fully automatic and programmable incubator (with a 1 g reference centrifuge) for research in gravitational biology. It flew for the first time in December 1992/January 1993 on the Russian Bion 10 retrievable satellite mission (a Foton re-entry capsule). It is planned to refly Biobox in 1994 and 1996 on cost reimbursable Foton missions. The Biopan is a multi-user experiment facility intended to support research into the effects of cosmic radiation on biological sample materials. Biopan is designed to fly on recoverable satellites, on missions with an orbital inclination of 62.8 Celsius Degrees or 82.3 Celsius Degrees, and with a duration between two weeks and six months. Biopan will be mounted on the outer surface of its carrier satellite and will allow direct exposure of the biological samples to the hard vacuum and radiation environment of outer space. The candidate carriers for Biopan are, in the first place, the operational Russian satellites of the Bion, Foton and Resurs type, and at a later stage the Russian Nika-T satellite, which will make its first flight in 1995. Different numbers of Biopans (between one and four) can be accommodated on these satellites. In the frame of the ESA/RSO arrangement mentioned above, it is planned to perform Biopan's first operational flight at the end of 1993 and to refly it in 1994 and in 1996. Already in October 1992, a technical qualification flight of Biopan on Foton was successfully carried out. 3.9 New Payload Development for Retrievable Carriers and MIR It is planned to develop - after Biobox and Biopan - the following two fluid science facilities for flight on Foton: -- Fluid Physics Facility (FPF); -- Floating Zone Stability Module; And it is proposed to develop two life sciences facilities for the MIR 1995 flight: -- Breath Analyzer; -- BIB-MIR Incubator. 3.9.1 FPF (Fluid Physics Facility) for Foton ESA made, in summer 1992, a detailed comparative assessment of the capabilities of the two fluid science facilities BDPU and the Liquid Structure Facility (LSF)(ESA/PB-MG(92)21). The background for this comparison was the strong reduction in the scope of Columbus Precursor missions from originally two Eureca reflights and two Spacelab missions (E1 and E2), to one E1 mission with only 50 percent ESA payload, and 2 MIR missions. Since the ESA multi-user facilities already developed for Spacelab, exceed by far the accommodation capabilities of a 50 percent E1 Spacelab, it was strongly recommended to refly either BDPU, or to develop the LSF and fly it on E1. The Microgravity Programme Board decided in September 1992, that a peer group examine the situation by taking into account the feasibility of the priority-A fluid science experiments which could either be performed with the BDPU, LSF, or with both facilities. In short, the Peer Group reached the following conclusion: The development of a derivative of LSF for flight on Foton was justified, because three priority A experiments could not be performed with the capabilities provided by the BDPU. The Microgravity Programme Board accepted this recommendation, and the Executive has, in the meantime, started a Phase A/B study for the FPF (as a LSF derivative), which will be concluded in autumn 1993. It is intended to subsequently initiate the development phase of the FPF in order to meet a launch on Foton in the 1996 time frame. 3.9.2 Floating Zone Stability Module A European team of scientists (six laboratories from four member states) proposed to develop a new fluid science facility either for Foton or for Maxus, to investigate the stability of non-axisymmetric liquid columns. The study/development of such a facility would certainly obtain a high priority if no E1 mission with the AFPM as payload was to be realised. 3.9.3 Breath Analyzer for MIR The Breath Analyzer proposed here is derived from a technological concept developed by a Danish company (Bruel & Kjaer) and is based on a combination of acoustic, infrared light an paramagnetic measuring principles. Compared with the Anthrorack mass spectrometer gas analyzer, the characteristics of this new analyzer are compactness, low power consumption, high stability and no vacuum requirement. The new analyzer transforms gas concentrations to acoustically detectable signals, and a highly sensitive microphone can be used as transducer for gas analysis. This transformation results in an alternating pressure obtained by applying phased energy (IR light) to the gas molecules and by choosing the pulsation frequency in the audible range. In the frame of the ESA Technological Research Programme, a breadboard model for space application was already built and showed similar resolutions, apart from CO, as the Anthrorack mass spectrometer, but was by a large factor smaller regarding mass, volume, and power. Since a gas analyzer is an instrument needed for monitoring the astronauts' pulmonary and cardiovascular functions, but which is not yet aboard MIR, it was proposed to develop the flight model and associated support and data storage equipment for the Euro-MIR-95 flight. 3.9.4 BIB Incubator for MIR The call for experiments for the Columbus Precursor missions resulted in a large number of proposals (more than 80) in the field of biology. The peer group evaluation of these biological experiment proposals resulted in some 33 category-A proposals. ESA examined which of these 33 experiments could be accommodated in the BIB-MIR incubator, and found that it would be possible for some 15- 20 of these category-A experiments to be performed with this incubator, originally conceived for flight on the Russian-British MIR flight. 3.10 Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD) NASA invited the Agency to participate in NASA Spacelab Mission SLS-3. SLS.3 is a dedicated life sciences Spacelab mission, which will be launched in the first quarter of 1996. The objective of this mission is to study the effects of microgravity on the musculo-skeletal system in the human body. This mission will also encompass the CNES/NASA Rhesus Projects, rodent experiments and an extended-duration orbiter medical programme. The mission will last 16 days. Although NASA had already selected its experiments related to studies in the human musculo-skeletal system, NASA had invited ESA to participate in this mission by developing a research facility, called Dynamometer, a facility for testing skeletal muscle performance overall and for specific research into muscle disuse atrophy. In return for ESA's contribution, European scientists were invited to participate in this mission. ESA had identified several experiment proposals from the Columbus Precursor Missions which were rated as Category A and would match the scientific objectives, both of the mission, and the potential research hardware provided by ESA. In particular, ESA plans to develop, together with industry, the Dynamometer which can measure force, torque and velocity of various human limbs/joints, in an adjustable and reproducible way. The Torque Velocity Dynamometer will be of central importance to the understanding of adaptation processes taking place in the skeletal muscles during the "0-g immobilisation". The quantification of the deconditioning in space with the help of the TVD is new compared to the pre- and post-mission muscle performance programmes carried out for the SLS-1, SLS-2 and D-2 missions. The TVD is also useful for studying and defining countermeasures. In order to comply with the very compressed SLS-3 schedule, NASA has offered to support this TVD development in the areas of safety aspects and Spacelab interface aspects, and to utilise a recently qualified NASA portable computer for control and data acquisition from the TVD. It is intended that the TVD hardware will also be technically compatible with a Shuttle Middeck accommodation. In the medium term the TVD could also be flown on long missions on the planned MIR-2 Space Station, where it would be an interesting complement to the Breath Analyzer. During these long-term missions it is important to maintain sufficient muscle strength for the time of return to the 1g environment. 3.11 Neurorack NASA invited ESA and other space agencies to participate in the Neurolab Spacelab mission (SLS-4) in 1998. The SLS-4 Neurolab mission is dedicated to studying fundamental neuroscience questions and to studying mechanisms responsible for neurological and behavioural changes that occur in space flight. In order to evaluate the best way for ESA to participate in the SLS-4 mission, and in order to discuss the hardware requirements of the European neuroscience community, ESA has set up a Neurolab Science Team in February 1993. The preliminary recommendation of the hardware ESA should study, is a Neurorack, which is composed of an infrastructure similar to that of Anthrorack, and which would provide the following services: a) A central computer service unit, a Facility Support Computer for: -- Data acquisition and data transfer between involved nodes; -- Communication with peripheral micro-processors/computers in connected or other Neurorack equipment; -- Data Acquisition and power supply support of the existing Anthrorack Plug-in Module (PIM) and Modular Support System (MSS); -- Provision of two individual displays: One stationary and one mobile, the latter connected to the rack by a flexible data/power cable. The facility Support Computer accommodates separate interface cards for support of specific interface requirements. b) Automated Blood Pressure Measurement System (ABP) derived from Anthrorack (Finapres system); c) A Remote Signal Conditioner Unit (RSCU) for support of EMG, EOG, ECG, EEG, dynamometer (strain gauge)/potentiometer, and temperature sensor; d) A vestibulo-ocular interaction recording device; e) Plug-in Module (PIM): For support of data acquisition/power/status coming from rack-external equipment. f) Modular Support System (MSS): For support of fully integrated units, connected through the Modular Support system (MSS) which may provide device control, data and power support as well as data acquisition by the Facility Support Computer. g) Video Colour Monitor (high resolution) for real-time display of video images and other support functions. ESA intends to initiate a Phase A study of Neurorack, which is based on the recommendation of the Neurolab Science Team in the near future. This study will also cover the scenario in which an E1- Spacelab mission would not be funded, so that Anthrorack hardware elements could become available for use in Neurorack. This should enable to strongly increase the capability of Neurorack. 4. Programmatic Changes Introduced by the Transformation of the Previous MG Programme (Extended Phase 2) into the EMIR-1 Programme The changes/adjustments introduced when the Extended Phase 2 was transformed into the EMIR-1 Programme, (lasting until 1997), are the following: a) It is assumed that no Eureca reflight will take place until 1997. b) The EMIR-1 Programme will support the ESA MIR missions in 1994 and 1995, as far as the utilisation of existing French, German and Russian experimental facilities onboard MIR are concerned, and in the frame of EMIR-1 a breath analyzer, an incubator, a freezer, a separation centrifuge, and other support equipment will be developed/procured and operated on MIR. c) The number of payload elements to be reflown on E1 or equivalent missions will be increased by reflights of Biorack, BDPU and CPF. d) New facilities will be developed for the recently offered NASA Spacelab missions SLS-3 and SLS-4: -- A Torque Velocity Dynamometer for the SLS-3 mission which is planned for early 1996; -- A Neurorack for the SLS-4 mission planned for early 1998. e) Additional funding has been allocated to develop, for flight on the Russian retrievable carrier Foton, a Fluid Physics Facility, FPF (which is derived from the former Liquid Structure Facility), and a Floating Zone Stability Module (FZSM). f) The funding of the Technology Support Programme will be reduced and the resulting "saved" amount will be used to support the microgravity experiments selected for the Euro-MIR 94 and Euro-MIR 95 missions. g) Additional funding has been allocated to cover the mission and utilisation costs for retrievable carriers such as Foton. In particular the following flights are planned: -- Biopan reflight in 1993 (September), 1994 and 1996; -- Biobox reflights in 1994 and 1996; -- Flights of the FPF and the FZSM in 1996; -- Performance of materials sciences experiments using the existing Foton and MIR furnaces. h) The Phase B-Studies (detached design) for the microgravity facilities for the Columbus Attached Laboratory have been blocked until the Columbus Programme is approved. This Phase B-Study is the only Columbus Programme element which remains within the EMIR-1 technical programme content. i) The annual budget limitation of the EMIR-1 Programme imposed by the Granada Council Meeting at ministerial level, of 88 MAU (1992 economic conditions), a sum which included the blocked amount of 25.5 percent or about 24 MAU resulting from the low subscription level of only 74.5 percent, has been introduced. This means that for EMIR-1 a net annual budget of about 64 MAU (1992 economic conditions) will be available, from which all industrial development/refurbishment expenditure, mission/flight costs, expenses for experts and consultants, scientific working groups, peer groups, test facilities, science teams and all ESA internal costs have to be paid. The approved EMIR-1 Programme incorporates a high degree of flexibility, enabling it to adapt to changes in related programmes (i.g. Columbus Precursor Missions) and to allow for timely adjustment to the emergence of new scientific results, or scientific focusing, which might require a change in scientific emphases.
