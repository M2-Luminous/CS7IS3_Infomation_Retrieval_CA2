The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the criticism "improper." The two countries agreed to promote the trade talks on schedule in line with a bilateral accord, the official said. "Criticism against counterparts in negotiations will serve only as a negative factor in talks," he said. Senior White House officials expressed Tuesday frustration about the stalemated discussions and indicated that the United States has given up hopes of getting a deal through negotiations with Japanese Government bureaucrats. Bowman Cutter, the White House official in charge of overseeing the bilateral talks, said it is time to move them beyond the confines of the bureaucracy, saying "sooner or later there has to be the capability to deal with people with political responsibility."
