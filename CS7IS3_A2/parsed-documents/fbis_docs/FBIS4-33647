The new law, which is designed to stop acts of violence perpetrated by neo-Nazi groups in Brazil, will become part of Law 7716, which defines the crimes of racism and discrimination. Deputy Alberto Goldman (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Sao Paulo State), who proposed the bill, estimates that there are at least 13 neo-Nazi groups in Brazil. He cited the "White Power" and the "ABC Skinheads" in Sao Paulo. In May, four men armed with knives and handguns tattooed swastikas on a 14-year-old girl who responds to the initials N.M.P.L. in Taubate, Sao Paulo State. The men had swastikas tattooed on their faces. The law may be used to bring aggravating circumstances in assault and battery cases. Goldman said: "By displaying swastika symbols, these groups are clearly revealing a menacing attitude, using force and brutality to discriminate against and affect certain social groups such as blacks, Jews, residents of northeastern Brazil, and homosexuals." He does not believe the new law is violating freedom of expression. He added: "Freedom of expression promotes ideological debate and democratic discussions, while swastikas are used to foment racism and intolerance."
