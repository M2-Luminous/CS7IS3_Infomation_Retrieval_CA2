In a statement issued Monday [21 March] on the breakdown of the eighth round of working-level talks at the weekend, the North Korean delegation said it had done everything possible to ensure the negotiations' success since offering to exchange special envoys last may, radio Pyongyang reported. But the South hindered the cross-visits by erecting artificial barriers and the proposed exchange "now faces a grave crisis," the report quoted the statement as saying. "While the dialogue was under way, the South took reckless actions threatening its dialogue partner, such as the maintenance of international cooperation (in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue), war games including the Team Spirit military exercise with the United States and an attempt to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles." On the hard-line measures being considered by Seoul after the breakdown of inter-Korean dialogue, the statement called them "de facto declarations on destroying and renouncing the special envoy exchange and on an all-out confrontation." It went on to say, "the measures have revealed the South's hidden schemes to make use of the inter-Korean dialogue in applying a brake to the North Korea-U.S. talks and to cease relations with the North, while driving the North-South relationship into a situation of confrontation and war." "We will take note of the chief South Korean delegate's public statement that the South will no longer talk with the North," it added.
