Not So Much `For' As `Against'"] [Text] Journalists, politicians, and scientists have been given various explanations for the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." But what do the voters themselves think, how do they account for their choice, and what are they saying in their letters to the newspaper? Many people believe that "voters voted not for Zhirinovskiy but against the ruling team's inability to cope with reforms" (V. Ogorodnikov, Kemerovo). A. Medyantsev from Yekaterinburg says effectively the same thing: "People only voted for Zhirinovskiy because he highlighted society's sore points to which our leaders are deaf." The question is that many people's living standard has been reduced to the lowest possible level and they have been made the dregs of society. It is a question of specific things like, for instance, losing savings as a result of "shock therapy." Here is one of the most emotional letters: "You made us all beggars. Had I been able to get my hands on Gaydar, I would have gone for the jugular," an elderly woman living in the north, who has lost both her savings and the chance of ever leaving there, writes. Another newspaper reader remembers the "Moskvich, for which I had saved for a long time and almost bought; but that hope has vanished like the mist." People are equally indignant at the ineffectiveness of the fight against crime: "When the militia shrugs helplessly in response to calls for help and officials do not even deign to answer your complaint, there is no question of whom to vote for...." (L. Shlyapnikova, Perm). Or: "Total license, bribe-taking, robbery, treachery, racketeering, pavement sex, a low birth rate, high mortality, rising unemployment, the bankruptcy of even profitable enterprises, the bankruptcy of our military-industrial complex, murders, assaults for virtually everyone to see, homeless people picking through garbage heaps -- Russian citizens are opposed to all this and protest where they can" (A. Kuznetsova, Irkutsk). Admittedly, the last letter indicates not so much that the person is unhappy but rather that they actively read newspapers. It is hard to agree with Yekaterinburg resident A. Medyantsev's viewpoint in this connection -- he says that the government "is not aware of the sore points" in society. Not at all: Everyone is aware of these sore points, even the illiterates who merely enumerate our socioeconomic ills. The causes of and the means of escaping from the crisis most speedily are another matter. As I read letters from people lusting for violence against the powers that be, I remembered the events of late last century: There was an epidemic in Russia, and the peasants murdered the doctors because they thought they were to blame for their misfortunes. The situation with our reforms is a similar one although, thank God, reformers are not yet being murdered.... While agreeing (how can you disagree!) in many respects with TRUD readers and sharing their indignation and perplexity at the obvious distortions with the implementation of reforms, I would nonetheless also point out that we have surprisingly short memories. Two years ago we were in a crush waiting in line for vodka and sugar, we were moreover crushed in a very real sense when we tried to exchange ration cards for goods. The stores were completely empty. Mobs blocked streets and boulevards demanding cigarettes. There were shortages of bread, butter, and meat, while cheese no longer seemed to be produced in the country at all. There was not even any milk for young children. If there were rubles, there was nothing to do with them. The economy went great guns [shla vraznos] between May 1991, when Pavlov and Ryzhkov tried unsuccessfully to "regulate" prices, and this December: Barter and exchange in kind prevailed and oblasts posted militia cordons on their borders to ensure that foodstuffs did not "overflow" from one region to another. Why have we forgotten this? If anyone brought the economy down, it was the people who directed it by Bolshevik distributive-administrative methods and the hapless reformers of the Gorbachev era. Needless to say, Gaydar also had "a part to play." But, to be fair, he came along at a time when no one wanted to assume responsibility.... It is not for nothing that his policy is called "shock" policy. It was indeed an attempt at treatment using overly severe means. Did Yegor Gaydar and his "buddies" cure the economy? No. But at least a "fatal outcome" may have been averted for a while. Admittedly, this was not only therapy, but by no means entirely well-considered surgery, resulting in a drastic drop in the production of many kinds of output and a host of enterprises ending up on the verge of bankruptcy. People are saying that Gaydar is a monetarist, who follows the recommendation of his U.S. masters blindly, and his policy of "financial stabilization" could have actually destroyed the country. But here are Russia's budget figures for the fourth quarter of 1993: income -- 15 trillion rubles [R], expenditure -- R22 trillion. Thus the state spends R3 for every R2 it receives. But you cannot spend what you do not have. This is the result not only of Gaydar's miscalculations but also of pressure from his enemies and their demands that he spend as much as necessary for "social equilibrium." Judging from the letters, Zhirinovskiy's promises to restore people's lost savings made a particular impression on many people. The authorities also say from time to time that they will repay their debts -- the latest presidential edict promises something of the kind. But something has obviously not been thought through here! In actual fact nothing can simply be accomplished in a fairly rapid timeframe. Before 1992 people had around R300 billion in savings, so should they today be given R300 trillion (since today's R1000 is roughly equivalent to the former ruble)? Russian produced output, so-called GDP, was worth around 100 trillion rubles for the whole of last year. So, three times as much as the entire country produces in a year has to be repaid? Is that possible now? The answer is obvious. Nevertheless some action is needed. And here the government is to blame for not being inventive enough in finding at least a partial solution to the situation. For instance, all savings could be registered as a state debt, a state loan to be paid off over so many years. As for Zhirinovskiy's proposals regarding switching to repaying lost savings "in noncash form," I suggest that you take a look at any newspaper that carries advertisements. There are plenty of "encashment" offers there. That, is noncash money rapidly becomes cash ,and then what happens to prices? By voting for Zhirinovskiy people were often protesting against the price that has to be paid for securing a market economy and true democracy. However, you can see something else. There are plenty of people who think Zhirinovskiy is the person who will (maybe) save the country. They were impressed by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's way of dealing with voters: "On television he spoke not to everyone at once, like certain turncoat Communists, but as it were to everyone individually" (anonymous letter). Another reader is convinced that "If Zhirinovskiy does not betray his election promises and implements a policy in the interests of Russian citizens and Russia, he will move mountains" (V. Bushuyev, Krasnodar Kray). A number of other (more ironic, shall we say) people express partial solidarity with him: "The Zhirinovskiy option, the 'stick and carrot' option suits us more in these conditions. And when he runs for president, you see, he will poll 90 percent of the vote." (G. Kozharskiy, Rostov Oblast). Thus, some people do not merely reject "shock therapy" but also see the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" as an alternative. A bad mistake!... Incidentally, for some reason no one is paying attention to the name of the party led by Vladimir Volfovich -- the "Liberal Democratic Party." If readers are so unhappy with the democrats, why do they trust a "Liberal Democrat"? After all, who are these Liberal Democrats. They are people who presumably are in favor of using Western models for organizing society and the economy. In principle most democrats would most likely subscribe to this party's slogans and postulates (I will not venture to judge the program -- is there one?). But "Liberal Democracy" as practiced by Vladimir Volfovich is a strange thing: For some reason there are lots of Communists in his party. The businessman Zavidiya, the LDPR's former chief financier, is a Communist. Deputy Lukava, who as an elder opened the Duma session speaking on behalf of the LDPR faction, is a Communist. And some of this faction's other deputies are, as it were, members of two parties at once. Hasn't Vladimir Volfovich got confused with the name of his party...? But if Zhirinovskiy is not a Liberal Democrat, what is he then? Let me cite a few quotations from a book: "Troubles for Russia have always come and will always come from the south... We must carry out this operation code-named the Last Dash to the South. Our Army will perform this task. This will be a method of ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole; it will be the basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. New armed forces can be reborn only as a result of a combat operation. But the whole world must believe that, if Russia has to do this, it is fine. You have to proceed from the majority will. It is to the advantage of the majority of mankind for the Muslim world to be carved up [rassechen].... And across this new space to the shore of the Indian Ocean everybody will speak Russian...." These are extracts from Zhirinovskiy's book entitled Last Dash to the South. The author says that this is the "juice of my brain." Some readers are indignant that the views of their elected representative are often described as profascist. "Since the elections people have been insulting not only the LDPR and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation but also those who voted for them. We voters are called sheep, fascists, fools" (A. Khlebova in Volgograd). "You are frightening us once again with the advent of fascism in Russia. Perhaps we have had enough of being frightened. There is no need to pigeonhole Mr. Zhirinovskiy; we have already experienced that...," others say. Yes, but if you agree with Zhirinovskiy's ideas and support the conquest of Afghanistan and Turkey, what kind of person are you...? Hitler called for eastward expansion, and Vladimir Volfovich is not averse to annexing the south. Admittedly, the people who voted for him stress that he is proposing to do all this by nonviolent means: "He is promising to revive Russia not by force but by other means, making it rich, and the process will happen on its own. Zhirinovskiy believes that we should drive to the Indian Ocean with the minimum use of force, since he believes that the countries involved will join us themselves." (L. Vedrov, Saratov). But how will this happen? Why would other peoples, those Afghans who fought the USSR for instance, suddenly join us voluntarily? Who can believe that? If we are right in our reading of Zhirinovskiy, who is coming up with these fantasies, it is hard to believe that sensible Russian people are willing to give power to that kind of man. But some are.... ...In 1917 virtually the same percentage of Russian citizens voted for the Bolsheviks in the Constituent Assembly elections. The civil war with its millions of casualties began soon after. But Russian citizens say in amazement: "Many democrats seem mere children on television" and "Why are you fussing, guys?" Others say: "The people have decided.... Should you be reproaching the people" (Yu. Vasnetsov, Yekaterinburg). Zhirinovskiy has promised to turn virtually the whole world into an area of combat operations, while the good-humored writers of other letters take political scientists and journalists to task: "Don't you dare insult the people's elected representative." If someone is extremely fond of Zhirinovskiy I suggest that they remember the film "Seventeen Moments of Spring." There are so many smart and in their own way extremely sympathetic national-socialists in it (Mueller and Schellenberg, for instance) who had no intention of doing a lot of fighting -- all they intended was a blitzkrieg, without balking at casualties, and then utter peace and prosperity for the German people. Admittedly things did turn out differently. Most Russian citizens voted against Gaydar's scenario for reforms on 12 December. But what did they vote for? It is indeed necessary to realistically assess the serious miscalculations and to rectify the mistakes of the first phase of reform in Russia, but nonetheless not to recoil from but to stick to the market course (mindful of world experience and Russian conditions and traditions). And not to trust political magicians who promise "easy" routes to prosperity that may cause a great deal of bloodshed.
