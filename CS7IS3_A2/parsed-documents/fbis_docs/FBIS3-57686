The words of Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev about Russia's defense interests in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which are constantly called "the near abroad countries," and about a possible suspension of the Russian Army withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia confirm this. No ambiguous maneuvers can reduce the negative meaning of these words. The presence of the Russian Army in the Baltic states and the delay in its withdrawal not only increase instability in Latvia and Estonia and create possibilities for conflicts and provocations there, but also endangers Lithuania's security. All of this shows that Russia ignores signed international agreements and documents and, through this, poses a threat to world peace and stability. The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania expresses great concern over Russia's current policy toward the Baltic states and hopes, at the same time, that processes of democratization will continue there, and that Russia will respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Baltic states. [Signed] Ceslovas Jursenas, chairman of Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania [Dated] 20 January 1994
