In addition to Japan and the United States, the participating countries are Canada, Australia, and the ROK. In connection with calls for sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) over the nuclear inspection issue, Japan, the United States, and the ROK will be on the same team for the first time in military exercises. Although the MSDF emphasizes that "the training assumes no specific situation," the issue of exercising the right to collective self-defense, banned under the constitution, appears likely to surface once again. The highlight of Rimpac '94 is to be an exercise in which the participants oppose one another in waters off Hawaii. The scenario has not been made public. But "Team X," which consists of two groups -- one organized around a U.S. carrier task force led by the aircraft carrier Independence and the MSDF destroyer unit, the other organized by a U.S. unit and ROK frigate vessels -- will assemble in waters off Hawaii and take back Hawaii from the enemy. The opposing force, "Team U," consists of U.S., Canadian, and Australian ships. For two weeks in mid-June, the two teams will conduct exercises comprehensively combining surface warfare, antisubmarine warfare [ASW], and air defense operations. In Rimpac '94, the ROK for the first time will join Team X, consisting until now only of Japan and the United States. The ROK, participating in its third Rimpac exercise, had been on the opposing team the previous two times. While it has not been made clear why the teams have been changed this time, it is natural to regard it as reflecting the situation on the Korean peninsula. When the United Nations decides to impose sanctions against North Korea over the nuclear inspections issue, ships from the navies of several nations may jointly conduct naval blockade actions. In that case, the commander of U.S. Forces Korea would have command over ROK forces. Therefore, points out a source related to the Defense Agency, "The aim of this exercise is probably to strengthen U.S.-ROK ties through Rimpac." On the other hand, the Maritime Staff Office [MSO] stresses that Rimpac maneuvers are "not intended for any specific nation or sea area." Concerning the first Japan-U.S.-ROK combination, too, the MSO denies that the exercise is a "path" to the exercise of the right of collective defense, saying: "There are Japan-U.S. and U.S.-ROK teams, so the three nations will never carry on maneuvers together." From the standpoint of Team U, however, Japan, the United States, and the ROK are a united opposing force, which gives the strong impression of military ties between Japan, the United States, and the ROK. When the MSDF first joined the Rimpac exercise in 1980, it came under attack for "participation in multinational military maneuvers constituting an exercise of the right to collective self-defense." However, not only is there the impression now that participation has become routine, but the participation of eight destroyers puts the level of MSDF participation second to that of the U.S. Navy. There are deeply cooperative relations in Rimpac between the U.S. Navy and the MSDF. With MSDF ships participating in at-sea refueling of U.S. Navy vessels and ASW exercises for detecting and destroying submarines under the guidance of U.S. destroyers. The opposite chain-of-command cases also take place as a matter of course. Moreover, the Kongo, the MSDF's Aegis-type destroyer with advanced air defense capability, will join Rimpac '94 for the first time and come under the U.S. carrier task force. Although the Japanese and U.S. fleets have separate commands, MSDF Chief of Staff Chiaki Hayashizaki says that "One has to say, according to one's point of view, that (the Aegis ship and other destroyers) will be escorting the U.S. aircraft carrier." With the ROK's participation in the exercises, the issue of exercising the right to collective self-defense will inevitably recur. The MSDF describes Team X as "simply an issue of teams with no other intent," but there is an outstanding whiff of smoke in the statements of the Japanese and U.S. sides. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata stated in his policy speech that Japan would deal with the North Korea issue in concert with the United States and the ROK even without UN resolutions. When U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry visited Japan in April, he stressed the need for a settlement of the issue through dialogue, but noted that "it is important for the international community to show a firm stance through ties among the United States, Japan, and the ROK." Specifically, in the event of an emergency situation on the Korean Peninsula, Japan is reportedly considering having the Self- Defense Force carry out such rear-echelon support as at-sea refueling, transport, and medical care. According to a senior Defense Agency official, "While participation in military actions is impossible under the constitution, cooperation is allowed." However, Japan has never discussed seriously whether "cooperation" is really possible. However, from the viewpoint of the U.S. military, there is no border in terms of strategy between Japan and the ROK, both allies of the United States. Even between Japan and the ROK, their national interests are completely identical when it comes to an emergency on the Korean peninsula and the defense of the Tsushima straits. Under such circumstances, Rimpac `94 is highlighting present relations among Japan, the United States, and the ROK. However, Japan should not freely strengthen military ties with foreign nations. Whether military ties are truly possible and, if so, to what extent, are issues for which debate based upon the Constitution are demanded.
