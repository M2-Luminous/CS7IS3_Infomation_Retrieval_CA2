Speaking at a national conference on rural work, the minister said that China produced more grain, meat, milk, eggs and aquatic products last year than in the previous year, but less cotton and sugar. Liu said China achieved a bumper grain harvest last year, with the total grain output exceeding 450 million tons. He said the total output of meat, milk, eggs and aquatic products increased by 5.5 percent, 6.4 percent, seven percent and 10 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The total output and profits made by China's rural enterprises, which accounted for about one-third of the gross national product (GNP), both grew by at least 40 percent, said the minister. The average per capita net income of China's farmers totaled 880 yuan (about 151 U.S. dollars), representing a real increase of two percent over the previous year after inflation. He attributed the progress to the policies and measures made by the central government to boost agricultural production and rural economy, and favorable weather for crops. "Problems hindering the development of agricultural production still exist," said the minister. He said some problems are outstanding, such as persistent low profits for farming, particularly for grain and cotton production. He stressed that increases in farmers' income remain slow, adding that these increases are falling behind the growth rates for agricultural production and rural firms. "a contrast between farmers' income and urban residents' income, which rose by 10 percent, is striking," said the official. In addition, the country's agricultural technology extension network and research should be improved, said the minister, adding "the means of the central government's macro-control over agriculture is not adequate, and the foundation of agriculture remains weak." He explained that the investment in agriculture is inadequate and a great area of cultivated land was used for industrial development and other purposes. Talking about the growing pressure from surplus rural laborers, the minister said the surplus labor forces numbered about 100 million in 1993, an unemployed force which is growing at an annual rate of 13 million. Liu said the vast number of surplus laborers hinders the increase in farmers' income, postpones the process of agricultural modernization, and also causes some social problems.
