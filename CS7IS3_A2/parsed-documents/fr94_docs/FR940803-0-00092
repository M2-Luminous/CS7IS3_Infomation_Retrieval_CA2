FR940803-0-00092 FR940803-0-00033 Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement, to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements. This rule will clarify the reporting of marine casualties to include unintentional strikes of bridges. However, when it has met the additional criteria found in 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1, this type of casualty has always been included in the category of ``other'' casualties listed on the form. A CG&hyph;2692 (OMB No. 2115&hyph;0003) will still be the form used. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under ADDRESSES. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and has concluded that, under §2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub-§2.B.2.1 of that instruction that clearly has no environmental impact. (It requires the reporting of marine casualties and the reporting of most strikes of bridges.) A ``Determination of Categorical Exclusion'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 4 Administrative practice and procedure, Investigations, Marine safety, National Transportation Safety Board, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Safety, and Transportation. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 46 CFR Part 4 as follows: TITLE 46␣[AMENDED] PART 4_MARINE CASUALTIES AND INVESTIGATIONS 1. The citation of authority for part 4 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1231; 43 U.S.C. 1333; 46 U.S.C. 2103, 2306, 6101, 6301, 6305; 50 U.S.C. 198; 49 CFR 1.46. Authority for subpart 4.40: 49 U.S.C. 1903(a)(1)(E); 49 CFR 1.46. 2. Section 4.05&hyph;1 is revised to read as follows: §4.05&hyph;1 Notice of marine casualty. (a) Immediately after the addressing of resultant safety concerns, the owner, agent, master, operator, or person in charge, shall notify the nearest Marine Safety Office, Marine Inspection Office or Coast Guard Group Office whenever a vessel is involved in a marine casualty consisting in_ (1) An unintended grounding, or an unintended strike of (allison with) a bridge; (2) An intended grounding, or an intended strike of a bridge, that creates a hazard to navigation, the environment, or the safety of a vessel, or that meets any criterion of paragraphs (a) (3) through (7); (3) A loss of main propulsion, primary steering, or any associated component or control system that reduces the maneuverability of the vessel; (4) An occurrence materially and adversely affecting the vessel's seaworthiness or fitness for service or route, including but not limited to fire, flooding, or failure of or damage to fixed fire-extinguishing systems, lifesaving equipment, auxiliary power-generating equipment, or bilge-pumping systems; (5) A loss of life; (6) An injury that requires professional medical treatment (treatment beyond first aid) and, if the person is engaged or employed on board a vessel in commercial service, that renders the individual unfit to perform his or her routine duties; or (7) An occurrence causing property-damage in excess of $25,000, this damage including the cost of labor and material to restore the property to its condition before the occurrence, but not including the cost of salvage, cleaning, gas-freeing, drydocking, or demurrage. (b) Notice given as required by 33 CFR 160.215 satisfies the requirement of this section if the marine casualty involves a hazardous condition as defined by 33 CFR 160.203. 3. Section 4.05&hyph;10 is revised to read as follows: §4.05&hyph;10 Written report of marine casualty. (a) The owner, agent, master, operator, or person in charge shall, within five days, file a written report of any marine casualty. This written report is in addition to the immediate notice required by §4.05&hyph;1. This written report must be delivered to a Coast Guard Marine Safety Office or Marine Inspection Office. It must be provided on Form CG&hyph;2692 (Report of Marine Accident, Injury or Death), supplemented as necessary by appended Forms CG&hyph;2692A (Barge Addendum) and CG&hyph;2692B (Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing Following a Serious Marine Incident). (b) If filed without delay after the occurrence of the marine casualty, the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section suffices as the notice required by §4.05&hyph;1(a). Dated: July 15, 1994. J.C. Card, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection.
