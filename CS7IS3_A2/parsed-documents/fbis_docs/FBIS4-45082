But it also mirrors a certain frame of mind: notions are turned upside down, irrationality becomes rationality, insult is taken to be accolade. This is the state we, it would seem, have finally managed to reach. The American administration chose to downgrade our Prime Minister's week-long sojourn to God's Own Country. Unlike on all previous occasions, this time it was not reckoned as a State visit; our Head of Government was given the treatment reserved for minor foreign dignitaries who are entitled to only some minimal courtesies. Propitiation We lumped that, in order to propitiate the US administration we chose to suspend, even if, as our Government claims, only temporarily -- our missile test firing programme. We also rushed through a new telecommunications policy which will gladden the heart of US transnational corporations. Our spokesman and our media were under instructions to make great play of the fact that the Prime Minister was invited to address a joint session of the US Congress. Between the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Congress consists of 535 members. Of them, not even 40 bothered to be present and listen to the Indian Prime Minister's address; the empty seats of the chamber, had to be filled by minions from the Indian Embassy and their family members and by some of the officials from new Delhi who constituted the Prime Minister's entourage. Even the press gallery was principally occupied by the plane-load of journalists the Prime Minister had taken along with him. The visit of the Indian Prime Minister and his perorations at New York, Houston, Boston and Washington, D.C. were blacked out by the American media. This was not deliberate, but matter of course. A banana republic is taken for granted. India was no longer the ogre leading the great non-aligned movement. There was no Krishna Menon around to incense, Time magazine by his forked tongue, and this puny visitor from a diminished country was no Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi. At the joint press conference following his session in the Oval Room with the US President, our Prime Minister was cut to size; he was simply ignored by the media. Only one American journalist chose to ask him a question; that was on the human rights situation in Kashmir, and the answer he gave was received with unconcealed disbelief. The rest of the time, the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy was a mute onlooker, even as correspondent after correspondent kept targeting a barrage of questions at the US President, not on US-Indian relations, but on his domestic health programme, on Haiti, on China's MFN (Most Favoured Nation) status, on the domestic interest rate structure, and so on. But Clinton spoke a few polite words about our country; these were obligatory for the occasion. He was, however, in no generous mood; he left none in doubt that the American administration would continue to harass New Delhi on the issues of nuclear non-proliferation, regional disarmament, Kashmir and human rights; there was going to be no switching off of the heat following the visit. His promise to send two special emissaries -- the Secretary of Commerce and the Energy Secretary -- in the course of the year is not bereft of significance either; one Secretary will press India to allow further market access to US goods and services; the other one is to ensure that the Indian authorities do not renege at the last moment their pledge to buy dozens and dozens of obsolete power plants from the United States and additionally guarantee American investors a minimum rate of return of 16 per cent. This is precisely where the state of the mind becomes relevant. All sensitivities are spent. The banana republic does not even realise that it is at the receiving end of the banana republic treatment. Every insult is regarded as a benediction. A Dream World The Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy misses the import of the adage that dignity is as dignity does; as he emerges from his tete-a-tete with the US President, he gloatingly informs the world press that, look, there has been no twisting of his arm. No Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi could have imagined that an Indian Prime Minister was capable of sinking to such a grovelling level. But a banana republic has its own code. It lives in its own illusory world. The block of press people who accompanied the Prime Minister would, for the next month and thereabouts, write dutiful columns on what a thundering success the Prime Minister's American safari was, on the umpteen points he succeeded in scoring off Pakistan, on how well his speeches went down with the US audiences, on how American industrialists and businessmen were totally bowled over when our Prime Minister described to them the limitless possibilities of the market India offered, on how our Prime Minister's quote from Abraham Lincoln completely befuddled a nondescript US State Department official named Raphel. Such is the banana republic state of the mind or, if one were to use that state-of-the-art expression, mind-set. A banana republic assumes itself to be the centre of the universe. The reality is that it is nobody. It gets accustomed to the role of a vassal State, but imagines the serfdom to be sovereignty. Its press becomes excruciatingly conformist. We are currently witnessing the unfolding of this phenomenon. Act of Accommodation Our Government, if we have to go by our media, can do no wrong, and the Americans, thanks to the Prime Minister's visit, have shed all their reservations about our country; even on Kashmir and the nuclear business, the Americans, it will be asserted, have been most understanding. A surrender to foreign pressure, don't you know, is not really surrender, but an act of accommodation. The lingo itself undergoes a transformation. We no longer talk of a suspension of our missile development programme, we merely `cap' it. The banana republic has arrived, and it has brought along with it a new manual of manners and norms. The poor have dropped out of the nation's conscience. The nation itself is now defined in terms of the foibles and predilections of the top 10 or 15 per cent of the social stratum. The latter dream American and think America. Their priorities determine official policy. Thanks to the spate of economic reforms since 1991; this upper crust had never had it so good; the consumerist arcadia they have attained has, therefore, to be protected at all cost. The high living of the upper classes has been made possible by interminable borrowings from foreign parties; such borrowings have been contingent upon letting go, in substantial measure, bits and pieces of the nation's economic sovereignty. The surrender of economic prerogatives cannot but endanger political sovereignty as well, as we are increasingly likely to learn in the course of the next few months; President Clinton has promised as much. But the upper crust mind-set is not disturbed. This mind-set expresses itself only in cliches: globalisation is good; we must integrate with the world; the market must be free; there is no substitute for efficiency; privatisation promotes efficiency. What good globalisation has till now done to the country is a query this mind-set feels no need to respond to; the fact that such data as are available suggest that efficiency in the Indian public sector units as a whole, measured by the rate of return, has in recent years been much higher than in the private sector does not impress them. Nor do they like to be detained by such abstractions as loss of national sovereignty. Since they never had it so good, why should they worry whether their country has been reduced to the state of a banana republic and, anyway, what is wrong with being a banana republic? The Prime Minister and his entourage perhaps know better. But they have their private concerns. The model they have opted for, they know, is unsustainable without a continuous, and rising inflow of foreign funds. In past decades, such funds were arranged on a government-to-government basis, with some master-of ceremonies role on the part of the World Bank. The cessation of the Cold War has ended the chapter of government-to-government munificence. Private capital inflows now offer the only possibility of escape. The wretched foreigners are, however, not coming in droves, and they are not investing in growth. American business and industry are playing hard. India is an eleventh-rate country which does not hold their interest. They will come only if their charter of demands is fully granted, and perhaps not even then. There is no evidence that the Americans ever helped any banana republic to develop into an economically strong nation. It is the fate of a banana republic to continue to be a dependent territory. The Suffering Many The upper crust will not mind that state of being, but will they be able to hold down the nation's overwhelming majority who will get nothing; absolutely nothing, out of the emerging social end economic arrangements? The Prime Minister may keep visiting the United States oftener, US officials may increase the frequency of their visits to our shores, the answer to the riddle however lies within the country itself.
