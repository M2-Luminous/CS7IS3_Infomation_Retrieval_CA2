The "Resolution" emphatically stated: The year 1994 is crucial for Yunnan in implementing and carrying out the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and also in building a socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we should firmly adhere to economic construction as the center; submit to the overall interests of CPC work; conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee in light of actual local conditions and in accordance with arrangements made by the provincial party committee; profoundly, protractedly, and fruitfully push forward the province's ongoing anticorruption struggle on the basis of the existing achievements in this connection; and strive to persistently consolidate and carry on the ongoing anticorruption struggle with a view to attaining the three anticorruption goals put forward by the central authorities. To this end, we should mainly concentrate on the following two work aspects: 1. Conscientiously study and implement an important reccent anticorruption speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee; correctly view and further the ongoing anticorruption struggle and orient it toward such overall interests as reform, development, and stability; 2. Work hard and strive to attain the three anticorruption goals put forward at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee. To this end, leading cadres at all levels across the province should: Persistently take the lead in honestly discharging official duties and observing party and government discipline; strictly abide by the five regulations mapped out in 1993 by the central authorities for ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among cadres; conscientiously carry out self- examination and self-rectification in accordance with the five requirements laid down at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee; strengthen leadership over the ongoing anticorruption struggle; persistently and successfully investigate and handle each and every major and serious corruption case; and should make continued and earnest efforts to eradicate professional malpractices and improve social order. The "Resolution" maintained: This year, the province's anticorruption struggle is bound to come across a host of new situations and problems. In view of this, we should make every possible effort to successfully accomplish each and every arduous task and overcome as many difficulties as possible. To this end, party committees, governments, and principal party and government leaders at all levels in the province, should: Firmly grasp the two key work aspects at the same time; take the ongoing anticorruption struggle as an indispensable component of the party and political power building work and a prerequisite for reform, development, and stability; place the anticorruption work high on the agenda; earnestly strengthen leadership over the ongoing anticorruption struggle; vigorously support discipline inspection and supervision organs in discharging their official duties; and should strive to successfully attain the three anti-corruption goals set by the central authorities.
