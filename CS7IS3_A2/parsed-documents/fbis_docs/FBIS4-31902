"What happened in Austria can help us succeed in our efforts to join the EU," he told CTK. The vote was also welcomed by the Slovak Foreign Ministry, which issued a statement saying that Austria's path was "in many ways a source of experience for Slovak foreign policy, whose strategic aim is full EU membership." It also expressed interest in intensifying Slovak-Austrian relations as a "prototype for Slovakia's relations in an integrated Europe." By voting to join, Austria had assumed not only the right to take part in joint decision making in the EU but also the responsibility of deepening European integration, the ministry said.
