It is still difficult for Austrian exporters to get credit guarantees from the Control Bank. They are only granted in special cases. According to Guenter Richter, the Austrian trade delegate in Moscow, Austrian firms have so far established 475 joint ventures in Moscow, in which they have invested about 2 billion schillings. However, many of these enterprises only exist on paper. In 1993 Austria's exports to Russia decreased by 9.6 percent to 6.2 billion schillings. This was a good result because Russia's total imports decreased by 30 percent. About 1,200 Austrian firms deal directly or indirectly with the Russian market. The most important export items are consumer goods, equipment for the food industry, and supplies for the natural gas and oil industries. Last year, Austria's imports increased by 2.3 percent to 7.7 billion schillings. The most important import item is energy, whose share decreased from 90 percent to 70 percent. However, supplies of semifinished and finished products increased.
