FR940216-0-00067 FR940216-0-00010 In addition, fuel suppliers opting to augment the complex model through vehicle testing must examine the extent to which emissions are affected when fuels certified with the augmented complex model are mixed with other fuels. The Agency is concerned with two potential problems when different fuels are combined. First, the emission effects of a parameter, as determined from vehicle testing, may not behave linearly as fuels with one level of the parameter are mixed with fuels with different levels of the same parameter. The degree to which this process occurs is referred to in this notice as the parameter's dilution effect. Dilution effects are evident in the complex model proposed in February 1993 and in the model being promulgated today. Second, the emission effects of various fuel parameters may be affected by the level of other fuel parameters. The degree to which this process occurs is referred to in this notice as an interactive effect. If such effects are present (as in the complex model proposed in February 1993 and in the complex model being promulgated today), actual emission performance of the fuel mixture in-use could be worse than emission performance predicted from the complex model augmented by vehicle testing results. Therefore, the testing process must be structured so as to identify dilution and interactive effects. D. Advance Approval of Test Programs Given the number of factors involved in designing a test program, the potential for inappropriate design is high. EPA wishes to avoid submittal of petitions based on test data from poorly designed programs in order to assure that the time and money invested in such programs is well-spent and to assure that all augmentations to the model are based on accurate data from well-designed test programs. Hence EPA will require petitioners to obtain advance approval from the Agency for their proposed vehicle testing programs. EPA will consider petitions to augment the model only if based on the results of approved testing programs. Furthermore, EPA retains the discretion to evaluate other data when evaluating petitions to augment the complex model and when determining the nature, extent, and limitations of the augmentation. This data may include the existing complex model database, additional vehicle testing programs, and other augmentation applications. Petitioners are required to include the following information when submitting a test program plan for approval: the fuel parameter to be evaluated for emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to be used in the test, including model year, model name, VIN number, mileage, emission performance, technology type, and vehicle manufacturer; the methods used to procure and prepare the vehicles for testing; the fuels to be used in the testing program, characterized as defined in Section V.I.5; the pollutants and emission categories to be evaluated; the methods and precautions to be used to ensure that the effects of the parameter in question are independent of the effects of other parameters already included in the complex model; a description of the quality assurance procedures to be used during the test program, and the identity and location of the organization performing the testing. EPA anticipates and encourages petitioners to submit the information listed above in stages beginning with the most general and ending with the most specific in order to streamline the approval process and eliminate wasted effort. EPA will work with petitioners to remedy unsatisfactory aspects of their proposed testing program. These provisions provide the Agency with greater assurance that petitioners would not selectively report test results to the Agency that support their petitions. Petitioners would still be able to ``game'' the testing process by pre-screening vehicles to obtain a test fleet with the desired sensitivity to the proposed parameter. However, such a test fleet would have to be re-tested as part of the formal test program and hence would be subject to the variability inherent in vehicle testing, which would tend to reduce the gaming benefits from pre-screening. EPA believes that the risks and costs associated with re-testing will tend to dissuade petitioners from attempting to manipulate the testing process in this manner. EPA further requires that the results of all approved testing programs be submitted to the Agency, even if the parameter in question proves not to provide an emission benefit. The Agency believes this requirement is necessary to ensure that all available data is at the Agency's disposal when evaluating proposed augmentations to the complex model and when updating the model itself. EPA does not intend to use this provision to limit legitimate, innovative test programs. Rather, EPA is only interested in preventing the creation of artificial fuel parameters that claim to be the source of emission effects which are in reality only normal statistical variability. An example may help clarify the problems that can arise if testing is permitted for such artificial parameters. The level of C10+ aromatics (aromatics whose molecules contain ten or more carbon atoms) influences a fuel's E200, E300, and total aromatics levels. A testing program to identify the effects of C10+ aromatics may indicate that an emission effect from such compounds exists when the effect is actually due to differences in the fuels' E200, E300, and total aromatics levels or to the inherent statistical variability associated with vehicle testing. A petition for approval of a test program to identify the effects of C10+ aromatics would be required to identify specific measures to be taken to isolate the emission effects of C10+ aromatics from those of E200, E300 and total aromatics, all three of which are included in the complex model. In this example, EPA might require that certain test fuels contain identical levels of E200, E300, and total aromatics; that more rigorous statistical tests be used to identify genuine C10+ aromatics effects beyond those already incorporated in the complex model for E200, E300, and total aromatics; that the fuels used in the test program meet more detailed compositional criteria to ensure their representativeness; or that additional vehicles and/or fuels be tested. This provision helps assure that the effects observed in vehicle testing programs are genuine and will occur in-use. E. Exclusive Rights to Augmentation EPA's April 1992 and February 1993 proposals discussed the advantages and disadvantages of providing a system of exclusive rights to model augmentations. EPA has given this matter further consideration, including consideration of comments regarding exclusive rights. The Agency has concluded that the reasons given in its April 1992 proposal for not providing a system of exclusive rights are still valid. Hence the regulations governing augmentation of the complex model through vehicle regulation being promulgated today do not provide for exclusive rights to augmentations. Each augmentation will be available to any refiner desiring to utilize it, and no restrictions are provided under this rulemaking for exclusive rights, other than those granted under other legal code (e.g., patent law). The Agency does not believe adequate authority exists to promulgate exclusive rights provisions under this rulemaking. Furthermore, as discussed in the April 16, 1992 proposal, there are a number of reasons from economic, administrative, and air quality perspectives that make open use of model augmentations a desirable public policy. To allow interested parties to review and comment on a model augmentation, EPA will publish a description of the augmentation and its supporting data and information for public comment prior to approving an augmentation for use. In keeping with the provision of the Act, EPA will take into account any comments received, and act upon any request received for fuel certification through model augmentation within 180 days of such a request being completed.
