Gu Changchun, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee, chaired the session. Cheng Wengui, deputy director of the provincial planning commission, said in his report on Jilin's commodity prices: Regarding Jilin's 1993 price work, aiming at establishing the socialist market economy system, a goal put forward at the 14th party congress, we gave better play to the regulatory role of the lever of prices in economic operation and achieved fairly good results. Major problems in Jilin's 1993 price work were that prices rose by a rather large margin, with the retail price index increasing by 11.3 percent in the province; and that collection of unwarranted fees, fines, and donations still occurred frequently, making the task to check this practice very arduous. In carrying out the price work in 1994, Jilin should focus on the priorities, achieve a good command of the extent, promote the price reform in an active and prudent manner in line with the capacity of the state, enterprises, and the people to bear the strains, gradually establish and improve the means of price regulation and control, and adopt resolute measures to strictly control price rises and stabilize the general price level. In his report on the trial of major and serious cases by the courts in the process of the anticorruption struggle, Yang Qingxiang, president of the provincial higher people's court, said: From January 1993 to February 1994, the province registered 220 major and serious economic cases involving 235 persons and concluded 202 cases of them, which involved 212 persons. Of the concluded cases, 196 involved over 10,000 yuan each; and of the 212 criminals punished, five were cadres at and above the county or section level. Public trial and pronouncement of sentences effectively frightened economic criminals and enhanced the people's determination to oppose corruption and advocate honesty. In his report on the endeavor of Jilin procuratorial organs to investigate and handle major and serious cases in the process of the anticorruption struggle, Li Xiangwu, chief procurator of the provincial people's procuratorate, said: From January 1993 to the first quarter of 1994, procuratorial organs throughout Jilin Province accepted 3,375 economic cases on embezzlement and bribery and placed 2,333 on file for investigation, of which 766 were major and serious cases, and concluded 1,654 cases. By handling these cases, they recovered 113.8 million yuan in economic losses for the state and the collective.
