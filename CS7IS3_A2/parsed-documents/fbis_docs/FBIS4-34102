In nine states and in the federal district -- which all told account for 76.31 percent of the total number of voters -- the preference shown for local gubernatorial candidates has not been translated into preference for the respective presidential candidate. The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is the front-runner in three states (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ceara); the Popular Party [PP] is leading in one state (Minas Gerais) and it is sharing the lead in another (Parana) with PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate Jaime Lerner. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] continues to lead in Rio Grande do Sul; the PMN [National Mobilization Party] in Bahia State; the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] in Pernambuco; and the PPR [Popular Renewal Party] in Santa Catarina. The survey shows that Senator Mario Covas, the PSDB candidate for governor of Sao Paulo State, has the highest voters' preference in the country -- 59 percent -- but only 14 percent of them are confirmed votes. Miguel Arraes (PSB) has obtained 40 percent of the confirmed votes in Pernambuco and emerges as the only candidate who could win the election in the first round. In Sao Paulo, Mario Covas [PSDB] leads with 59 percent; In Santa Catarina, Angela Amin [PPR] leads with 31 percent; In Rio de Janeiro, Marcelo Alencar [PSDB] leads with 30 percent; In Rio Grande do Sul, Antonio Britto [PMDB] leads with 52 percent; In Parana, Alvaro Dias [PP] and Jaime Lerner [PDT] share the lead with 41 percent; In Minas Gerais, Helio Costa [PP] leads with 39 percent; In Ceara, Tasso Jereissati [PSDB] leads with 50 percent; In Bahia, Joao Durval [PMN] leads with 29 percent; In Pernambuco, Miguel Arraes [PSB] leads with 56 percent; and In the federal district, Valmir Campeao leads with 30 percent.
