Sancti Spiritus Province is among the best in the nation in self-sufficiency. The goal of ceasing to be a burden to the national electric power system is being consolidated in Sancti Spiritus Province, when we consider that they already generate 90 percent of the electricity they need. The huge Uruguay [sugar mill] in Jatibonico is outstanding in this accomplishment, which produces 108 percent of its electricity. The (?FNTA) and Ramon Ponciano mills are also self-sufficient. However, the potentialities could be even greater if capabilities were used to greater advantage -- these potential capabilities are a fundamental factor -- and if exploitation of the installed turbogenerators was to be improved. The national average is 20 kilowatt-hours per ton of cane ground, while Sancti Spiritus' nine mills surpass 22. Other elements for self-sufficiency in energy are to be found in the search for alternative measures, such as at the Ramon Ponciano Agroindustrial Complex, where the cane chaff grinder is yielding very good results. This chaff makes decent levels of combustion possible. This has been a report by Rafael Daniel from Sancti Spiritus.
