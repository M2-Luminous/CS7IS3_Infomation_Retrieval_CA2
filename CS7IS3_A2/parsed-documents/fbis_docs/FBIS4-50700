Industrial production was up by 170.9 billion yuan, representing a two percent increase over the average level in the previous three months, said an SSB report released today. The SSB said that the investment structure in April was better than last year, with more money going to the transport industry, but less to machinery and textile industries, luxury villas and hotels. State enterprises completed 55.4 billion yuan of investment in fixed assets, 8 percent more than the average level of the first quarter. Demand and supply in consumer goods remained balanced, the ssb said, noting that the total retail sales reached 117 billion yuan, 24.3 percent more than in April of 1993 or a four percent increase in real terms. The growth of exports outpaced that of imports for the first time since September 1992, with the export volume reaching 8.94 billion U.S. dollars. The state revenue receipts and expenditure increased by 23.5 percent over April of 1993, according to the SSB, indicating the normal operation of the new tax system. The bureau said that enterprises' shortage of funds was eased to some extent and the bank savings increased dramatically despite the fact that a large amount had been diverted to buy state treasury bonds. The momentum of price hikes was blunted. Consumer price in the month was 21.7 percent higher than the same month of last year but the range of increase fell by 0.7 percentage points from March, it said.
