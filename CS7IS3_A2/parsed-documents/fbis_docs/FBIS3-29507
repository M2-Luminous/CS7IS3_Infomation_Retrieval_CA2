The company reported an analysis of the secondary water revealed that pipes in one of the plant's steam-driven generators were damaged, which allowed some of the primary water to leak into the secondary water supply. Officials from the Fukui prefectural governments's nuclear power safety division said that while traces of radioactivity may have escaped into the atmosphere in the steam, its radioactivity monitoring systems in the prefecture showed nothing unusual. The officials declared that there was no effect on the immediate environment. The warning lamp at the No. 1 reactor went off at 6:10 A.M. [2110 GMT 17 February] while the Mihama plant was in full operation. The Mihama reactor is a pressurized water reactor with an output of 340,000 kilowatts. The company began reducing the output of the plant at 7:37 A.M. and 52 minutes later shut down the reactor to examine the cause of the alarm. According to the safety officials, the warning lamp was set off when the secondary water was supposed to return to water after being turned to steam but remained a vapor, causing a vacuum in the return pump. It appears that there has been an increase of about 0.1 over the normal numerical value of the monitor, officials said. The pressurized water reactor generates electricity with turbines driven by secondary water which has been turned into steam by the superheated primary water.
