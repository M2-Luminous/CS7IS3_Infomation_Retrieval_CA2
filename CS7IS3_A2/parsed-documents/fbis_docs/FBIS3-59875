A few days before the criminal aggression against the border control station, they fabricated and began to agitate about the tunnel they dug and its passage through Iraqi territory that Iraqi farmers refused to give up. No one but them, with the bribes they paid so some hirelings and agents content to live on the crumbs from foreigners' tables, and to media mercenaries and Western intelligence--it is they who made up the lies and fabrications about Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the south. The dwarfs, installed by force of arms by the American-Zionist alliance as rulers in the governorate of Kuwait, are playing with fire and have apparently become proficient at committing crimes against the people and the nation, having incited and taken part in committing the crime of the age against Iraq and continuing their futile efforts against the enduring and steadfast nation. We say it frankly: Iraq has honored all of its commitments relating to the Security Council resolutions, despite the suffering and oppression it endured. If it is expected to continue this policy, it is awaiting a positive and honorable stand from the Security Council, not influenced by the dwarfs of the governorate of Kuwait and the other terrified agent rulers in the region, who have sold out their countries and peoples for a pittance. A final word about the al-Sabah: they will be judged at a time when regret will be of no avail. And when that time comes--and it will come, God willing--they will regret the day they were born.
