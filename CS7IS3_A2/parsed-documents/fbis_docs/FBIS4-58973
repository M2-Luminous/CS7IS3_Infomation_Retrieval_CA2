The YSP also expressed its readiness to grant all oil prospecting concessions to U.S. companies. The oral message conveyed by special envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid to a U.S. official said the YSP does not oppose U.S. interests and fully understands the U.S. policy in the region, particularly the two issues of peace with Israel and the siege on Iraq. The YSP told the U.S. Administration it will use its Air Force in its battle with Sanaa and asked the administration not to misinterpret this step because it is part of the secessionist attempt which requires a military battle after which all attempts at reconciliation or pressure on the southerners to abandon their secessionist plan will subside. In the past, the YSP has received large sums of foreign financial aid.
