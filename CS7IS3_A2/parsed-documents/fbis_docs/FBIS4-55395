[Fiala] One often speaks about growth of organized crime in Russia. How strongly is this growth influenced by the political situation there, in your opinion? [Basta] The situation in Russia is different and more serious than it is being presented in our Republic. The traditional democratic division of power in the form of the government-president-parliament triangle does not work there. The government's powers are very small because many of them have been transferred to the parliament and president. The president has so many powers, however, that he is unable to exercise them, and, as a result, these powers are exercised by people who are not even constitutional officials. A great many of them come from the "apparatus" and have behind them the "standard career"--that is, about 20 years in the KGB and its successor organizations. [Fiala] Many of these people have left the security forces, however, to become entrepreneurs, for instance. What role do they plan in organized crime in Russia? Is the situation in our Republic similar in any way? [Basta] Each such operative lived in a certain ghetto and, the more his activity had to do with the security of the state, the more secluded he was in this ghetto. His only contacts were his fellow workers and his clients. When you look at the way these people run their businesses, you find out that they employ colleagues from their branch or their former agents in their firms. When they worked in the past on something pertaining to the protection of the economy, this becomes extremely dangerous. Essentially, they have contacts at the Ministry of Interior, in the KGB successor organizations, and in the underworld. For example, 10 functionaries of the Ministry of Interior who had been involved in organized crime were arrested in Russia in April. Moreover, the Russian secret services have started to officially promote the possibility of acquiring money outside the budget. The budget is one of the most important means of subjecting these services to control. If they are able to generate resources outside the budget, they become uncontrollable. Machinations with various technologies--for example, with radioactive materials--show how they obtain these resources. All research institutes, factories, and installations dealing with those materials are under the KGB's permanent control. Whenever anything gets lost anywhere, it does not happen without the knowledge of its former staffers. They are mostly involved in this [cases of disappearance of radioactive substances]. and I believe they are making use for this purpose of agents with whom they used to cooperate. [Fiala] Are the conditions for organized crime any different in our country and other postcommunist countries than they are in advanced states? [Basta] What makes us different from the West is that, for several decades, we did not live in a state based on the rule of law. Ethics did not exist here, and, instead of the rule of ethics and the law, we had the rule of anxiety. This anxiety is now gone and people behave the way they logically must behave because the state based on the rule of law is not ingrained in them and some believe that everything is permitted. This is the ideal environment for the emergence of organized crime. I am not afraid of organized crime that comes to our country from the West because, compared with what is in store for us, this organized crime is civilized and less dangerous. When someone who used to work for some security service embarks upon the path of organized crime, he has a great many advantages, compared with ordinary criminals. He knows how the police work and what course the investigation will take, and he is more qualified than an ordinary criminal. When people who were always criminals begin to engage in organized crime here, it is far more dangerous than in the West. The local brand [of organized crime] will have communist roots because it will be organized by people who were working in criminal organizations such as the StB [State Security Corps]. The combination of the underworld and people who worked at the Federal Ministry of Interior, for example, is immensely dangerous. Those who used to organize crime legally, under the cover of the communist regime, will now organize it illegally. For this reason, I assess negatively the Interior Ministry's claim that there is no need for laws against organized crime in our country. [Fiala] Wherein lies a solution to the situation, in your opinion? [Basta] We have only one chance--to join the coordinated struggle against organized crime, alongside other states. For this to happen, we must, first and foremost, make our laws compatible with the legislative norms adopted by the European Union [EU]. This concerns, for example, the convention on the laundering of dirty money, which the European Union adopted in 1988. Our Republic has not adopted this convention, and it seems that it will not adopt it, either. The longer we are a laundry for dirty money, the worse our situation in the security sphere and the worse our international position will become. We should build without delay a state based on the rule of law, complete with all the legislation this entails, including a law against organized crime.
