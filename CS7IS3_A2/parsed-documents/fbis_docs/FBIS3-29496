"Sales declines (in such consumer fields as) automobiles, department stores and life insurance policies have slowed recently although uncertainties remain over whether these can be judged as signs of a full-fledged (economic) recovery," Toshiomi Uragami told a regular press meeting. But the chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan stressed, "the yen's appreciation will put a damper" on such movements. "We must take (the yen's rise) calmly instead of falling into confusion," added Uragami, head of an industry which is also Japan's largest institutional investor. The dollar plunged against the yen after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement in so-called framework trade talks at their weekend meeting in Washington. Uragami said, "it's extremely regrettable," but the failure was "inevitable" in the wake of the strong U.S. demand for "numerical targets." He reiterated that numerical targets lead to "managed trade," and are especially inapplicable in the insurance field, as opposed to government procurement. The summit was intended to reach an agreement on three priority fields -- insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. With the U.S. economy in recovery and the Japanese economy remaining weak, "(the bilateral) trade imbalance was apt to swell," Uragami said, adding that the situation is poised to change with Japan's economy about to pick up. He welcomed the government's latest economic measures, including the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, income tax cuts, and the economy-oriented budget for fiscal 1994. Uragami gave a mark of 70 out of 100 to those measures, and said he deducted 30 because more spending would be favorable to "really jump-start" the economy. Referring to plans by nonlife insurers to hold business-level discussions with the U.S. side, Uragami said his association already has foreign-affiliated life insurers among its members, and both informal and formal talks have been conducted. In press remarks Thursday, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, said nonlife insurers intend to hold top-level and other discussions to deepen understanding. Meanwhile, Uragami said the recent ongoing moves by life insurers to lower their rates on insurance policies for the second consecutive year are a decision "ultimately" reflecting the interest gap with market rates. He brushed aside any connection with nonperforming loans at housing and other financial institutions related to life insurers. He said, "there is no plan now" for pension insurance, but it could be considered.
