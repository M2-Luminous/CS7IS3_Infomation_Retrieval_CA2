FR940830-0-00035 FR940830-0-00006 The control requirements that are applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). An analysis of air quality and emissions data for the Libby nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust and residential wood burning ( i.e., area sources). Neither the emissions inventory nor the CMB analysis for Libby revealed any major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors. Consequently, EPA has determined that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude any such sources from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing the effect of such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area. 6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress The PM 10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(l) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date. While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991, for initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas). See 57 FR 13539.
