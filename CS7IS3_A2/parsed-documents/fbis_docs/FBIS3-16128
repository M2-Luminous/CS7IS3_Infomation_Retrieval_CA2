[passage omitted] A chance is at hand, which under no circumstances must be let slip, the Russian minister said, appearing before the press. This is a chance to considerably improve bilateral relations in all areas. [passage omitted] Speaking to journalists in Berlin, Grachev stressed that the fundamental role in the system of European security should belong to the "main peacemaking organization" -- the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not rule out NATO being integrated into the common European process right through to the transformation of that organization into a single structure. [sentence as heard] Time will show what kind of structure that will be, Grachev said, calling for cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic bloc but not for integration into it. After noting that a final decision on the parting ceremony for the allied troops leaving Berlin would be taken at the highest political level, both ministers stressed that it would have to proceed in a fitting manner. We would like to leave Germany as friends, Grachev said, all the more so since good relations have arisen between the Western Group of Forces and the German side. [passage omitted]
