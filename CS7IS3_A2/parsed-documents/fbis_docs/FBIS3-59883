Russians? And in Ari'el of All Places?"] [Text] The skies darkened over Ari'el. The winter came down on the hills all around. But the mayor of Ari'el, MK [member of Knesset] Nahman Ran, is beaming. "There are," he says. "There are foreign investors in Ari'el..." While I wonder who is able already to invest these days in Ari'el, whose fate is shrouded in mist, the energetic Nahman Ron springs the second surprise: "The investors are Russian non-Jews from the Urals..." The truth is, that I didn't believe [him] in the first moment. But MK Nahman Ron does not relent. "Come and get acquainted with them," he says and pulls me to a table in the Knesset dining room. Most of them around the table are Russian speakers. Some of them are immigrants from the former Soviet Union and two of them are representatives of Russian investors from the city of Ekaterinburg, formerly Sverdlovsk, in the Urals. One is Feminov Sergey, the manager of the "Layet" company, which is registered under another name also in the British Virgin Islands. The second one is Kokarkin Viktor. So what? You want to invest in Israel?--I ask without hiding my doubts. "We have already invested," Mr. Feminov cuts in and pulls out an agreement that was signed with the "Tel-Basis" company of Ari'el. How much have you invested? "Half a million dollars," replies Feminov. Micha'el Zeldner, the director-general of "Tel-Basis" company, joins the conversation: "The money has already been deposited in a bank in Israel." Zeldner himself immigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union 10 years ago. By profession he is an engineer, who worked in Ta'as. According to the agreement, a joint company was founded by the Russian investors and the "Tel-Basis" company for producing software for inspecting digital circuits. The software was developed in Ari'el's technological incubator by a group of immigrants from the Commonwealth of Peoples. [sentence as published] At the meeting there was also Naftali Raz, the director-general for technological initiatives in Ari'el. According to him, this is only a first project. In the pipeline there are additional projects, whose development is based on know-how from the former Soviet Union. Like, for example, the manufacture of reinforced plastic pipes. "Half a million dollars is a lot of money in Russia. How did you raise this sum there?" Feminov smiles: "Yes, among us that is a large sum. But there is money. How did we raise it? That is our commercial secret..." Why in Israel of all places and not anywhere else in the world? The investors from the Urals explain: "First, it is a lot easier to speak with people in Israel than elsewhere. Our partners in Israel came from Russia, they know the language, they are acquainted with the conditions. Aside from that, we already worked with some of them in the Urals. In addition to that, Israel has a developed technological infrastructure and trained and superior manpower. Another reason: because of the agreements and the contacts that Israel has with Western Europe and with the U.S.A. it has become an economic bridge between the West and the East, and we want to use it. Finally, there are now chances for peace and stability in the Middle East." We did not want to embarrass Nahman Ron and ask why in Ari'el of all places. But it turned out that the reason is quite simple: in Ari'el there are some of the acquaintances with whom the investors already worked in Russia. "Among us," explains the entrepreneur from the Urals, "the inventions and the developments are getting lost..." MK Nahman Ron holds in his hand a memorandum that was composed two months ago under the somewhat historical heading "The Soviet Connection." The memorandum, which was composed by Tamar Guy and Vladimir Aks, is an analysis of the tremendous potential afforded by exploiting the know-how from R&D in the former Soviet Union. The political and economic chaos in Russia caused, among other things, the collapse of the entire government R&D system. According to a rough estimate, about 4,000 Russian research institutes, which employ about 600,000 scientists, were left without government support. For that reason, there appeared the phenomenon of Russian scientists who continue to work, in theory, in these institutes, and try to sell privately the know-how and the technologies that they developed. In Russia, there are no legal limitations on such activity. In Israel, there operate today 27 "technological incubators," in which are employed hundreds of recent immigrants, who are working on 300 different projects. Tens of projects are already ripe, and they can be shifted to production. Such a technological incubator also operates in Ari'el. Among the new projects that are being offered to investors--in addition to the software for inspecting digital circuits and for manufacturing reinforced plastic pipes: a sophisticated system for exact measurement of heat at temperatures of 2,000 to 3,000 Celsius, a new kind of ink that withstands high temperatures, and which costs half as much as ordinary ink, and more. They are now trying to shift from research and development to business initiatives, and the Russian investors are taking part in this. Of course, while taking advantage of the system of grants and incentives that the laws provide to foreign investors. The mayor of Ari'el, MK Nahman Ron, is now planning to travel to the Urals.
