The Guangzhou underground railway project has been under preparation for a long time. Construction of the 18.45-km No. 1 line began at the end of last year. The whole project is expected to be completed by 1998. It will be the city's biggest ever investment in urban construction. The total investment is estimated at over 10 billion yuan. The No. 1 line requires about $1 billion of investment, half of which is foreign capital. Equipment for the 16 stations is being imported from a number of countries and is worth a total of $440 million. In order to minimize the impact on surface communications and the public's life, an advanced method, quality structure [zhi gou 6347 2845] construction, was adopted. An invitation to tender for the Guangzhou underground was held. Nine companies from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Republic of Korea signed up for the bidding. They included Balfour Beatty of Britain, CMC of Italy, Holtzmann [huo er zi man 7202 1422 5417 2581] of Germany, Maeda Construction Limited of Japan, and Matiquer [ma di ke er 7456 5530 0344 1422] of France. The right to supply 15 mechanical and electrical systems required by the No. 1 line attracted great interest from foreign firms, which engaged one another in competition: Last November, Germany's Siemens took the lead and became the supplier of five equipment systems, including rolling stock and vehicle-related equipment; the United States' (Puller) [pu le si 2528 2867 2448] and (Kelly) [kai li 7030 0448] and Britain's Balfour Beatty and General Electric Company (Hong Kong) Limited became the suppliers of six equipment systems, including emergency alarms, cold-water generating units, overhead contact nets, and fans. Japanese firms beat their rivals to supply two systems. Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Hitachi became suppliers of escalators for the No. 1 line. America's Cobic [kou bi ke 1379 3024 0344] Automatic Ticket Seller & Checker Group became the supplier of automatic ticket vendors. So far, suppliers for 13 of 15 equipment systems have been designated.
