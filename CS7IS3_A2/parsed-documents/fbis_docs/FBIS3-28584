Up to now, many Japanese enterprises have been cautious about large-scale investment in Vietnam, but this year saw the start of full-scale international assistance including that provided by the Japanese Government which forecast that Japan's activities in Vietnam will be accelerated. Vietnam fever among Japanese enterprises has gained increased momentum in recent days. Every day more than 1,000 Japanese visited the JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization] sponsored "Vietnam Exhibit" which was held in Tokyo in the latter part of January. In March, a "Japan Industrial Sample Fair" is scheduled to open in Hanoi, to be participated in by more than 100 Japanese machinery manufacturers. In April, a Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] delegation will visit Ho Chi Minh City to hold the second Japan-Vietnam joint economic conference. Investments by Japanese enterprises started in the late 1980's, centered around such small-scale operations as manufacturing textiles and home electric appliances. Since last year, however, heavy and chemical industries started to set up joint venture plants. Scheduled to be built are a minibus factory by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, cement plants by Nihon Cement Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, and a vinyl chloride plant by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc. is under consideration. In addition to these, electrical and automobile manufacturing companies are placing emphasis on exports to Vietnam by opening offices there for sales and service. The lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will enable Japanese enterprises which build plants in Vietnam to import parts and raw materials from the United States or to export their products to the United States. No restrictions will be imposed in financing funds and settling accounts in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, opportunities are available for Japanese to launch large-scale development of resources and to consolidate social infrastructure by entering joint partnerships with U.S. enterprises equipped with technical knowhow, and abounding with financial resources. The U.S. decision is likely to encourage activities of Japanese enterprises in Vietnam. In the development of petroleum resources, three Japanese firms in partnership with Mobil Corporation of the U.S. have obtained the rights and interests to submarine oil fields. As part of Official Development Assistance [ODA], Japan decided to provide loans in the amount of 52.3 billion yen for eight projects which aim at improving such social infrastructure as power plants and railroads. U.S. enterprises are expected to make bids in international bidding, heightening competition for Japanese enterprises. Also it is likely that Japanese and U.S. firms will make joint bids. Japanese enterprises, taking notice of a Vietnamese population of 70 million and abundant mineral resources, regard Vietnam as the most promising market next to China. However, Vietnam lacked social infrastructure and legal systems, and the U.S. trade embargo imposed obstacles, both material and moral. Morihito Kosuda, Nissho Iwai Corporation's representative in Indochina, set a high value on the U.S. measure "which is highly effective because Japanese businessmen can rid themselves of the psychological restraint to refrain from investing." Nissho Iwai will increase the number of staff members in Vietnam from 11 to 21, and major trading firms plan to follow suit.
