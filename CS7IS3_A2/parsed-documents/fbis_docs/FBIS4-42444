Clinton needs to regain the European people's confidence, shaken by the scandal-mongering attacks on him and disconcerted by his wandering strategy in foreign policy. Berlusconi needs ratification, from the most powerful chief of state and Italy's traditional reference point, of the legitimacy and solidity of his leadership in this new stage of the republic. Both leaders are seeking to enhance their image -- the American leader with a touching re-evocation of D-Day on the European fronts, which 50 years ago marked the definitive supremacy of his country's role in the world; and the Italian leader, with a display of credibility on the international scene, which has hitherto caused him some dismay. The Italian leadership class' attitude to the United States has always suffered from a "complex." The U.S. Administration has often been asked to judge and to interfere in Italian domestic politics by providing support to this or that political solution, or acknowledgment of particular balances, or perhaps by issuing an excommunication to the adversaries of the moment. For years the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the PCI [Italian Communist Party] used the American pretext for their own domestic purposes: the ruling party, in order to lead people to believe that it could not be replaced in the country's leadership because of the impending Communist threat and the PCI, by espousing this theory in order to strengthen associationism as the only possible solution within the overall bloc. In the same way, now we are witnessing the powerful resurgence of the "American complex," despite the fact that the international situation has changed radically since the collapse of the Wall and therefore that America's interest in internal balances in countries where there are communists has declined to virtually nothing. This has been apparent in recent weeks. First, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino went to extraordinary lengths in Washington to explain sophisticated differences between the AN [National Alliance], the MSI [Italian Social Movement], fascists, and postfascists to his opposite numbers, who were mainly interested in what attitude the new government intends to adopt to the Atlantic Alliance and who were basically uninterested in the internal balances of his victorious electoral coalition. Then came the interview on television channels 1 and 5 news, in which Clinton was clumsily asked whether he believed that Italy was moving in a "neofascist" direction -- a question typical of someone suffering from a complex and one that deserved a curt, impartial, and pragmatic reply: "People must be judged on what they do, not by labels." Last, there was Berlusconi's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST, with the succession of statements, denials, and attributions of responsibility for the verdict on fascism, which piled one embarrassment on top of another. So the time has come for the Italian Government to realize once and for all that the anxious requests for internal political legitimization usually made to America, and especially to the Clinton Administration, are neither appropriate nor welcome. The President said so clearly across the Atlantic, and it has been repeated by [National] Security Adviser Anthony Lake and by the authoritative chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton. It has been reaffirmed, with different points of emphasis, by a number of American figures -- Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Lee Iacocca, and Mario Cuomo. The same thing was stated baldly in August 1993 -- "the Washington administration is very little interested in what happens in Italy" - by the intellectual, Edward Luttwak, whose independent opinion on Italy was mistaken for a destabilizing message from the Washington government. Now Clinton will appear on our beautiful Capitoline Hill in Rome and expect to see welcoming crowds. We pay tribute through him to the history of a nation that first liberated us from Nazi-fascism and that then helped to halt Stalinism. Politicians of all persuasions must not try to burden the American President with tasks and responsibilities that he must not, and does not want to, bear. The representatives of the government majority must free themselves of the complex of needing America's approval. And let the representatives of the minority, who describe themselves as neo-Clintonites, spare us their recent zeal as converts, having long been preachers in the churches of anti-Americanism. The close ties between Italy and the United States, under the banner of freedom, are too important to have to be used and abused for petty political purposes.
