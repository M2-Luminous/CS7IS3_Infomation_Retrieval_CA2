According to the association, a maximum 68.71 percent tariff has been superimposed on the regular import tariff (2.5 percent) for Japanese products. It is the first time that Japanese resin has become the target of an antidumping tariff. In the fall of 1992, a complaint was received from a Taiwanese PP manufacturer, Taiwan Polypropylene (Taipei), that it suffered a disadvantage because both Japanese and South Korean manufacturers imported PP at an unreasonably low price, and Taiwan authorities carried out an investigation starting in June 1993. While Japanese manufacturers submitted data, they counterargued in a public hearing that "they are importing product items that cannot be manufactured in Taiwan," but it was not accepted. The subject of the tariff is the PP homopolymer type used mainly for sundries. An antidumping tariff of 5.16 to 68.71 percent for each manufacturer has been imposed according to the difference between domestic shipment price in Japan and export price to Taiwan. The same tariffs will be applied even in cases where manufacturers who have not previously exported to Taiwan newly export. The amount of raw material propylene production is slight in Taiwan, the amount of PP production is about 220,000 tons (1993), and they depend on imports for about the same amount (little over 190,000 tons, 1993). Exports from Japan were 45,000 tons of this (1993). Regarding the effect of the antidumping tariff, the Petrochemical Industry Association explains that, "since necessary items will probably be imported in the future also, it will not be zero. Since the export amount for each individual manufacturer is small, it will not be a problem."
