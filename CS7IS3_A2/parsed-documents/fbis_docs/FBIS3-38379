The Mozambican president came to Lisbon to talk to President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva about the Mozambican peace process. The training of Afonso Dhlakama's bodyguards by Portuguese experts will also be one of the issues on the agenda. More details from Sofia Vieira: [Vieira] Joaquim Chissano is in Lisbon in response to an invitation by President Mario Soares. This is a brief visit, during which he will also talk to the prime minister about the Mozambican peace process. These highest-level meetings follow a meeting at the weekend in Davos, Switzerland, with Portuguese Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso. During this stopover in Lisbon--on his way to Luanda where he will be attending a meeting of African leaders--Chissano stressed the importance of the peace process in his country and reminded that all processes in southern Africa are interlinked. Therefore, contact with his Angolan and South African counterparts is important. This short visit may also be used for clarifying the case related to the training of the Renamo leader's bodyguards. The Mozambican president accused the Portuguese Government of having provided training in Portugal for Afonso Dhlakama's men. According to Chissano, this situation is unacceptable because it goes against the principles contained in the peace agreement. Another issue that will certainly be discussed at the meetings with Soares and Cavaco Silva is related to the training of the future Mozambican Armed Forces. Troop confinement--particularly that of the Frelimo troops--continues to delay the peace process, and the UN Security Council has already warned that it may condemn the Maputo government for its continuing delay in implementing the agreement. [Announcer] Chissano is in Portugal to talk about the Mozambican peace process.
