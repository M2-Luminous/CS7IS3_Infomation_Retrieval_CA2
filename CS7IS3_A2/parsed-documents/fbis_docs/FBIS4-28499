Nuclear safeguards measures, the key point of the issue, will come under intensive discussion by the board members following a separate report by IAEA Director-General Hans Blix. Major board members such as the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, France and Russia are likely to hold a separate meeting Tuesday morning to reaffirm their joint stance on pushing for the board's adoption of a resolution. But the issue will probably take a clearer shape at the next meeting slated for Thursday or Friday, when the member countries adjust their positions after observing developments in the United Nations Security Council and North Korea. The board's discussion will be based on Blix's report pointing out that North Korea's unsupervised refueling of its 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and the damage to later measurement of the discharged fuel rods is a grave violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. The board members are likely to urge North Korea to accept additional IAEA surveillance of two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear waste dumps in Yongbyon. Blix is expected to report that the IAEA cannot ascertain how much plutonium North Korea possesses because of its unsupervised replacement of fuel rods in the reactor and, consequently, is unable to accomplish its purpose of ensuring nuclear safeguards. Blix's report, which has been obtained beforehand, emphasized that North Korean cooperation would allow the IAEA to secure lost information, pointing out that inspection of the undeclared nuclear facilities at Yongbyon was vital. In light of some board members' feeling that the IAEA's strong position on North Korea should be addressed, some form of resolution will likely be brought up at the meeting Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning.
