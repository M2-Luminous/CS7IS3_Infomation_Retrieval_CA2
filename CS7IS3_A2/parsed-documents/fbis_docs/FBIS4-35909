During the audience, the premier has underlined the importance of work at this stage to guarantee the continuity of UNRWA to work and promote its services offered to Palestinian refugees until a permanent and just settlement for their cause is reached. Dr. al-Majali urged the donor countries to increase their donations, provide more support for UNRWA, and increase their contribution in its budget to enable it carry out its role. The prime minister said that all refugees should receive the same treatment in the hosting countries without any discrimination as their cause is one and their basic needs are identical regardless of their location. He urged the UNRWA to provide more services for the Palestinian refugees as Jordan is hosting the biggest number of Palestinian refugees and incurring heavy financial burdens, especially in the fields of health and education.
