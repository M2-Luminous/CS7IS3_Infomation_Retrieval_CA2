At the closing session, Major General Wang Zhicheng, provincial party committee standing committee member and military district commander, delivered a speech in which he spoke of strengthening party leadership over the armed forces and constantly improving the people's militia reserve forces under the new circumstances. The closing session was presided over by Cheng Andong, provincial party committee standing committee member, Xian City CPC Committee secretary, and Xian Military Subarea CPC Committee first secretary. In his speech, Commander Wang Zhicheng stated: It is one of the fine traditions of the CPC and the People's Liberation Army to ensure strong party leadership over armed forces, this being also an important task assigned to the local party committees and people's governments by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Placing the armed forces under party leadership is also a fundamental guarantee of successfully handling new situations and new problems in the course of the people's militia reserve forces development and of building stronger national defense reserve forces under market economic conditions. Commander Wang Zhicheng expressed the hope that leaders at all levels across the province will show concern for and effectively manage armed forces, actively support and build the armed forces, and make important contributions to the armed forces development. In the meantime, he said leading organs and people's armed forces departments at all levels across the province should organize and mobilize people's militia reserve forces personnel to cultivate a spirit of selfless devotion and actively promote two civilizations building in local areas. Also attending yesterday's closing session were provincial and Xian City leaders, city district and county party committees secretaries, county magistrates, and others.
