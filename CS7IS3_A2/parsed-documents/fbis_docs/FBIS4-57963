According to what Villalobos Alva told Dincote agents, currently approximately 50 powerful Peruvian businessmen and industrialists and 200 medium-size merchants are on MRTA's computerized list of those who paid from $100 to $400 per month. Operation Alacran III -- during which Divicote-2 [Dincote 2d Division] agents found MRTA strongholds in Lima, Barranca, and Arequipa -- however, revealed all this information and radically cut the resources MRTA received from Peruvian business people through either blackmail or abductions. In the meantime, MRTA terrorists continue to receive money from drug traffickers in Upper Huallaga, whom they protect when transporting drugs from one place to another or when shipping drugs abroad. According to our sources, Comrade Polo's confessions, and an assessment of the documents and archives the Divicote-2 agents confiscated from MRTA strongholds revealed that the money was distributed as follows: Part of it was deposited in bank accounts in Paris, France, where Hugo Avellaneda Valdez, Comrade Eloy, lives. Avellaneda Valdez, MRTA international coordinator, is in charge of distributing the money together with other MRTA leaders living abroad and with leaders of the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] international wing. Deposits are made by computer via "modems," which were seized at one MRTA stronghold raided by counterterrorist agents. As we reported some days ago, the MIR international wing is financed by contributions from American and European terrorist groups, to whom they send weapons and highly trained subversive elements in military tactics. Another part of the money is withheld by the terrorist leaders in Lima to pay foreign -- Chilean -- terrorists for the crimes committed together with MRTA and for the logistics apparatus that was run by terrorist Ramos Edison Loayza Alferez (arrested). This group used the money to buy or rent houses used as strongholds; to purchase vehicles, weapons -- brought from abroad, computers, faxes, and communications equipment; and to set up clandestine workshops to make military or police uniforms.
