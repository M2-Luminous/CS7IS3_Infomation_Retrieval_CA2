Katalin Horvath reports: [Horvath] According to Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas, people voted for parties rather than personalities. The sweeping victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] was due to this fact and it is the Hungarian Democratic Forum's government policy -- not the MSZP -- which is responsible for this. It is certain that these election results are not politically healthy, Janos Palotas said. This kind of victory is unprecedented even in the western democracies. But the MSZP won in democratic elections and the will of society should be respected. As far as the economic policy programs of the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] are concerned, they are similar to the Republic Party's economic ideas in many points, although they can only be compared when the MSZP and the SZDSZ present their ideas on domestic market regulation, taxes, customs duties, and inflation. Janos Palotas hopes that the MSZP's victory does not cause a political shock and does not make the economy collapse. As far as the Republic Party is concerned, in Janos Palotas's view the party is ready for parliamentary work and it can enter parliament in the next elections. The Republic Party is now preparing for the local government elections.
