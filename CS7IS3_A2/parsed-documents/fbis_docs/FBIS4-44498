This plan on the surface appears to be an economic one, but in reality the background behind this plan has an important political content. And the CPC, because it agreed to this plan, also is considering countermoves. Behind the CPC's attraction of investment also lies a certain political purpose. The plan for Taiwan businesses to invest in Hainan goes under the name of economic cooperation, and is also a political boost for both sides of the straights. . Highlighting Taiwan's Position as a "Sovereign Country" In confronting the swarm of Taiwanese businessmen recently entering the mainland market, Taiwan authorities have consistently been apprehensive that too many Taiwan businesses are being drawn into economic trade activity, and that this constitutes a non-governmental force among the people that would tie down the policies of mainland authorities. For example, with the "three connections" issue [China, Taiwan, commerce, postal communications, and air and sea transport], Taiwan officials recently also have been subjected to every kind of pressure, because Taiwan businesses generally demand direct "open air traffic," and direct "open business dealings," causing the authorities much difficulty in holding fast under the established conditions (the CPC must renounce the use of force against Taiwan and give Taiwan international space), allowing the "guiding principle of unification of the country" to enter into an intermediate state, and permitting the state of the "three connections." What meaning does making Taiwan business investment in the mainland transcend relations between the two sides endow to international investment? This is the major task for Taiwan officials doing all they can to implement the policies of "the two sides as reciprocal political entities" and a "staged two China's." For this reason, Singapore was brought into the picture, and the formation of a joint corporation for the joint development of Hainan's four natural resources of oil, natural gas, minerals, and tourism, has become an important measure. This plan has Taiwan putting up funds, Singapore providing the name and personnel, and in reality is based primarily on putting up the name. In this manner, this natural resource sector among Taiwan's investments in the mainland, which touches on Taiwan's economic lifelines, constitutes an international investment, and avoids the situation where the CPC in the future could nationalize Taiwan's source of oil, even as it achieves a certain political purpose. Taiwan business investment in the mainland has changed to become an international investment, and also highlights Taiwan's position as a sovereign country. This is beneficial to Taiwan's expansion of its international space, to defeat of the CPC's attempts to isolate Taiwan internationally, and to promote the policy of "two China's by stages." Another important factor is that Taiwan and the mainland until now, as a result of the sovereignty issue and failure to agree to an accord on guaranteeing investment, have also not yet agreed to an accord on mutual exemption from rental taxes. But Singapore has separately concluded accords with the mainland and Taiwan on investment guarantees and mutual exemption from rental taxes. With this type of investment in a major projects (the development of oil, natural gas, and mineral natural resources), Taiwan businesses also require an accord on guarantees. Using a Singaporean corporation's name, of course, is quite a good option. CPC Strengthens Its Economic Leverage Over Taiwan From the CPC's point of view, the new CPC document on Taiwan policy of early this year shows that the CPC's three principles towards Taiwan have not yet changed. These three principle are: the one China principle, the principle of not undertaking to abandon the use of force against Taiwan, and in terms of international space, the principle of continuing to restrict Taiwan's activities. The principle of the use of force against Taiwan is only a threat of force, and has no meaning in terms of guiding current actions. What is really guiding present actions internationally is the continuation of the use of the "one China" policy to oppose Taiwan's policy of "two Chinas by stages," and in this way restricting Taiwan's international room to maneuver. Because of changes within Taiwan's internal political situation, there is more and more tendency to have a regular posture vis-a-vis the mainland. Hence, the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Zhaoguo [3769 0340 0948], in an early January public speech, also changed from the past's emphasis on unification as the main task, "placing hope on Taiwan authorities, and also placing hope on the people of Taiwan," to "placing hope on Taiwan authorities, and placing even more hope on the people of Taiwan." It should also be said that the CPC has strengthened its people-to-people "work" vis-a-vis Taiwan, and created a posture of "having the people pressure the authorities." Under the premise of confronting the changes in Taiwan's political situation and the coordination of the three principles, the focal point of the CPC's work on Taiwan has been determined: economically, leverage over Taiwan, in military affairs, pressure on Taiwan, and internationally, restricting Taiwan. Of these, economically gaining leverage over Taiwan means attracting Taiwan businesses to invest in the mainland. This, on the one hand stems from the requirements of the mainland's economic development, and on the other also increases the dependence of Taiwan's economy on the mainland. The mainland is large, while Taiwan is small, and if the mainland lacks investment from Taiwan businesses, then this type of risk can be endured; Taiwan, a short time after it forms an economic dependence on the mainland, will seem to lack the mainland's market, the mainland's resources and raw materials, and it is very possible that Taiwan's authorities could be compelled to submit politically. This is the political meaning of the CPC economically gaining leverage over Taiwan, and Taiwan of course cannot but recognize this, and also cannot but protect itself. Both Sides Use Political Abacus The issue of a guarantee accord for Taiwan investment was raised during last year's April Gu-Wang talks and, at that time, because of the "sovereignty issue," Taiwan was not able to consult on a country-to-country guarantee accord and the issue was shelved. Since this time, the CPC has been more and more eager to "economically gain leverage over Taiwan," and therefore has decided to use an internal legislative approach to seek an investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses. But Taiwan authorities on the contrary have not been as ardent in pursuit of a relevant guarantee accord. For this reason, if the mainland is using a legislative approach, an investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses on the mainland is still limited by the "one country" category of the relationship between the two sides. Taiwan must seek a "two country" or "many country" guarantee, and for this reason has decided to promote the plan calling for Taiwan Singapore cooperation to develop Hainan. When it comes to the plan for Taiwan Singapore cooperation to develop Hainan, CPC officials on the surface are still reticent, and have yet to make known where they stand on this issue. It is quite clear that the CPC is still considering the political content of this plan, while locally, particularly on Hainan, where activity is already taking place, officials are hastily making preparations for large scale investments from Taiwan businesses. In appraising future CPC countermeasures, in terms of large-scale, major projects, the Taiwan Singapore cooperative development plan will channel this sector cooperation into the international investment category. At the same time, a large amount of investment will be channeled based on major projects and the border investment projects of Taiwan businesses; medium and small scale Taiwan business investment projects will be allowed within the category of economic cooperation between the two sides of the straights. Using the former to spur on the latter, the latter then can help to achieve the political goal of "gaining economic leverage over Taiwan."
