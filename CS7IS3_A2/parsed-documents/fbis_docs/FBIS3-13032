'Arafat Is Right, the Massacre was a Conspiracy'" -- first paragraph is LA STAMPA introduction] [Text] Moza Illit -- Matti Peled, the general who does not want the war, lives on the mountain on the road to Tel Aviv. It is a quiet house located among the pine trees; the stone bust of Theodor Herzl on a natural balcony overlooks a green slope. "Sheket, be good," the general told the dog baring its teeth to the visitor. The air is good, there is peace around. Peled is 70; he was a Haganah "terrorist" and one of the generals during the Seven-Day War; but later he became a leader of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Council. He has a nice open face, light eyes, and still talks straight, the way the military do. He went straight to the heart of the problem that is breaking Israel's heart. "'Arafat is right, Goldstein was not an isolated madman. The mosque massacre was the result of a conspiracy." [Candito] Rabin says it was not and insists that Goldstein was the only one to open fire. [Peled] Goldstein opened fire inside the mosque; but others were firing outside at the same moment. There were 250 injured, and a great deal more than the 30 deaths reported by the government. [Candito] Rabin says that "the majority of the families" with dead relatives in the mosque have been questioned. [Peled] What does "the majority" mean? A great many families of Palestinians killed in clashes with the police rush to bury them once they have ascertained their death to avoid a request for an autopsy. Rabin's police counted 30 bodies for autopsy, but perhaps just as many were buried secretly and in a hurry, perhaps even more. [Candito] What about a conspiracy? [Peled] Goldstein did not act alone. That is the first point. Second: The two policemen whose duty it is to check at the entry to the mosque that the settlers' rifles are not loaded arrived more than half an hour late that Friday. And this is very fishy: Goldstein had been saying for almost two years that he wanted to eliminate a lot of Palestinians. Remember also that the soldiers guarding the entrance to the mosque live in Qiryat Arba', in other words, they live in the same village as Goldstein. Finally: Why so much haste to clean away all traces of the massacre from the mosque? [Candito] Is there also complicity on the government's part? [Peled] There is a very suspicious combination of lies. In any event, governmental connivance with the settlers' extremist positions has never been far away: Throughout all these months of reflection, the settlers launched Operation Double, which consisted of doubling the size of the settlements, as if there had never been any accord with the Palestinians. They set up tents and built walls, and the government let them do it. [Candito] What should the government have done? [Peled] Wipe out everything, with force, to show one side and the other, the settlers and the Palestinaians, that it meant business. The government made a mistake: It should have proceeded as quickly as possible and delivered Gaza and Jericho to the Palestinians within six months, and then discuss the rest later. [Candito] Whereas? [Peled] Whereas instead, it harped on about the most insignificant things, wasting time and losing credibility. Just think, when the Israeli delegation turned up to discuss the points that Rabin wanted to clarify, it had a 55-page dossier that made the Palestinians' eyes boggle. Generals in their prime were called upon to discuss methods that a simple customs officer could have resolved. [Candito] There is bad faith then? [Peled] In reality, Rabin wants to be freed from the Oslo accord and then be able to rewrite it as he pleases. You know what the crux of the matter is? It is that the Palestinians see the Oslo accord as the first step in a project leading to the birth of an independent state, while Rabin sees the Oslo signature as a process that will end up with partial independence: That is why he combats even the smallest signs of sovereignty: the flag, a bank, a currency, the stamp on a passport. [Candito] Does he envisage something resembling the old Allon plan. [Peled] Rabin never talks of this plan but he always thinks about it. It is the old project of maintaining all the settlements that are considered to be strategic and to cede the rest of the Territories to a Jordanian-Palestinian management under the sovreignty of King Husayn. And Husayn would not be opposed to the idea either. [Candito] We are going back in time. [Peled] Yes, but in the worst possible way. The truth is that we should have made peace with the Arabs 25 years ago, when we won the Seven-Day War: We were strong, victorious, sure of ourselves, while the Arabs had been beaten; they were weak and divided. At that time I said: Let us cede the West Bank to the Palestinians and give them their independence, then they themselves will be our best protection against all the other Arabs. I remember I always used to quote Churchill: "In victory, magnanimity." Instead we were proud, presumptuous, and convinced that we could keep the whole world at bay, and we did not give a damn. They called me a traitor. Of course the years between 1967 and 1973, that is, until the Yom Kippur war, were happy years. I remember that we used to go on carefree picnics to Ramallah or to Hebron; then Yom Kippur brought us back to reality. [Candito] Is it still too late? [Peled] In politics it is never too late. But of course in making that decision we built a very conservative society that is different from the one we wanted and could have built. Also, the young people are also growing up with this mentality: The three years' military service they have to perform when they turn 18 forces them to be in a hurry, to want to snatch everything immediately: family, university, work. Poor young people, what they miss out on is their youth. Take the university for example: Young people hate books, which they see as a waste of time; all they want is a professor to explain the lesson and their notes are all they need. They have no time to really study, to understand, to meditate. [Candito] Goldstein is the son of this type of society which has no desire to understand. We foreigners see in the collective pyschology of Israel a dramatic ethos of complicity with religious and nationalistic extremism. [Peled] Certainly. The truth is that the extremists are everything that we would have wanted to be: They are the "real Jews" and if we are different it is only because of the cohabitation problem, not because of an ideological choice. They are never condemned on moral or ideological grounds, they simply make unrealistic judgements. [Candito] Can ethical complicity also be political complicity? [Peled] The resolution that Rabin presented condemning the Goldstein case was made to win the votes of the religious parties. He made a choice. He could have had the vote of the Arab representatives, and he would certainly have been closer to the truth of the facts. But he did not want to. [Candito] Where will this lead us? [Peled] Certainly not to a meeting with the Palestinians. [Candito] Is there still hope for peace? [Peled] When I shook 'Arafat's hand 10 years ago everybody called me a traitor and they passed a law in the Knesset. Today Peres and Rabin are shaking hands. Times are changing, we must have the strength to adapt. [Candito] Will Rabin succeed? [Peled] It is difficult to say. I fear that his hopes, his vanity will get the better of him. He is already looking to the 1996 elections, when the prime minister will be elected under the new system. He already sees himself as premier in the year 2000, whereas what we need is a policy of courage, the desperate strength of daring.
