The signing parties were the National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The memorandum was exchanged between Toshihiro Ishii, the director general of the Research and Development Bureau, and Rinsen, the director general of the Advanced Technology Agency of the National Science and Technology Committee of China. According to the cooperation agreement, NASDA will transmit the data collected by the JERS-1 sensors (optical sensors and synthetic-aperture radar) and provide the information required for data reception and processing. In return, CAS will implement the Chinese JERS-1 Remote Sensing Research Program and provide the research results to NASDA. This cooperation will be managed under the Japan-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement.
