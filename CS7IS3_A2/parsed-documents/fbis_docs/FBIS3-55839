Major General N.A. Taylakov, deputy commander of the NWGF, and Major General A.D. Vodopyanov, adjutant [pomoshchnik] to the NWGF commander for work with personnel, went to the scene of the incident. In response to their demand for the release of the facilities seized the chairman of the suburb of Vidzeme ordered the generals' arrest. The Russian generals were handcuffed and put into a car, which was driven off in the direction of the Russian border. NWGF Commander Colonel General L.S. Mayorov informed the Russian defense minister of what had happened. Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev issued instructions to place the Russian troops stationed in Latvia on combat alert and to step up security at facilities and buildings belonging to the NWGF. Likewise, air-assault troop and military transport aviation forces and resources were also placed on alert. The NWGF commander reported the event to Latvian President G. Ulmanis, who expressed bewilderment about what had happened, issued instructions for the arrested parties to be released, and offered his apologies. By 1700 hours the Russian generals and all the occupied facilities had been freed. "The Russian Federation Defense Ministry demands an immediate investigation and the punishment of those responsible. Any violent, unlawful action against Russian servicemen, military units, or facilities belonging to Russian troops will be cut short in the most resolute manner. Responsibility for all possible consequences in this instance lies with the local authorities, who have an obligation to guarantee a normal atmosphere for Russian military units." [Signed] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate [passage omitted] For justice's sake it should be acknowledged that the Latvian official authorities' reaction was immediate. Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis declared that the home guards' actions were illegal and that measures would be taken to bring about the Russian generals' immediate release. By 1700 hours the generals had been freed and conveyed to Riga, and by the end of the day, according to a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, official apologies had been received via the Russian Federation Embassy. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned from Inart Skukinsh [name as transliterated], ITAR-TASS correspondent in Riga, an emergency session of the Latvian National Defense Council chaired by Guntis Ulmanis took place in the evening. It adopted a decree comprising the following five decisions: to examine the essentials of the emergency which had taken place; to relieve Andrejs Rucs, chairman of the Vidzeme district council and deputy chairman of the Riga assembly, of his duties; to conduct official inquiries within the home guard and municipal police of the relevant Vidzeme precinct; to prepare a response for Russia on what happened; and to clarify normative acts regulating the transfer and receipt of Russian Army property. At an emergency session of the Latvian Government held at midnight, Republic Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs evaluated the event as a provocation. Late in the evening Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs spoke on Latvian television. He noted that "armed conflict was a real threat." And in a statement for the press circulated the same evening the Latvian Republic Foreign Ministry made it known that "the Latvian Government will do everything possible to ensure that actions of a provocative nature which may damage Latvia's prestige in the world and complicate the domestic political situation in the republic will not be allowed to happen in the future." The conflict would appear to have been defused, and 11 January talks began between the heads of Russian and Latvian government delegations. However, nobody should be left in any doubt that Russia will take all requisite measures to protect its citizens, all its citizens, but particularly those in military or diplomatic uniform, from this type of encroachment.
