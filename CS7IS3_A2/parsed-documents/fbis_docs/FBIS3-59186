Delivering the keynote address at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said the West must continue to support the emerging democracies of Central, East and southern Europe on their road to free market democracy. "A failure of the reform efforts in these countries, in which some 380 million people live, would bode ill for West Europe directly, but also for the Western world as a whole," Kohl said. "This would raise the danger that, in their disappointment, these people would leave their homes and try their chances in the West -- not only, as till now, in Germany, but also in other West European states," he warned. Success of the reforms, on the other hand, would offer all countries the chance of lasting peace and prosperity, the chancellor said. Kohl said the West must continue to make every effort to build a market economy in these states. Germany had not restricted itself to promises, but assumed a "way over normal" responsibility in this respect, he observed. Of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, Germany had provided by far the greatest financial support for the reform process in Russia, he said -- nearly 90 billion [German] marks [DM] (51.5 billion dollars) for states of the former Soviet Union and about DM37 billion (21.2 billion dollars) for those of Central, East and southern Europe. However, it was clear the West could only provide "help for self-help" and that credits and advice alone could not bring the desired results, Kohl said. "With consistent pursuit of the economic reforms already begun, these countries hold in their own hands the key to a step-by-step resolution of their economic problems. No one can take on this responsibility for them." The German chancellor saw support for the reform process in the former East Bloc countries as part of a four-point approach to counter unemployment, take up new economic challenges, and ensure a stable and secure future for Europe. His first proposal was to "press ahead full speed" with European political and economic integration. Extension of European Community membership to Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden beginning on 1 January 1995, would "further strengthen Europe." A standstill in the integration process, on the other hand, carries the danger of political power rivalry and a throwback to earlier times, he said. Kohl further called for a strengthening of economic links with the dynamic young market economies of Asia, and for further opening up the world trade system. In his speech, the chancellor also warned about the war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying military intervention would require "hundreds of thousands of ground troops" and lead to a great number of casualties, including civilians. He also doubted it could produce a lasting peace. "The truth remains -- there is no ready-made solution to this conflict," he said.
