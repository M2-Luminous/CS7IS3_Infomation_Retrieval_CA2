The sources could not confirm reports that Muhammad Zahlan, who heads the Palestinian side to the negotiations on prison release, was refusing to return to the talks next week in protest against what he saw as the PLO's gradual move towards accepting the Israeli condition. Having made progress in reaching agreements on key security issues and a general framework for a Palestinian police force to deploy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the Sept. 13 autonomy plan, Israel and the PLO are unable to move forward on the prisoner release issue, the sources said. "The Israelis are insisting that no known supporter of the hardline groups which oppose the autonomy agreement will be released," said a source familiar with the negotiations held at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba. "The Palestinians have been resisting this, demanding that a prisoner release come under a general amnesty covering all Palestinian detainees regardless of their affiliation," said the source. Independent Palestinian analysts said PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat appeared to be betting on a mass release of Palestinians from Israeli prisons to dilute opposition to the autonomy accord. "'Arafat's comments on Friday have reaffirmed his approach," said one analyst. He was referring to a statement by the PLO chairman during a visit to the Netherlands that he could not "sign a final agreement without having a guarantee for the release of all prisoners." Red Cross figures indicate that 9,000 Palestinians are held in Israeli jails while PLO officials say the figure is closer to 12,000. Israel puts the number of detainees at 6,000. Israel has agreed in principle to a prisoner release but ruled out a general amnesty. According to PLO sources, more than half of the detainees belong to groups such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestinian (DFLP) and other factions which have vowed to wreck the autonomy agreement. But in line with his strategy to create good will among the Palestinians, Mr. 'Arafat has been demanding that Israel make no discrimination among the prisoners. Sources among the dissident groups also said that despite their fierce opposition to the self-rule accord, Mr. 'Arafat and his aides had been insisting that their members also be released from Israeli detention. "I do not know whether there was any shift in the PLO stand last week in Taba, but our information is that 'Arafat is refusing to accept anything less than a complete prisoner release," said a prominent figure among the dissidents. Meanwhile, an independent Palestinian source said Mr. Zahlan, a member of the Palestine National Council from the Gaza Strip, was refusing to return to the negotiations with Israel. "Mr. Zahlan believes that the PLO is going to accept the Israeli condition against releasing members of groups which do not support the autonomy accord," said the source. "As such, he wants no part of the deal since he would not be able to live with such a compromise." The other sources said they were not aware of a shift in the PLO stand that would prompt such a response from Mr. Zahlan. "The PLO negotiators (in Taba) have not accepted any compromise over prisoner release," said the source. "The issue is very much on the table, and it would be dealt with when the talks resume" in Cairo on Monday.
