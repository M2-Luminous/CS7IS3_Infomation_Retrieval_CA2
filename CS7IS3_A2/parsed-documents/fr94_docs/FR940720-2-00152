Instead, a withdrawal charge (contingent deferred sales charge) will be assessed in some circumstances when the contract value is completely or partially withdrawn prior to the maturity date. Generally, a withdrawal charge only applies to the withdrawal of purchase payments that have been in the Contract less than seven complete years. The withdrawal charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn which is subject to the charge, which percentage declines 6&hyph;6&hyph;5&hyph;5&hyph;4&hyph;3&hyph;2% over the first seven years that a purchase payment has been in the Contract. Withdrawals are allocated first to earnings and then to purchase payments on a first-in-first-out basis. There is no withdrawal charge with respect to withdrawals of investment earnings and certain other free withdrawal amounts. Under no circumstances will the total of all withdrawal charges exceed 6% of total purchase payments made. The withdrawal charge is intended to reimburse First North American for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers, preparation of sales literature and other expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants will rely on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to permit imposition of the withdrawal charge. 7. First North American assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. First North American assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract, which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that his longevity will not have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, First North American guarantees that if the owner dies before the maturity date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by First North American is the risk that the administration fees, which fees cannot be increased, may be insufficient to cover actual expenses. To compensate it for assuming these risks, First North American will deduct from each sub-account a charge each valuation period at an effective annual rate of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for mortality risks and .45% for expense risks. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertaking, First North American will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to First North American and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality and expense risk charges. 3. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon an analysis of publicly available information about selected similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as the method used in charging sales loads, any contractual right to increase charges above current levels and the existence of charges against separate account assets for other than mortality and expense risks. First North American will maintain at its principal office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey made. 4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charge will be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the withdrawal charge. First North American has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable Account and the contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by First North American at its principal office and will be available to the Commission. 5. First North American represents that the Variable Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes, in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act. Conclusion Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
