According to the communique, the possibility has been eliminated to get truthful information and objective analysis of public affairs and policies of opposition parties from radio and television. To support the statement, the communique mentions the elimination of discussion programmes and their turning into monologues. In the AFD's view, another step towards political monopoly is the dismissal of all those who insist on giving objective information to the public. The communique says that, according to press reports, government forces are holding talks with a part of the opposition about appointments at the helm of radio and television. The AFD does not take part in any such talks. The Free Democrats are ready to participate in consultations about the media law but, at these talks, they seek to examine whether the government is willing to guarantee objective and many-sided information, the communique says.
