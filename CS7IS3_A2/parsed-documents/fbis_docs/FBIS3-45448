Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said at a meeting here this morning with Diepgen that Berlin has established good ties with the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Beijing. Efforts should be further made by the two sides to promote such cooperation, he added. Diepgen said Berlin is willing to make full use of its advantages to expand its cooperation with China. The mayor told Qiao that he is scheduled to visit China in April this year. Qiao said the forthcoming visit by Diepgen will give new impetus to the ties between Berlin and the Chinese cities. Germany is China's largest trading partner in Europe. Bilateral trade amounted to 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 and last year it further increased to reach over nine billion U.S. dollars. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last November enabled bilateral ties to enter a new stage. Both Qiao and Diepgen expressed their confidence in the growth of ties between the two countries. Qiao expressed the hope that foreign companies will invest in the infrastructure in China's central and western parts, which are less developed than the coastal areas, so as to facilitate their balanced economic development.
