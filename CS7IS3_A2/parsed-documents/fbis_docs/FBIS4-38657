On the current situation in the region, the Russian diplomat said although the May 12 ceasefire agreement - which is valuable - is being observed, the situation is fragile and insecure. Kazimirov holds that what is needed is clear striving by all parties to the conflict to turn the interval into a firm truce and to settle all outstanding issues exclusively at the negotiating table. The diplomat said that Russia stands for an end to the armed conflict, is making specific proposals, an unbiased intermediary as she is, and is ready to back them up with specific deeds. "We are open for practical cooperation with the aim of settling the conflict with the involvement of the international community, in particular the CIS, the CSCE and the UN," Kazimirov concluded.
