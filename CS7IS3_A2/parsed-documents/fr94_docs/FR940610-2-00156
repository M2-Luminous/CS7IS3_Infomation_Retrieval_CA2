FR940610-2-00156 FR940610-2-00077 [Release No. 34&hyph;34166; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change to Add a Standing Instruction Database to the Institutional Delivery System June 6, 1994. On January 31, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;01) under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 to implement the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced institutional delivery (``ID'') system. 2 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on March 4, 1994. 3 The Commission received three comment letters supporting implementation of the proposal. 4 The Commission also received one comment letter that discussed the structure of current self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') confirmation/acknowledgement rules and a response to the comment letter from DTC. 5 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78(b)(1) (1988). 2 The Commission recently approved the overall concept of the enhanced ID system. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33466 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3139 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;07]. The approval order sets forth a description and discussion of the enhancements being made to the ID system and requires DTC to submit for each principal new feature the finalized rules and procedures in a proposed rule change filing under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33679 (February 24, 1994), 58 FR 59283. 4 Letters from John Zupan, Chairperson, Bank Depository User Group, to Secretary, Commission (April 28, 1994), from George J. Minnig, Chairman, Securities Operations Division, Regulatory & Clearance Committee of the Securities Industry Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 29, 1994), and from Lawrence Morillo, Senior Vice President, Pershing, Division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (May 12, 1994). 5 In its comment letter, Thomson Financial Services (``Thomson'') agreed that DTC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act but also asserts that the current self-regulatory organization rules that require the use of the facilities of a registered securities depository for the confirmation and acknowledgement of all depository eligible transactions and DTC's status as a registered securities depository preclude vendors from competing with DTC in supplying electronic trade confirmation services. Letter from Dr. Keith B. Jarrett, President, Thomson Trading Services, Inc. (A Thomson Financial Services Company), to Jonathan A. [sic] Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 25, 1994) (``Thomson letter''). DTC's response to the Thomson letter disputed the statement that DTC's status as a registered securities depository creates an anticompetitive environment and precludes Thomson from providing electronic trade confirmation services. DTC also stressed that the Commission's review of the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced ID system was not the proper forum for the initial consideration of the propriety of SRO rules that require the use of a registered securities depository for the confirmation and acknowledgment of transactions in depository eligible securities. Letter from Carl H. Urist, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President, DTC, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, (April 15, 1994) (``DTC's response''). The Commission believes that the issues raised by the Thomson letter and DTC's response need not be resolved prior to the approval of the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced ID system. The Commission understands that discussions regarding Thomson's concerns are underway among Thomson, DTC, and the Securities Industry Association.
