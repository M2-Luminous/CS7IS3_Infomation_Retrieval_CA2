Everything else is added to the main dish like an appetizer, a garnish, or a dessert--without this the dinner will seem incomplete, but without the main dish there will not be any dinner at all. As we know, the quality of news services themselves becomes apparent in the difficult and extreme situations--in the ability to respond quickly and to provide viewers with full information on what is taking place at a given place, at a given hour. During the October events last year, it became clear that our news is far from being on a par with generally accepted world standards. This is not so noticeable in everyday life: well, are you sometimes amazed why they begin a program with this event and not that one, why they call something amorphous and indistinct, and why the anchors who make their appearance in a picture are either frivolous and flippant or display an air of messianism and importance? Why do they permit themselves to engage in lyrical digressions and unconvincing personal assessments? The event which took place last week--the release of the "Octobrists" from Lefortovo Prison and its airing on various channels--once again graphically revealed all the flaws of the news services of both the state television companies and the clear advantage of the nonstate NTV company by comparison. I cannot help but acknowledge that both "Vesti" and "Novosti" tried very hard to meet the requirements of the moment and the event--they made their own predictions and assessed what had taken place themselves. However, one thing was required from the news reporters from the beginning: that they show the event promptly and reliably, with the details. The NTV "Segodnya" program at 1900 hours on Saturday evening began with such coverage. Viewers were able to see the crowd, photographed from different points, attending a meeting at the walls of the investigation isolation room, the limousines arriving for those given amnesty, the departure from the casemates of the principal persons concerned in chronological order, and Khasbulatov's arrival at his own house. Two groups of cameramen stood watch at the prison, which made it possible to provide for their maneuverability. We also heard the first remarks from those who had been freed. NTV correspondents clearly, without emotions and personal assessments, showed and reported "What happened? Where? When?" After an hour, "Vesti" rushed on the air. Anchor Tatyana Khudobina appeared on the screen, showing by her attitude that she was personally outraged by what had taken place. She uttered pompous banalities on the subject for several minutes: "We are at a loss to understand Russia." The code of the American corporation NBC News contains the following rule: "We permit those whose experience and sense of responsibility warrants this to go beyond the reports on immediate events of the day and to evaluate them not in the sense of exhorting or imposing their personal opinion, but so that the viewers can receive something more than an official statement of facts. If the desire to engage in dogmatic expatiation arises, it should be suppressed." Alas, all the so-called commentary by T. Khudobina, as well as the commentary by S. Medvedeva in Ostankino's "Novosti," consisted of just such expatiations and exhortations, which were not "suppressed" by anyone in time. But they were very inarticulate on the key event of the day. As an example, "Vesti" showed what was taking place at Lefortovo after 15 minutes, and at the same time, a correspondent not in the picture was duplicating the text of what we saw for ourselves on the screen. It is amusing that "Novosti" on the first channel has added the word "plus" to its name for the news at 2100 hours on Saturday evening. Apparently something similar to "Itogi" had been planned. But it turned out to be "Novosti-Minus"--the program had everything except a normal account of the news. The next day, which required skillful comprehension of what had taken place, one more problem arose: the absence of professional commentator-analysts on state television (Nikolay Svanidze came out with his "Podrobnosti" [Details] on Monday). And once again, only "Itogi" provided a competent analysis of the event, the underlying reason for it and the details, and it named and presented its well-informed sources to the audience. But "Vesti" and "Novosti" only dropped hints with a thoughtful air about certain informed sources--as a rule, those whose simple formulation attests to the lack of informants who are really well-informed and close to the ruling circles. If the reporters for state television cannot obtain information firsthand, this means either that the reporters themselves are lazy and lack prestige or the ruling structures could not care less about them. So they have to make do with hints, innuendos, and personal assumptions. So it turns out to be neither news nor analysis, but some kind of impossible concoction which makes our Western colleagues horrified. Puzzled, they ask: "What are your television reporters doing? Is this really possible?" Everything is possible here. Continuous "Novosti-Minus." At parliamentary sessions devoted to mass media problems, Mikhail Poltoranin, the current head of the Committee on the SMI [Mass Media], once again started speaking about "certain commercial structures" which are trying with all their might to take possession of state television to the detriment of the state and the state system. A week earlier, the custodian of the dying center of television in St. Petersburg, Bella Kurkova, prophesied the same terrible danger. "Is it possible to have independent television, bought by the banks?" she asked, with her distinctive passion. And she answered herself with the same passion: "Never in our lives." Attempts to prove what cannot be proved could be successful when we knew no other television but state television. But now, when viewers have a choice and the opportunity to compare, statements about the mythical threat from commercial television seem strange, at least. The appearance on the air of NTV news programs, which have won a high rating right away, convince us of just the opposite: it is precisely the nonstate news programs which are demonstrating a national approach, a high degree of social responsibility, competence, and professionalism. All arguments such as this are unfounded: "Of course, we can try this ourselves for such money, and buy the news sources." The viewer does not care at all who bought it, from whom, or for how much--just give him the facts, the details. The NTV news programs are providing them--and firsthand.
