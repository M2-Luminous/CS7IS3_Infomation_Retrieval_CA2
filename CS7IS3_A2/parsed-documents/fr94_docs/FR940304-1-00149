FR940304-1-00149 FR940304-1-00014 E. Impact of lessening competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need to save energy. In 1987, 1.9 percent of residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.1 quad) was accounted for on a national basis by mobile home furnaces. In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually decrease air pollution. However, in the case of mobile home furnaces, projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at most of the higher trial standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since it takes more primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a gas furnace. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A. 40 Evaluating standards for electric mobile home furnaces might result in standards requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably resolve this abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for electric mobile home furnaces in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on energy use because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's decision-making as discussed in the conclusion below. 40 See footnote 37. Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ) at level 1. For all classes of mobile home furnaces at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be approximately 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;6, SO 2 emissions are projected to increase by 5,000 tons; 29,000 tons; 54,000 tons; 122,000 tons; and 270,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.18 percent. Standards at levels 1 and 2 would result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be over 1,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard level 2, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be less than 1,000 tons. For standard levels 3&hyph;6, NO 2 emissions are projected to increase by 7,000 tons; 16,000 tons; 34,000 tons; and 87,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions at levels 1 and 2. For either of these levels, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be approximately 1 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 3&hyph;6, CO 2 emissions are increased by 2 million tons; 8 million tons; 15 million tons; and 49 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual increase of these levels is 0.05 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 0.75 million barrels over the years 1996 to 2030. Standard levels 2&hyph;6, are estimated to result in an increase in oil imports of 2.87, 18.14, 35.16, 77.82 and 174.02 million barrels, respectively. 5. Conclusion Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 6 for amended mobile home furnace standards.
