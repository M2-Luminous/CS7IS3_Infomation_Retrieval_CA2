FR940906-2-00059 FR940906-2-00050 Health Resources and Services Administration Cooperative Agreement With the National Rural Health Association AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), PHS, DHHS. ACTION: Notice of Cooperative Agreement Award. SUMMARY: The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces its intent to award funds in FY 1994 to support a cooperative agreement with the National Rural Health Association (NRHA), Kansas City, MO. The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy seeks solutions to the health care problems of rural communities by working with Federal agencies, the States, national associations, foundations and private sector organizations. This award will initiate a number of projects designed to (1) help build State and local infrastructure through a variety of approaches including workshops, conferences, technical assistance, etc. and (2) develop and provide current information to a wide audience through various mechanisms including journals, meetings, publications, etc. During 1995, significant investment will be made in a project that supports the President's Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC) Initiative. Resources, information, and technical assistance will be made available to 3 EZ and 30 EC (rural) to help foster community based solutions to local health care problems. This cooperative agreement will create an ongoing partnership with significant involvement and input from the ORHP into the design, development and implementation of all projects. HRSA plans to award this cooperative agreement to the NRHA because of its unique characteristics, skills and superior qualifications in the area of rural health care. NRHA is the only organization with a broad and diverse membership from rural areas throughout the country, a clear mission to improve the delivery of health services in rural areas, and the staff capability to provide research, educational, leadership, and information support to help rural citizens build, maintain and improve the institutions that can meet their health care needs. Accordingly, HRSA has determined that there is adequate basis for awarding this cooperative agreement to the NRHA without competition. This cooperative agreement is authorized under section 301 of the PHS Act, with funds appropriated under Public Law 103&hyph;112 (HHS Appropriations Act for FY 1994). AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS: Approximately $530,000 will be made available for obligation to support the cooperative agreement for a budget period of one year and a project period of three years beginning in FY 1994. Approximately $350,000 of the total will be allocated to support the EZ/EC Initiative. OTHER AWARD INFORMATION: This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented by 45 CFR Part 100).
