[four-second break in transmission] We repeat: The negotiations between the transportation workers and government have been broken off. We receive this last-minute report from Carlos Torres, chief editor of the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast. Carlos Torres, tell us what has happened. [Torres] The negotiations between the government and the transportation sector were broken off a few hours ago. The members of the National Transportation Commission withdrew, because they are demanding the government conduct the negotiations only with the National Transportation Commission. Labor Minister Francisco Rosales expressed regret over the withdrawal of the National Transportation Commission members and said the government had called the entire National Transportation Council to study the agreements. The Nicaraguan Transportation Chamber president reported that three members of the Transportation Chamber were attacked in the Metro Centro sector this morning and directly accused Roberto Gonzalez, the main leader of the Parrales Vallejos [bus cooperative] of being involved in this event. Gonzalez denied his accusations, however. Francisco Rosales and Emilio Pereira, the labor and finance ministers respectively, have just gone to the second floor of the National Assembly to talk to Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman to try to find a solution to the transportation problem. Roberto Gonzalez and members of the National Transportation Commission have said their demands will be tougher tomorrow.
