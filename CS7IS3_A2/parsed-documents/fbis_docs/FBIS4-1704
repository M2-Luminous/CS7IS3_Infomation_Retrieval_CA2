The report, providing a list of specific figures, pointed out that the U.S. revocation of China's MFN status would reduce China's exports to the United States by 42- 96 percent. For example, China's garment exports to the United States would drop by 50-100 percent. Given the fact that the Chinese commodities are relatively cheap, U.S. consumers would have to spend $14 billion more on buying more expensive substitute commodities each year. The report noted that the Chinese economy has become increasingly open due to its growing volume of export trade. It can be said that "China is much more open than India, Brazil, and even the United States." Since the World Bank is the world's most authoritative financial institution, its views are believed to be objective and pragmatic. China's Stronger International Position Recently, personalities in all parts of the world, including those in the United States, have urged the United States to renew China's MFN status, expressing the hope that the United States and China will strengthen cooperation and will jointly make efforts to safeguard the security of the Asia-Pacific Region. Thanks to its growing economic strength and stronger international position, China is playing a more and more important role in the world. Take, for example, the recent nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, which has now become the focus of international attention. Many countries are hoping that China will play a positive role in defusing this crisis. As a matter of fact, the statement issued by the UN Security Council chairman on 31 March, urging the DPRK to cooperate on the nuclear inspections issue, has embodied China's policy on the issue, this being the result of China's positive efforts in this connection. Wide-Ranging Sino-U.S. Cooperation China and the United States can no doubt broadly cooperate with one another economically and through trade. Reports over the last few days have fully attested to this point. Last Thursday, official U.S. trade representatives declared: U.S. exports to China in 1993 increased by $1.3 billion over the previous year, reaching $8.8 billion. In a national trade appraisal report submitted to the government, they acknowledged that China has already taken "significant steps" in fulfilling "most of its obligations" stipulated in the Sino-U.S. trade agreement. The report noted that China has also increased the transparency of its import examination and approval procedures by a large margin. The day before yesterday, the U.S. Government announced its decision to lift the ban on the U.S. companies exporting computer and telecommunications equipment to China in an effort to obstruct Europe, Japan, and other countries from acquiring a larger share of the China market. The decision will probably help to secure contracts worth tens of billions of U.S. dollars for the United States. Yesterday, it was reported that the Chinese and U.S. scientists have made a new breakthrough in medical research cooperation: They have jointly discovered and developed a liver cancer vaccine, thereby finding a new cure for this "incurable disease." China and the United States can indeed cooperate with each other in many fields. Opposition to Attaching Strings to MFN Status The above facts have demonstrated that those who have tried to engineer the revocation of China's MFN status on the pretext of human rights and thus undermine the normal relations between China and the United States are indeed absurd and ridiculous! It is a pity that such people still exist. In the past, they tried in every way to obstruct China from obtaining MFN status or tried to attach strings to China's MFN status. Seeing their position losing popular support with every passing day, they are now trying to employ new tactics. They have recently proposed so-called sanctions against China's "state-run enterprises," which constitute nothing but a refurbished version of their original position. China has already made it clear that MFN status should be a mutual and unconditional status in bilateral trade and that China will not accept any strings attached to its MFN status. We can rest assured that those who advocate revoking China's MFN status are will find it difficult to fulfill their goal. U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Garten [jia teng 0502 3326] once stated: "As far as I know, no official in the Clinton administration wants to see China's MFN status revoked." There is no denying the fact that contradictions and differences exist between China and the United States. Nevertheless, shared interests make it imperative for the two countries to cooperate and develop relations with one another. The governments of the two countries are duty-bound to make every possible effort to expand cooperation and reduce trouble between the two countries. I hope that events capable of dealing a "disastrous" blow to the economies of the two countries will never take place.
