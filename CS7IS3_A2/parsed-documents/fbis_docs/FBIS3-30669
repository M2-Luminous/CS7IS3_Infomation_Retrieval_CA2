The strengthening of the Czech Republic's international position was also something to be assessed positively, Havel said, pointing to the visits of U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Prague. Also important were the building of a civic society, of the non-profit sector and public institutions, Havel said. Although it was the business of parliament and the government to decide such things, the president's voice ought also to be heard, he said, and the president ought to look to the long-term, which was also true in foreign policy. Relations with neighbouring states had to be redefined and clarified, Havel said. He added that he had many foreign visits awaiting him, including ones to India, Thailand and the Vatican. In addition, he said, he was to make a speech to the European Parliament and perhaps open the plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly. He would also be representing the Czech Republic at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit. Asked if during his second year as president he would avoid conflict with the premier, foreign minister and parliament, or whether he saw such conflicts as a normal part of Czech political life, Havel said that "it is a feature of democracy for there to be a certain tension between individual constitutional institutions." He did not have the feeling that he had serious conflicts with anyone, he said, adding that he identified with the basic line of the Czech Republic's policy and supported it. "Of course, we are all a little different, we have different characters and different tendencies, and here and there might be hitches, but I really do not think this is a subject that the public need worry about. They are our problems," Havel said, adding that what was important for the public was the results, and these were good. Reform of local government will definitely strengthen democracy, but it depends what sort of reform it will be, Havel said. A relatively wide consensus was beginning to appear, and reform had to take note of the real state of things, he said. The electoral system to the authorities of the higher administrative units would be very important, Havel said, adding that "a strictly proportional system, like the one used for parliamentary elections, would not be good." "Instead of one parliament we would have thirteen or fourteen. All the little parliaments would play at being the big one," he said, adding that the regions would only suffer. The Czech Republic ought to gain membership in the European Union and NATO, and to perfect privatisation, he said. "I would be glad if we became a country to which people no longer attached the label of post-communist," he said in conclusion.
