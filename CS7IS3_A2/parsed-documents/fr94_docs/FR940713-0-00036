Summary 1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted streamlined depreciation prescription procedures for the local exchange carriers (``LECs'') regulated under our price cap incentive regulatory plan. 1 These procedures require us to establish ranges for the underlying factors that are used to compute depreciation rates for plant categories. The new procedures generally will permit carriers to make streamlined filings for changes in depreciation rates for these categories, as long as their underlying factors fall within the prescribed ranges. By adopting these streamlined procedures, we hoped to simplify the depreciation process, achieve administrative savings, and allow the LECs greater flexibility 2 in the depreciation process, while remaining consistent with the public interest. 1 Simplification of the Depreciation Prescription Process, Report and Order, 58 FR 58788 (1993) ( Depreciation Simplification Order ). 2 Flexibility allows a LEC to select, within established ranges, the life and salvage factors it uses in prescribed depreciation rates without undergoing the expense of submitting studies to justify its specification of those factors. In addition, under the new procedures, the LECs can change their basic factors annually, as opposed to the current triennial represcription cycle. 2. We further concluded that the streamlined procedures should be implemented as soon as practicable. To that end, we decided to implement the new procedures in two phases. In phase one, we directed the Common Carrier Bureau to identify the accounts most readily adaptable to the range approach and propose ranges for them. In phase two, we will establish ranges for the remaining, more complex accounts, to the extent feasible. 3. On November 8, 1993, we adopted an Order Inviting Comment 3 on 22 plant categories selected by the Bureau for initial implementation of the streamlined procedures. These categories represent two-thirds of the 33 plant categories for which carriers currently submit depreciation studies. In addition, the OIC sought comments on the proposed projection life and future net salvage ranges proposed by the Bureau for these categories. 3 Simplification of the Depreciation Prescription Process, Order Inviting Comments, 58 FR 62083 (1993) ( OIC ). 4. In response to the OIC, the LECs and the United States Telephone Association (USTA) maintained that, to maximize the benefits of the simplification procedures, ranges should be established for all accounts as quickly as possible. They argued that the limited number of accounts for which ranges have been proposed in phase one severely restricts the benefits of streamlining depreciation. On the other hand, MCI, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the state commissions supported the 22 plant categories proposed in the OIC for implementation in phase one of the simplification process. 5. We agree with the commenters that the ranges should be established as soon as possible. However, to begin the simplification process in 1994, it is necessary to implement the streamlined depreciation procedures in two phases and to limit the initial phase to certain categories of plant readily adaptable to the range approach. As we stated in the Depreciation Simplification Order, this schedule will make the most efficient use of our limited resources. To change our plans at this time and to perform the thorough analyses required to establish appropriate ranges for additional plant accounts would delay unnecessarily the use of the new procedures for the depreciation categories identified in the OIC. The commenting parties have presented no new information or arguments that would warrant a change in our plans. 6. Prior to the release of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding, the staff of the Common Carrier Bureau had been considering ways to improve and to streamline the depreciation prescription process. The staff collected a substantial amount of data and performed analyses to determine the difficulty of establishing ranges for various accounts. Based on these analyses, it concluded that the 22 plant categories proposed in the OIC were the categories most adaptable to the range approach, because their life and salvage factors did not vary substantially among the carriers, or over time. The commenting state commissions generally concur with this conclusion. 7. We estimate that instituting these procedures for the 22 categories selected for phase one will reduce the size of a typical depreciation study by 50%. We recognize that a 50% reduction in the size of the study will not necessarily result in a reduction of the workload by 50%. Nevertheless, in our view, the elimination of so much of the detailed analyses currently required in the studies will produce a substantial administrative savings for both the LECs and our staff. Moreover, we plan to propose ranges for additional accounts later this year, and to adopt ranges for these accounts early in 1995. As a result, we expect that the simplification procedures will be in place for all accounts, to the extent feasible, for the 1995 depreciation prescription review process. The ranges we establish in this Second Report and Order will be used to establish depreciation rates for 1994. Considering that ranges for additional accounts will take effect in 1995, we believe that our two-phase plan will allow us to achieve a major improvement in the depreciation prescription process in a very short period of time. 8. In the OIC, we proposed to establish ranges at the account level for sixteen plant accounts and at a rate category level for four additional accounts. The majority of parties commenting on this matter supported our proposal. Pacific Bell further suggested that, where a carrier maintains levels of categorization more detailed than those proposed by the Commission, it should be allowed to use the streamlined procedures, if the ``composite'' factors of its individual rate categories are within the ranges established for the category as a whole. In addition, NYNEX made a special request that the Commission establish a separate rate category with appropriate ranges for interoffice cable plant, because it contends the life characteristics of this plant are significantly different from those of subscriber cables.
