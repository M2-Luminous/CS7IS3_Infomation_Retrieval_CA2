Kanis said Slovakia hoped for better ties with Hungary, between the two countries and also the two ministries. "Our talks covered regional security, bilateral military cooperation, NATO's peace partnership programme, and cooperation between the Visegrad countries," the Slovak minister said. Fur saw the new Slovak foreign policy as promising, citing as a major gesture that Kanis visited Budapest first. Hungarian-Slovak military cooperation has gone well so far, Fur added. Kanis said the new government wished to use the half a year up until the elections to intensify foreign relations. "Nationalism in Central Europe implies isolationism, while integration symbolises openness, and balance in the region," he said.
