Appreciating the conditions set forth by the new Constitution of the Russian Federation as favorable for expanding bilateral ties, the guest said that they could and should be expanded not only between Romania and the Russian Federation, but also between Romania and the states in the federation that are enjoying full freedom to build up their own international economic ties. In the opinion of Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov, the two governments are called to ensure as soon as possible the legal framework for expanding cooperation in the economic, commercial, trade, and scientific fields. In his turn, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu pointed out the similarities of the stages crossed by the two countries on their road towards market economy, saying that to get out of that specific crisis implies strengthening of ties on multiple planes.
