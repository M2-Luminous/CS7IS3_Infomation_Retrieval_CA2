In a candid reference to the growing number of political groups, director of the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, said: "If three or four persons are able to form a political party, the number of parties would be more than the rebellions in the Cultural Revolution. "Then it will be difficult to maintain stability -- and Hong Kong cannot be without stability." Mr Zhou also said he would like a meeting with Governor Chris Patten one day -- to discuss poetry, not politics. Mr Zhou was speaking at a poetry meeting he initiated for reporters in Beijing. He said too many political parties meant too many choices for Hong Kong people. China, he stressed, could never fully adopt the Western style of parliament. "China has her own style for democratic development," he said. "We should not and need not take the Western style for reference because China is a democratic country and we have got wider democracy." Recalling conversations with members of Britain's House of Lords, Mr Zhou said: "If Britain has taken about 400 years to develop this style of Parliament, how can Hong Kong take only a few years to come up to that point?" Mr Zhou also said the greatest wish of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was to stand on Hong Kong soil, even if only for a minute, after it was returned to China in 1997. [passage omitted]
