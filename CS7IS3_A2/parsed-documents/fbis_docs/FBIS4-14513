In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, he said that the Republic is now considering other issues, such as the creation of parliamentary structures, the formation of a new government and the structure of executive power. As for the proposal of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to create a EURASIAN Union, in Luchinsky's opinion, the implementation of this idea is unlikely under present conditions. Luchinsky believes that it infringes upon the independence of the new independent states. "Moldova stands for economic cooperation with all countries and intends to ratify the agreements within the framework of the CIS and the economic union, but we will not create joint political and military structures," Luchinsky said.
