I am convinced that the stabilization of the internal political situation in our country will promote the ratification of the Russian-Georgian agreement in State Duma", Vladimir Chikovani, commander of Georgian Interior Ministry's troops has told today SNARK in his exclusive interview. "I hope very much that consultations and experience exchange with our Russian colleagues will help us to form interior troops and to improve their activity", said General Chikovani. Refuting the statements that Russian troops take part in order providing in criminal regions of Georgia, Vladimir Chikovani declared: "It is out of the question. The Russian guys are not engaged in any incident on Georgian territory, but those connected with the Group of Russian troops in Transcaucasia." Speaking on the Abkhazian problem, Vladimir Chikovani mentioned that for realization of the Geneva Agreement on Abkhazia a necessity may arise to return to the idea of creation joint Georgian-Russian Interior troops. Earlier this idea was discussed last year at the Sochi negotiations, devoted to the Abkhazian conflict's settlement.
