Political parties and trade unions marched side by side. With their own slogans, but together. And this after the pomp and circumstances of the signing of the `Treaty on Social Accord'! This year's May Day demonstration was a demonstration by those who disagree with the extremism of the reforms and the attempt to use the social treaty to legitimize inequality and injustice. "It did not work. Even the law enforcement officers were polite. They realized that fighting and battling with your own people is a horrible exercise and they showed restraint, despite being urged on. Only the country's leaders showed no restraint. Leaders congratulated working people on May Day in almost every state; it was only our leaders -- former members and candidate members of the Politburo -- who `forgot.'" Viktor Anpilov, secretary of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and leader of "Working Russia": "This year's May Day demonstration was a worthy response to the self-righteous `Treaty on Social Accord,' to the spread of capitalism, and to the ransacking of the people. "You will note that we traveled the entire 10-km route peacefully -- if there is no violence from the authorities, then their calls for `accord' are unnecessary. "People are striving for unity -- Communists walked side by side with anarchists. It is a question of rallying the `elite' -- the leaders of political parties and movements." Lyudmila Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Party of Working People: "I have mixed feelings about May Day. On the one hand, it is good that people came with specific slogans. But, on the other hand, fewer people attended than last year. Why? Were they unhappy about the form of protest?"
