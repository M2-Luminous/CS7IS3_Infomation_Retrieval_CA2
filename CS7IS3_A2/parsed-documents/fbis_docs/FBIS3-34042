A ceremony was held on the occasion. It began with Koranic recitations, and then the Opening Chapter of the Koran was read to invoke God's mercy on the souls of the noblest of all creatures, the martyrs of Iraq and the glorious Arab nation. Comrade Taha Yasin Ramadan then delivered a speech. He began by conveying the greetings of comrade leader Saddam Husayn to those who received the medals. He also conveyed his excellency's wishes of continued pride and victory. He added: This honoring ceremony crowns the enormous struggle, high discipline, and true commitment displayed in your performance of holy missions and tasks. Ramadan affirmed that the current phase requires further preparedness, continuous training, and constant vigilance, because the Mother of Battles is still going on, and also because the enemies are using all their cards to undermine the willpower and steadfastness of the noble Iraqis, who thwarted the most massive aggression and defeated the most ferocious embargo enforced by all forces of evil and aggression. Ramadan noted that defending great Iraq by all means is a holy duty to be performed by all honorable Iraqis. He asserted that the reconstruction drive is a chapter in the counteroffensive against the aggressors meant to break the unfair embargo imposed on Iraq by the enemies of Arabism and mankind in defiance of all heavenly and earthly laws and in violation of human rights. The medal-awarding ceremony was attended by several comrade members of the National Command and the head of the National Command General Secretariat Office.
