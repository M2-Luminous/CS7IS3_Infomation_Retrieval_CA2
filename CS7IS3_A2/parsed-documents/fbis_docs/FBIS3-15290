There has been a mixed reaction among the Kuban public to the transfer of the legislative assembly elections from 3 April to 12 June. The kray organization of the "25 April Alliance" party is inclined to see in this some kind of behind-the-scenes games by the Kray Administration and a desire on its part to forestall political opponents in a bid to get its own people into the representative organs of power. The kray organization of the Agrarian Party of Russia expects 12 June to be the final date for the elections, and intends to hold visiting sessions in a number of rayons where it intends to define strategy and tactics for the election campaign. The local organization of the Republican Party believes that the postponement of the elections will open the way for conducting the election campaign without haste. For the elections, the "Republicans" have decided to register as the "Yabloko" sociopolitical association, which, apart from them, will include the Association for the Defense of Consumer Rights, "Memorial," the Association of Repressed Peoples, the "Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and "Solidarity," the Kuban association of shareholders. Mikhail Veligodksiy, chairman of the Republican Party kray organization, believes that the Kray Administration made a mistake by inserting into the statute on elections an amendment on the need to collect 3 percent of signatures in order to nominate a candidate in a district. This is three times as many as under the old version. The task of collecting 2,000-3,000 signatures in today's conditions is highly complex. But the elections are set, and, one way or another, the candidate deputies for the kray legislative assembly must submit voters' signatures in support of them before the electoral commission will register them.
