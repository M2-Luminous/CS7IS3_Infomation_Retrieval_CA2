But this disease is under control because health departments have promptly taken measures. As learned, after floods broke out in western Guangdong, drinking water and the aquatic environment in many parts of these areas were polluted; some flood victims drank unboiled water and ate unclean food, which led to the outbreak of cholera rarely seen in years in these localities. Intestinal infection and diarrhea began to increase. On the day flooding occurred, the Guangdong Provincial Health Department sent medical and epidemic prevention personnel to western Guangdong to guide medical and epidemic prevention work there; it also transported a large amount of disinfectants to these localities to sterilize drinking water and the aquatic environment. As a result, the epidemic was stopped from spreading.
