What is the true nature of this matter? [Song Yong-tae] It is a fact that North Korea increased its military exercises by 50 percent and that it is strengthening air defense exercises around Pyongyang and Yongbyon. Normally at this time, North Korea would be making a fuss in preparing for Kim Il- song's birthday, 15 April. This year, however, rather than concentrating on preparations for Kim Il-song's birthday, it is exerting efforts in the production of military supplies, such as military uniforms. North Korea is increasing domestic tension. No special signs of military provocation have been detected. [Hwang] How do you analyze North Korea's ulterior motives in making violent remarks, such as it will be ready for war? [Song] When analyzing North Korea's intentions in detail, it seems that this kind of remark was made as a warning to the international community, which is showing moves toward sanctions against North Korea. Also, this is to consolidate internal solidarity, and assumes a psychological characteristic to agitate the South from within. In particular, the nuclear card is a very important strategy for its existence. If the effectiveness of the nuclear card is diminished, North Korea has no other alternative. Therefore, it seems that to maintain nuclear suspicion to some degree, North Korea ruptured the South-North dialogue and insincerely accepted inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. [end Song] He emphasized that regardless of rumors of a crisis on the Korean peninsula, "the people are not agitated and are able to maintain their positions, which proves that the people's awareness has increased and that this will act as a strong message to North Korea." [Hwang] Ordinarily, the content of North-South dialogue is not made public. What was the reason for publicizing the content of the recent North-South dialogue? Comments have been made that making public the content of the contact may have amplified the people's uneasiness. [Song] As this is an issue related to the country's security, I felt that it was necessary to let the people know the content of the working-level delegates contact. It is in line with the reasoning that when a fire breaks out, it is necessary to let the people in the surrounding area know that a fire has broken out. It was a decision made by the National Unification Board [NUB] after consulting with related ministries. We also considered the fact that if we did not make public the content of the contact, there was a possibility that North Korea might have made it public to the people first. North Korea has a past record of publicizing the whole content of the sixth working-level contact. [end Song] When asked if making public the content of the contact, which was unprecedented, was used to achieve change in the current situation, such as to overcome the problem of price instability, NUB Vice Minister Song strongly said: "It is unthinkable for the civilian- ruled government to use the reunification issue internally." [passage omitted] [Hwang] What is the future schedule surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue? [Song] It seems that a statement by the president of the UN Security Council [UNSC] or a resolution by the UNSC urging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections will be adopted soon. Then, the scenario will change in accordance with how the situation develops between dialogue and sanctions. If the situation turns to dialogue, dialogue can be carried out between the United States and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North Korea. However, if the situation turns to sanctions, the intensity of the sanctions will be strengthened gradually. [Hwang] If UNSC economic sanctions are applied against North Korea, many people predict that our economy will be considerably weakened because of a sense of uneasiness. Also, because of military tension, it seems that consumption of national power will be great. What is the government's position on economic sanctions against North Korea? [Song] If a resolution is adopted at the UNSC on applying economic sanctions against North Korea, we will agree to it. Of course, we will open our doors for dialogue. We hope that North Korea will respond to dialogue before sanctions are applied. We will carry out diplomatic efforts regarding this matter. [Hwang] People point out that we do not have a sufficient card to lure North Korea into holding North-South dialogue. Therefore, have we even reached the point of requesting the United States to ask North Korea to resume North-South dialogue? [Song] Basically, North Korea views North-South dialogue as a political struggle, not negotiations. Therefore, if it is not of their interest, North Korea will not respond to our efforts, however we try. When considering such an attitude by North Korea, we can say that we have such cards as the Team Spirit exercise, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, and North-South economic cooperation. [Hwang] If North Korea shows change in its attitude now and agrees to receive additional IAEA inspections and shows sincerity in North-South dialogue, will our side once again withdraw our plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise this year? [Song] The condition for suspending the Team Spirit exercise is for North Korea to receive IAEA inspections and realize the exchange of special envoys of the North and South. Since these two conditions were not met, this year's Team Spirit exercise will be carried out. The time for holding the exercise will be decided upon after President Kim Yong-sam returns from his visit to China. [Hwang] While holding a news conference with ROK correspondents in Japan, President Kim said that 'there are unusual signs in Kim Chong-il's succession system.' In this connection, what are signs that can be viewed in North Korea? [Song] When synthesizing information obtained through various channels, there are signs that there are problems in Kim Chong-il's succession system. Because of this, we can sense that there is confusion in North Korea's policy on the nuclear issue and its policy on the South. [passage omitted]
