But the monthly poll, carried out by the BVA Institute for the weekly PARIS-MATCH, also said that 57 percent thought Balladur had the "qualities of a head of state" while 51 percent considered he was "thinking too much about the presidential election," due in May next year. Questioned about the premier's calm, conciliatory style, 58 percent said they thought Balladur "tends to try to put the French to sleep" and 56 percent believed he did not go far enough with his reforms. Fifty-three percent of those polled also believed that Balladur was too ready to "appoint his friends to top jobs in major enterprises." The poll showed a two-point drop in 64-year-old Balladur's overall popularity to 53 percent, but paradoxically, 63 percent were dissatisfied with the way France is being governed, the same figure as a month ago. In another poll released Tuesday, Balladur dipped below 50 percent support in a popularity poll for the first time since he came to power nearly a year ago. A Gallup poll in the weekly EXPRESS said 47 percent of the French approved Balladur's policies, a drop of five points from a month ago. Other polls since the beginning of February have shown falls of nine or 10 points in his popularity. Balladur and the leader of his own Rally for the Republic (RPR) party, Jacques Chirac, are rivals to replace President Francois Mitterrand when he steps down in May 1995.
