The period in question does not end for another two weeks but, because all manner of rush jobs have been consigned to oblivion, the Council of Ministers deemed it necessary to draw conclusions on the basis of preliminary data from the State Committee for Statistics and the Economy Ministry. Especially as the situation in the economy has become more or less predictable. There were no revelations at the government session. The steady economic decline, which manifests itself particularly sharply in machine building and light industry, continues. On the whole we have "slimmed down" by over one-fourth compared with the middle of last year. The production of agricultural produce and electricity and the extraction of fuel and energy raw materials are decreasing, albeit at a slower rate. The volume of mutual nonpayments is increasing, and unemployment is making it presence felt increasingly strongly. The deficit of the still unapproved federal budget is balancing at a critical level. Yet in the government's opinion there are no grounds for panic. The main encouraging conclusion is that the Russian economy -- albeit in a bumbling fashion and battered and bruised -- has entered the market. Certain islets of stabilization, operating on purely market principles, are appearing. Inflation has sharply dropped its pace and become practically controllable. The domestic market is becoming increasingly saturated and balanced. A steadily positive foreign trade turnover has developed. The population's real money incomes increased 11 percent compared with last June, and citizens' savings are growing at a fast rate. On the whole the first -- voucher -- stage of privatization is ending successfully and the program for its second stage, whose implementation will begin as early as 1 July, has been promptly worked out. In this context an upswing in investment activity can be expected. A program to reorganize and bankrupt unprofitable enterprises, which indicates the beginning of practical work to structurally reorganize the economy, has been coordinated with monetary privatization. Many problems regarding the creation of a normative base for reforms have been solved. The latest "economic" edicts of the Russian Federation president have made an important contribution to this. In general, it was noted at the government session, the main preconditions enabling the gradual revival of our economy to begin have been created. The main problem now is maybe that the ministries and departments responsible for economic transformations are late in creating mechanisms for implementing decisions made by the president and government. The Council of Ministers session also discussed progress in implementing the Russian Federation president's edicts on economic reform questions, questions concerning price formation in the energy complex and in transport, and questions concerning the rate of insurance contributions to the social insurance fund, as well as the draft Russian Federation Law "On Making Amendments and Additions to Certain Russian Federation Legislative Acts in Connection with the Adoption of the Russian Federation Law `On the Status of Servicemen.'"
