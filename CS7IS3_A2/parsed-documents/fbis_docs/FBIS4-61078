Interviews were published under the general headline: "Politics withdraws from streets. But it is too early to say that it happened as a result of `St. George Agreement' (eds: the treaty on social accord signed at the St. George's Hall in the Kremlin), although its influence on public life is great". According to the newspaper, even those who do not believe in the sincerity of authorities and would like to have "revolutionary" changes, "are forced to heed the unwillingness of the popular masses to settle their problems in the streets". Here is an opinion expressed by Moscow worker Aleksey Dorokhin: "The leaders of the state should learn to think about people. We support the government both in words and labour. I believe that some forces are deliberately driving a wedge between us. "The main thing now is not to fall for provocations but to continue efficient work". Writing about World Press Freedom Day which was marked on Tuesday, the same newspaper singles out an extract from a message to Russian journalists by UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor, saying: "Democratic changes in Russia would have been impossible without bold and persistent activities of journalists who believe in the freedom of expressing opinion and who work for it". The TRUD newspaper also discusses the above treaty in its commentary under the following headline "Road to Accord Is Not an Easy One, But It Should Be Covered". In the newspaper's opinion, the essence of this agreement is simple: "To put common interests above group, party, deparmental and regional aspirations and to preclude a chance of settling problems in society by force". Putting the question of what attitude should be taken to the treaty, the newspaper says that one should not overestimate it and to sleep on laurels. Taking into account the fact that the treaty was not signed by forces ready for any methods of struggle, TRUD writes that "the danger of violence will loom over society in some or other way". The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about the agreement of the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Independent States on mutual recognition of privileges and guarantees for veterans and invalids of the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945, participants in combat operations in the territory of other states and families of fallen servicemen as well as supplements 1 and 2 to the present agreement. The same newspaper writes how the government settles problems of supplying the Armed Forces with foodstuffs in the conditions when the cattle and poultry populations sharply dropped in the country. Noting that the Army now controls not 67 state farms which remained after the collapse of the Soviet Union but many more, the newspaper notes that these so-called military state farms should become one of guaranteed sources for supplying the Army and the Navy with foodstuffs. The press devotes much space to materials describing how residents of Moscow and other cities marked May Day. The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries its report on this event under the title "Well, we have marked May Day. Quietly. People were not vociferous and did not frown much". The newspaper quotes slogans voiced during a May Day demonstration organised by Moscow trade unions: "Check Industrial Slump. Bridle Inflation. Pay Wages in Time". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA notes that "the holiday passed in a civilised way. There was no 'fistfighting'. There was no references to "the great, omnipotent and united party". Publishing detailed accounts of May Day celebrations, the PRAVDA newspaper stresses words that "columns of Moscow workers peacefully marched at places where blood had been shed last year". The newspaper quotes an opinion by Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Communist Party, that the May Day demonstration became an action by "those who disagrees with reforms of extremism and with an attempt at legalising inequality and injustice with the help of the social treaty". The same newspaper gives a summary of an interview by President Boris Yeltsin to the French FIGARO newspaper. It singles out his words that "the true danger (eds: for Russia) will be the next president", since, Yeltsin said, "I do not see a possible candidate. At least at present". According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, it carries a sensational article entitled "Russia's northern fleet is being killed slowly and with relish". As a result of a shortage of funds appropriated for the fleet's needs, "The number of the fleet's ships and vessels dropped by 45 per cent since 1988". "The utilisation of nuclear-powered submarines provokes special concern", the newspaper stresses.
