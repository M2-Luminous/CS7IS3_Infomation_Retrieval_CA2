If violence and repression force them to seek survival and run for their lives in the midst of ferocious extermination campaigns, the scope and drama of this situation is then unmeasurable. It is an exodus of sorrow and bitterness. It is a march amidst terror and huge uncertainty. It is to walk not knowing where, leaving everything behind, abandoning everything obtained through the hard work of a lifetime. The tales, testimonies, and descriptions of those who one day had to leave propelled by anxiety and harassment will never tell the whole story. They watched their homes burn down. They died along the way or had to start their lives again overwhelmed by sadness and longing for the past. The scope of the people who were displaced by the repression should be carefully considered. One must recall and clearly state the motives behind the displacements, determine the consequences of these displacements, and seek solutions. In Guatemala, the displacement started with the scorched earth strategy and genocide the army carried out in large areas of the country during the 1980's. This policy later became consolidated with the repressive mechanisms of control over the population, the establishment of concentration camps, euphemistically called model towns or development centers. The direct, repressive, and brutal actions against the civilian population is what causes the phenomenon of refugees, people displaced internally, or resistant communities. Altogether or separately, they constitute problems of a truly terrifying scope in terms of quantity and quality. The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] thinks the situation of the displaced population (refugees, people displaced internally, and resistant communities) must be viewed in its overall context, although we must seek specific solutions that at any rate and from any standpoint have a common denominator, and, therefore, comprise in a substantial manner the list of topics in this search for a political solution to the internal armed conflict. It is totally wrong to view it as a simple problem of repatriation of emigrants who wish to return based on their legitimate right. It is also wrong to assess it for unspeakable reasons as an administrative or economic problem. The displaced population in its various forms constitutes a living and visible testimony of a policy of repression and it includes separations, traumas, and an aftermath of historic and national consequences. It is a complex problem to which no solution can be found if it cannot be found within the framework of complete agreements that truly resolve the causes of the problem and that compensate for harm inflicted. Repression and mechanisms of oppression were the causes that degenerated into this situation. They are the direct result of a demented outpouring against insurgents. It would be illusory or unrealistic to attempt to resolve this acute and immense problem with partial agreements or measures. Based on the fact that this reality must be part of the general solution, the list of topics, and agreements between the government and the URNG, the following has to be taken into consideration: 1. The problem of the displaced population has to be considered and discussed as a whole, starting with the conditions and reasons that forced the different displacements and establishing the specific characteristics of its current situation. 2. Foremost, the solution to this problem must take into consideration the opinion and stance of the sectors that were directly hurt by it to study and design their resettlement. 3. Because of its nature, the situation of the displaced population will be partly resolved if the agreements on human rights adopted during the process of negotiation are fully implemented. Their implementation, enforcement, and verification is a sine qua none condition to make the problem viable. [as published] 4. The active participation of the international community through governments, nongovernment organizations, and humanitarian organizations is truly essential and a decisive element to guarantee their certain and effective resettlement, based on the needs of that population. 5. Considering that the essence of the problem of the displaced population has a social and political nature, although it also has very important components of an ethnic and economic nature, it is necessary to draft specific projects that address those aspects. 6. It is necessary to create and guarantee conditions so that the solution to the problem of refugees, people internally displaced, and resistant communities does not turn into a demagogic program indented to fracture the overall negotiation. 7. In the case concerning refugees in Mexican territory, the impartial conditions for their return have to be created. In addition, the elemental principles of voluntariness and specific guarantees of a political, economic, and social nature that they are defending must also be created.
