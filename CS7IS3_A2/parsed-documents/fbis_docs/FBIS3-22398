Ting, who is visiting several wildlife protection groups in Washington D.C., said in a message to BTF headquarters Wednesday [9 March] that there seems to be a consensus among U.S. and CITES officials to "sanction Taiwan first and keep the Chinese mainland on the watch list." Ting said that the international community seems to be losing patience over Taiwan's inability to crack down on alleged illegal trade in rhino horns and tiger bone. Besides, he added, they are also upset with Taipei's failure to keep its promise to submit amendments to its Wildlife Protection Law to the Legislative Yuan for approval by the end of February. The U.S. and CITES have several times turned down requests by non- governmental organizations to impose sanction against Taiwan. But now, Ting said, they believe Taiwan is not serious about improving its wildlife protection record. In related news, Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung of the Council of Agriculture said Wednesday that his council will send the revised Wildlife Protection Law to the legislature March 20.
