The planes strafed the area, terrorizing the population in the areas of Kljuc, Drvar, Petrovac, Krupa-on-the-Una and the Serb municipality of Bihac. Moslem forces over the past 24 hours continuously mounted fierce attacks on this part of the battlefront, Bosnian Serb military sources have said. Serb forces keep all front lines under control and respond to attacks only if necessary and in case when their property and lives of fighters are being threatened. The Bosnian Serb Army has had no casualties in the fighting. Moslem forces have continued regrouping on the Srbobran (formerly Gornji Vakuf) battlefront, in central Bosnia, Serb military sources said. Despite strong Moslem attacks launched on Srbobran from Bugojno during the past week, trucks of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have shipped off, via Srbobran, 600 tonnes of food for Moslems in central Bosnia, the same sources said. Moslem forces have again staged provocations against Serb positions towards Cajnice (south of Mostar) and Konjic (north of Mostar), local Serb military sources said. In western Bosnia-Herzegovina, fierce inter-Moslem clashes continue between loyalists of hardline Moslem leader Alia Izetbegovic and his moderate rival Fikret Abdic, leader of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia.
