FR940926-2-00074 FR940926-2-00066 NASA FAR Supplement (NFS); Availability in Electronic Form AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is announcing the availability of the NASA FAR Supplement in electronic form in order to satisfy requests for an electronic copy of the publication. With appropriate software, users will be able to search the copy using keywords. ADDRESSES: Requests for NFS Version 89.16 should be sent by electronic mail addressed to: dbeck@proc.hq.nasa.gov FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dave Beck (202) 358&hyph;0482. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1), notice is given that NFS Version 89.16, effective September 30, 1994, is available in WordPerfect 5.1. For as long as we can accommodate requests, a copy will be sent by e-mail, without charge, to anyone sending an e-mail request. We are supplying the NFS by e-mail until we place the NFS on Internet. The electronic copy contains the text that is used to produce the loose-leaf version of the NFS. The NFS is also published in 48 CFR Chapter 18. Efforts are made to minimize the differences between the loose-leaf version and 48 CFR Chapter 18. However, neither the electronic copy nor the loose-leaf version are a substitute for the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal Register . The copy supplied by e-mail will be a compressed file of 964 kilobytes along with shareware (pkunzip.exe, 30 kilobytes) for decompressing the file. When the file is ``unzipped'' it becomes 122 WordPerfect 5.1 files (plus a README file) totalling 3 megabytes. Persons using WordPerfect 5.1, or software capable of converting from WordPerfect 5.1, should be able to search the text of the 122 files using keywords. (Caution: When converted to ASCII, some text and most tables are difficult to read. We will try to improve later versions of the NFS to eliminate this problem.) Tom Luedtke, Deputy Associate Administrator for Procurement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23772 Filed 9&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7510&hyph;01&hyph;M
