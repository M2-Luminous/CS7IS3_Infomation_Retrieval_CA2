Necessity for Grain Region Specialization First of all, the principle of comparative benefits requires regional specialization of grain. The tremendous difference between one region and another in the quantity and quality of natural and economic resources forms a basis for regional specialization. Places relatively rich in resources are better suited to the production of the commodities they can produce in abundance. The price of the commodities that they produce by using the resources they have in abundance is lower than in other regions. If the price of a commodity differs between two regions, a profit can be made from the development of regional trade. The specialization that stems from comparative benefit enables a region to produce more goods for shipment; it stimulates investment in and expansion of low cost industries; and it forces high cost industries to cut back production, thereby strengthening regional specialization. Second, the multiple value effect of regional grain specialization is increased. Regional growth that is based on regional specialization and for which trade between regions serves as a vanguard means that shipment of specialized commodities promotes other industrial sectors. Grain area specialization that increases grain shipments can increase demand for commodities such as chemical fertilizer, electric power, farm machinery, agricultural pesticides, plastic sheeting, and diesel fuel. This role is termed a follow-on relationship. The development of grain specialization can also promote the development of grain processing industries. This role is termed a precursor relationship. Third, grain region specialization helps increase the grain labor productivity rate. Grain crops are living plants whose biology must be matched to a proper living environment if they are to produce commodities of good quality in large amounts. Growing grain crops in areas that lend themselves to production and from which economic returns are high enables laborers to accumulate production experience and helps improve specialized skills; thus, regional specialization means relatively high labor productivity rates. Fourth, grain region specialization can impel the peasants toward a market economy. In China, more than 80 percent of the population are peasants who produce grain largely for themselves. The amount of commodity grain produced for consumption by the remaining 20 percent of the population in cities and towns is extremely limited. Grain region specialization demolishes the existing self-sufficiency economy in which "every family grows grain, every household being small but complete." When specialized farming of grain is concentrated in certain areas, the marketing areas that formerly produced grain to supply their own needs withdrawing from grain production, the grain marketing area has to use its own cash crops or industrial goods in exchange for grain from producing areas. Regional specialization of grain increases the amount of demand for commodity grain; it opens rural markets for grain. Even when grain prices fall, sales increase. The multiplied sales may very likely be greater than the former total income. In discussing the regional specialization of grain, we emphasize the comparative advantage principle, but from the standpoint of the growing of grain in specialized areas and peasants obtaining maximum income, the diversification principle is also extremely important. Since grain crops are highly seasonal, three problems unavoidably arise. One is that if nothing is done but farm grain, during the winter season there is no work to do. The work force and the means of production are idle. Second, income distribution is uneven during the year. Third, the time between planting and harvesting of grain crops is inordinately long. The crops may sustain a natural disaster, which damages the peasants' income. Grain farming alone carries very great risks, so objectively diversification is needed. Grain crops and other agricultural sectors are interdependent and promote each other's development. The development of one can spur the development of all the others. Damage to one means all the others are limited. Only diversification can bring the greatest returns. Grain Region Policy In view of the comparative benefit principle, we believe that grain production should be developed in grain producing areas and in needy marketing areas by instituting specialized farming. The state treasury and financial policy should tilt a great deal toward these two areas so that the income peasants receive from the growing of grain in these two areas is no lower than income from other than agriculture. The state should ensure that grain prices in these two areas cover costs plus the average profit rate in society, commodity grain for the whole country being mostly provided by grain producing areas, needy marketing areas striving to attain self-sufficiency. Grain Shipping and Marketing System Decisions Following grain market deregulation, the grain shipping and marketing system functions should be performed entirely by the market, all grain procurement, marketing, shipment, and storage being carried out through the market. Market prices should be set on the basis of market supply and demand. Decisions About Grain Shipping and Marketing System Goals The ultimate goal of the grain shipping and marketing system is to narrow the market price difference between grain producers and consumers, permitting both grain producers and consumers a relatively satisfactory price. Narrowing of the production and marketing price gap requires lowering of shipping and marketing costs first of all. Second, it requires improvement of shipping and marketing efficiency as well as the elimination of monopoly to enable the greatest market contact with traders, but not on too large a scale so that their decisions do not manipulate market prices. Microeconomic Decisions of Shipping and Marketing System Enterprises In the provinces and cities that have already deregulated their grain markets, grain retailing enterprises work through markets: Government subsidies have either been abolished or will be abolished within three years, and the wages of staff members and workers will be uncoupled from state wages within a limited period, thereby making grain retailing enterprises truly responsible for their own profits and losses, for developing themselves, and for limiting themselves. Thus, all enterprises in the shipping and marketing system are facing a market competition environment. They no longer perform the task of stabilizing market prices, this task being borne by the state-financed stabilization system, i.e., it is borne by the State Reserve Bureau system. This is not to say that the two systems have no relations with each other. In a market economy, the two systems are interdependent and mutually restricting. In a true market economy, the profit that shipping and marketing businesses make is the difference in the price paid to the producer and the price paid by the consumer. If they buy grain when prices are low during the grain harvest period, store it, then sell it in a non-harvest period when grain prices have risen, they earn a seasonal price differential. They may also make a profit on arbitraging the grain market price differential in different areas. However, if most grain traders arbitrage, the price differential between one area and another tends to disappear. The difference between the price paid the producer and the price obtained from the consumer includes not only the seasonal price difference, but also the additional price of shipping and processing. This means that each time the grain passes through a shipping or marketing link, an additional price is added to the price paid the producer. 1. Shipping and Marketing System Storage Decisions Grain production is strongly seasonal. If the off season price is very much higher than the harvest season market price, the retailer can buy it at a low price during the harvest season, store it, and sell it at a much higher price during the non-harvest season. Grain dealers have to contend with the market climate. Just how much grain they buy to store has to do with the following year market price forecast as well as whether bank interest rates will rise. It has to do with the four way division of profits among the state, grain dealers, producers, and consumers. 2. Grain Dealing Enterprises Arbitrage Decisions Once the grain market is deregulated, the unevenness of grain supplies in different areas will mean a substantial difference in market prices between one area and another. In a market economy, grain dealers have information showing that grain prices are lower in one market than in another. They buy grain from the low price market and ship it to the high price market where they sell it for a profit. If many market dealers are doing the same thing, the prices in different markets tend to even out, the price differential disappearing. This is because supplies in the low price markets decline causing a rise in prices, while supplies in high price markets rise causing a decline in prices. Thus markets in different places are linked together by their arbitrage decisions of traders with the result that price differences between markets reflect only normal shipping and marketing costs. How Government Intervenes in the Shipping and Marketing System Since shipping and marketing are replete with numerous external factors such as an extreme grain shortage in multiple natural disaster years, market regulation will result in a tremendous rise in grain prices, which consumers will fine hard to bear. Likewise in exceptional bumper harvest years, grain prices will fall tremendously occasioning enormous losses for the peasants. The existence of these external factors means that market laws no longer apply. In addition, highly efficient transportation and marketing systems require highly efficient communications, transportation, and storage facilities. They require that all contract regulations and statutes be carried out, and they require credit for storage and processing, and the provision of market information for all market participants... These can be built only with government investment. Therefore, modernization of the grain shipping and marketing system requires improved efficiency. Government must intervene to the proper extent. The goal of government intervention in the shipping and marketing system is to narrow the difference between the price paid to producers and the price charged consumers. The size of the difference in this price depends on the shipping and marketing system's actual costs and the efficiency of the services that the shipping and marketing system provides the market. If costs are high, government can increase investment to lower shipping and marketing costs. For example, it may lower state-owned granary rent, or it may issue low interest loans to the shipping and marketing system. It may also provide special shipping price subsidies for railroad and highway grain shipments. If shipping and marketing system efficiency is low, the government should improve market competition conditions to conditions for all market participants to enter the market, or provide better information. However, for government intervention to be beneficial, skill in intervention must be emphasized. While enlivening the macroeconomy, a good job of macroeconomic management and coordination must be done.
