Two plants supply the capital, the Mario Fortuni Plant, which operates with French technology, and the so-called Melones plant, which was purchased in the United States at the turn of the century. Jointly, they produce a little bit over 400,000 cubic meters of manufactured gas, a volume far below the current demand. Although other factors are involved, four have essentially caused a production deficit in that industry: a tank out of service due to necessary repairs; lack of number 40 gas because the Nico Lopez Refinery closed down; damage in one of the Mario Fortuni Plant's lines; and a failure in its hydraulic system due to low-quality rubber gaskets. [Begin recording] [Engineer Flora Elena Mesa] Repairs disrupt our service because although we can manufacture gas at night, we need to stop once the storage tanks are full -- we have nowhere else to store the gas -- and the next day we have less gas available to provide this service to the population. Regarding the rubber gaskets problem, some of the gaskets lasted three, six, and even 12 months -- for example the (Clavier) gaskets -- yet these last only a week, 15 days, sometimes hours. This results in constant breakdowns, and we have to stop the plant to solve the problem. This line should have been repaired by now. Its effectiveness has decreased; its efficiency is not the same and it has lower production. The lack of number 40 gas... [pauses] like I said, the Nino Lopez Refinery's catalytic cracking plant, the one that produces liquefied gas, is undergoing general repairs. Consequently, we cannot receive the number 40 gas, which represents an important support in our production. [Unidentified Reporter] When do you think the gas service can be restored? [Mesa] The situation cannot change in the near future because the gasket problem has not been solved, and the gasometer is still out of service. The gas situation will improve next month. [end recording] [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 17 June reports in its "NTV" newscast that the Melones Plant tank, which can store 70,000 cubic meters of manufactured gas, has been repaired so Havana's manufactured gas enterprise will now be able to store more gas to supply the population.]
