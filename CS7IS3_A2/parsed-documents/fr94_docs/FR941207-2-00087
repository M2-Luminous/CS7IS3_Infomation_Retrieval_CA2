FR941207-2-00087 FR941207-2-00062 Regulating the Chicago Match as a ``facility'' of the CHX is consistent with the approach the Commission has followed in similar cases. For example, the NYSE's off-hours trading system is regulated as a facility of the NYSE and not as a separately operated PTS. 61 Indeed, if another exchange wanted to operate a similar system to Chicago Match, it would also be permissible as a facility of that exchange. 61 Because the Chicago Match will be operated as a facility of an exchange, the Commission does not need to resolve issues relating to the regulation of PTSs in order to address the CHX proposal. Second, the Chicago Match adequately displays orders and reports prices. The NYSE, in its comment letters, expressed concern that the Chicago Match transaction prices reported to the Consolidated Tape will be inaccurate due to the use of liquidity fees and credits, and therefore, Chicago Match would violate Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act. Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 provides for the collection and dissemination of ``transaction reports'' that contain, among other things, the price associated with a transaction in a security. The Commission disagrees with the NYSE's concern and instead believes that, as amended, the Chicago Match is consistent with rules regarding the dissemination of quotations and reporting of transactions. The amended Chicago Match rules require the CHX to report one trade for each stock executed in the Chicago Match. This report will include the total number of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity fees paid (or liquidity credits received) for that stock. This approach will provide public disclosure of liquidity fees by including them, albeit in averaged form, in the price reported to the tape. The Commission believes that this method informs market participants of the value of the security including any liquidity fees or credits. The Commission further notes that the block market currently reports in average prices. The Commission feels that this reporting will provide investors with adequate transaction price information in compliance with Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act. 62 62 The CHX has informed the Division that Chicago Match trades can be reported in up to 1/256ths, thereby allowing for greater accuracy in this system of volume weighted trade reporting. In addition, the NYSE asserts that the Commission should not allow the CHX to operate Chicago Match because the bids and offers on the system are hidden from view, thereby violating the Firm Quote Rule. The NYSE asserts that Chicago Match orders that are displayed to other Chicago Match participants are bids and offers under Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 of the Act and, therefore, should be taken into account when the CHX is calculating the best bid and offer that it provides to the CQS. The Commission disagrees with this assertion. While it is true that the Firm Quote Rule requires exchanges to collect bids, offers, quotation sizes and aggregate quotation sizes from ``responsible brokers or dealers,'' as defined in the Act, 63 for each reported security or each security admitted to unlisted trading privileges and make them available to quotation vendors, the Commission does not believe that the provisions of this rule apply to the Chicago Match. First, users of Chicago Match may not always be ``responsible broker-dealers.'' Second, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates bids and offers at specific prices. The execution prices in the Chicago Match, however, are a function of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at a randomly selected time in the future that is unknown to the users at the time the orders are entered. Because the execution price also may vary with the addition of liquidity fees and credits, prices are essentially unspecified. Third, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates dissemination throughout the trading day of bids and offer quotations with respect to reported securities traded on the trading floor. This will not occur with the Chicago Match, were orders can be entered and changed without being subject to execution until a single cross time. 63 Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 defines a ``responsible broker or dealer,'' when used with respect to bids or offers communicated on the floor of an exchange, as ``any member of such exchange who communicates to another member on the floor of such exchange, at the location (or locations) designated by such exchange for trading in a reported security, a bid or offer for such reported security, as either principal or agent.'' The Rule provides, however, that if two or more members of an exchange have communicated on the floor bids or offers at the same price, each member is a ``responsible broker or dealer'' with respect to that bid or offer, subject to the rules of priority and precedence then in effect on the exchange. Furthermore, if a member represents as agent another member's bid or offer, only the member representing the bid or offer on the floor will be considered the ``responsible broker or dealer.''
