This might be an appropriate epitaph to the two-day meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers in Athens, which ended on Saturday [9 April]. Barely a word passed about the old exchange rate mechanism, still less was there any talk about how to restore the narrow fluctuation bands for EU [European Union] currencies -- the cause for which billions of dollars and several political reputations were lost in 1992-93. Plainly, the 15 percent fluctuation bands in operation since the collapse of the ERM last August have won converts. Mr Hans Tietmeyer Bundesbank president, was not alone in defending a system which no longer imposes obligations on the strong to intervene to prop up weaker currencies, but which has still encouraged the old "hard-core" currencies (Benelux and the French franc) to cluster around the D-Mark [German mark]. The "dirty float" has given everyone a respite from the speculators, but it still raises questions about the European Union's road-map to a single currency by the end of the decade. The old plan of moving to European monetary union [EMU] using the discipline of narrow bands to move progressively to fixed exchange rates looks out of date. So what comes next? Athens ducked this question but one senior EU official predicted that ministers would have to take decisions before the end of the year if the earliest date for EMU -- 1997 -- was to remain credible. The most important concerns the interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty, specifically article 109J which covers the criteria on inflation, budget deficits, interest and exchange rates necessary to qualify for EMU. The Treaty says that member states must respect "normal" margins of fluctuation within the ERM for at least two years, and that there must be no devaluations. But what is "normal" now that the ERM exists in name alone? One option is to judge member states' exchange rate performance against the central rate as represented by the ECU; but this would impose a tougher standard than the old 2.25 per cent fluctuation inside the narrow ERM bands, said one official. Meantime, the accent is on each member state taking the necessary corrective action to bring their economies into line. Mr Kenneth Clarke, British chancellor of the exchequer, may be criticised for his tax rises in the UK; but in Greece he was happy to stand alongside Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart, as the fearless pruner of budget deficits. Nor was the mood too sombre in Athens. One senior official noted that for the first time in at least two years there was a widespread feeling that the European economy may be moving decisively into recovery. If there was a fear, it was that the recent upward pressure on U.S. interest rates could cross the Atlantic, dashing hopes that the downward trend on the continent will continue. Despite misleading suggestions from the Greek delegation, this did not translate into an appeal to the Bundesbank to accelerate cuts in short-term rates. "Everybody realises that this is counterproductive," an official said. This realisation suggests a new realism about monetary union. It also underlines the extent to which the central banks are in the driving seat.
