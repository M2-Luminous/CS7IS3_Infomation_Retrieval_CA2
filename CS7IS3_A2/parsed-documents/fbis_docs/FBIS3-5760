An official at the Seoul's Chondo-kyo headquarters said that at the Beijing meeting, the two sides decided to adopt a joint statement at the Seoul ceremonies and to discuss procedural matters at Panmunjom on North Koreans' coming to Seoul. He said, however, that it is not certain if North Koreans could attend the Seoul ceremonies because the Seoul government plans to allow the two sides' Panmunjom contacts to discuss procedural matters only when the exchange of special envoys is realized. The Beijing contact was attended by Pang Chin-kyo, Chondo-kyo chairman, and Hong Chang-hwa, an official of Chondo-kyo College, from Seoul, and Yu Yong-mi, chairman of the North Korean Chondo-kyo Central Committee. Materialization of North Korean delegates' visit to Seoul would depend on the outcome of the South-North contact slated for coming Saturday [12 March] at Panmunjom on the issue of exchanging special envoys, the official said.
