People are wondering: Is this unification legal and to what extent is it expedient? We will not discuss the economic aspects in detail. Experts have already spoken about this issue. You have only to scan such periodicals as the Minsk-published BANKOVSKIY VESTNIK, NATSIONALNAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA, DELO, BELORUSSKAYA DELOVAYA GAZETA, BELORUSKIY RYNOK and the Moscow-published EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, DELOVOY MIR, and KOMERSANT-DAILY to realize just how extremely critical most highly qualified experts in our states are of this issue. Obviously, the unrecoverable losses for each side will considerably exceed the rather dubious advantages. Let us address the legal side of the issue. No one doubts the fact that the agreement -- with additional protocols attached to it -- signed in Moscow two months ago seriously violates the new Constitution of the Republic of Belarus. Only one issue is of importance: What conclusions should be made? We know that the General Prosecutor's Office did not find anything criminal in the work of our governmental delegation. Well, let us assume that, indeed, there was no crime in all this, there are no criminal cases to be investigated, there is no one against whom legal actions could be instituted for having committed intentional crimes. Moreover, [Central Bank Chairman] S. Bahdankevich, one of the members of our delegation, was cautious and officially disagreed with those clauses of the agreement which were obviously unconstitutional. Therefore, there is no agreement as such. In a word, we can only speak about a sort of misunderstanding prompted by the fact that our statesmen have inadequate knowledge of their constitutional duties. We should not wonder why. The times when the Constitution was less valued than the statute of the Communist Party, or even any of the Central Committee's instructions, did not go this far. Having not sorted out this issue from the viewpoint of the constitutional rights of our state, let us look at it from the international-legal viewpoint. [passage omitted] I can only add that international legal experts hold a common opinion that the norms "jus cogens" [internationally recognized laws] are, first of all, the principles recognized by international law. Among those principles, the principle assuming the sovereign equality of all states is of top priority. Therefore, what sovereign equality -- with regard to the recent Belarusian-Russian agreements on financial issues -- can we speak about?! These agreements do not refer to the introduction of a new currency, a new unified ruble, which could be used in circulation as single legal tender with two equal state emblems or without any symbols at all. These agreements do not refer to the setting up of a unified state bank -- with the right to print currency -- with two cochairmen adopting joint decisions. These agreements do not refer to the use of single tariffs to be introduced in accordance with special bilateral pacts. No, the point is quite the contrary: To allow a foreign state to exercise overall control over the national monetary and credit system; to regularly plead for money with foreign national symbols; to allow a foreign state and a foreign legislature to adopt legal norms -- regulating tariffs, customs duties, and so on -- to be observed by us. I do not know, perhaps for Tatarstan -- fighting to be granted the status of privileged autonomy within the Russian Federation -- such an agreement could be a definite step forward, but as for the Republic of Belarus, this, of course, is, no doubt, a step backwards on the path to the so-called "autonomy" which was long ago proposed by Stalin. Evidently, such agreements would not raise the authority of either Belarus or Russia in international arena. It is obvious that -- sooner or later -- such an agreement will be considered illegal "ab initio" with all the subsequent consequences. One more thing: I cannot help but wonder, looking at those people -- war veterans and representatives of the influential directorial corps -- who support the so-called "socialist choice." On what do they count? Do they really count on the quick removal of Russian President B. Yeltsin and Russia's return to the communist past? This hope is quite preposterous. Russia would rather continue along the path of reforms. So, what will directors and chairmen of unprofitable Belarusian kolkhozes and sovkhozes or managers of bankrupt industrial enterprises do then? Let us imagine that they will be able to realize the dream of their life and include independent Belarus into a Russian protectorate or make it a Russian province. Do they believe that Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Shokhin, and Mr. Gerashchenko will hurry to issue them favorable credits? Will these unlucky managers enjoy the same maneuvering room they currently have? Will they be able to pay wages to their workers when Russian miners and militiamen have been living without wages for several months? What fortified fraternity between the Belarusian and Russian peoples could they -- all those who wish to turn Belarusian workers into Russian parasites, such hanger-ons from the viewpoint of a Russian Philistine -- speak about? As for our Belarusian Philistine, he will blame all his mistakes and failures on "Moscow's intrigues." Wonderful prospects! No, we would do better to strive to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with Russia, and other states as well. There are objective conditions for that, we should only make proper use of them.
