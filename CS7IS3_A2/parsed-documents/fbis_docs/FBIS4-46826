They began to comment on it. In reality, the lowest point means there is nowhere deeper (read -- worse!) to go, means that next we should begin to rise. The path is slow and torturous, but it is upward. When will it start? How will it proceed? By what signs can we determine that it has, all the same, begun? How can we scramble out, albeit with bleeding fingers, but without falling back into the abyss? We must get through this low point as quickly as possible, feels Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, Russian minister of economics, or else the danger of falling to the bottom of the pit lies in wait for us. [Shokhin] Even if everyone scrambles for himself, the way upward will become reality only when society comes to realize that we are now completely tied up. There is nobody to throw down a rope from the precipice -- preferential loans -- and to pull up an enterprise that has gone under -- the state has no money. Many captains of industry, however, still believe religiously in a bottomless state pocket. If nothing comes out of it, they explain that as the ill will of the government. Recently, when picketing miners were standing around the White House, I myself held in my hands the travel authorizations issued to the miners. On them -- in black and gray: such-and-such mine face worker is dispatched to Moscow to solve the problem of financing the coal industry. What social harmony we have here -- typical power methods! [Vishnevskaya] All the newspapers have avoided the ZiL story -- also the pressure on the president and the government. How does the government intend to behave in situations like this? After all, these giants constitute thousands of workers, and this means a potential social explosion. [Shokhin] What is happening there could not better reflect what is happening in our industry and the desire of the directorial corps to solve their problems by proven methods. After all, two-thirds of the plant's shares belong to the Mikrodin Company and the Moscow Federal Property Fund. So that they won't picket it? No, the ZiL workers appeal neither to commercial structures nor to the Moscow government. All because both of them, for loans and the more so for financing, need an effective production program and a guarantee of sales. Their plant management cannot provide them. So we are looking for a way to keep ZiL afloat. [Vishnevskaya] Preferential loans without a guarantee of selling what has been produced? [Shokhin] No. Consultation with shareholders, working out a program and a new management system. The Moscow authorities decided to ease the load on ZiL somewhat, after taking on its social infrastructure -- housing, medical institutions. I am now trying to talk the capital's government into turning over to the plant the land on which ZiL stands. With it as security, loans could be attracted. [Vishnevskaya] Mortgage rights, a mortgage -- some time ago we began an active discussion of them, but things went no further than talks. After all, commercial banks could also grant a loan secured by land. [Shokhin] This is one of the most important noninflationary methods of stabilization in key sectors. In this case, state guarantees might be given even to commercial structures investing funds in the development of production. I feel in general that the funds of Russian banks, commercial structures, finance companies, and institutional investors (pension, insurance funds) are a very important source of investment in the Russian economy. It is possible that we may have to guarantee the securities that they issue. But only when their funds go toward projects specified in the program for structural reorganization, agriculture, the defense complex. [Vishnevskaya] Quite recently, when inflation was 20 percent and more a month, it would have been laughable at the least to talk about investments. Just who is going to invest money for several years under such conditions? Right now inflation rates have slowed noticeably. But they are linked to an unprecedented production slump. Have we not got into a vicious circle: In order for production to revive, we need money, and money means a rise in inflation, inflation fattens up additional capital and makes it unprofitable to invest in production? [Shokhin] Some enterprises have already got into one, having picked up commercial loans at a high interest rate, not even thinking about how they will pay back the money. Even though, of course, this rate is clearly too high, and speculative. Low inflation has another advantage, however, which is somehow often forgotten --the possibility of reducing the interest rate. According to the information of the last three months, it could have been reduced to 160 percent without hurting credit-financial institutions. There are limits, of course, for example, the market interest rate. Here the state, having worked out a mechanism which makes it impossible to raise these interest rates, might have its say. [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, there are also loans from international financial institutions -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank. Can we count on them? After all, what we can owe is limited by our potential for paying off the debt. What if we fall into a pit of debt. [Shokhin] You are quite right. Right now we have submitted to the State Duma the draft of a law which limits aid to us to $5.7 billion. In no way can we go over this sum! Otherwise, in the next few years "payment peaks" will arise and we will have to pay back up to half of the new loans to clear off the old ones. This is just about what happened in the last two years, when we were getting interstate loans without giving much thought to how to pay them back. [Vishnevskaya] There are loans and loans, though. "Cheap" loan money can be invested in more profitable projects. Surely? [Shokhin] Not quite. In the first place, because you have to pay more for a large loan. Even so, for 1994-1995 we invested $4.5 billion in the budget (but for 1992-1993 -- only $2.5 billion). There are no more realistic possibilities, except through cutting back expenditures on items other than social ones. And in the second place, precisely because they are cheap, it is not worthwhile, for example, investing them in the development of the oil and gas complex. Commercial, more "expensive" loans can be drawn in there. So through the cheap ones, create a mechanism of social support for the population, and adapt the reforms, if you like, to the social-political situation in the country. [Vishnevskaya] What do you mean? [Shokhin] For example, practically everyone agrees that taxes have become too heavy for enterprises to bear. It would be nice to lower taxes instantly by 10-15 percent. Then, however, a tax gap is inevitable in the time between their reduction, and this means a reduction in budget receipts, and the increase in business activity, for which, strictly speaking, tax reform is needed. There is no way to fill this gap other than with the aid of foreign loans. Having obtained them in the autumn, and this is presumably $4 billion, they could go toward tax reform. Another direction for the use of "cheap" loans might be the development of a social infrastructure, with its transfer to the balance sheet of the enterprises (most of them have not had the money for it for a long time) and to municipal authorities. We could take out a social loan for this. Negotiations are in progress concerning a half-billion dollar loan of this sort. As for investment loans, here we must suppress our appetites a little and pass from loans secured by government guarantees to investments in specific projects, using a mortgage. [Vishnevskaya] This is, though, a basically different form of borrowing money -- not from the government or international financial organizations, but from private investors. [Shokhin] Yes. It is a turning point in interrelations between Russian and foreign entrepreneurs and banks. Private investments are direct investments according to project financing schemes. They will be given for a guarantee, not from the government, but from the creditor himself, for example, with land as security -- as we were talking about in the case of ZiL. [Vishnevskaya] This mechanism presupposes not only the direct collaboration of two partners -- Russian and foreign -- but also the responsibility of the former to the latter? [Shokhin] Yes, if the debt is not repaid, the creditor can sell the security (that same land), convert the rubles made to currency and export it abroad. Neither pickets nor leaflets nor meetings will help here. [Vishnevskaya] But in order for a private investor to invest his money in the Russian economy, he should still have some sort of guarantee. If the Russian government does not pay back the sums invested in a bankrupt enterprise, at least have stable legislation -- customs, tax. In our country it runs up against, to put it mildly, the inconsistency of the decisions made. For example, why, suddenly, since December of last year, have they begun to levy tax on the added value of capital imported into Russia? After all, in September, an edict of the president introduced a moratorium for several years (!) on the force of the normative acts that worsen the conditions for the activity of foreign firms on Russian territory. [Shokhin] This is an example of our legislative instability that worries actual and potential investors so much, an example of what free interpretation can be like. Explanations must be given here. The capital that was imported as part of the charter capital is not taxed. As for the investments, the tax on them immediately disappears, as soon as the equipment is installed, that is, the investments become real. The technical question, it is true, remains: whether to grant a deferment of the VAT payment for the period until the equipment is installed or to exact it right away, and then return the sum paid. There are difficulties involved in both the first and the second case. In the first -- how is the period for which the deferment is granted determined, and in the second -- should the sum paid be indexed on the basis of inflation. In any event, though, if a new tax or duty is introduced, a certain "period of adaptation" to the new regime is necessary. [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, it is not only foreign investors who need legislative and other stability in our country, though, our entrepreneurs need it too. I meet many plant and factory directors. Often they do not ask for privileges, but they want clear-cut, clearly understandable economic legislation, and also -- the removal of the restrictions that fetter their work. [Shokhin] There is no doubt about it, everyone needs stability. Above all, one must adhere precisely to the laws, for example on the customs tariff, which does not specify any individual privileges. Even though, probably, we will not succeed in refusing all privileges, for example, for projects that are already being completed and established as privileged, you do not stop construction because of the last nut. But you do not have to pass these privileges through the budget and show how much we lose on them and monitor their object-oriented use as well. We must also remove thoughtless restrictions, for example, the quota, for that same petroleum complex, on the export of petroleum products. If nonpayments make it impossible for an oil refinery to trade with fellow countrymen, then do not stop production (and so on, meanwhile, along the chain, right down to the oil extractors, who are faced with the problem of whether to kill the wells!). Let them increase the export. [Vishnevskaya] One hears all the time that there is not enough money. We think about how to attract foreign loans and investments and how to interest our entrepreneurs and financiers in investing funds in the development of the economy. Again, however, the draft of the state budget has been made up with a deficit, and moreover: The State Duma is proposing that this deficit be increased. After all, our country has its debtors. Or have these debts already been relegated to the ranks of the hopeless? [Shokhin] There are, of course, hopeless ones. One must remember that our debtors are the least developed countries. The governments of some of them, on this basis, appealing to the feelings of the Russian leaders, are asking that their debts be remitted. To excuse the debts does not, however, mean forgetting about them. In this case each debtor requires his own approach. Libya, for example, is well enough off to pay us, for example, for the supply of oil. For this, however, the UN sanctions should be removed. Work is proceeding in this direction. In another direction, though -- it is not proceeding. I mean that many countries are already concluding pre-contractual protocols of intent with Libya. There is a danger that, when the sanctions are rescinded, we will not find ourselves first in this queue. [Vishnevskaya] It is difficult even to get what is ours. What other methods can be used to recover our debts? [Shokhin] This can be done, for example, through supply of traditional export goods. [Vishnevskaya] Like China, which offers its feather-beds and track shoes in payment for the newest, most modern technological equipment? [Shokhin] This is not, of course, the most profitable variant for us. There are others, though. For example, converting debts into property on the territory of the debtor-state. [Vishnevskaya] But can we negotiate a debt to some other state whose economic level permits it to expect repayment? [Shokhin] Yes. The only question is, in the first place, how much it will pay us, buying this debt, and in the second place, must we ourselves in this way leave our debtor's country. Perhaps we could work out a long-term scheme for repaying the debt, but remain in the country. The important thing today is not getting the money, even though we need it very much, but being included in economic and political dialogue as a member with equal rights.
