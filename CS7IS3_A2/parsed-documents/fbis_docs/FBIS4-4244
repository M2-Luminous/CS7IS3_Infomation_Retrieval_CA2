He added that a U.S. company has been given permission to open a hard-currency insurance business in China. Addressing the annual conference on overseas insurance business, which opened here this week, the deputy general manager of the picc's international department said his company made 732 million U.S. dollars-worth of premiums last year, an increase of 29.8 percent over the previous year, and paid out 356 million U.S. dollars-worth in compensation, accounting for 48.76 percent of the total premiums. He told the conference that the PICC's overseas business now ranges from general insurance to some high-risk areas such as aeronautics, oil exploitation and construction of nuclear power stations. He said all the fields available in the international market are covered by the PICC, among which property insurance for foreign-funded enterprises and insurance for short-term credit and the buyer's contract responsibility are the most popular. So far, the PICC has established two regional companies in Hong Kong and Europe, respectively, and over 70 branches and offices worldwide.
