The Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 state that the U.S. presence in Panama must end by 31 December 1999. Mulino recalled that President Guillermo Endara's administration "has always said that there is no possibility of renegotiating the presence of U.S. bases in Panama after the year 2000." However, some groups in the country are suggesting the renegotiation of these treaties to avoid the negative impact that this withdrawal will have on the country's economy. "As a Panamanian I have seen and studied in depth what the return of these infrastructures will represent for our country, socially as well as economically, and I believe it would be a mistake to suggest they remain here," Mulino said. The Panamanian diplomat added that "we have to start working, as of yesterday, to efficiently and actively incorporate all those assets that the reverted areas represent to our national development." Mulino said he believes Panama will benefit more from developing those areas in an organized way than by having them inhabited by foreign soldiers. The areas along the banks of the Panama Canal are worth approximately $30 billion, and, according to economists, they must be used to create jobs through foreign investment. Mulino said that "as a citizen, this is the view that I must support." However, Mulino added that it will be up to President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares and Foreign Minister-elect Gabriel Lewis Galindo to deal with this matter. Mulino added that since this is a matter that is of interest to all, it must be handled as established in the Constitution.
