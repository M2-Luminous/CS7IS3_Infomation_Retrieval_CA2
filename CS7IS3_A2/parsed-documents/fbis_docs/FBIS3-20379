In a written statement yesterday, Rasid recalled Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis' effort to blame the Turkish Cypriot side for the deadlock in the talks on the confidence-building measures and said that Mikhailidhis' effort was aimed at distorting well-known facts. Rasid stressed that the introduction of new elements in the talks -- elements aimed at satisfying the Greek Cypriot side -- will create a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said: "As the experts who follow the talks on the confidence-building measures on Maras [Varosha] and the Nicosia International Airport have seen, the main reasons for the present deadlock are the Greek Cypriot side's pressure and the attempt to deviate from the original package of confidence-building measures and add new elements to it in order to satisfy Glavkos Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side."
