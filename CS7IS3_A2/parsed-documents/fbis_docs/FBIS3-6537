Kono, assuming the top post of the party late last July, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that the governing coalition parties have had clear-cut differences over the interpretation of the Constitution and other basic national policies. Kono said the LDP will not be able to help the governing coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with their simmering political rift. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) and new party Sakigake [Harbinger], two of seven coalition parties, have kept their basic stance of respecting the war-renounced Constitution and have been hesitant for Japan to participate in the U.N. peacekeeping forces. But Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, two other coalition parties, envision that Japan should play a more positive role in world politics by shaking itself off from the role of an economic player in politics. The rift among the four main coalition parties has seemingly deepened since Hosokawa failed to remove chief government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura from the post in an attempt to reshuffle his cabinet early this month, political sources said. Kono turned his topic into a loan dispute involving Hosokawa and urged the prime minister to clear an allegation over a receipt of political donation from the scandal-tainted truck parcel delivery company. Kono, the first head since the LDP lost the 38-year grip on power in August, said the prime minister should clear the suspicion as he has spearheaded political reform resulting from years of money scandals involving LDP politicians. The LDP leader also said it is clear that Hosokawa's remarks in Diet deliberation over the allegation contains a contradiction of whether he owed 100 million yen to now-defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. which he borrowed to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in central Tokyo. Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair the home and buy the condominium, and fully repaid the money by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor. He served two four-year terms as governor from 1983 until February 1991. Hosokawa has rejected an opposition party demand to submit more documents related to his loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. The LDP, which set the submission of additional documents from Hosokawa as a condition to start deliberations of the fiscal 1994 state budget in the House of Representatives budget committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet sources said. "It will be unfortunate for the Japanese people if there is a further delay in Diet deliberations on the state budget," Kono said. Concerning the possible return to power by the LDP, Kono said his party will present its clear-cut policies to the Japanese people to regain power from the coalition government in an upcoming general election.
