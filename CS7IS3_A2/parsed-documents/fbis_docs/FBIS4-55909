[Kolodko] I am determined to shape the macroeconomic proportions in such a way as to reach the level of single-digit inflation in 1997. Thus, if in 1997 the yearly inflation indicator were 9.6 percent, at the end of the same year inflation would be even lower. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Is the starting point of your forecasts the same as in this year's budget? [Kolodko] It is practically the same. This year's budget envisioned a 23.1-percent price increase from December 1993 to December 1994; at the moment we are estimating this year's inflation to be 23.6 percent. As far as the path of lowering inflation is concerned: in 1995 the indicator would amount to approximately 16 percent, in 1996 -- in the vicinity of 12 percent, and in 1997 -- less than 10 percent. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Will official prices rise at the same rate as inflation? Will official prices still exist? [Kolodko] We would like to decrease the scope of official prices. As far as the rate of their increase is concerned, a certain concession has already been made for those who want it limited. This year we will be implementing the budget law rather strictly. In the years to come, the energy prices will be going up slightly more quickly than the overall inflation rate; however, the process will be slower than was agreed with the World Bank. At this point I must make a more general remark. Reducing inflation is not the final goal of the economic policy. In our strategy lowering the inflation is an instrument necessary to persuade people to save money. Thus, it is an instrument that helps achieve investment growth as well as an increase in productivity. Only in such a sequence -- as an effect -- can we bring up the issue of real wage increases. Another reason that lowering inflation is necessary is that the budget must be made less tight as far as its expenditures are concerned: the increase in expenditures must be controlled and then the costs of paying off the public debt must be reduced. Finally, the lowering of inflation means a slower devaluation rate, as a result of which the budget expenditures for paying off the foreign debt will be increasingly lower. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Right now the share of the public finances in the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] is approximately 50 percent. This indicator shows the degree of the redistribution. Is it satisfactory, or should it be greater or rather smaller? [Kolodko] It should be smaller and we are defining how it should be lowered in the medium-term financial strategy. There are fewer difficulties as far as receipts are concerned; there are more difficulties concerning the expenditures. They are too great, both if we look at the level of our development and from the point of view of the market allocation of money, the so-called transfers for the people. This is related to the sphere of social benefits, which, even though small for individuals, overwhelms the public finances with its burden. At any rate, I believe that the budget is fulfilling the function of redistribution to a degree that is too great; therefore, in the "Strategy for Poland," we would like to limit the redistribution by lowering the expenditures for the transfers for the people, and by protecting the real level of average wages and social benefits. This is possible. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] With what, then, would you now start the reforms? [Kolodko] I would start them first of all by blocking the process of the employees of various industry branches' gaining further privileges, such as an earlier pension age, which we have been witnessing for years, including very recently. The problem is not that our benefits are too high; the real problem is the fact that there are too many beneficiaries in Poland. I am aware of the fact that the people will become the beneficiaries of the reform of the system of social reforms and insurances only after a longer period of time. However, if we want to think about the public finances and plan certain things a long time ahead, we must implement changes now. Our government is prepared to take up this difficult challenge. For me this planning means that in 2005, Poland must be in a position to meet the Maastricht criterion which says that the public debt should amount to approximately 60 percent of the GDP at the most. There are no politicians among us who would think along these lines. However, one must think this way. Today I have made decisions, concerning the reduction of our foreign debt, up to the year 2004. In the meantime, however, I often have to make decisions "for yesterday." [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us return to this year's budget. Is the deficit going to be such as was included in this law, that is, lower? [Kolodko] I hope that it will be a little lower. We would like to lower the size of the deficit from more than 6 percent of the GDP in 1992 to less than 4 percent this year, and not more than 2 percent in 1997. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] How? [Kolodko] Greater pressure is being placed on increasing revenues; however, this should not be achieved through further hardening of the state's fiscal policy, which is being -- probably unfairly -- criticized. It should rather be attained through the completion of the construction of the taxation system. Some issues are going to take as many as several years, such as the cadastre and the new tax on immovable property. We are considering gradual, quiet changes in the area of taxes on capital-derived revenues; however, I do not think that this is an issue of paramount importance. We are seriously treating the slogan of absorbing the gray market and collecting overdue taxes. [passage omitted] [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you intend to exclude the National Bank of Poland [NBP] from the financing of the budget deficit? [Kolodko] NBP is my ally and my cooperation with Ms. Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz is developing very well. The central bank should try to minimize its share in the financing of the deficit in the end; it should concentrate on the function of issuing and be a modern central bank. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Do you think that the money supply should be the same as the nominal GDP growth, slightly faster, or slower? In other words, should the financial policy be stricter or more expansive? [Kolodko] I believe that the amount of money will be increasing slightly faster than the nominal GDP. First of all, I would like the central bank to see to it that the really positive interest rates are maintained. I expect it to aim at lowering the cost of money and the discrepancy between the interest rates of bank deposits and the interest rates of credits. We have already made a serious step in this direction: we have agreed that the reserves for bad credits be included by banks in the costs of their activities, which decreases their tax burdens. As a consequence, the cost of money decreases. The activities of the central bank should not be guided by the temporary needs of the government or of the finance minister: it should be guided by the desire to perform the task of stabilizing the money in the long run. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] You said that the money supply should increase faster than the GDP. What if the bank has a different opinion on that? [Kolodko] We should say this differently. The central bank should shape the money supply in such a way as to proceed down the roughly-defined path of limiting the inflation. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If it accepts it. [Kolodko] I think that it accepts it... Second, the level of the supply must be influenced by the problem of net international reserves. This issue has not been settled. I believe that the reserves should be maintained on more or less the present level. An alternative to this is an increase. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In this way we have reached the issue of the currency exchange rate. You said that you would readily lower the rate of the creeping devaluation. In what way? Very slowly, or faster, but perhaps with a leap devaluation, just as it occurred last year? [Kolodko] The scale of devaluation is a function of the processes related to inflation, especially a function of the increase in the prices of industrial products. On the other hand, the scale of devaluation influences inflation through the prices of imported goods, and especially through the expectations concerning inflation. We want to carry out our policy of a "creeping" devaluation in such a way as to prevent a real appreciation of the zloty. The basket of currencies should go up at more or less the same rate as the index of production prices. I will not tell you how to do this because the finance minister must not discuss certain matters. One can imagine a process of decreasing the scale slowly, the so-called crawling peg [preceding two words in English], or a process of decreasing it more rapidly, along with a small corrective devaluation, by three points for instance. I am saying this rather generally because it should not be expected for the time being. In the end -- I do not know whether this will be in 1997, a year earlier, or a year later -- we would like to switch to a floating rate which will be determined among banks. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What will become of the 6-percent import tax which should be lifted this year? [Kolodko] We will try to decrease it -- after arrangements with our foreign and international partners -- by 1 percentage point a year. Thus, it will disappear after some time. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the compensatory fees? Does the lack of an executive order, necessary for their implementation, result from the fact that you are against the fees? [Kolodko] I believe that the scope of the compensatory fees should be limited. They should be applied in situations when there are clear characteristics of a dumping policy. They should also go for products which are of fundamental importance for the level of employment and for the level of revenues in the Polish agriculture. Indeed, the final decisions have not yet been made. However, the list of the products will be shorter than might have been suggested in some press reports. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is the greatest inflation increase, caused by the compensatory fees, that you consider acceptable? [Kolodko] I would not like to add more than half of 1 percentage point. Incidentally, the results of the introduction of the compensatory fees have not been included in the above-mentioned inflation estimate -- 23.6 percent. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Let us now discuss privatization. Is the government going to present a uniform stand on the issue of privatization within the next few months? [Kolodko] You cannot see such a stand, then? [RZECZPOSPOLITA] No, we cannot. [Kolodko] If you cannot see it, then it will become clearer because there are people who have clear views on this. I would prefer concrete questions. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization of banks? Is the Industrial-Commercial Bank going to be privatized? Is a fourth bank going to be selected for privatization this year? [Kolodko] The first question, which we will answer as early as June, is the following: Should this sector first be consolidated, or privatized? Perhaps, then, the Industrial-Commercial Bank will be privatized in a different configuration, as a result of a consolidation process. Increasingly more experts are saying that banks should first be consolidated. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What about the privatization and the future of the State Insurance Bureau [PZU]? [Kolodko] We want to restructure the insurance sector in such a way as to first of all weaken the monopolist position of PZU. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] A division, then? [Kolodko] I would like to answer this question in two weeks' time; however, I do not rule out the possibility that PZU will be divided. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What is your evaluation of the program of commercialization of state-owned enterprises? [Kolodko] My views are similar to the views of Minister Kaczmarek; I share his opinion that over 1,000 enterprises, especially the bigger ones, should be quickly commercialized, so that we will be able to lift the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] at the end of this year. We also want to establish the criteria for selecting the enterprises that should be quickly privatized. On the other hand, the parliament should define the areas of the economy which will not be privatized in the foreseeable future. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] The program of National Investment Funds will be continued, of course, will it not? [Kolodko] Yes, it will. One must run forward; this program must be completed and looked upon as broadly as possible, even though it does not entirely resolve either the problems of ownership transformations, or the problem of running this property. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What portion of the GDP and what portion of the industrial production will come from the private sector in 1997, do you think? [Kolodko] I do not know these figures and I am not particularly excited by any forecasts in this area. However, the private sector will certainly be developing faster than the state- owned sector and the indicators of its share in employment, production, and exports will be rising, due to the faster growth rate of private companies, the influx of foreign capital, and the denationalization processes. However, these indicators will be changing in favor of the private sector less rapidly than they have been changing in recent years, because a revolution is carried out only once. You cannot double something that already has over a 50- percent share in the global indexes. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] What do you think of the participation of employees in privatization? [Kolodko] My views on this are rather moderate. Not only does it not guarantee greater efficiency, but it also decreases budgetary receipts; moreover, it is unfair. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Why is it unfair? [Kolodko] Because they put pressure on it and its beneficiaries are only defined groups of employees of mostly medium- sized enterprises. As a result, budget sphere employees, senior citizens, inhabitants of rural areas, and employees of enterprises which will still be owned by the state for a long time, including many large enterprises, are left out of the privatization process. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] One of the restructurization and privatization ideas would be the exchange of the Polish debt for shares in Polish enterprises. Are any details known yet and does the government unanimously approve of this idea? [Kolodko] The answer is negative to both questions. Generally, the thought is the following: the government's task, resulting from the reasons of the state, is to also dispose of some of the public debt while disposing of such a vast amount of assets. Hence the support for the settlement procedure or, in the future, the issuing of special public debt Treasury bonds which may be exchanged for elements of the privatized property. Some time in the future we would like to start buying out the public debt and offer the privatized property, especially to households. This will enrich our capital market. The second aspect is of an international nature. If we successfully finalize the reduction that has already been included in the general agreement with the London Club -- and this process is slowly but surely going on -- then I think that we should take the second step and implement a bold program of exchanging part of the remaining debt for shares in enterprises. I would like for such transactions to be closely related with the inflow of foreign capital from private sources; I would like them to be an element of the packet which also includes cash investment and (or) certain investment commitments for the future. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Investment or social commitments? [Kolodko] I would prefer the former. It will create new work places. We want to kill three birds with one stone... I guess that this is too much: decreasing the debt, privatization, and inflow of direct investment enhancing the competitiveness of the Polish economy. In this way these investments are supposed to be advantageous to the Polish people, even though, of course, the foreign capital will make its own business. I cannot see any discrepancy here. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] If the program is to yield considerable profits, it must concern large and attractive companies -- refineries, telecommunications, insurance, perhaps airlines... [Kolodko] That is right. In Argentina 20 percent of the debt -- $10 billion -- was liquidated in this way. I can see no reason why we should not try this in Poland. Also here we must run forward and resist this pseudo-capitalist bla bla bla that we will sell Poland out and give it away for half the price. This is just not true. [RZECZPOSPOLITA] Your projects seem to be rather technocratic... [Kolodko] They are pragmatic... [RZECZPOSPOLITA] In the meantime, in one of your interviews you said that you would like the GDP to be distributed more justly. What does one have to do with the other and how do you intend to achieve this justice? [Kolodko] The process of transformation is related to colossal redistribution and we touch upon this problem in almost every question. This redistribution is done through the budget or through the capital market, or it is transferred over borders. The beneficiaries of this process are various social groups and it will continue to be this way. Now, there is the question: How to distribute the results of the increase in productivity, the results of the growing GDP? We want to change the relations of work and remuneration. I am determined to depart from the chaotic, political, sick bidding system, which is anti market. I am certainly not a populist, I will not allow anyone to put such a label on me. However, I believe that right now there is time for more social sensitivity. And I believe that it is in the interest of the people if we change the relations of work and the principles of remuneration. We cannot have a situation in which bilateral negotiations are always conducted, even if the problems are multidimensional. I am against transferring all the decisions concerning wages to the central level. I am in favor of deregulation and decentralization; I am also against the idea of imposing the concept of a corporate state. We will have the Trilateral Commission; it will be written down in the law. However, it is supposed to be first of all a place where the conflicting interests will be discussed; it will be the forum of negotiations. It will certainly not decide everything. The government is subordinated to the parliament and to the president; it will certainly not be subordinated to the Trilateral Commission. Now, returning to your question, when we speak about social justice, we do not say that we want to be good uncles and we want to give away some of the budget money. On the contrary. There is justice when the stronger are not allowed to take money away from the weaker -- through strike pressure, for instance. More just distribution is when it is those who work hard that earn more money than those who strike hard, not vice versa.
