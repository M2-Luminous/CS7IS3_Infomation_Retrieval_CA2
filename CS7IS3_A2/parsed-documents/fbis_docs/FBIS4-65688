And Gianfranco Miglio did not like the image of the "dream" taken from Martin Luther King: "He is one of the people I abhor," he commented, caustic as ever, "like all preachers and people of that kind." The Northern League's Roberto Maroni was pleased, appreciating the pragmatic nature of the speech and its references to federalism. According to Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance], "Berlusconi is not only someone who likes specifics, but someone who is quite clear about this government's political profile." New Minister Clemente Mastella, of the CCD [Christian Democratic Center], was excited by the prospect of a million new jobs: "It is like an athlete trying to beat the world record." The comments from adversaries were very different. While on the one hand reassuring Berlusconi, ("ours will be a democratic and constitutional opposition,") Occhetto reaffirmed his very tough verdict: "This government humiliates Italy because of its unfitness, the intrigues and maneuverings that accompanied its formation, and the violation of the promises made to the voters." As for its program, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader described it as "very vague," and described as "frightening" the absence of any reference to the issue of southern Italy. Cesare Salvi, the PDS Senate leader, was blunt about it: "Our `no' is unconditional." Luigi Berlinguer, the PDS floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, observed: "Rather than a government program, it seems to me more like a television program." Armando Cossutta, leader of the Communist Renewal caucus, dismissed the speech "for three reasons: the failure to reject all vestiges of fascism; the arrogance displayed with regard to the political and ethical incompatibility between his assets and the prime ministership; and because in economics he is even further to the Right than Confindustria." The PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] Ottaviano del Turco dismissed it as follows: "Reticent on the subject of fascism, vague with regard to guarantees, and generic with regard to all the points in the program." The Rete's Mancuso criticized the speech for being "obvious" and "demagogic, designed to win easy applause on the subject of [killed anti-Mafia judges] Falcone and Borsellino." Without going into details, the Democratic Alliance's Passigli reaffirmed: "None of us will vote in favor." The Greens too were tough; they do not believe in Berlusconi's promises with regard to environmentalism: "If it really interested him," Manconi said, "he would not have granted the ministry to Matteoli, who is a real enemy of the environment." On the Center, officially all the responses are negative. "It would be irresponsible to grant a vote of confidence," Rosy Bindi commented; "it would be like setting a locomotive on a track in the knowledge that you cannot in any way influence its course and direction." Segni [Pact for Italy] called it "a second-rate speech, just as the government team is second-rate." Senator Agnelli summed it up as follows: "The part on foreign policy was excellent, the part on economic policy was good, and the rest was mediocre." He will decide how to vote after hearing Berlusconi's reply. Giovanni Spadolini [Italian Republican Party], however, has already decided not to vote in favor. Roland Riz (South Tyrol People's Party) considers the speech "good on the whole" but nevertheless confirmed that he will not be granting his vote of confidence. Cesare Dujany (Val D'Aosta Union) is still undecided, but wants more guarantees with regard to local government. Last, the social partners. Confindustria "acknowledges with pleasure" Berlusconi's pledges, and positive assessments also came from Confartigianato [General Confederation of Italian Artisans and Craftsmen] and CIDA (business managers). The trade unions were more cautious, preferring to judge the government on its actions.
