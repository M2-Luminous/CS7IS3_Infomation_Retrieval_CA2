According to B. Van der Meer, one of Nenachov's employees, the donation amounted to roughly $50,000. Nenakov has admitted this to Van der Meert. According to the Moscow office's Dutch employee, Nenachov also co-financed campaigns of other Russian political parties. "Nenachov also donated $50,000 to Gaydar, the democratic candidate," Van der Meer claims. "This is also true for the other important candidates." He denies that the 27-year old Nenakov co-financed Zhirinovskiy's $800,000 campaign through his Netherlands companies. "There have not been any flows of money through Amsterdam," Van der Meer says. The Amsterdam-based GMM was discredited last Wednesday after the Russian newspaper SEGODNYA reported that Nenachov had sponsored Zhirinovskiy through this company. According to the GMM staff member, Nenachov did not pay Zhirinovskiy on account of his political preference for an ultra- right-wing politician. "As an entrepreneur, you have to be pragmatic as far as politics are concerned. Nenachov has one political preference: money." According to Van der Meert, Nenachov made the payments in his capacity as a private individual." Partly as a result of the fuss raised, the Economic Control Service [ECD] launched an investigation into GMM's activities and into its Russian manager-shareholder. The control service has already contacted De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) about the case. However, the central bank is not the formal authority entitled to give instructions to the ECD. This is the purview of the Finance Ministry, in close consultation with the central bank. The Finance Ministry said that it is still considering whether the ECD will be called in. Nenachov's employee says he is "pleased" with the control service's investigation. "We will render our assistance. This way, we will be able to prove our innocence," Van der Meert says. The ECD investigation will not focus on GMM's and Nenachov's political sympathies, but on possible economic offenses committed by the company, in contravention of Article 82 of the Law on the Inspection of Crediting. The DNB has recently sent a letter to GMM, in which the bank warned the company not to do any banking business. To that effect, the bank also invoked Article 82, which stipulates that non-banks and non-investment companies are not entitled to attract capital. This article also forbids institutions established in the Netherlands to attract money from abroad. GMM is allegedly involved in large-scale money-raising operations in Russia. The company, which also has an office in Moscow, has daily commercials on Russian television. GMM has already been in conflict with a Dutch institution on a previous occasion. Some three months ago, the ABN Amro discontinued its credit relationship with the company. The bank took offense to Nenakov's assertion in Russia that the GMM office in Moscow is an ABN Amro Russian subsidiary. According to Van der Meer, "Nenachov is merely an enthusiastic Russian, who is not aware that you have to keep strictly to the rules in the Netherlands. Things are quite different in Russia." In the Netherlands, GMM is banking with the U.S. Citibank. The GMM case has embarrassed Nenachov's adviser. L. Gribling, a close assistant and employed by the accounting office Arenthals/Chaudron, has gone on vacation. The office issued a statement that it will break off its relation with Nenachov if "illegal practices" are revealed. Arenthals/Chaudron denies any involvement in the financing of Zhirinovskiy's campaign.
