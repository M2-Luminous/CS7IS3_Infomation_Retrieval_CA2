The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled "Are We That `Desperate'?" The editorial refutes Chief ROK delegate Song Pyong-tae's remark "that the envoy exchange is a pressing issue that cannot be put aside even for a minute," and calls on Song to disclose if his remark represents the government's official view or is his personal opinion. The editorial notes the issue on exchanging special envoys is "not the supreme task nor a pressing issue, but what we hope for to occur." The editorial deplores that "the South side disclosed all our cards" and that "we begged the North side for the exchange of special envoys, which resulted in North Korea's assuming a haughty attitude toward our demands." Recalling that President Kim Yong-sam expressed his hope for the North-South summit at a news conference, the article concludes that our side's mishandling of the affair is a by-product of "unification-related government officials' flattery, pursuit for personal achievements, and excessive loyalty to fulfill the president's hope." Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by An Hui-chang entitled: "The Prospect for Exchanging Special Envoys Before 21 March Grows Dim." The article analyzes North Korea's counterproposal of two additional demands, including maintenance of national self-reliance, on the agenda for discussion by the special envoys, as attempts by North Korea "to break the ROK-U.S. cooperative system by not agreeing to the envoy exchange" and "to size up our government's determination to exchange special envoys." The article interprets "North Korea's attempt to itemize the special envoys' missions in seven points as an intent to hinder the ROK side from focusing on the nuclear issue." Commenting on North Korea's suggestion to add to the envoys' mission discussions on how to preserve national independence, the article notes "North Korea added this condition to put pressure on the ROK side by raising the issue of U.S. troops stationed in the ROK and to use this as a card during the future North Korean-U.S. talks." The article concludes "such being the case, chances are slim that the special envoys will be exchanged before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks." The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled: "How Long Do We Have To Be Dragged About by the North?" Pointing out North Korea's insincere attitude to evade the envoy exchange by presenting two additional demands on the envoys' mission, the editorial calls on the government "not to vacillate or hasten negotiations. Our side should make it clear to the North that practical discussions on the envoy exchange is a precondition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks, which the North longs for." The editorial condemns the North for always putting forward "preposterous conditions after reaching an agreement in principle" and predicts that North Korea will make further attempts to "gain more concessions," while repeatedly putting forward additional conditions. The editorial warns the ROK Government not to get entangled in North Korea's foot-dragging tactic and calls on the government "to convince the U.S. side that the North Korean-U.S. talks should be suspended until the North and the South reach an agreement on the pending issues." The editorial concludes: "If North Korea continues to put forth additional conditions for the envoy exchange, our side should demand that the North disclose its position on its real intention for the envoy exchange." The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on page 2 a 900-word article reviewing the thorny conversations between the two chief delegates, adding that a tense air surrounded the contact. The article adds that the chief delegates held private talks for 20 minutes after the contact, but ROK delegate Song declined to give more details. The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 a 900-word article by Yu Sung-u and the conservative Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Pak Chae-kun. Both articles review the conversations between the two delegates and describe the atmosphere at the talks as tense.
