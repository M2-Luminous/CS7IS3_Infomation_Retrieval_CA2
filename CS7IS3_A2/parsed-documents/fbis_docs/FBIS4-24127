It is now clear that there is division among its followers. There are three leading sects -- namely, the Mozambique Islamic Congress, the Mozambique Islamic Council, and the Muhammadan Association (Sunni sect). [passage omitted] Leading Islamic figures in the Isle of Mozambique and in the port city of Nacala say: "We are being invaded by Islamic fundamentalism. The whole world knows the signs of it, notably those relating to radicalism which leads to violence." They made an accusation: "It is the Sudanese who have been introducing Islamic fundamentalism here in Nacala and in the Isle of Mozambique..." We asked [Mozambique Islamic Council member] Habibo Amade for an explanation. He said: "As a matter of fact the danger lies in that interpretation because it has been fabricated in the West. We ought to be very careful and realize that right now, in line with what has been reported in the Western press, Islam is regarded in the West as more dangerous because communism is no longer around. So, there will be new fabrications and subtly they will try to infiltrate us." "Why would the West be so interested in, so to speak, overthrowing or even weakening Islam?" "The example from Bosnia is more than clear about that. Now that there is an arms embargo, the West is doing its best to prevent those people from defending themselves because they do not want the establishment of an Islamic state in that part of the world. They say it is a violent society and make other accusations like the ones about Iran, Algeria, and other Islamic countries." [passage omitted]
