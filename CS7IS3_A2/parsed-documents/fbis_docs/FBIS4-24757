Italy is the first stop on his European trip, which also takes him to Britain and France. During the three-day stay here Clinton will meet Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister S. Berlusconi to discuss bilateral relations between the countries, the current situation in Europe and particularly that in Bosnia. The two will also examine the preparations for the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to be held in Naples, Italy, next month. Clinton is also expected to reaffirm his support for the new Italian Government. According to sources Berlusconi will stress that Italy should not be excluded in efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia. He will also point out to the U.S. President that Italy would not be idle in the process for a proposed increase of permanent seats in the U.N. Security Council. Clinton will lay a wreath at the tomb of U.S. soldiers in Nettuno, who landed there in World War Two. Political pundits say that Clinton's Europe trip is designed to reaffirm trans-Atlantic ties and to boost his image back home which has been adversely affected recently by a series of personal and public crises.
