FBIS3-29729 "dreas035_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 North Korea Daily Criticizes South's `Mobilization Posture' SK2102053094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0452 GMT 21 Feb 94 SK2102053094 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Reckless Frenzy of Simpletons" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities at a "meeting of officials concerned with mobilization" some time ago called for a full "mobilization posture" of para-military forces to cope with an "emergency". Branding this as a reckless frenzy of simpletons, NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today says the recent move of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique is very ill-boding as it is a criminal step usually taken by warmaniacs on the eve of war. The news analyst goes on: This year, too, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has held war confabs not infrequently allegedly to "cope with an actual war" and "establish a posture of immediate counteraction", and openly declared that they would resume "Team Spirit" or stage another military exercises. The puppets are also making haste with the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea with the United States, unusually scaled up their "military budget" and are hell bent on arms buildup. The fact that the Kim Yong-sam group now has put on the order of the day the question of mobilizing para-military forces ten million strong in a war against the North tells that the war frenzy of "civilian" warmaniacs has reached an extremely dangerous stage. Due to such criminal moves of the puppets, the situation of the Korean peninsula now is in a dangerous phase reminding one of the time when the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique unleashed the war to invade the North in 1950. While the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique resorting to criminal moves to ignite a war in a "civilian" guise is left intact, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace even a moment, nor can they evade a bloodletting from another war. Kim Yong-sam, a traitor to the nation and the enemy of peace and reunification, must be removed in good time.
