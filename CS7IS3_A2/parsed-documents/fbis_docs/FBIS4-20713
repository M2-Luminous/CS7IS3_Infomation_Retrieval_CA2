FBIS4-20713 "jpnea017___94009" JPRS-NEA-94-017 JPRS Near East & South Asia 21 February 1994 NEAR EAST TUNISIA Recommendations for State Family Aid Program Recommendations for State Family Aid Program 94AF0126B Tunis LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE in French 21 Feb 94 p 3 94AF0126B Tunis LA PRESSE DE TUNISIE French CSO [Article by Foued Allani: "Aid to Needy Families: A Program Deserving Support"] [Text] Covering 101,000 families since 1992, the National Program of Aid to Needy Families (PNAFN) has distributed an average of 250 dinars[D] per family per year, i.e., 178 percent more than in 1987. Created in 1986, the PNAFN was designed to help needy families living below the poverty level and whose purchasing power may deteriorate now that staple product prices are being adjusted. This program "is part of the auxiliary measures provided under the economic recovery plan in order to alleviate the social impact of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) on poor populations, living below the poverty level." Thus, in 1986 and 1992, the PNAFN spent as much as D93.834 millions, and projected 1993 expenditures alone amounted to D26.26 millions. According to a Ministry of Social Affairs survey of 61,000 heads of households covered by this program, the recipients are as follows: - 57 percent are women; - 52 percent are over 60; - 17.5 percent are handicapped; - 3 percent are covered by Social Security; - 18 percent had a paying job at the time of the survey (15.2 percent on construction sites, 4.5 percent in agriculture, and 1 percent in services). That last figure, according to the speaker, reflected one of the inadequacies of the programs, which suffers from some problems in targeting recipients. Therefore, since 10 May 1993, the ministry has undertaken an exhaustive survey of the 101,000 families covered by the program and of another 59,000 families eligible for aid, in order to update and overhaul the program and set up local, regional, and central files on poverty. Since that program alone is not adequate to ensure the social advancement of needy families, the Ministry of Social Affairs believes that it must be supported by additional efforts. For his part, Mr. Abdellatif Ben Kilani, director at the Ministry of Social Affairs, made the following suggestions: - "To make all participants aware of the social dimension of any development efforts, and to improve the identification capacity of social advancement projects." - "To finance social advancement programs essentially through solidarity (private efforts, especially foundations and non-governmental organizations)." - "To associate nongovernment organizations to the application and management of social advancement projects." - "To adopt a consensual approach as to which indicators are to be used by the various participants."
