The party style of a ruling party exerts a decisive and yet subtle influence on social practices. Since its inception in 1921, our party has faithfully carried out its objective of serving the people wholeheartedly. It has believed in and relied on the people. In their interests, and advancing wave upon wave, it has vanquished imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and spared no pains to do a good job in economic construction; thus winning the warm support, love, and esteem of the people, and establishing flesh-and-blood ties with them. Over a long period of revolutionary struggle and economic construction, the broad masses of party members have, with their staunch party spirit, strict discipline, selfless dedication, and edifying influence, given an impetus to hundreds of millions of people. The correct party style has thus given rise to sound practices among the people to lead simple and honest lives amid an harmonious atmosphere, and among people who are ever vigorous in spirit and intent to make progress. In recent years, some party members and cadres, in particular a handful of party members and leading cadres who were unable to stand the trials of governing, reform, and opening up, gradually yielded to mammonism, hedonism, and extreme individualism. They made use of their power to gain selfish ends, lived in luxury, became corrupt and degenerate, hankered after fame and fortune, and to a certain extent, undermined party style and tarnished its image. The presence of decadent phenomenon within the party has exerted an undesirable influence and encouraged unhealthy practices, giving rise to the tendency of regarding money as all-important and caring for nothing but profit, or even bringing back to life some of the vicious phenomena that disappeared long ago. These kinds of phenomena not only run counter to socialist spiritual civilization, but also hamper economic development. The people are realistic. First they come to know the party and evaluate it in light of the practices and actions of party members in their midst. When a Communist Party member raises his arm at a critical and trying moment when one's fate is hanging in the balance, he shouts: "I am a Communist Party member, follow me!" As soon as party members go forward, the people will follow suit. If a party member sees a woman being humiliated by a villain armed with a knife and turns a blind eye, staying away for fear that he may be unable to get away in time; if some party members and leading cadres come across a seriously ill patient who needs to be rushed to a hospital, but just ignore him and whiz by in a plush sedan; if, while the people are still toiling to find sufficient food and clothing, party members and cadres indulge themselves in feasting, what will they people think? How will they view it? How can we expect the people to gallantly rise for a just cause? How can we ask the people to unite and help one another? Presently, some party members and cadres complain that the people are disobedient and hard to lead, that human hearts are not what they used to be in the old days, and social practices are no longer pure. Those complaining comrades should first examine the actual role being played by party organizations as fighting bastions under their leadership, and examine how their own party members are playing their exemplary vanguard role. Why is it that party members in places like Huaxi village under Jiangyin county, Qianzhou township under Wuxi city, and Jianhuai village under Huaian city do not have such complaints; and why can these people work with one heart and one mind with party members and cadres to carry out economic construction and spiritual civilization construction? The crux of the matter lies in that party organizations and members in these localities have been faithful to their objectives, have done practical work for the people, and worked for their benefit; such correct party style has naturally led to healthy social practices. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The key to China's problems lies in doing a good job within the Communist Party. To establish simple and honest social practices, create a political environment marked by stability and unity, and organize hundreds of millions of people to work with concerted efforts to achieve the goal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, first and foremost, we must eradicate all corrupt practices inside the party. Party organizations at all levels and every party member should further study the guidelines set out in the whole series of anticorruption documents issued by the party Central Committee; clearly understand the overall concept of the anticorruption drive launched by the party Central Committee and the party's short-term goals and current tasks, principles, and priorities; and try to unify our thinking and understanding, and actively plunge ourselves into the anticorruption struggle. We must, on this basis, resort to mobilizing and relying on the people to expose, lodge reports, and take measures against major cases in cooperation with specific organs according to the law, and firmly stamp out several unhealthy practices which the people are resentful of. At the same time, we must strengthen the management of education among party members, and constantly raise consciousness toward self-discipline, honest living, as well as the ability to fight corruption and handle any unfavorable turn of events among party members and cadres, particularly among leading cadres. The leadership and rank and file must work hand in hand to set party style right, and create a new situation with correct party style and healthy social practices.
