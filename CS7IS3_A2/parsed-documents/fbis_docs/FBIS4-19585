It cannot." We have been hearing this phrase often lately. Do not doubt that those who say this phrase are stating a fact in their opinion; but, maybe they are actually expressing a wish. In social life, however, developments cannot be stopped by saying "it cannot be, it must not be." Such phrases have been uttered frequently in our country. There were times when people said "Turkey cannot become Latin America." When the circumstances dictated, however, we began experiencing the same things as Latin America. It must be noted immediately, however, that social development in one country is never identical to that in another country. Every society has its own particular circumstances and they differ from one society to another. These differences should not prevent us from seeing some of the common factors. It is possible to observe common factors in all countries, where radical movements emerge. We will examine these factors in another article, while today we will look at the common factors between Turkey and Algeria. One of the greatest similarities between Turkey and Algeria consists of the high rate in the population growth in both countries. This rate is 2.4 percent in Turkey (although the rate is below 2 percent in certain western regions, it is around 4 percent in the southeast) and stands at 3.2 percent in Algeria. This rate of increase in the population, which exceeds the rate of economic development, causes big social problems in societies where the increase in production cannot keep up with the population growth. Especially because of high migration rates, a significant portion of the population is concentrated in urban areas, creating shantytowns, as in the case of Turkey, and forcing people to live in difficult and destitute conditions in Algeria, which make the shantytowns in Turkey appear desirable. In both countries, people are given jobs in state economic enterprises in a bid to solve the employment problem, and this, in turn, pushes the economy into a bigger impasse. Grave economic crises and the inability to increase the income from exports make it more difficult to undertake new investments in both countries. Both countries are burdened by huge foreign debts, and the capital and interest payments obstruct all kinds of economic enterprise. Having cited these common factors, let us look at elements, which appear to be different at first glance, but are not actually so different upon deeper examination. It is said: "Contrary to Algeria, there is a democracy in Turkey and the situation will not be the same as Algeria because everyone will have the opportunity to express his opinion within the framework of democracy." There is a portion of truth in this statement. It is also true, however, that this democracy and its parties as well as its leaders have become unable to meet the demands of the people. The system is unable to overcome its problems and its difficulties within its own framework and it is failing to provide real or seemingly alternative institutions, other than the Prosperity Party. Democracy is a regime of choices. If the choices disappear or it seems to the public that there are no choices, then the structural existence of democracy loses its meaning. Another argument suggests that Turkey has a secular tradition of 70 years and secularism is established among the people. Yes, it is true that Turkey has a 70-year-old tradition of secularism, which is still supported by the people. It is, however, necessary to realize the following point as well. Aided by the state's carelessness as well, a new and powerful anti secular generation is being raised in Turkey because monotheistic education has been abandoned, Koran courses have been taken over by anti secular forces, and these forces have infiltrated the state's National Education cadres. It is clear that declaring offhand that Turkey cannot become Algeria is merely wishful thinking. It is neither right to say "Turkey cannot become Algeria," nor is it correct to say "Turkey will definitely become another Algeria." When social circumstances dictate, consequences similar -- not identical -- to those in Algeria are inevitable.
