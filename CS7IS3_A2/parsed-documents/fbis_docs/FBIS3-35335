Several central activists from the David Levi camp did not manage to get voted into the secretariat. Ya'aqov Berdugo, secretary general of the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, is one of those who failed to get elected. A series of municipal heads identified with the Levi camp were also voted out. [passage omitted] A somewhat surprising fact is that eight persons newly elected to the secretariat are identified with Moshe Qatzav's camp. Altogether 29 secretariat seats were available. The other 32 slots were reserved for the Likud's Knesset members [MK's]. MK Netanyahu is not a member of the secretariat because one of its duties is to monitor and supervise his work. [passage omitted] Netanyahu's associates expressed satisfaction with the results of the elections to the secretariat. They stated that those who declared they intend to "give Netanyahu a hard time" were not elected, while all of those elected who are not members of the Netanyahu camp are "suitable" candidates. Levi camp members, on the other hand, claim it is misleading to depict the results as a defeat for the Levi camp. According to Levi's associates, this confrontation was not conducted on a partisan basis and the Levi camp did not promote any candidates.
