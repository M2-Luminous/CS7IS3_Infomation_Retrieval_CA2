The group was taken to a police office in the town of Petseri and kept there for two hours. Reet Tobre, the head of the Petserimaa movement, said Russian officials had said the arrest was due to filming. The Estonian television team had filmed a local church, industrial buildings in the town, as well as the railway station and local headquarters of a Russian border guard unit. The police had told the group that Petseri is located in a border zone where filming is allowed only for holders of special permits, which can be obtained for a fee. "The police very carefully examined our documents. We had the Russian visas and we had crossed the control line legally," Tobre added. Tobre's Petserimaa (Petseriland) group advocates the rights of the legal Estonian citizens in the region and stands for reunification of the region with Estonia. The police had also tried to examine the material filmed by the video group, but had failed to do so because of not having the necessary equipment. Aino Leppik, adviser to the government, in an interview today said the issue was being dealt with by the Estonian Foreign Ministry. "It is absolutely inadmissible that Russian police detain Estonian citizens in Petseri without any charges. This, under the constitution, took place on the Estonian territory," said Leppik, who was among those detained. The television team and Aino Leppik were visiting Petseri for celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the local Estonian school. The area, an Estonian territory under the 1920 peace treaty with Russia, was annexed and named a region of the Russian Federation shortly after World War II, when the Soviet Union was occupying the country.
