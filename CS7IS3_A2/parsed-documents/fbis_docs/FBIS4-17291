In the first quarter the production slump reached the record level of 25 percent. The unstable internal political situation in Russia and the deepening economic crisis, which could cause a powerful social explosion this year, are giving rise to growing Western concern. Political and business circles in the United States, Germany, Japan, and other states are increasingly openly voicing their opinion of the inability of the country's present leadership to find a way out of the impasse without relying on strong public organizations. The Federation of Commodity Producers [FCP] has sent the Russian Federation president proposals for taking measures without delay to rescue Russian industrial and agricultural production. The message makes a hard-hitting analysis of the very grave situation in the Russian economy and sets forth specific measures to organize a system of cooperation between the FCP and the government with a view to working out and implementing specific joint actions. B. Yeltsin has examined the proposals and instructed V. Chernomyrdin to arrange cooperation with the FCP for the purpose of overcoming the disastrous drop in production and curbing the growth of unemployment. The FCP's practical activity in shaping new relations between commodity producers and the government and foreign partners is a real step on the way to creating a self-organizing system of economic relations. Russia will be unable to emerge from the crisis without the painstaking, gradual building of working market infrastructures and new relations in the economy. The hopes of Ye. Gaydar and his supporters that an unrestrained market will itself set everything to rights and that the economy will start working efficiently have, as was to be expected, proved a bluff. The transition to a civilized market is a complex process which must be conducted sensibly and systematically. This FCP activity is meeting with increasing support from Russian entrepreneurs, the corps of directors, and trade unions. This is of considerable importance, since Yuriy Skokov has declared his intention to run as a candidate in the 1996 presidential election and needs new supporters and broad support. Today this cannot be achieved with fine promises alone -- few people believe them anymore.
