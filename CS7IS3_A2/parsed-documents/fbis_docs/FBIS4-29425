In a nutshell, the announced selections broke new ground. Nine out of the 10 appointees are from non-political circles. Professional politicians are shut out, conspicuously; the appointees include four ex-government officials, three lawyers, a scholar and a chaeya [reformist camp] figure from an activist group. No familiar faces, and not many celebrities in their sectors either. Their average age is 49, 6 years younger than the average of the present DLP district chairmen, which is 55. They belong to no factions. There is no to-the-core RDP [former Reunification Democratic Party] man among them, and none affiliated with the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction either. Of the 10, the only professional politician is Rep. Cho Yong-chik, nominated for Songpa-B, Seoul. A member of the NDRP (former New Democratic Republican Party) faction, he is an exceptional case. The action literally demonstrates a "shift in generation" and a "shake-up." Its timing proves it. The ruling camp had kept putting off the appointments for as long as 5 months, each time by instructions from Chongwadae awaiting the passage of the Political Reform Act through the National Assembly. Finally, the reform act was passed, setting the stage for the next step, the human reform. Average Age 49, Unaffiliated The DLP has served notice that the same principles will be followed in the nominations for the rest of similar districts, too. It appears very likely that they will be carried through into the party endorsement process for candidates in the 14th general election. After the district-level reshuffles will come a national-level shake-up. It is the time for those "influential" incumbents in the National Assembly to worry about their individual cases of "endorsement." Meanwhile, some within the ruling camp strongly reacted against the new party line, particularly members of the DJP faction, who see it as targeted on them. Picks on "Kim Mun-su's Record" Complaints were voiced bluntly at a party executives meeting held on 8 March. Executive Committee member Yi Chi-ho, DJP, fired the first bullet, taking issue with the personal record of Kim Mun-su, appointed to the post of Puchon Sosa District, Kyonggi Province. Kim Mun-su had served 2 years and 6 months in prison for leading the 3 May Inchon Upheaval, a key battle in the 1986 constitutional amendment struggle for direct presidential election system. He was convicted on charges of violating the National Security Law. "Since when has a criminal record been viewed as a credit?" asked Yi Chi-ho at the session. He raised questions over Kim Mun-su's rehabilitation and his role in the Chonnohyop [National Council of Labor Movements]. Secretary General Mun Chong-su responded, only in theoretical terms. Where the DJP faction is headed with its resistance is a matter of concern. It is hardly predictable at the moment, however. The party leadership seems to take a wait-and-see attitude. Meanwhile, complaints seem to grow deeper inwardly as time goes by. For Showdown with the Opposition The DJP faction had shown some wayward signs until recently, which, however, have subsided since the party decided to postpone its national convention, a development that deprived the faction of its pretext for agitation. Now, one may say that it is about to find a new pretext. Meanwhile, it is known that the process of selecting the new district-level chief organizers was plagued with backbiting mirroring that situation. It is said that most difficult were the decisions on Seoul and Puchon districts. It was because the opposition maintains an edge in those districts. In the process of coordinating with Chongwadae on final selections under the lead of Secretary General Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae, director of the Basic Research Office, officials reportedly weighed that fact and decided to bring in reform-oriented, untainted "new faces" in force for a showdown with the opposition. Local Tendencies Taken into Account Thus came the appointment of Chong Song-chol, a lawyer from chaeya and presently assistant first minister of state, for Kangnam-B, Seoul, and that of Kim Hak-won, also a lawyer and political new face, for Songdong-B, Seoul. The two satisfied the newly adopted standards, it was explained. Chong Song-chol -- who is a drawing-card-type chaeya figure, whose participation in the new government was the result of "recommendation" by Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong -- had been designated for the post early on, although informally. The selection of Kim Mun-su "fueled criticism" through to the end. The reason was that he was the leader in the 3 May, 1986, Inchon Upheaval and served a prison term on conviction for violations of the National Security Law. Some argued that he could stir up conservative vs. reformist ideological polemics within the party. The pros and cons were equally divided, and eventually party executives decided to "run the risk." Their decision is said to have taken into consideration the fact that Puchon Sosa District residents are mostly working people, and that in the neighboring Kwangmyong District, Son Hak-kyu, a chaeya-oriented scholar, was elected to the National Assembly in a recent by-election. Rumors had it that the decision was also based on the observation that the Democratic Party [DP] will run either its party spokesman, Pak Chi- won, or Pae Ki-son, former deputy chief secretary for the party chairman as its candidate for the same district, Puchon Sosa, in the next general election. It was for the same reason that O Song-kye was named to the Puchon Ojong District post. The DLP was on the verge of withholding a decision on Songpa-B, Seoul, when Cho Yong-chik, DLP deputy spokesman, was finally picked thanks to the "influence" of Chairman Kim Chong-pil. The RDP faction strongly supported Song Chol-won, chairman of the Forum of Press Workers Unions. It was a close contest, they say. Satisfied with the Outcome For now, party officials are satisfied with the results of the open recruiting, saying that they succeeded in obtaining "fresh candidates." As examples, they cite the cases of Yi Ki-hyong, staff researcher of the National Land Development Research Institute and a graduate of University of San Francisco and doctor of economics, who was named for Sosan-Taean District; and Kim Kwang-won, former lieutenant governor of North Kyongsang Province, named for Uljin District. Kim Kwang-won says that "I responded to the open recruiting without knowing that there is a recruiting plan that is not open to the public." It is rumored that he drew strong support from Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u. It is also said that Kim Mun-su's "sponsor" was Kim Chong-nam, Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for educational and cultural affairs. The nomination of Choe In-ki for Naju District practically had been predetermined when he was "left out" in the appointments of vice ministers in late December last year. Yi Chol-kyu, chief of the Planning and Management Office of the Kyonggi provincial government, who was named for Sihung-Kunpo District, was a case of "draft." Yi, former Sihung City mayor, says that the nomination was a surprise although there had been a hint from Choe Ki-son, Inchon City mayor and a key member of the RDP faction, a month ago. "Preference for SNU Graduates" Criticized The districts of Seoul's Sodaemun-B, Socho-A, Taegu's East-B, and Hwasun of South Cholla Province were placed on the hold following the principle that the party will look for best-qualified persons having both the resolve for reform and local support. Also, Seoul's Kangso-A District -- of which Yi Won-chong, Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for political affairs, declined the chairmanship before the start of the open recruiting -- was taken off the list of open-recruiting districts from the beginning. The 10 appointees are made up by nine Seoul National University [SNU] graduates and one University of San Francisco graduate. Of the nine SNU graduates, seven are from the law school. Responding to criticism of too much importance having been attached to academic career factors, Secretary General Mun Chong-su "explained" that "honestly, it was by accident."
