The two problems threaten to reduce its role in power in the future as a result of the tribal dispute between the Hashid tribe, from which the grouping's leadership comes, and the Bakil tribe. And also because of the external moves and bilateral contacts between its partners in power: The General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. [passage omitted) Corroborated information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says that the Nasirite Unionist Party -- an opposition party -- has not yet decided to open a dialogue with the YRG, because the latter is a partner in government. Meanwhile the YRG feels isolated because of its exclusion from many of the consultations inside the ruling coalition, especially after the YSP sensed some contradictions between the GPC and the Reform Grouping and thus began to exploit them. However, observers point to a kind of breakthrough toward a solution to the crisis in the light of the mediation efforts made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. They expect a meeting to be held between President Salih and Vice President al-Bid in Cairo at the beginning of next month at the latest to restore stability to Yemen before the unity anniversary on 22 May.
