Jassim al-Manai, chairman-designate of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), said economic ties hinged on the political relationship between the two sides after they end hostility. "It is difficult now to speculate about the role which Israel will play or how Arab countries will build their relations with Israel and what is the shape of this relationship. But such a relationship should be satisfactory for all parties," he told the United Arab Emirates magazine Al-Shuruq. "All this depends on the strategy of Arab countries after the establishment of peace and their ability to benefit from that relationship," he added. "There should be a new Arab concept to work from now to benefit from the coming stage in coordination with the Arab League." Arabs have voiced fears economic integration with Israel will enable it to dominate their economies given its superior industrial power at a time when they are striving to boost their industries to tackle their economic woes. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has proposed a Middle East common market as a measure to boost confidence among the parties involved and achieve prosperity in the volatile but rich region. Talk about a common market intensified after Israel and Palestinians signed an autonomy agreement in Washington on September 13. Syria and Jordan have also been involved in peace negoitations with the Israelis. But despite the progress, Arab governments have resisted pressure from the United States and its western allies to end a 40-year old economic boycott against the Jewish State, arguing the ban would be lifted only when Israel withdraws from the occupied territories. Egypt, tied with Israel in a 15-year old peace treaty, is the only Arab nation to have officially lifted the boycott, which has cost Israel nearly 50 billion dollars in addition to large losses by world companies blacklisted by Arab states for dealing with it. "The establishment of a comprehensive peace will have a great impact on the region," said Manai, whose Abu Dhabi-based AMF is one of the Arab League's biggest financial organisations. "It will boost investors' confidence and the region will become an attractive centre for foreign capital. This will benefit Arab states, especially those which need foreign investment." Egyptian economist Said al-Najjar, one of the best-known economic experts in the Arab world, said he believed a Middle East common market would see light although in the long-run. "Such a market is not an inevitable result of peace but a higher degree of economic cooperation which could be realised in the far future," he told Al-Shuruq. "Arabs should concentrate in the first stage on cooperation with Israel in joint projects in the fields of water, energy and environment."
