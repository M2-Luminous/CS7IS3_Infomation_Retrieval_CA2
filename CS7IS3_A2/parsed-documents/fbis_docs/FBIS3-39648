Inflation stood at 12.3 percent at the end of last year, with an average yearly rate of 13.8 percent, or quadruple the average rate in other European Union member countries (3.2 percent). [passage omitted] The principal structural causes for Greek inflation are: 1. The nature of national expenditures, characterized today by a high rate of consumption and a low rate of savings for investment purposes. The consumerist nature of national expenditures stems from the strong consumer habits of the Greeks, notably those involved in the underground economy who siphon off nearly half of the national income, which thus remains untaxed and is used instead to purchase luxury--especially imported--goods. Another cause is the strong consumerist character of public expenditures, most of which go toward servicing the public debt, whose nature is also inflationary. 2. The rate of savings/investments and their nature. The rate of savings in Greece (15.5 percent) is small in comparison with that of other EU countries (20 percent). In addition, part of the savings remains "sterile" in bank vaults and remains outside the productive process because of the high interest rates paid to depositors and, more generally, because of unfavorable bank loan terms and the difficult access of commercial companies--notably small-and medium-sized firms--to the capital market. On the other hand, part of the "potential" investment funds from accumulated savings is channeled into very attractive income-producing sources, such as state bonds and high-interest private loans (half of the Greeks lend to the other half), rather than into production. As a result of the nature of national savings, only 18.1 percent of GDP is channeled into production, despite the fact that investments in the 23-25 percent range are needed to support the development rate (4 percent) needed to achieve the goals of the Greek economy. However, the problem stems not only from the low rate of investment, but also from its nature. The largest share of investment is channeled into low-productivity projects such as construction and small equipment, while little goes to research, innovation, and improvement of human resources through education and training. The result of the low rate of investment and its inadequate nature is the slow expansion rate of market potential and productivity, leading to "gaps" in production and in supply versus demand, as well as to supply-side inflationary pressures. 3. The basic nature of the Greek economy, characterized by overdevelopment in the field of what is mainly middleman services, the small size of companies, excessive state participation in production, low rates of capital accumulation and modernization, repeated strike-induced interruptions in the production process, absenteism, network and infrastructural dysfunctions, etc. 4. The size and nature of the public debt. With a public debt amounting to 145 percent of GNP, Greece is on the brink of overindebtedness. However, the size of the debt is not so important as its nature. Greece's public debt increased spectacularly after 1980 in order to satisfy the sometimes justified and sometimes irresponsible consumption demands of various groups and of the government, but not the needs of development, which may briefly give rise to inflationary pressures, but also creates the possibility of absorbing such pressures in the medium- and long-term through the national product it generates. As a result, the size and especially the nature of Greece's public debt presently function as a strong structural source of inflationary pressures and inflation. 5. The nature of the budgets has been inflationary for a number of years, with the exception of one or two. The reasons for this inflationary trend are, on the one hand, increasing expenditures in conjunction with structural weaknesses of public expenditures and, on the other hand, a revenue gap. This gap is caused by the citizenry's weak conscience toward paying taxes, the poor structure of the tax system, the lack of efficient tax mechanisms, and the escape of a significant share of the national income--notably the profits from the underground economy--as well as the not uncommon resort to printing money under the pressure of inelastic financial needs. 6. The nature of the markets and the social structure. Because of the existence of business oligopolies and the lack of healthy competition, the markets for good and services, capital, labor, and others are "inflexible" and "protect" themselves through frequent price increases. In addition, Greece's social structure is characterized by deep fragmentation in strongly competing social groups (physicians, lawyers, tradesmen, businessmen, trade unionists, etc.) that aim at satisfying "selfish" interests often incompatible with behavioral patterns serving the national interest. Thus, both the nature of the markets and the social structure lead to tendencies of higher prices, which have strong repercussions on costs of production, and hence to inflation.
