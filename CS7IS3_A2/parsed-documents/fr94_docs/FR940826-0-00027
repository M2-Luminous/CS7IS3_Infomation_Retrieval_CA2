FR940826-0-00027 FR940826-0-00011 The National Potato Promotion Board (Board) administers a national program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen potatoes' competitive position and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets for potatoes and potato products. The program is financed by assessments on producers of 5 or more acres of potatoes (collected by the first handler) and on all imported fresh or processed potatoes for human consumption and seed potatoes (collected by the U.S. Customs Service). There are currently 103 members on the Board: 100 producers, 2 importers, and a public member. Due to the large size of the Board, the Plan authorizes the Board to appoint an Administrative Committee which has the authority to conduct Board business on the Board's behalf. As currently set forth in paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the rules and regulations issued under the Plan, the Board is authorized to appoint up to 27 members to the Administrative Committee which includes 25 producer members, 1 importer member, and the public member. Producer membership on the Administrative Committee is allocated among six regions established in the Board's bylaws on the percentage of U.S. potato production in each region. Since the six regions were established in 1972, potato production in the U.S. has increased and shifted to the extent that the number of producer members in each region is no longer representative of the percentage of production in each region. At its March 20, 1993, annual meeting, the Board directed its Long-Range Planning Subcommittee to study the increase and shifts in potato production to determine whether or not producer member allocation by region was equitable and to recommend corrective action the following year. Using data from the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service, the subcommittee determined that, based on the percentage of U.S. potato production, some regions were under-represented and other regions were over-represented on the Administrative Committee. The subcommittee also determined that if the 25 producer members on the Administrative Committee were apportioned based on current production, some regions would lose representation disproportionately to the decrease in production in that region. Therefore, at the Administrative Committee's January 12, 1994, meeting, the subcommittee presented to the Administrative Committee four proposals for the Administrative Committee's consideration. The Administrative Committee approved a proposal to add 5 producer members to the Administrative Committee and to reallocate the 30 producer members to reflect, as closely as possible, the percentage of U.S. potato production in each region. The proposal approved by the Administrative Committee for presentation to the full Board would increase the total number of Administrative Committee members from 27 to 32 (30 producer members, 1 importer member, and the public member) and would reallocate the 30 producer members among the regions as follows: Northwest, from 8 members to 13; North Central, from 5 members to 6; Northeast, from 5 members to 4; Southwest, from 3 members to 2; South Central, from 2 members to 3; and Southeast, 2 members (no change). This recommendation was presented to and approved by the full Board at the Board's annual meeting on March 18, 1994. The Board approved an amendment to Article VI, Section 1 of the Board's bylaws, which sets forth the allocation of Administrative Committee members, and recommended amending paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the Plan's rules and regulations, which sets forth the number of members and composition of the Administrative Committee. While the Board, with the Secretary's concurrence, may amend its bylaws to reflect changes to the regional boundaries and allocation of the producer members, paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 of the rules and regulations issued under the Plan must be amended to change the number of Board members who may serve on the Administrative Committee. However, U.S. potato production and the distribution of that production among the states is subject to future change which would affect producer representation on the Administrative Committee. Therefore, in order to provide more flexibility to the Board in adjusting the size of its Administrative Committee based on current production trends and, at the same time, eliminate unnecessary rulemaking, this rule amends paragraph (a) of section 1207.507 to provide that the number of producer members on the Administrative Committee be as set forth in the Board's bylaws. This action also revises section 1207.501 of the rules and regulations to reflect the Board's current place of business. In addition, the Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tariff Schedules of the International Trade Commission, at the request of the Department, has revised the statistical reporting requirements for imported potato starch. As a result, Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code numbers which differentiate between imported potato starch for human consumption and imported potato starch for other uses have been established. Paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510 provides the HTS categories and assessment rates on imported tablestock potatoes and frozen or processed potatoes for ultimate consumption by humans and on imported seed potatoes. The Act provides the authority for the Board to assess only those potatoes and potato products intended for human consumption and for use as seed. Because the tariff schedule did not provide a statistical breakout to identify product intended for different uses, the present HTS code number in this section identifying potato starch does not differentiate between the above uses. As a result, it is possible that assessments on potato starch not intended for human consumption are being collected by the U.S. Customs Service on the Board's behalf. Amending this section to list the correct HTS code for potato starch for human consumption will eliminate the need for importers to request a refund from the Board of assessments that might be erroneously collected by Customs on the Board's behalf. Therefore, this rule also amends paragraph (b)(3) of section 1207.510 to reflect the new HTS code number identifying potato starch for human consumption. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.
