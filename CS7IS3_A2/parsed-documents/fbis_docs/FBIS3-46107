In the past five years, the province's grain production basically increased at a slow speed. After 1988 when the province produced over 20 billion kg of grain, the province's grain output has remained at around 22.5 billion kg for the past two years. According to the development plan of the provincial government, the grain output of the province should reach 27.5 billion kg by 2000. This task is extremely arduous. The cotton production situation is even more serious. To this end, the provincial party committee and the provincial government defined that in 1994, the province should strive to turn out 23.5 billion kg while ensuring the production of 23 billion kg of grain, and strive to turn out 500 million kg while ensuring the production of 400 million kg of cotton. The ideas for guiding the province's agricultural work are to realize the target of becoming fairly well-off, to take the overall situation into consideration, to focus on steadily increasing grain and cotton production and increasing the income of the peasants, to deepen reform, to expand the scale of opening up, to make structural readjustment, to perfect systems, to make a breakthrough in science and technology, to vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, and to accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization. Under the guidance of these ideas, this year, we should win a tough battle in grain and cotton production. We should adopt forceful measures to bring about an upswing in cotton production. From this year, the provincial government begins carrying out mandatory planned management of cotton production and distribution and also to sign letters of responsibility with various prefectural and city governments so as to ensure the fulfillment of the cotton production task. The general requirements for this year's grain production are to stabilize the grain and cotton sown areas, to optimize the grain and cotton structure, to improve the quality, and [words indistinct]. The province's grain sown areas should surpass 100 million mu and must not fluctuate by a big margin. We should adopt different techniques to sow wheat on different wheat fields and try every possible means to ensure the scientific management of wheat field. In regard to corn production, we should vigorously carry out the key measures to change the growing forms and change the quality and to increase the input and the density in an effort to set a new record in corn production.
