The university and high school students blocked the capital's Latin Quarter as police sealed off the nearby residence of the prime minister, where he was holding a roundtable meeting on employment with trade union leaders and employers' representatives. The students shouted "Balladur, you've had it. The kids have taken to the streets." Among them was the secretary general of the powerful communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union, Louis Viannet, who walked out of the meeting with the prime minister after he had refused to withdraw his plan. Also among the demonstrators were Communist Party leader Robert Hue and Socialist Party official Jean-Christophe Cambadelis. [passage omitted]
