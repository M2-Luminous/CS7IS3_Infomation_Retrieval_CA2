The French Government has maintained silence about the matter but French and Iranian sources claim that the sudden step was a result of negotiations held in Tehran by French Foreign Ministry Secretary General Serge Boidevaix last fall. The sources said that France requested and got the following three concessions from Iran: 1. That Tehran will not encourage acts of violence on French territory nor against French interests abroad for a period extending at least until the French presidential election date in May 1995. 2. That Tehran will undertake to considerably reduce its aid, particularly financial and military aid, to the Algerian "Afghans." 3. That Tehran will agree to bring to trial four Iranians accused of killing Shahpur Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime minister under the Shah, in 1991. Saud Hindi Zadeh, Khomeyni's nephew, is one of those who will stand trial later this month. The two released Iranians are Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi. They are believed to be senior officers in the Iranian security organ Savama. They were accused of planning to kill Kazem Rajavi, the Iranian leader opposed to the mullas who lived abroad, in 1991 in Geneva. [passage omitted]
