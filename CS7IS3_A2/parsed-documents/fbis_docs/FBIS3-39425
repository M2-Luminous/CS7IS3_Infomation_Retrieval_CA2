General Michael Rose, commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, jokes about my means of transportation in Sarajevo. It is a bicycle and is ideal for moving around quickly. The man who will bear most of the responsibility of deciding whether to launch the NATO air strikes, came to greet me personally at the entrance to UN headquarters. Rose is courteous but determined as a result of the years spent in the special British forces. Born in 1940 in Quetta, now in Pakistan, he began his military career at an early age with the paratroopers. His curriculum includes numerous assignments in the Middle East and the Far East, in Northern Ireland, and at the command of the 22nd Special Air Force Regiment, which he led to reconquer the Falklands/Malvinas in 1982. [Poggiali] Are you concerned about this new mission, General? [Rose] It is indeed a delicate and complex mission. It is not a matter of defeating an adversary, but of preventing the continuation of the war and a downturn in the situation. Our strategy will be mapped out by the Security Council resolutions, and we must closely abide by its instructions. [Poggiali] But almost none of the contenders seems to want to respect the resolutions. [Rose] After two years of war, the conflicting parties are extremely suspicious of one another, and it is our duty to do all that we can to open talks. [Poggiali] A few days ago you threatened to sweep away the Bosnian Serbs' roadblock on the way to the airport yourselves. This is a change in style compared to the previous UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] attitude. [Rose] Unfortunately, we must deal with a large number of extremists who are trying to impose their will. We are also here to put a stop to such situations and, if obliged to do so, are also ready to resort to weapons. These are drastic decisions but nobody should doubt our will to bring to conclusion the mission with which we have been entrusted. Some of the best soldiers in the world are under my command, and we are also taking steps to strengthen the contingent: For example, the first tanks at the disposal of this mission, the Leopard tanks, are scheduled to arrive soon. [Poggiali] The contingent is scattered over most of Bosnia; some of your divisions are isolated and could be the object of Serbian reprisals in case of an air strike. [Rose] Obviously we have elaborated plans for any type of eventuality. On our side we know that we can count on a formidable air capacity and on the possibility of performing airborne operations, both because of the mobility of the units and the quick dispatch of reinforcements. The last person to challenge the United Nations, Saddam Husayn, was severely punished; therefore it would be better if everybody abided by the United Nations' desires.
