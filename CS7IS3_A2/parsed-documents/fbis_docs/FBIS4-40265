The forum was convened at the initiative and under the patronage of President Akayev. It is not by chance that Akayev is taking an active part in all the events of the forum. Last Saturday [11 June] was a really Russian day in Akayev's life. Apart from his speech at the opening ceremony and his interested participation in a roundtable discussion on Russians in Kyrgyzstan, Akayev also spoke at the opera and ballet house during a solemn evening devoted to the 195th anniversary of Pushkin. On the eve of the forum, in a conversation with Mikhail Romanov, ambassador of Russia to Kyrgyzstan, Akayev noted that it would have been much better not to exchange reprimands addressed to each other but to get together and to discuss in full detail the problems connected with the life of the Russian and other Slavic peoples in Kyrgyzstan. The president has done his part to hold a discussion that is highly useful. First, a large group of the forum's participants was brought from Moscow to Bishkek at his personal invitation and on his personal plane--a group that included renowned political scientists, historians, lawyers, sociologists, former state figures who worked in Kyrgyzstan, and Russian and foreign journalists. [passage omitted] Second, and important, the president provided the right direction for the discussion in his speech at the opening of the forum. This speech, in the opinion of the forum's many participants, was very deep, frank, and intellectually rich, as well as thought-provoking, analytical, and scientific, and it was based on facts and arguments rather than on emotions. Discussing the Republic's economic prospects, Akayev said he had to be honest with his people and to admit that Kyrgyzstan would remain at the outskirts of the world economy for a long time--at least for the next 10 years. The Republic is not able to maintain its production structure and its infrastructure at the moment and has been forced to eliminate a number of specific areas of more or less outdated production and stop them. Akayev said that Kyrgyzstan does not have any other way out. The population's living standard is very low. Possibilities to save on wage payments and on turnover capital attract foreign investors to us. Nevertheless, the profit of such investments is reduced to zero because of very low skill and labor productivity levels. In a nutshell, it is difficult to expect that the rating of our Republic will sharply increase with regard to foreign investments in the next 10-15 years. I cannot avoid speaking about such issues as the impoverishment of our liberal arts intelligentsia and the reduction of the number of students, coupled with the decreased quality of training, Akayev said. The "Kyrgyzstan is Our Common Home" forum will end on 17 June.
