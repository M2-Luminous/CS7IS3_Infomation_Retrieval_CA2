The figures were up 0.5 percentage point from the increase recorded a year earlier for consumer prices and 0.7 percentage point for producer prices, largely due to higher oil, cigarette and farm prices. Farm prices rose 3.7 percent and livestock prices went up 1.7 percent, while fish prices dipped 0.3 percent. Fresh food prices as a whole surged 3.9 percent compared with the 3.6 percent registered in January last year. Processed food prices inched up 0.7 percent and public utility charges increased 1.3 percent. Steel prices rose, while the prices of whiskey, video-tape recorders and ready-made concrete fell. Chong Chae-yong, the Economic Planning Board official in charge of price policy, on Tuesday blamed higher cigarette and oil taxes and the lean crops caused by last year's cold summer for the sharp consumer price hike in January, but said prices would stablize in the second quarter to record a six-percent increase for the whole of this year, the same inflation level as last year.
