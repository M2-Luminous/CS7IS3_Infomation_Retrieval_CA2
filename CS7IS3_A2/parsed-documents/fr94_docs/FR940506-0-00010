FR940506-0-00010 FR940506-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;02] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Saint George Island, AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. A Non-Directional Beacon/Distance Measuring Equipment (NDB/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the new St. George Airport at Saint George Island Controlled airspace extending from 700 and 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach and departure procedures. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Robert C. Durand, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;531, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 W. 7th Ave. # 14, Anchorage, AK, 99513&hyph;7587; telephone number: (907) 271&hyph;5898. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 10 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK. (59 FR 12874.) A SIAP was being developed for the New St. George Airport at Saint George Island. The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet and 1200 feet AGL for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700/1200 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Saint George Island, AK, to provide controlled airspace from 700/1200 feet AGL for aircraft executing the NDB/DME SIAP and departure procedures into and out of the New St. George Airport at Saint George Island. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
