FR941004-2-00015 FR941004-2-00007 [A&hyph;508&hyph;807] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Israel AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Gary Bettger or Jennifer Yeske, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;2239 or 482&hyph;0189, respectively. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We have preliminarily determined that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the ``Act''). The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred: On April 14, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( See ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;690, 59 FR 18825 (April 20, 1994)). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b) (1994), the Department issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Pipe Fittings Carmiel, Ltd. (``Carmiel'') on April 29, 1994, as it accounted for over 60 percent of the merchandise sold in the United States during the POI. Carmiel was the only exporter from Israel of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI. On June 30, 1994, the petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). On August 4, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances with regard to imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Israel. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that while a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (``POI'') is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. Product Comparisons Carmiel sold identical products in both Israel and the United States during the POI. Therefore, in making our fair value comparisons, we compared sales of merchandise identical in all respects. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether Carmiel's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade. United States Price Because Carmiel's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act. We calculated Carmiel's PP sales based on packed C.I.f. prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for marine insurance, ocean freight, foreign inland freight, port fees, and customs agents fees and expenses.
