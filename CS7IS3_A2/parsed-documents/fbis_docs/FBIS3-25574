Speaking after a tour of Soweto and Noordgezicht, Mr. Meyer said the government would have to take care in protecting the electoral process, so that every party and every voter could participate freely. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Conrad Burke] A little battle of the bands greeted Mr. Meyer when he opened the National Party's [NP] Dube office, but the ANC [African National Congress] supporters' protest was drowned out by the NP's drums. Mr. Meyer said it was the first time in history that a NP cabinet minister had campaigned in Soweto. [Meyer] The fact that we are here is proof of free political participation by all, especially also by us as the NP in Soweto. [Burke] Then the NP flag went through the streets of Soweto. At the Mafolo community center Mr. Meyer underwent the ritual of traditional healers. It was described as an act of reconciliation, to introduce the NP to the ancestors. It was a small gathering, but there was some voluble support. [Unidentified NP supporter] I'm going forward with the NP. I'm dying for the NP. I am not scared. I'm a mother of 59 years, but I'm still Johnny Walker. I'm still strong. [Burke] A short snack at a roadside mealie [corn] store, and the entourage visited the colored community of Noordgezicht. The people here took to the Meyer charisma. One of the highlights of the tour was the signing up of the NP's oldest supporter, Mr. Niklaas Amsterdam, on his 107th birthday. Addressing newsmen here, Mr. Meyer touched on the constitutional road ahead. [Meyer] We have every reason, first of all, to go ahead in ensuring that we proceed with the democratic process on the basis of a valid constitution, and secondly, to enable all parties and every individual in the country to participate in the elections. I believe we have all the right to do so. [end recording]
