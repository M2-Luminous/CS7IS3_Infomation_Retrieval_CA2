There are questions on how to eliminate the bottleneck that is embodied in reduced economic efficiency and in loss of the ability to overcome financial, administrative, organizational, production, and marketing problems, strangleholds, and obstacles in most public business sector companies. How can these problems be eliminated so as to achieve the desired reform and so holding companies and subsidiaries can move forth and keep pace with the economic awakening that is underlined by the public policies and by the development and growth strategies? Regarding an urgent prescription for reform and cure, AL-USBU' AL-IQTISADI [Economic Weekly] has interviewed accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh, executive vice chairman of the Chemical Industries Holding Companies. Al-Shaykh has emphasized a main fact that he believes is extremely significant and without which it will be difficult to accomplish the desired leap. This fact is connected with the inevitability of a prompt evaluation of the capability of all leaders of holding and subsidiary public business sector companies. This evaluation has to be made according to scientific, sophisticated, and unconventional criteria in order to measure accomplishment and lack of accomplishment and so as to replace all leaders who have not accomplished and who have not been able to rise to the level demanded by the phase calling for a fundamental reform of the conditions. The call for comprehensive change is not connected with individuals. It is connected primarily to modern and sophisticated selection criteria that focus on new and vigilant leaders who possess scientific and technical ability; who have international and domestic experience; who are capable of advanced modern management; who have the potential for creative initiatives; and who will shoulder the responsibility of building for the future. This requires opening the way for a new generation of leaders who believe that their future is tied to effective and serious reform and that success is the only means to prove their existence, to survive, and to participate effectively in building for long periods to come. On the basis of his long financial experience in drafting and reviewing the state's general budget and of the budgets and plans of the industry sector and of public business sector companies, accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh notes that the problems existing in holding and subsidiary companies are of extremely great dimensions and that a large part of these problems is the legacy of long years of faulty policies and of procrastination in implementing a comprehensive reform program. But the immensity of the problems does not at all mean that reform is impossible or unlikely. It means primarily that reform needs leaders who are highly aware of the problems and of the numerous solutions to deal with the problems according to the new conditions and circumstances and according to policies that are based on free economy and market economics--policies that are very far from the conventional concepts that have dominated the system of management and of dealing with the public business sector for long years. This means that there is a need to replace the administrative concepts and to enlist the help of leaders capable of responding and clinging to, embracing, and implementing the new concepts. This is because the administrative concepts that existed prior to the liberation of the public business sector companies are not fit or beneficial. The conventional pattern of ministerial intervention and the adoption of executive decrees to bolster reform are no longer adequate, absolutely. Reform is bolstered soundly by that which emanates from within the holding companies and subsidiaries and from the possibilities of exploiting the available resources and capabilities with a mentality based on dealing with the market challenges, on competition, and on the new methods to confront problems. This mentality makes it possible for every company to overcome its negative conditions and to move to new and much better conditions. This mentality achieves reform for the companies and, at the same time, achieves the desired reform of the general economic structure. Because of the enormous total size of the public business sector, especially of the production, construction, and building sections and of most of the vital service sections, reforming this sector will certainly reflect very positively on the economic situation generally and will inevitably provide positive indicators that support the comprehensive reform program. These indicators will bolster the program, accelerate its steps, reinforce its successes, banish many mistaken and faulty concepts from the national economy's management, and enhance the capability and efficiency of this management. Accountant Muhammad al-Shaykh proposes the introduction of prompt amendments to the executive bylaws of the public business sector companies so as to achieve a fundamental change in the structure of holding companies' boards of directors and so that vice chairmen will be appointed to these boards. This is because in all holding companies, the position of executive board chairman has been combined with the position of commissioned board member, thus making it possible to determine clearly the responsibility for managing the holding company's executive work and giving the commissioned member the opportunity to participate in the executive board as an original member. This combining of positions also underlines the importance of preparing the periodic reports stipulated in the executive bylaws on the positions of the public business sector companies and the importance of submitting these reports to the Cabinet regularly through the public business sector minister. The submission of these periodic reports offers the Cabinet a constant opportunity to familiarize itself with these companies' problems, to debate them, and to make the necessary decisions on them. The various ministries should be made partly responsible for [implementing] these decisions so there will be no delay in reform and in dealing with problems. The reports also offer the Cabinet a full opportunity to familiarize itself with deficiencies and flaws and with excesses and violations. They give the public business sector minister the opportunity to confront problems and to introduce the necessary changes among leaders and the necessary amendments to rules and regulations. The [new] rules and regulations are still not enacted even though they are necessary and important for creating the desired climate to enhance work efficiency, to free bureaucratic work, and to enhance the level of organization and management. Enacting the rules and regulations will ensure that the spirit of the business sector law is achieved. It will also guarantee the effective implementation of this law's objectives. To date, the real situation falls far short of approaching and accomplishing these objective capably and effectively.
