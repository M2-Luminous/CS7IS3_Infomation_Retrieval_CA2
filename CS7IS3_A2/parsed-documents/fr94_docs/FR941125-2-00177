FR941125-2-00177 FR941125-2-00121 `` The mission of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program is to establish and support a U.S. network of designated biosphere reserves that are fully representative of the biogeographical areas of the United States. The program promotes a sustainable balance among the conservation of biological diversity, compatible economic use, and cultural values, through public and private partnerships, interdisciplinary research, education, and communication.'' Focal Issues Within the mission of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program, the directorate seeks to support two to four conferences in 1995. A wide range of conference and workshop topics are eligible. For example: A forum for Biosphere Reserves stakeholders at a single Biosphere Reserves unit or cluster of units; a regional or local vision setting workshop; or a conference for Biosphere Reserves stakeholders from throughout a region focusing on an issue or management approach of shared interest. Other ideas for conferences and workshop topics promoting the mission of Biosphere Reserves are welcome. The U.S. Biosphere Reserve Directorate also intends to support three to six partnership projects in 1995. Proposals are sought which strengthen cooperative relationships for enhancing the functions of Biosphere Reserves. Innovative and new approaches to conservation challenges will be given priority. Examples of eligible projects could include: Assessing natural or cultural resources; building public support for conservation and sustainable development; fostering demonstrations of cooperative ecosystem management or, developing local planning mechanisms. Other ideas for partnership projects that promote the mission of Biosphere Reserves are welcome. Feasibility studies of expanding the activities of existing Biosphere Reserves to more fully implement the regional, ecosystem-based mission of the BR program also are encouraged. However, feasibility studies for designating new Biosphere Reserve units are ineligible. Proposals may include a request for staff support only if the proposal and the staff position are related to expanding the regional activities of a Biosphere Reserve or promoting a cooperative program involving multiple agencies and nongovernmental partners. Proposal Content Each proposal should have a title page and a one page synopsis of the proposal activities. A maximum of three additional pages should describe: (1) The affected Biosphere Reserve or Biosphere Reserve Cluster; (2) the applicant's relationship to the Biosphere Reserve; (3) the proposed conference or partnership project; (4) how the proposed conference or project relates to past, current, and projected BR activities at the site; (5) how the proposal complies generally and specifically with the evaluation criteria; and (6) how the results of the conference or activity will be evaluated. All proposals must also include a one page itemized budget including personnel, travel, operation, equipment/supplies with justification. The budget page should show the status of any matching funds to the proposed activity. A one-page map of the affected Biosphere Reserve, showing if possible, the BR zonation and if applicable, the site of the proposed activities must be included. The last page of the proposal should be a one-page letter of endorsement from the Biosphere Reserve manager or managers. If the proposed activity would involve or benefit more than one Biosphere Reserve, one page letters of endorsement should indicate the support of the managers of the involved or affected Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere Reserve managers should endorse no more than one single proposal in each funding category this year. Evaluation and Review Process A review panel of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Directorate will evaluate proposals based upon the following criteria: _Alignment of the proposal with the mission and goals of the United States Biosphere Reserve Program as defined in the ``Strategic Plan for the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program'' dated November 1994, available from the U.S. MAB Secretariat, (address below); _Likelihood that the proposal will result in tangible progress within a year toward promoting cooperative regional, ecosystem based initiatives that integrate conservation and sustainable development at Biosphere Reserve sites; _Demonstrated local support for the project; _Innovation in implementing Biosphere Reserve functions;
