But this does not mean inactivity. At approximately 1400 today, the president held a meeting with members of the national security cabinet: National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan, Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor, Attorney General Diego Valadez, Federal District Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevillo, and National Security General Director Jorge Tello Pon. Although we do not have any official information on this meeting, we believe the president and his officials must have discussed, among other matters, the appointment of Dr. Cordoba Montoya as Mexico's new permanent representative to the Inter-American Development Bank, headquartered in Washington; the general situation in the country; Chiapas issues; Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder; and, quite probably, how Mexico and especially Mexico City will get along in the coming days. Although it has not been officially announced, it seems President Salinas de Gortari will take a few days of rest after all and go to Agualeguas, Nuevo Leon. This is one of two times during the year that he takes a holiday. This has not been officially confirmed, but it seems everything is ready for him in Agualeguas. Therefore, he must have talked with his officials about how things will go in Mexico City during his probable absence.
