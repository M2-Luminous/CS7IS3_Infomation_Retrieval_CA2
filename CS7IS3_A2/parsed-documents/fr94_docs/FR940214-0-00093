FR940214-0-00093 FR940214-0-00015 Waiting Period (Interim Provision) The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of the law become effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to apply on November 30, 1998. The Act imposes a waiting period of 5 business days (defined in the statute as days on which State offices are open) before a licensee may sell or deliver a handgun. As defined in the Act, the term ``handgun'' means_ (A) a firearm which has a short stock and is designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and (B) any combination of parts from which a firearm described in subparagraph (A) can be assembled. Basically, the waiting period provision makes it unlawful for any licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual (transferee), unless the licensee_ (1) Obtains a statement of the transferee's intent to obtain a handgun containing the transferee's name, address, and date of birth appearing on a valid photo identification, a description of the identification document, a statement that the transferee is not a felon, under indictment, or otherwise prohibited from receiving or possessing the handgun under Federal law, and the date the statement is made; (2) Verifies the identity of the transferee by examining the identification document presented; (3) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement, contacts the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee and advises such officer of the contents of the statement; (4) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the statement, transmits to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee a copy of the statement; and (5) Waits 5 business days from the date the licensee furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer before transferring the handgun to the transferee (during which period the licensee has not received information from the chief law enforcement officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would be in violation of law); or receives notice from the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee that the officer has no information that the transferee's receipt or possession of the handgun would violate the law. In addition to the items in (1) above, the regulations request certain additional optional information about the transferee to facilitate the transfer of a handgun and assist law enforcement officials in verifying the transferee's eligibility to possess a handgun. This optional information includes the social security number, height, weight, sex, and place of birth of the transferee. The optional information will help minimize the misidentification of handgun purchasers as felons or other prohibited persons whose receipt and possession of firearms violate the law. For example, this information would distinguish the transferee from a prohibited buyer having the same name and date of birth as the transferee and, therefore, help expedite the transfer. Subsequent to the sale or transfer of the handgun, the law requires a licensee, who receives a report from the chief law enforcement officer containing information that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee violates Federal, State, or local law, shall within 1 day communicate any information the licensee has concerning the transfer to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of business of the licensee and to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee. As provided in the Act, the term ``chief law enforcement officer'' means ``the chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.'' The law requires that the chief law enforcement officer within 5 business days make a reasonable effort to determine whether the transferee is prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the handgun sought to be purchased. Except for records relating to a proposed handgun sale that would violate the law, law enforcement officers are required to destroy within 20 days the purchaser's statement, any record containing information derived from the statement, and any record created as a result of the notice referred to in (3) above. Furthermore, these records may only be used to carry out the purposes of the Act, and no information in the records may be conveyed to any person for purposes other than complying with the Act.
