ACTION: Interim rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense has amended the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to prohibit the use of Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Defense appropriated funds for acquisition of aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are manufactured in the United States. DATES: Effective Date: March 7, 1994. Comment Date: Comments on the interim DFARS rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before May 13, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D307 in all correspondence related to this issue. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, ATTN: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, OUSD(A&T)DP(DAR), IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 697&hyph;9845. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 697&hyph;7266. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 8090 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139) prohibits use of Fiscal Year 1994 appropriated funds for acquisition of aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are manufactured in the United States. The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94&hyph;003, March 7, 1994, to implement the restriction on acquisition of aircraft fuel cells in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act applies but is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the revisions are limited to acquisition of aircraft fuel cells, and limit such acquisitions to U.S. manufacturers. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. This action is necessary because section 8090 became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139), on November 11, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.
