Meanwhile the oblast prosecutor's office has protested against the decrees because they do not accord with the Russian Constitution and the president's edicts. But the governor has rejected the prosecutor's office protest and has pretended not to notice the critical comments made by communists, agrarians, and even "Democratic Russia" supporters -- incidentally, to date the last-named group had supported Podgornov. Since the regional elections complete the reform of the authorities, they should calm the political situation. But no -- the Vologda people have become even more worried. "I am disturbed that the constitutional principle of the separation of powers has been violated," Albert Volkov, senior physician from the city of Sokol and candidate for the oblast Duma, says. "Administration employees have been allowed to run for the oblast Duma. I am afraid that our representative authority will be swallowed up by the executive." Volkov's fear is not without foundation. Eighteen officials from the oblast and rayon administrations have been registered as candidates for the 115 deputies' seats in the oblast Duma. But experience of previous elections shows that authority members have incomparably greater chances of winning electors' votes than ordinary candidates. But while the oblast Duma's future depends, if only to a small extent, on Vologda inhabitants' choice, Podgornov has unconditionally subordinated local self-government organs to the executive branch. Under a statute approved by him, the dumas in Vologda and Cherepovets will be run by the heads of these cities' administrations, appointed by the governor. As for rayon assemblies, they are generally being formed from leaders of village and settlement administrations. Podgornov has abolished representative authority in the ancient cities of Totma, Belozersk, Velikiy Ustyug, Kirillov, and Ustyuzhna, where it has existed for centuries. The governor has called a referendum on the adoption of an oblast charter at the same time as the elections on 20 March. The draft of this fundamental law for the Vologda region has been prepared by a narrow circle of people appointed by Podgornov. Representatives of parties and movements were not allowed to work on the project and, when the document was finally published at the end of February, they saw that their worst fears had come true. "I personally cannot vote for this charter," Sergey Smirnov, a leader of the Vologda branch of "Democratic Russia," says. "Property must be under the control of two branches: The representative branch disposes and the executive manages. But under the draft charter the possession, use, disposal, and management of all the oblast's property is effected by the executive branch in the person of the governor. That is nothing but dictatorship. In the opinion of Russian presidential representative Guriy Sudakov, the draft charter preserves the idea of separatism, which the oblast Soviet tried to implement by proclaiming the "Vologda Republic" in May 1993. All the oblast's natural resources are proclaimed the exzclusive property of those who live here, while there is not a word about Russia. And the governor -- the effective owner of the Vologda region -- is distanced from the federal authorities: Under the Vologda charter he cannot be removed from his post even by the Russian president. The oblast has over 900,000 voters, yet the administration printed the draft charter only in its newspaper KRASNYY SEVER, whose print run is only 29,000 copies. So Vologda inhabitants are familiar with the proposals it contains only through hearsay. When RUSSKIY SEVER, another Vologda newspaper, ventured to speak critically of the governor's actions, at a press conference Podgornov called journalists a corrupt group of people trying to discredit him on Moscow's orders and receiving very large sums of money for doing so. The governor's monologue was immediately shown by the "Vologda" television channel. According to RUSSKIY SEVER journalists the governor is determined to "remove" Chief Editor Vladimir Pantsyrev from the newspaper and, if the editorial office opposes this, to evict it from its building, which is oblast property.
