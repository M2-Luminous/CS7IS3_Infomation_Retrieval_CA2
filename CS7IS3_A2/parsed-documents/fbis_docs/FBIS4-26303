Meanwhile legal experts have told the government the package of measures does not go far enough nor comply with Hong Kong's Bill of Rights. Secretary for Home Affairs Michael Suen told the Sunday Hong Kong Standard yesterday that it was up to Beijing to bring forward its concerns to the government. "I think the initiative does not lie with us," Mr Suen said. "We have taken the first step and informed them." The government announced last week it would give individuals access to their personal files and establish a British-style code of practice covering the release of official data. But Chinese officials -- who were not consulted over the move -- lashed out on Friday, warning the measures breached the Joint Declaration. Deputy director of Xinhua News Agency Cheung Kwok Hung reiterated last night that China had not been consulted on the proposals, which Beijing would dissolve after 1997. "If there is such a great change of policy without discussion with the Chinese side, we will not accept it," he said. Mr Suen played down the latest rift in Sino-British relations and said consultations would resolve the problem. "I think all they (China) are saying is that they need to be consulted," Mr Suen said. "That should allay any fears. It is a whole package of measures which will improve the efficiency of the civil service, something I believe both governments want." The government's package, which does not go so far as to give Hong Kong people a legal right to obtain information on government operations, has angered key backers of Freedom of Information legislation who say the proposals are toothless. Senior Hong Kong lecturer in constitutional law Nihal Jayawickrama said Section 16 of the Bill of Rights gives people the right to seek information. "When you create the right to seek information from the government there is a corresponding right by the government to provide that information," he said. Dr Jayawickrama said there would be grounds for a court battle if an individual was refused information by the government. "But the government is securely protected by those exorbitant (court) fees," he said. Mr Suen disagreed. "There is no obligation for an unwilling party to give information," he said.
