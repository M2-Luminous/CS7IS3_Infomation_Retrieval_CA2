The Peace Corps, which returned to Chile in July 1991, signed agreements with about 30 national organizations without creating any controversies until last week, when ACHM Chairman Jaime Ravinet signed an agreement with the corps. Political party leaders reacted by saying they do not accept new U.S. intervention in municipal affairs. Jaime Insunza of the Chilean Communist Party, Councilman Herman Chadwick of the Independent Democratic Union, and Senator Ricardo Nunez of the Socialist Party criticized the agreement. Insunza and Chadwick agree that the Peace Corps presence in Chile was a form of "intervention." Chadwick said: "The U.S. policy toward Latin America in the 1960's was based on the Alliance for Progress. Its relation with us was of protectionism. This allowed the U.S. Government to intervene directly in the Latin American countries that were poorer and less developed socially and politically." Jaime Insunza said: "I believe the main problem is that the corps represented a flagrant intervention in the Chilean social process that went against the interests of the national majorities." Sen. Ricardo Nunez prefers to be more cautious. He said the main problem with the corps is that it is an obsolete organization. He believes there should be an exchange between Chilean municipal governments and municipal governments in other countries. He added: "My criticism is not aimed at the cooperation itself but at the fact that instruments that are no longer part of the international scene should not be used. The Peace Corps, no matter how reorganized, is something from the past that already has been overcome." Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet reacted angrily because he believes an agreement of this type should not revive the controversy of the 1960's. He said those who will come will not be youngsters with romantic ideas about how to help an underdeveloped country. He added: "The municipalities will get people with high academic training and vast labor experience."
