FR941013-1-00073 FR941013-1-00010 c. Existing Land Disposal Units. The MACT floor for existing land disposal units at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities is determined to be no disposal of wastes that contain equal to or greater than 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration in open land disposal units. No data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination of the type of air emission controls used on the top 12 percent of land disposal units located at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities or the VOHAP concentration of the wastes disposed of in these units. However, since most of the facilities operating land disposal units included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also hazardous waste TSDF, many of the land disposal units are subject to treatment standards under the RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDR) codified in 40 CFR part 268. The LDR treatment standards require hazardous waste TSDF owners and operators to treat certain types of hazardous waste to reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific chemicals contained in the waste before the owner or operator can place the waste in a surface impoundment, land treatment unit, landfill, or wastepile. The treatment standards of the RCRA LDR are established by requiring treatment below constituent specific concentration limits that vary by type of hazardous waste or by requiring use of specific treatment processes. Many of the chemicals for which LDR treatment standards have been established are also listed as HAP. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control technology for the existing land disposal unit MACT floor is treatment of wastes to remove or destroy organic HAP in the waste prior to placing the waste in the land disposal unit. Treatment of the waste to reduce the organic HAP concentration to a level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor for existing land disposal units based on the same reasoning used in determining the MACT floors determined for existing tanks and containers (i.e., to distinguish those units with little or no potential to emit organic HAP). The degree of air emission control achieved by placing a waste with a VOHAP concentration above 100 ppmw in tanks and containers using air emission controls would be lost if these wastes are ultimately allowed to be placed in land disposal units without first removing or destroying the organic HAP to a level consistent with the level used to apply air emission controls to tanks and containers. d. Existing Process Vents. The MACT floor for process vents used on treatment processes subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP is determined to be application of air emission controls on each affected process used to treat wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as determined at the point where the material enters the facility. All process vents on an affected process are to be connected through a closed-vent system to a control device with a minimum 95 percent organic HAP emission control efficiency. As previously explained, most facilities in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also hazardous waste TSDF. Distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping processes that are treating hazardous waste at these TSDF are subject to the existing RCRA air emission standards for process vents under 40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA (hereafter referred to in this notice as the ``subpart AA rules''). The EPA concluded that it is not appropriate to directly transfer the air emission control requirements of the subpart AA rules to the MACT floor for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, this MACT floor is based on adapting, to the extent applicable and relevant, the air emission control requirements of the subpart AA rules. The subpart AA rules require a TSDF owner or operator to identify all process vents associated with distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping processes that are treating hazardous waste having an annual average total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 ppmw (i.e., vents affected by the subpart AA rules). Total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected vents must be determined. The total facility process vent emission rate must then be compared to two specified emission rate limits (3 pounds of total organic emission per hour and 3.1 tons of total organic emission per year) to determine whether the owner or operator must use additional air emission controls for the affected vents. If the total facility process vent emission rate exceeds either of the specified emission limits, then the owner or operator is required to implement control measures that will reduce total facility process vent organic emissions to below both of the emission limit levels, or to install air emission controls to reduce total facility process vent organic emissions by at least 95 weight percent.
