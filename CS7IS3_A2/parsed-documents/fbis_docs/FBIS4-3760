FBIS4-3760 "drchi079_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Taiwan SEF Requests More ARATS Information SEF Requests More ARATS Information OW2404045394 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network in Mandarin 2300 GMT 22 Apr 94 OW2404045394 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network Mandarin BFN [From the "Hookup" program] [Text] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] in a letter formally informed the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] on 22 April about the details of the Chientao [Qiandao] Lake tragedy. The SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] held an urgent meeting to discuss the letter. They decided that the investigation results provided by Communist China were not acceptable because they failed to provide reasonable answers to some doubts raised by the victims' families and our relevant departments. The MAC authorized the SEF to reply in a letter today to express the hope that the mainland authorities will send us all information, including records of the investigation, and to once again express a strong demand that a special meeting between the SEF and the ARATS be held in Hong Kong on 27 April as scheduled. The MAC also said: If Communist China does not provide a reasonable explanation, the MAC will when necessary release the report compiled by our investigating group and compare it with the one compiled by Communist China. Here is Liu Yu-mei's report: [Begin recording] After newspapers in Hong Kong carried detailed stories about the Chientao Lake incident, the ARATS informed the SEF in a written message on 22 April and provided a relatively concrete report. In the letter, the SEF said: Wu Li-hong [Wu Lihong], Hu Chih-han [Hu Zhihan], and Yu Ai-chun [Yu Aijun] plotted as early as last year to rob tourists on Chientao Lake by using a motorboat. On 31 March, they climbed aboard the Haijui [Hairui] tourist boat and committed the crimes of robbery, murder, and arson which caused 32 deaths. The letter pointed out: After a 17-day investigation, the case was brought to light. The police retrieved $5,250, 154,000 new Taiwan dollars, a video camera, six cameras, eight rings, one jade bracelet, and two Rolex watches. The SEF was not satisfied with the report. SEF Deputy Secretary General Shih Chi-ping said that the information revealed by the ARATS was only partial in nature. He expressed his hope that the mainland will provide more detailed facts and that it will promptly answer in clear terms whether the two parties will hold special cross-strait consultations on this case. [Shih] It is our hope that the ARATS will provide us with more detailed information so that we can have a better understanding of this case. We also hope that they will give us a clear answer as soon as possible concerning the request stated in our previous letter. [Liu] Shih Chi-ping said that the MAC and the SEF will respond to the ARATS' letter in the near future. This is Liu Yu-mei reporting from the SEF. [end recording]
