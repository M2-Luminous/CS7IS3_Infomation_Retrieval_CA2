Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee, held discussions with some of the representatives to the meeting prior to the conclusion of the meeting. The forum was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee. Following the briefings presented by representatives from Sixian County, Fuyang Prefecture, and Wuhu city on current political and legal work, Lu Rongjing delivered a speech in which he emphasized the need for various levels of party committees to enhance in a down-to-earth manner political and legal work in the new situation. Lu Rongjing said it is necessary to seriously study political and legal work, which are confronted by new conditions and new issues in the new situation, and to pay attention to exploring a pattern for political and legal work. Increasing economic activities and an increasing flow of people have created opportunities for criminal elements whose sole purpose is to rip people off. Touching on the policy of "promoting the reform and opening drive with one hand and cracking down on severe crimes with the other," Lu Rongjing noted that some localities and some comrades have still been unable to properly put theory into practice; they have failed to crack down really hard on criminals. Some localities are weak in grass-roots work and fail to do a good job in the comprehensive management of social order, which create loopholes in social order work. Problems in the readjusted relationship between interests brought about by reform and increases in the number of ideological and work-related problems could produce new contradictions if they are not properly dealt with. Generally speaking, the quality of the contingent of political and legal workers is good. But in ideology, in work, and in work style, there still are areas which have not adapted to the needs of the times. All levels of party committees and political and legal departments must remain sober-minded. To be sure, they should be aware of the excellent situation in the current efforts to deepen reform and to accelerate development, but they should also make full preparations to cope with factors of instability, to formulate good countermeasures in advance according to changes in the situation, to maintain political stability using all possible means, and to help to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Lu Rongjing said that to strengthen the political and legal work in the new situation, it is necessary to persist in the policy of a "two-handed approach" and to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to unify our thinking and to guide our actions. We need to get really serious about the "two-handed approach." We should, on the one hand, stress the building of material civilization, and on the other hand, we should emphasize the building of spiritual civilization. While persisting in the policy of a "severe crackdown," we should step up efforts to enhance the comprehensive management of social order; namely, we should deal with the root cause and symptoms of crime at the same time. While making efforts to improve the greater social environment, we should strive for personal improvement. It is necessary to stress grass-roots work. The macro- and micro-level relationship should be handled correctly. It is also necessary to stress building a legal system on the one hand and to emphasize building up organizations on the other. Lu Rongjing used the two Chinese characters "jia qiang" [enhancement] to emphasize the need for the party committee to strengthen leadership over political and legal work. He urged all levels of party committees to do a good in the following areas: first, enhance leadership of political and legal cadres in their theoretical study, and use theory to arm them and help them increase their understanding of the importance of political and legal work. Second, enhance investigation and study; analyze the state of political and legal work in localities; formulate problem-solving measures; and improve work. Third, devote more efforts to political and legal work and adopt a comprehensive view on political and legal work. Fourth, show concern for cadres involved in political and legal work; support them ideologically; give them support in work; help them to solve practical difficulties in daily life; and help political and legal departments solve difficulties encountered in enforcing the law. Fifth, improve the management and education of political and legal cadres and constantly raise the overall quality of those involved in political and legal work. It is necessary to seriously treat and deal with problems that exist among those who are involved in political and legal work. We must be resolute in removing a small minority of people who are not adapted to the work of political and legal departments. When coming to the issue of giving full play to the functions and roles of political and legal departments, Lu Rongjing pointed out that the political and legal committee is entrusted by the party committee with taking charge of political and legal work. In addition to fulfilling the primary task of implementing the party's principles and policy on political and legal work, the other tasks of the political and legal committee include doing a good job of organization and coordination in the day-to-day work of the political and legal system as stipulated by the law; supervising and checking matters related to law enforcement according to the law; carrying out massive amounts of investigative and study work; and helping party committees to manage cadres working in the political and legal departments. At present, priority should be given to doing a good job in building up the contingent of political and legal workers and in building up grass-roots organizations. It is also of great importance to stress the building up of leading bodies at various levels of political and legal departments. Fu Xishou, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee and Anhui governor, who is now inspecting work outside the province, sent a written message to the forum. He called on all levels of party committees and governments to voluntarily put political and legal work at the top of the agenda, to help safeguard social stability, and to maintain by every possible means the current excellent momentum of development in our province. Fu Xishou stressed the need for all levels of government to attach importance to helping political and legal departments solve funding difficulties.
