An OAU delegation arrived in Yaounde yesterday to discuss the Cameroon-Nigeria border dispute. According to the Cameroonian Government daily CAMEROON TRIBUNE quoting sources close to the Cameroonian Ministry of External Relations, this visit follows, and I quote, Nigeria's illegal occupation of some areas of Cameroonian national territory, including the Bakassi Peninsula, an area in the Gulf of Guinea which Cameroon and Nigeria have been disputing since December 1993. [no reference to closing of quotation as heard] [passage omitted] Well, what is the purpose of the OAU mission to Yaounde? Here is the response by Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroonian minister of communication and government spokesman, who spoke to Raphael Mbadinga this morning. [Begin Kouomegni recording] It is normal for an OAU mission to come to Cameroon. It could also go to Nigeria because recently, the OAU's central body for the prevention, management, and settlement of conflicts asked the OAU secretary general to report on the situation in Bakassi within one month after the adoption of the resolution asking Nigeria to leave Cameroonian territory. I, therefore, believe that the OAU mission, which has come to Cameroon and which could also go to Nigeria, will gather the necessary information to enable the OAU secretary general to prepare his report. This report will also enable the OAU's central body to know whether the two sides have implemented the resolution. [end recording]
