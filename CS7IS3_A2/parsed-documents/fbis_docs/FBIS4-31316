Here is a report by Ramadan Mucolli from Prishtina: [Mucolli] All the reactions of political parties and other Albanian bodies in Kosova against the Serb fabrications on the alleged secret talks between the Albanian and Serbian sides stress that only the legitimate Kosova representatives, freely elected by the people, have the mandate to hold such talks on the question of Kosova. It is reported that a meeting of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] Branch Presidency in Gjakove stressed that the membership of this party in this commune is aware of the fact that only those who have the mandate of the people can talk about Kosova's political status. On this occasion, they stressed that the position of the LDK and other Albanian political subjects on the solution of the Kosova question rely on the political will of the people expressed through a referendum and that the dialogue with Belgrade can be developed only on this basis and with the participation of international organizations. The Kosova Liberal Party has also turned down offers by several Serb politicians for some individuals to participate in talks between Kosova and Serbia. A public statement issued by this party states that Serbia is attempting to concoct a Serb-Albanian dialogue characteristic of the communist regime and of a modified and perfidious methodology. This party stresses that, by attempting to profess to the world that it allegedly supports dialogue with the Albanians, Serbia wants to select only the Albanians with whom it can find a common language to continue the slavery of the Albanian people in Kosova, but also to disqualify the legitimate representatives of the Kosova people elected in the free elections of 24 May 1992. Regarding a solution on the question of Kosova, the Union of the Independent Trade Unions of Kosova has stated that it recognizes and supports only the legitimate representatives of the Kosovar people, who have the mandate to fulfill the determination of the people for Kosova as an independent and sovereign state. In a conversation with a Dutch delegation, Dr. Hajrullah Gorani, chairman of these trade unions, stressed that the talks of individuals who represent no one are not serious and cannot solve any problem and, as such, they do not have the support of the people or the trade unions. Branches and sub-branches of political parties and other Albanian associations in Kosova have also reacted to the Serb fabrications on these so-called secret talks.
