He conveyed a message addressed by the Ministry of Industry to the Confederation of Mining Trade Unions, in which Industry Minister Dumitru Popescu agreed to receive a five-man delegation representing the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation at 1600 tomorrow. The two union leaders acknowledged the message and said that future labor action would depend on the outcome of these talks. The Gorj County prefect told our correspondent that he expects the majority of the miners currently present in Targu Jiu to go home and await the results of the talks at the Ministry of Industry headquarters. The strike organized in Targu Jiu by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federations proceeded today in a tense atmosphere, as the participants were expecting some message to come from the government or the Ministry of Industry, our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu reports. The several thousand miners that went there from various mining units affiliated to this trade union federation alternated between the headquarters of the Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation and that of the Gorj County Prefect's Office, accompanying Miron Cosma, who by noon was joined by a group of mining union leaders from the Jiu Valley. In the evening they told the miners that it had been agreed that tomorrow a four-man delegation of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation, together with Ilie Ciortan, the chairman of the Jiu Valley Miners' Trade Union League, should go for negotiations to the headquarters of the Ministry of Industry. The miners were disappointed by the news and requested that all of them go to Bucharest. However, they were calmed down by Miron Cosma, who said that it would be better to wait for the results of the negotiations. Thus, they agreed to return tomorrow -- if possible, in greater numbers -- to the same place next to the Targu Jiu Mining Public Corporation, and if by 1600 the demands are not solved, they should leave for the capital. The chairman of Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation, Miron Cosma, also said, quote, we will not give in under any circumstances. This is the last chance that we will give those who are responsible for the solution of our demands, unquote, after which he appealed to the miners to go home.
