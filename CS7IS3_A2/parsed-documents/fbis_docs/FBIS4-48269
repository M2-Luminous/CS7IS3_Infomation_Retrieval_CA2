"It will be a company of 120 to 125 soldiers, all volunteers, who will be put at the disposal of the organization to be part of the peacekeeping force in Rwanda," said this senior official who preferred not to be named. The Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a request from the organization and the request is expected to be given a "favorable response," he stated. Last week, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, proposed to increase to 5,500 the number of blue helmets in Rwanda for an essentially humanitarian mission. The strength of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was reduced from 2,500 to 400 men when the massacres began in that country following the death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents on 6 April. Twenty-five Congolese were in the UNAMIR.
