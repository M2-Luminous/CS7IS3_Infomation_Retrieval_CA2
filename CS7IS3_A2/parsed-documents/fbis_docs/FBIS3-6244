January orders rose 1.9 percent from December to 912.7 billion yen, following a 5.3 percent increase in December and a 23.0 percent jump in November. The January figure also marks a 0.4 percent rise from a year earlier, the first year-on-year increase in 22 months, the agency said in its monthly report. The data exclude orders for ships and from electric power companies, which are often volatile. An EPA official in a briefing for reporters said the January results support the agency's view that the downward trend in private machinery orders has come to an end. The official also said the latest figures have increased the likelihood that the agency will meet its target of an 8.1 percent increase in private orders for the first quarter of 1994. The official said, however, that results from January alone are insufficient for making an accurate prediction. Private machinery orders, omitting volatile factors, are a leading indicator for near-term corporate spending on plants and equipment. Including orders for ships and from electric power firms, January private-sector orders totaled 1,102.9 billion yen, down 4.5 percent from December and a 4.1 percent decrease from a year before. Orders from manufacturers accounted for 377.9 billion yen of the total, and orders from nonmanufacturers, excluding those for ships and from power firms, came to 541.6 billion yen. Orders placed by the public sector jumped 23.9 percent from the previous month to 387.3 billion yen, and orders from foreigners increased 31.7 percent to 542.6 billion yen. The agency official said public-sector orders received a boost from the second supplementary budget enacted last year for the current 1993 fiscal year, ending in April. The budget increased orders for items such as garbage-disposal facilities and telecommunications equipment. An agency hearing found that many makers expect orders from the government to remain strong at least through the end of March, the official said. The January jump for foreign orders is "too good to be true," the official said. In the last few months foreign orders increased only modestly, with a 0.4 percent rise in December and 0.2 percent rise in November. The yen's decline against the U.S. dollar in January cannot fully explain the jump, the official said. Overall, January machinery orders amounted to 2,165.4 billion yen, up 4.8 percent from December and 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
