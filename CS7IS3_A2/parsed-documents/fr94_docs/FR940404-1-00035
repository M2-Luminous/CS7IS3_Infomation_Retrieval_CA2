FR940404-1-00035 FR940404-1-00014 The State of Texas adopted amendments to its TACB Regulation IV, Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles, Chapter 114, to add a Section 114.13, which establishes an Oxygenated Fuel Program for El Paso. The TACB (now TNRCC) Board approved the Regulation IV revisions on September 18, 1992. The program covers the County of El Paso, Texas (the control area), which is also the El Paso Metropolitan Statistical Area. In this action, the EPA is proposing approval of the El Paso oxygenated fuel program, based on the TACB's revised Chapter 114, Control of Air Pollution from Vehicles, section 114.13, Oxygenated Fuels. The State has entered into an agreement with the El Paso City/County Health Department (known as the El Paso Local Air Pollution Control Program) for that agency to assist the State with the administration of the oxygenated fuels program. The agreement, in the form of grant objectives, details the activities that El Paso will undertake for the State in the administration of the oxygenated fuels program. Examples of the activities the El Paso City/County Health Department performs for the State in the oversight of the oxygenated fuels program include sampling 20 percent of the affected facilities and reporting on the number of violations during the control period. The TNRCC is, however, ultimately responsible for the administration, oversight, and enforcement of the El Paso oxygenated fuels program. The control period for the program is from October 1 of one year to March 31 of the following year, and the program is one in which all oxygenated gasoline must contain a minimum oxygen content of 2.7 percent by weight of oxygen. The State has adopted labeling regulations, enforcement procedures, and oxygenate test methods in conformity with Federal regulations. For further details of the oxygenated fuels program, the reader is referred to the TSD. 7. Enforceability Issues All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and the EPA. See sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556. The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. See 57 FR 13541. The criteria include, for example: ensuring that the rules contained in the SIP are explicit in their applicability to the regulated sources; ensuring that compliance dates are clearly specified; ensuring that compliance periods and test methods are clearly noted; ensuring that adequate recordkeeping is required; and ensuring that any exemptions or variances are clear in their applicability and in how they are triggered. In addition to enforceable requirements, nonattainment area plan provisions must contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP. See section 110(a)(2)(C). The State of Texas has an enforcement program that will ensure that certain control measures contained in the El Paso CO SIP (i.e., the oxygenated fuels) are adequately enforced. As stated in the oxygenated fuels section of this FR notice, the State has an agreement with the El Paso City/County Health Department for that agency to assist the TACB (now TNRCC) in its oversight activities regarding the oxygenated fuels program. The State, however, is responsible for the administration, oversight, and enforcement of the El Paso oxygenated fuels program. 8. Attainment Demonstration There is no attainment demonstration required for CO nonattainment areas with design values equal to or below 12.7 ppm. and El Paso's design values are less than 12.7 ppm. However, the International Border provision (section 179B of the CAA commonly referred to as section 818 of the CAAA), provides a State on an international border, such as Texas, an option to satisfy the EPA Administrator regarding attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory deadline. Specifically, section 179B provides that a nonattainment area on an international border that fails to meet NAAQS will not be reclassified if it can demonstrate attainment ``but for emissions emanating from outside the United States.'' Criteria for a section 818 demonstration are further discussed in the TSD. The TACB (now TNRCC) included in this SIP revision its intention to perform a section 818 CO technical analysis for El Paso. The EPA will take action on a section 818 El Paso CO demonstration, if one is submitted, in a future FR notice.
