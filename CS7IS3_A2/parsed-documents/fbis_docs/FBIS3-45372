Either good or bad relations between China and the United States will have a great impact on the peace and stability of Asia and the world as a whole. Some differences between the two sides can be settled through mutual visits, conversations, and discussions between leaders of the two sides. Zhang Wannian stressed that China pursues a national defense policy of positive defense. The fact that China develops some military equipment is entirely to meet the needs of defending our own country and will never threaten others. General Zhang Wannian told the guests that the whole party, the whole armed forces, and all the people of China are wholeheartedly carrying out economic construction in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. China is full of confidence about attaining her strategic goals. Paul Cerjan said that the United States supports China's modernization and supports a stable China because this is conducive to the peace and stability of the region and the world as a whole.

Paul Cerjan said that U.S. military are very interested in developing exchanges with the Chinese armed forces. Such exchanges have restarted at present and are hoped to become more and more in future. Paul Cerjan and his party arrived in Beijing by invitation on 15 January for an eight-day visit to China.
