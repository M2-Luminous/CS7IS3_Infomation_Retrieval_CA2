FBIS4-166 "drafr064_c_94019" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Officer Confirms Existence of `Operation Sunrise' Officer Confirms Existence of `Operation Sunrise' MB0104154594 Pretoria Radio Pretoria in Afrikaans 1700 GMT 31 Mar 94 MB0104154594 Pretoria Radio Pretoria Afrikaans BFN [Text] An officer in the Defense Force says it is nonsense for officials in the Defense Force and the Police to say they have no knowledge of the maneuvers of Operation Sunrise and the SACP [South African Communist Party] document in which the procedure for a takeover has been detailed. He said the document was distributed among various Defense Force elements, police and government officials at the end of last year. According to his evidence, the document had also been discussed in Parliament, and it is therefore unimaginable that the authenticity or existence of the document should in the least be doubted. He said if the document was false, then it is coincidental that the communist onslaught spelled out in the document should coincide with recent events throughout the country, and with those that have already taken place.
