This is because we view Israel as a mob of invaders who came from various parts of the world to occupy a land that is not theirs and a homeland that is not theirs. It has been the homeland of Arabs and Muslims for 14 centuries. The Jews who existed in Palestine at the beginning of this century were a minority of no more than 5 percent. They have lived peacefully with the Arabs and Muslims for 14 centuries. In principle, we are not against Judaism as a religion nor against the Jews as a race. We are against a country being occupied by foreigners. Those invaders are new colonialists who were supported by Britain at the beginning of the century and by the United States in the middle of the century. Thus, the Zionist plan converged with the Western colonialist plan to colonize Palestine. Therefore, in principle, those are rejected people in our homeland. [Badawi] So you are against any peaceful settlement in the region? [Al-Farhan] It is not like that. We are constant advocates of peace, but not when our territory is occupied by force. Therefore, the real solution to the Palestine question is to allow the Jews who lived with us for 14 centuries to stay and to evacuate to their own countries the Jews who came as invaders from overseas and from over 70 countries in the world. Indigenous Jews and their children and the Christians and Muslims of Palestine would remain. The deported Palestinians, who are over 4 million--not only the 400 deportees who returned last year--should return to their country. Afterward, in a democratic way, if the West is really democratic, the Palestinians--Muslims, Christians, and Jews--should be left to determine their future so that they would have equal opportunities and would rule themselves by themselves. [Badawi] Mr. Ishaq al-Farhan, in light of the results of the Jordanian elections on the domestic level and in light of the recent Geneva summit on the foreign level, do you not feel that your opposing stand is being isolated? How do you expect your activities to be affected? [Al-Farhan] In fact, true democracy has room for both supporters and opponents. We are a political party operating under the Jordanian Political Parties Law and under the Jordanian Charter and Constitution, which adopt democracy and democratization which allow everybody to express their views no matter how different they may be. We are neither permanent rejectionists nor permanent supporters of the policy of any government. Our opposition or support depends on stands themselves. With respect to the Palestine question, we have our known stand, which is widely respected. At the same time, we do not resort to violence to impose our stands. Hence, we believe that we are being logical with ourselves, and that others must be logical with us. We do not have a problem here in Jordan with the regime in terms of agreement or disagreement. This is because we view matters in a practical and realistic manner. At the same time, we act according to our constant and deep-rooted policy. As for the regional or Western circles that want to plot against us, we hope that they will understand the democracy which they advocate, and leave us alone to resolve our problems by ourselves. [Badawi] So, what is the strategy of your future opposition. In other words, what are you wagering on in the future to reverse the current peaceful, negotiatory trend? [Al-Farhan] We believe that as long as an inch of Palestinian territory is under occupation, the Palestinian resistance inside the Palestinian territory will continue until the occupation is removed from the Islamic Arab territories, headed by Jerusalem. We believe that irrespective of the nature of the self-rule that the Palestinians will attain, they will avoid any civil wars or domestic disputes, especially if they adopt democracy and shura among themselves so that they would act in harmony with themselves and set a starting point for the building of their future state, which would be supported by the neighboring Arab countries, especially Jordan. We are wagering on the assumption that proceeding from their colonialist and expansionist logic, the Jews will try to impose their economic and political hegemony on the region. Thus, they will be hated in the region. After they failed to impose their military hegemony, they will not be able to achieve their political, economic, educational, and cultural objectives of a greater Israel in the region. We are also wagering on the balances of power. We have recently seen how the Russian power crumbled and how Russia became a thing of the past. Also, we believe that American and European public opinion will show more understanding of our issue, especially if we hold fast and explain this issue and continue to explain it for the next decade. Then, the world military, political, and ideological balances of power may change in our interest.
