The engineers, attending the 1994 international symposium here on cable-stayed bridges, agreed that more and more such bridges will be erected throughout the world for their beauty and sophisticated technology. In a paper read at the symposium, Man-chung Tang, a professor at Columbia University in the United States, said that some 300 cable- stayed bridges have appeared worldwide since the first such bridge was built at Stromsund, Switzerland, 40 years ago. "Cable-stayed bridges fill the gap of efficient span range between conventional medium-span girder bridges and the very long- span suspended bridges," he said. "The beauty of the cable-stayed bridge is so overwhelming that the general public will quickly fall in love with it. For this reason, more cable-stayed bridges will be built around the world in the future," he added. German Bridge Engineer Holger Svensson said that three cable- stayed bridges have erected on the Rhine River in Germany alone. He said in a paper that such bridges to be built in Europe will have an increasingly bigger span. For example, such a bridge with a span of 1,204 m will be erected in Denmark. He said that a feasibility study of building another cable-stayed bridge with a span of 1,500 m in Europe has been completed. The bridge is expected to use conventional materials such as steel and concrete, he added. Chang Song-pil, a professor at Seoul National University, said that several cable-stayed bridges have been built in the Republic of Korea in the past decade. Engineers from Malaysia, Japan, Norway and France also read papers during the symposium, which is scheduled to close today.
