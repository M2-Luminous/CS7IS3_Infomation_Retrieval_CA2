According to statistics, approximately 36 percent of the total Latvian export goes to Russia. Olgerts Pavlovskis, minister of state for trade and European Union Affairs, does not think that the increasing of import customs tariffs on Russia's part means economic pressure on the Baltic states. However, the Estonian Government, as DIENA has already reported, is of the opinion that by introducing new customs tariffs Russia has started an economic war against the Baltic states. According to O. Pavlovskis, an increase in customs duties is not a special political act aimed at the Baltic states alone, because the tariffs are higher also for other countries. Nonetheless, the fact that the Russian parliament avoids -- for more than one year -- ratifying the most favored nation clause for trade with Latvia could be regarded as political pressure. Consequently, the import tariffs for Latvian goods are twice the so-called basic import tariffs. At present, Russia has granted the most favored nation clause to 125 countries and organizations, for example, to the European Union, and basic import tariffs are being applied to goods arriving from these countries . Among the developing countries, 104 can supply their goods paying only half of the basic import tariffs, and 46 countries are not obliged to pay any customs duties at all. The rest of the countries, including the Baltic states, have to pay a customs duty for their goods that is twice as high as the basic tariff. Since 15 March, customs tariffs in Russia were increased for all agricultural products, and were applied also to those that were customs free until now. For milk and milk products, as well as for meat, the new basic tariffs are 15-20 percent of the value of the product, but for Latvian products, as was said before, they are twice as high. Among industrial goods, the highest raise was set for vans -- from 5 to 30 percent. For motorbikes it has risen up to 20 percent, for cosmetics -- about 5 percent, for textiles -- about 10 percent. The average customs duty for Latvian goods amounts to 40 percent of the value of the manufactured article. [passage omitted] Andrejs Runcis, director of the trade department in the Ministry of Economy, pointed out that the reason for the problems with the export of Latvian products to Russia is the lack of a main trade agreement between Latvia and Russia. He told DIENA: It is absolutely clear that the new tariffs create obstacles for Latvia in trading with Russia. At the same time, the behavior of Russia is illogical -- if the customs duties are rising, the prices are rising too. The big cities in Russia wish to conclude direct trade agreements with Latvia on food supplies, in order to lower the prices. [passage omitted]
