They also urged an "early entry into force of the Convention on Chemical Weapons." They asked all states to fully implement the "Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and to strengthen it." The statement also called for an early entry into force of the Treaty on Open Skies and increased transparency on conventional arms transfers. The participants called for an early conclusion of a universal and effectively verifiable comprehensive test ban treaty. In the nuclear field, the ministers "welcome the trilateral statement signed by Presidents Bill Clinton (of the U.S.), Leonid Kravchuk (of Ukraine) and Boris Yeltsin (of Russia) in Moscow on 14 January on the transfer of all nuclear warheads in Ukraine to Russia for dismantlement." During the one-day meeting the ministers and representatives of the 41 countries also discussed the regional conflicts which could lead to unstability in the region. On the Bosnian conflict, the meeting urged the "parties concerned to conclude the comprehensive cessation of hostilities and negotiate an early and durable settlement of the conflict." The meeting, which was chaired by Sergio Baganzino, deputy secretary-general of the NATO, decided to hold next NACC meeting in Brussels in December this year.
