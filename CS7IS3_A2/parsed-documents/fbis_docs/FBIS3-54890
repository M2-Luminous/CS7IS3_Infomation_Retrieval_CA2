The consultations are not yet over and the final results of the round are not yet known. However, this round is apparently not the final one: The talks will be continued, with only a recess for Christmas, right up to the opening of a Duma session, Ivan Rybkin, one of the leaders of the Agrarian Party, told the newspaper. Various names of candidates were mentioned during the consultations. Rybkin, whose candidacy was named as well, said he personally regards as fruitful the idea of electing four deputy speakers. This will make it possible to ensure the stability of the ship called the State Duma, for the more interests are represented in its leadership, the more stable it will be." TRUD on the reform-minded blocs' defeat in the recent elections: "The paradox of the past elections is that, notwithstanding the lack of victors, there still are the vanquished -- reform-minded blocs. If they, while counting on winning a majority in parliament, did not get it, this cannot be called otherwise than a defeat. There is one hope, namely, that all political forces from the very outset will renounce orientation towards confrontation or political accusations against one another and will come to realise that such a path has already been traversed completely and it did not lead to anything but trouble". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on why State Duma deputies are so preoccupied with the speaker election issue: "There is one disquieting circustance: The talks, a regular round of which was held on Tuesday, focus on the search for a candidacy of a State Duma speaker. Why does this question worry the deputies so much? Under the new constitution, the speaker is a purely functional figure: He will preside over sessions and see to it that internal rules and regulations are observed. Neither party affiliation, attitude to reforms, nor a stand with regard to the government and the president should be decisive in a speaker's characteristics: only tactfulness, organising ability, an aptitude for the establishment of contacts, and loyalty to various points of view. It is not so difficult to find such a person among 450 deputies provided there is accord on priorities. But the matter, apparently, is precisely in priorities. This is actually the result of deeply ingrained habits of the soviet times: The main thing is what kind of a boss one will have, not the law (in this case -- fundamental law). If the boss is not an outsider, then one has a chance for promotion, etc. If the boss is a stranger, one would have additional problems". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the possibility of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's participation in the forthcoming Russian-U.S. summit in Moscow: "The Ukrainian president's foreign affairs service has expressed doubt about the possibility of Kravchuk's participating in Moscow talks among the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States on January 14, 1994, on the future of Ukrainian strategic nuclear weapons. The summit will coincide with an official visit to Kiev by President Nursultan Nazarabayev of Kazakhstan, the presidential service announced. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, a meeting of the presidents of the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Moscow is still possible but it will depend on the outcome of the ongoing talks in Washington which involve Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and Vice-Premier for Defence-Sector Issues Valery Shmarov". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with Stanislav Voronin, chief designer of Russian nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons, who emphasises: "One does not toy with an atomic bomb in political games! Some politicians state that nuclear weapons can be dismantled in Ukraine. This is an ill-intentioned attempt to mislead public opinion. in Ukraine, there are neither specialists of the needed qualification, nor facilities, nor experience in dismantling nukes". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Dmitry Volkogonov, adviser to the president of Russia on defence affairs. He said: "I could never agree that the army as one of major instruments of the state can be outside politics. Yes, it must be outside party-motivated politics but it cannot be outside state politics. The army should adhere to the course followed by the government and the president, who is the supreme commander-in-chief, the course towards security, the official course towards the armed forces' development, towards reforms, etc.". PRAVDA on an attempt on the life of Aleksandr Barkashov, leader of the banned Russian National Unity Movement: "Could it be that the shoot-out in which Barkashov was heavily wounded was the consequence of his knowing some details of the firing on the parliament building?" St. Petersburg's-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper on an explosion and fire near metro station: "An explosion, followed by a heavy fire, occurred at the entrance to the Russo-Italian shoe shop Marcopizii near Petrogradskaya metro station four hours before the advent of the new year. The blast smashed the stained-glass partition separating the shop and the hallway of the metro station. No one was hurt but many people were unable to get home by midnight -- the metro station was promptly closed down. Criminal proceedings have been instituted."
