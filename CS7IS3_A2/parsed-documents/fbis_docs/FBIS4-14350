The exhibitions were set up on Tehran's permanent exhibition site for international trade fairs. At the end of his inspection tour, the president was interviewed by our correspondent and expressed his views on these exhibitions. [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] The outstanding features of the electricity industry exhibition were too many to be mentioned in this interview. However, one of the features which interested me greatly was to witness the result of a move which started two years ago with the aim of enabling us to manage all aspects of the electricity industry on our own -- such as production, transfer, and distribution. With regard to the distribution of electricity, we are almost fully self-sufficient in that everything to do with all 20 posts [as heard] is being done inside the country. As far as the transfer of electricity is concerned, we are also largely self-sufficient. In production too, there has been a major move during the last two years, and now we are able to build everything which is feasible and cost-efficient inside the country and meet the needs of our hydroelectric, steam, gas, and compound cycle power stations. [passage omitted] [end recording] The president stressed: With the plans we have, during the next five or six years Iran will become one of the main centers for the construction of various types of power stations. Such an achievement deserves praise, and one must really pay tribute to the efforts of the experts in the field. He added: Experience shows that our choice, that is the construction of dams and hydroelectric power stations, was a right choice which has proved beneficial to us. [passage omitted]
