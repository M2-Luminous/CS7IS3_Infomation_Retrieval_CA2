FBIS4-19921 "drweu079aa_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IAEA Experts Review Safety Situation at Chernobyl IAEA Experts Review Safety Situation at Chernobyl AU2204163394 Vienna IAEA Press Release in English 1522 GMT 22 Apr 94 AU2204163394 Vienna IAEA Press Release English BFN [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media, not an official record": "International Experts Review the Safety Situation at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station"] [Text] Experts from a dozen countries reviewed with Ukrainian representatives the current safety situation at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power station at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Headquarters in Vienna 21-22 April 1994. A recent IAEA expert mission in March 1994 found serious safety deficiencies at the Chernobyl station and on that basis its Director General informed the President of Ukraine that international levels of safety were not being met. It was subsequently agreed that a meeting of interested parties be convened in April to consider what actions could be taken to alleviate the situation. The Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, in opening the meeting reminded the participants that national governments carry the responsibility for safety in nuclear installations in their territory. Yet there is legitimate international concern about maintaining safety of nuclear installations any where. Technical safety issues and actions would need to be considered in the context of other factors that influence the current situation such as the overall energy and economic circumstances in the Ukraine. The Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister, Mr Valeriy Shmarov, and the Chairman of the State Committee on the Utilization of Nuclear Power, Mr. Umanetz, discussed the energy and economic situations and the current safety situation at Chernobyl. The meeting also heard views of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on the energy and economic situations and was given a summary of the IAEA safety mission results. Ukrainian officials pointed out that energy use had dropped lately due to the temporary economic depression, but should rise substantially as the economy improves; per capita energy consumption is inordinately high, but reducing it would require complete overhaul of the infrastructure, lasting decades; the country is already heavily dependent on external, expensive and potentially unreliable sources for gas and oil; coal is becoming harder to extract and, in any event, greater use depends on introducing, at high cost, modern combustion technology; and thus, Ukraine must look to nuclear energy as a continuing major source to meet its energy requirements. They further stated that the role of nuclear power is essential in their energy planning. More modern VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power reactor] reactors will be required along with on-time completion of five additional VVER plants now under construction. The output of the Chernobyl station is currently a least cost alternative for energy supply. Completion of three VVER 1000MW units in an advanced stage of construction can be completed by 1996 at a cost of $196 million. Two additional units can be completed by 1999 bringing the total cost to $1.2 billion. They believe that the Chernobyl station could be upgraded to a level no less safe than other currently operating RBMK [expansion unknown] reactors. Chernobyl is now behind in implementing the safety improvements at other RMBKs, but the pace of implementation could be accelerated, if sufficient resources were available. To date no international financial assistance directed at improving the safety situation at Chernobyl has been provided by the international community. There was consensus at the meeting that the many factors involved make the situation at Chernobyl complex and that there was no simple one-step solution. Some participants suggested continued technical assessment which could be undertaken in the frame-work of IAEA activities. A clear majority wished to see operation at Chernobyl discontinued as soon as conditions allow. In concluding the IAEA's Assistant Director General for Nuclear Safety, Morris Rosen, reminded the participants that, in addition to the recent loss of many highly qualified staff, and no matter what improvements were made, the situation at Chernobyl was unique: For several years Chernobyl would be at a lower level of safety than similar plants; the severe economic situation would impact on the availability of spare parts and the procurement of modern equipment. In addition one of the former units is encased in a currently deteriorating shelter and the remaining units would be operating in an environment of elevated radiation levels.
