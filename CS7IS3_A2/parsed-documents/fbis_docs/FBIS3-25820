[passage omitted] During the forums held at the two universities, Gu Jinchi analyzed why most schools still experienced strained supplies of funds even though Liaoning's growth of education funds was greater than the growth of revenues every year. He said: The major reason was that, under the old systems, establishment of schools has been duplicated in all localities, which leads to disperse of funds. In addition, the contingent of teachers is so large that it is disproportionate with the number of students. He held that only by deepening reform, can the difficulties in running schools be resolved. He called for concentrating efforts on making a few key universities successful. He expressed the hope that the universities reform will be conducted in better coordination with the economic development plan, and personnel with both scientific and technical ability and economic knowledge will be trained; that old professors will make more contributions to training outstanding young teachers; that teachers will attach importance to the political and ideological training of students and educate them to have enterprising spirit and strong sense of responsibility in addition to training them with specialized knowledge; and that greater steps will be made in the coordination between the scientific research of universities and enterprises. He said that the provincial party committee and government would make utmost efforts to support these two universities to enter the state's "211 project." At the institute of metals research and the Nanhu Scientific and Technological Development Zone, Gu Jinchi said: The work that people throughout the province are most concerned about is how to accelerate Liaoning's economic development. They are worried about Liaoning's decline in the country's rating. He realistically analyzed the reason for this and said firmly: Liaoning used to rank second in the country thanks to its strength and was able to accomplish what other provinces and municipalities could not. For this reason, people called Liaoning the equipment department of the country. Things changed later, and some provinces and municipalities surpassed Liaoning. What should Liaoning do? The most important thing is to clearly understand science and technology as the primary productive forces, transform traditional industries with high and new technology, and continue to be able to accomplish what other localities are unable to. Only in this way, can it regain its magnificence. Gu Jinchi repeatedly talked about transformation of scientific and technological achievements, urging efforts to give wider publicity to science and technology and scientific units to integrate science and technology with industrial production and trade. He hoped that a road to rapid development, rapid transformation, and good efficiency of high and new technology would be blazed. He urged for efforts to learn from the achievements and experiences of scientific and technological development zones to promote Liaoning's economic work. Accompanying Gu Jinchi during the investigation and study activities were Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy secretaries; and Xu Wencai, standing committee member and secretary general of the provincial party committee.
