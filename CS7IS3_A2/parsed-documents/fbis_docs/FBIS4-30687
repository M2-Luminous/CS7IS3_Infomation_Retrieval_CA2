FBIS4-30687 "dreas125__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-125-A Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan OECD To Draft Global Communications Network Plan OECD To Draft Global Communications Network Plan OW2806222994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 27 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2806222994 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Japanese BFN [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN 27 Jun Morning Edition] [Text] On 26 June, a government source disclosed that the OECD plans to convene a meeting of a joint committee on information-related matters in Paris on 28-29 June to begin work on drawing up an international high-speed communications network project. The OECD plans to look into establishing a social infrastructure that befits an era of a highly advanced information-oriented society, basing its plans primarily on the following points: 1) to coordinate policies, including the promotion of deregulation programs; 2) to revise existing systems regarding such matters as intellectual property rights; and 3) to promote the establishment of industry standards and development of databases. The OECD plans to compile a report on this project at a ministerial meeting in June 1995. The project has drawn much attention as an effort to help realize the "Global Information Highway Initiative (GII)," an expanded version of the "National Information Super Highway Initiative," which has been announced by the administration of U.S President Bill Clinton. The OECD's joint committee consists of three separate committees: one deals with industrial affairs; another with information and computer communications policies; and the third with scientific and technological policies. The fact that the OECD has decided to convene a joint committee meeting indicates that the issue of how high-speed communications networks ought to work has become a priority issue among major industrialized nations. So far, the United States has promoted its "NII," which was proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. European nations have proposed the "Trans-European Network (TEN)" project. As for Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has announced that the nation plans to participate in the "GII," which has been proposed by the United States. At the same time, Japan has also proposed the "Asia Information Highway Initiative (AII)." However, there never has been an opportunity for countries to hold comprehensive debates on policies related to an international high-speed communications network project. At the joint committee meeting, committee members will hold discussions on how to promote international cooperation regarding deregulation in certain areas that will be indispensable toward expanding communications networks. Such efforts will be directed toward facilitating access to data communications businesses and determining how networks ought to be mutually connected, among other goals. Committee members will also hold discussions on how copyrights ought to be protected in connection with users' editing and processing visual and audio data which they have acquired through multimedia networks and on other problems related to existing systems which govern such matters. Moreover, committee members will exchange opinions as to what measures ought be taken to make specific improvements on international high-speed communications networks which primarily deal with scientific and technological information and to promote the establishment of standards among networks regarding such matters as data processing. In conjunction with such moves, Japan plans to set up soon an "Advanced Data Communications Promotion Headquarters" (tentative name) within the cabinet, which will hopefully compile a Japanese version of the "Information Super Highway" project right away. It then plans to participate actively in debates with other OECD member nations on the global communications network project.
