However, hope for an immediate provision of Belarusian citizens with tricolored Russian banknotes did not come true. This hampers Mr. Kebich's campaign to a great extent. Relations with Russia and the forthcoming monetary union are the main topics at meetings of the prime minister and his electorate. They were also much discussed at Mr. Kebich's meeting with professors of institutes of higher education in Minsk, which was held at the Belarusian State University on 12 May. The present stage of the implementation of the above-mentioned agreement was assessed by the prime minister in the following way: "Nine articles out of 12 are already in force. The most essential article of this agreement concerns the lifting of custom duties, quotas, and tariffs. Practically, it means that prices for imported Russian goods will be lowered by about 25-30 percent. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in production costs and to a possibility of falling retail prices. However, it is undesirable to decrease retail prices today. Why? Because even at current prices, a great flood of goods (especially foodstuffs) outside of Belarus exists. Therefore, our task is, while preserving the same retail prices, to increase wages. This is a more proper way, and we will follow it." "With regard to other articles of the agreement, I should say that we need to bring some legislative acts in line with legislative acts of the Russian Federation. However, I will tell you honestly: During our talks with the Russian leadership, one could sense an underlying sentiment: `We will wait and see who will become your president...' The document signed by Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, specifies the term. Nine articles come in force before 31 July. Note that this term was chosen not accidentally... Let us say straightforwardly: If the presidential elections are a bust, this may prevent the union from being formed." In general, during the meeting, Mr. Kebich frequently accentuated the delicacy of relations with our eastern neighbor and their tendency to fluctuations due to seemingly insignificant factors: "There was a mention of our victory over Moscow regiments near Orsha in 1514, and Russia cut off its gas supplies. This was not accidental. We still owe debts to Russia for gas -- but gas supplies continue... There was a mention of Belarusian claims to Bransk and Smolensk Oblasts, for Vilnius region -- and we received the next warning: `We will halt gas supplies if you do not start paying.' Politics know no trifles. One has to be very careful about politics and assess the situation very accurately." Understandably, Mr. Kebich himself has never made any such statements on the victory near Orsha or some territorial claims. Apparently, he had in mind statements and actions by the Belarusian Popular Front... The prime minister firmly cut himself off from the radical ideas of both the "right" and the "left." He promised stability, consequence, and continual progress after his victory in the elections.
