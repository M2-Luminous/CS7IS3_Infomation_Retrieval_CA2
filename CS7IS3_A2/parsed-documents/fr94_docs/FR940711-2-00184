The Council is established to: (1) minimize duplication across Federal, State and local agencies of programs and activities relating to early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families and preschool services for children with disabilities; (2) ensure effective coordination of Federal early intervention and preschool programs, including Federal technical assistance and support activities; and (3) identify gaps in Federal agency programs and services and barriers to Federal interagency cooperation. To meet these purposes, the FICC seeks to: (1) identify areas of conflict, overlap, and omissions in interagency policies related to the provision of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities; (2) develop and implement joint policy interpretations on issues related to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers that cut across Federal agencies, including modifications or regulations to eliminate barriers to interagency programs and activities; and (3) coordinate the provision of technical assistance and dissemination of best practice information. The FICC is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. At this meeting the FICC plans to: (1) Update the membership on the IDEA reauthorization process; and (2) discuss innovations in the use of information-highway technology by children with disabilities and their families. The meeting of the FICC is open to the public. Written public comment will be accepted at the conclusion of the meeting. These comments will be included in the summary minutes of the meeting. The meeting will be physically accessible with meeting materials provided in both braille and large print. Interpreters for persons who are hearing impaired will be available.
