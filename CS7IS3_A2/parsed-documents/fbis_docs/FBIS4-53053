Eight groups, composed primarily of communications firms, have announced feasibility studies on personal handiphone systems (PHS), and special attention is being focused on the activities of DDI. DDI and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) together launched tests in Sapporo half a year ahead of the other groups. The reason for DDI's early start was progress on its proprietary technology. DDI's pioneering attributes are clearly visible in the development of its land stations which communicate with PHS units and the progress made in the development of data bases for managing customer information. Further development will require an interface to link with the NTT network, but NTT has announced a model of that interface via the Telecommunication and Telephone Technology Committee. NTT Service Development Department's Personal Service Development Project Committee chief Tadao Kobayashi says, "The status of current feasibility studies reveals whether or not interested parties were initially serious about development of PHS systems," in providing an indirect evaluation of DDI's posture on PHS. The land stations used by the eight groups can be broadly categorized into two types. Aside from DDI, they all use land stations which emit signals with an output of 20 milliwatts. Since PHS uses a standard communication interface, there is little incentive to develop proprietary facilities, unlike cellulars that use two different formats. However, DDI uses a format with a transmitter output of 500 milliwatts or 25 times greater. According to managing director Yoshio Senmoto, "DDI faces fewer restrictions in terms of locating land stations as long as it can reduce the numbers," as a result of being able to cover more space by using high output stations, whereas NTT-format land stations can handle only calls which are within a radius of 100 meters. The DDI format also reduces the frequency of "handovers," interruptions in communications that are experienced when a PHS user moves from one land station area to the next land station area. Industry sources estimate that use of 20-milliwatt land stations in the 23 wards of Tokyo would require the installation of more than 20,000 land stations, but NTT could use public telephone boxes and electric power company-affiliated firms could use electrical utility poles. DDI opted for high-output land stations as a last resort to overcome the issue of locations for land stations. However, regardless of the high output feasible for land stations, the output from PHS units will be limited to 10 milliwatts. If the land stations were not capable of receiving the weak signals from the PHS units, then there would be a problem. DDI has overcome that potential problem by improving reception at the land stations by converting to civilian use technology held by a military equipment maker in Israel. Managing director and chief of the Management Planning Department Sanshiro Fukada states, "Both the specific name of the company and the nature of the technology is secret," but DDI has made use of technology of foreign manufacturers who have been thorough in their efforts at PHS development. DDI opted for that course of action because its assessment was that primary communications makers were organized into a consortium called the "NTT family" and that it would be difficult to surpass rival NTT in the area of technology through the use of domestic equipment. In its efforts to develop a compression technology system for digital signals with a U.S. venture firm, DDI used 20 firms worldwide such as in Europe, the United States, and Israel in the area of research and development and parts procurement. Managing director Senmoto states DDI's objective was to "make itself a model for development" amidst the prevailing air of international trade friction. Investment costs thus far have totaled 10 billion yen. However, circuits to be used are not proprietary. Rival NTT's integrated services digital network (ISDN) circuits will be used to link land stations. Of the eight groups engaged in feasibility studies, three groups such as those affiliated with electrical power companies will use proprietary network circuits. Proprietary networks will entail infrastructure costs, but will eliminate access charges associated with the use of NTT ISDN circuits. PHS which is dependent on low user rates could face an issue of survival or death if it involved the payment of access charges. Department chief Kobayashi of NTT suggests, "In principle, access charges are based on actual cost, but if they are too high, they could lead to the failure of both user and service provider," but if DDI were to be forced to use NTT ISDN circuits, it may not be able to use its proprietary technologies. Unlike long-distance telephone and cellulars which have been provided by all of the NCC (new common carrier) companies, PHS is a service that can be provided by all communication companies with a uniform service initiation time frame. DDI which offers Motorola cellular services has also rejected the NTT format for PHS service. However, on cellulars it went with technology borrowed from Motorola, but on PHS they are challenging the competition with proprietary technology. According to managing director Fukada, it is because of this reason that the company feels a strong sense of crisis that "It will lose to the competition if it lags in technology." DDI launched itself into the PHS effort under the leadership of Messrs Senmoto and Fukada, formerly of NTT, despite assertions of caution within the company. DDI just may become the center of a highly turbulent situation while establishing technological distinctions which separate it from the competition.
