Everything remains the same, since at the last minute the UNITA representatives decided to postpone approving the document being discussed, alleging that they need more time to reflect. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace process, is trying to control the situation by holding constant meetings with the UNITA team. Meanwhile, the mediator has decided to release the government's negotiating team until 1600 tomorrow. It is presumed that by then UNITA may have a concrete and objective idea regarding the document still being discussed, which well-informed sources say may be approved. If that happens, the government and UNITA negotiators will then discuss the implementation of modalities on installing UNITA and its senior officials.
