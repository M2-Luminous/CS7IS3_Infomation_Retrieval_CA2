Following the invitation of Vyacheslav Chornovil, political leaders who had signed an agreement on forming the Council of Democratic Parties and Organizations took the rostrum and ceremonially swore to put an end to discord and join efforts for the victory of democracy. That was a touchy scene, even though the Party of Democratic Renaissance of Ukraine had reneged on its commitments to join the council. It is too early to announce the premature death of the Council of Democratic Parties and Organizations, but there is no doubt that the "child" is afflicted with a serious congenital disease. The fathers of the council were too inharmonious and there was too broad an incongruity between their slogans and practical goals. The council was formed at the initiative of leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] and the Democratic Party. These parties have always demonstrated their loyalty to the president and given preference to access to power rather than the ephemeral unity of democratic forces. The URP has always opposed all kinds of blocs and coalitions, and agreed to join the latter only if was granted a leading position. Such coalitions inevitably became URP delegations and "independent players" quickly lost interest in their activities. It is understood that Republicans' unexpected desire to unite was prompted by purely practical considerations. Republican stakes in the upcoming elections are not very high and slogans like "Unity above all!" may increase chances for victory at the expense of possible partners. The URP remains loyal to its former strategy and will try to gain control over the future coalition. Republicans need the council, both to gain additional weight and neutralize its rivals. On the one hand, the URP cannot compete with representatives of the "party of power"; on the other hand, Republicans are trying to avoid competition with the Rukh and other national-democratic forces. The "peaceful" division of electoral districts between URP and the Rukh can be achieved through the newly formed council. The URP dreams of a situation in which its candidates could be nominated only in the districts in which there are neither Rukh nor "party of power" representatives, even more so if this could be done under the camouflage of consolidating the democratic movement. Having realized that the goals of the council are different from its declarations, the more moderate organizations began to back out. The example of the Party of Democratic Renaissance was followed by the "Greens." The Rukh found itself in a ticklish situation. Its leaders realized that they had been involved in somebody's schemes, having no control over the situation. It was not by coincidence that the URP-oriented Union of Ukrainian Students was invited to join the council, why the Rukh-affiliated Ukrainian Students' Association was not. Neither was the newly formed Youth Rukh Organization. However, the Rukh cannot abandon the council because in this case its leaders could be blamed for splitting the "national democratic forces." Those claiming that the Rukh made a strategic mistake in 1992, are probably right. At that time, following a declaration on opposition to the official power, the organization should have emphasized socioeconomic reform rather than national and cultural ideas. As a result of this mistake, forces representing similar ideas (the Party of Democratic Renaissance, the "Greens," and social-democrats) have not been included in the coalition, while those who threatened to destroy "the Chornovil movement" became its members. Cooperation between the Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] is the only possible counterbalance to URP domination of the council. Both parties have similar political programs and oppose the current administration, considered by them the successor of the Soviet nomenklatura. Finally, both the Rukh and the Congress have a very "cautious" attitude toward the Republican and Democratic Parties. However, there exists a certain difference in views between the KUN leadership and the rank and file, limiting the chances for cooperation with the Rukh. The leadership of the Congress is closer to the Rukh than its provincial organizations. Very often, especially in West Ukraine, Rukh and KUN advocates find themselves in two opposing camps. As a rule, candidates for deputies will be nominated not in accordance with their professional qualities, but in accordance with their party membership. Reliable sources have reported that in Poltava, for instance, URP will nominate its candidates in every district in which a Rukh candidate is registered. A similar situation may develop throughout eastern and central Ukraine, reducing the chances of all democratic candidates.
