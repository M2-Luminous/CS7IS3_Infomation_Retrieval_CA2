Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan, said: Japan has carried through its stance against the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets which could lead to managed trade. As a result, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks failed to hammer out an accord and I think that it was inevitable. Commenting on the future economic relations between Japan and the United States, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Association, said: I cannot help but say that the Japan-U.S. economic relations have entered a difficult situation. Mr. Nagano also expressed his caution against moves in the United States. Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: the U.S. Congress is moving toward imposing sanctions against Japan. We intend to use international trade rules to ask the U.S. Congress not to invoke sanctions against Japan. It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to make efforts to continue their discussions and build a firm cooperative relationship.
