Asked by Interfax to comment on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's statement that peace-keepers can't be sent to Abkhazia now because of unsuitable conditions there, Jinjolia noted that "there have always been conditions for a UN peace-keeping mission." In his words, Abkhazia's leadership adheres to a document signed in Geneva on January 13 at the end of the second round of Abkhazi-Georgian talks, envisaging the deployment of peace-keepers on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along the Inguri river. Last month Georgia changed its mind and called for positioning peace-keepers in Abkhazia, something that the Georgian leader Shevardnadze insisted on during his visit to U.S. earlier this month and in his speech at the United Nations. Meanwhile, the Abkhazi Parliament's Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba has declared that the introduction of peace-keepers in Abkhazia without its authorities' consent will be condemned as "an occupation with all the ensuing implications."
