He told reporters he does not know when he will make the speech, because the Diet's Steering Committees have the power to make the decision. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that the coalition government will arrange for the prime minister to make the speech on Friday. Hosokawa reiterated Sunday that he would make the speech on March 7, instead of this Friday as initially scheduled. He said, "the government is scheduled to submit the fiscal 1994 budget on March 4. It is being argued on the basis of past custom that the prime minister should make a policy speech on the day when the budget bill is submitted to the Diet." Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, said at a news conference that it will be difficult for Hosokawa to reshuffle his cabinet prior to parliamentary deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program if the premier delivers his policy speech on Friday.
