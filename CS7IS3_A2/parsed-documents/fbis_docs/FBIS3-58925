It could have come up with a formula clearly stating the temporary nature of the situation, the resigning members expressly being invited to return to their responsibilities as soon as "the matter has been cleared up" and their innocence confirmed by the courts. By contrast, the vast game of musical chairs conducted by Philippe Busquin and the choice of Elio Di Rupo as deputy prime minister bears witness to a very strict "realpolitik," staking all on a lasting revival of the coalition. Such an attitude may, however, lend credence to the idea that, in fact, over and above the inevitable expressions of solidarity, the Socialist Party is sacrificing the three Guys. Because it doubts in some way their complete innocence, or because that is the price which must be paid in order to restore its image. But will this quick fix then be enough to allow the coalition to get off again on the right foot, almost as if nothing had happened? Even if they are both bound by the same fear of electoral defeat, the PS and the CVP [Christian People's Party] have seen their old differences once again exacerbated by the recent events. Busquin and his colleagues cannot get it out of their heads that it is harassment by Flanders, and by the Flemish partners in the coalition in particular, which drove them to the episode of the triple resignation and which for several days created a Titanic-like atmosphere in the Socialist Party. If a full-blown political crisis, with elections thrown into the bargain, has been avoided as a result of these three resignations and wide-ranging reshuffle, there is reason to fear a resurgence of a muffled community war which will trigger a new separatist dynamic, at present dulled rather than eradicated, which, due to the increasing confusion of public opinion, will serve to break the fragile balance struck by the latest state reforms. Perhaps, therefore, the Agusta affair may no longer directly threaten the coalition, but it does continue to undermine political life and the foundations of Belgian society. It is still a matter of urgency that the truth, and the whole truth, be revealed.
