The Indian diplomatic mission in South Africa is being set up well ahead of the first free elections in the country slated for April. The pace of mutual co-operation between the two countries has been quickened since the signing of the historic protocol for diplomatic ties during the recent visit of the South African foreign minister, Mr R.F. Botha, to New Delhi. In the last few months, India has not only established a direct air link with South Africa but has also set up a cultural centre in Johannesburg. Last month, the minister of state for external affairs, Mr Salman Khursheed, paid an official visit to South Africa and met leaders of all the major political parties there.
