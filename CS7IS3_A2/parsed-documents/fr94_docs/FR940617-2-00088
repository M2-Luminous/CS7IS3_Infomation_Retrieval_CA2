FR940617-2-00088 FR940617-2-00052 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Transportation Conformity Rule The transportation conformity final rule, entitled ``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Funded or Approved Under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act,'' was published in the Federal Register on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). This action was required under section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Conformity to an implementation plan is defined in the Clean Air Act as conformity to an implementation plan's purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards. In addition, Federal activities may not cause or contribute to new violations of air quality standards, exacerbate existing violations, or interfere with timely attainment or required interim emission reductions towards attainment. The transportation conformity final rule establishes the process by which the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration of the United States Department of Transportation and metropolitan planning organizations determine the conformity of highway and transit projects. Under the rule, conformity applies in nonattainment and maintenance areas. The transportation conformity rule requires ozone nonattainment and maintenance areas to perform a regional emissions analysis of motor vehicle NOx emissions in order to determine the conformity of transportation plans and programs. This analysis must demonstrate that the NO x emissions which would result from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program were implemented are within the total allowable level of NO x emissions from highway and transit motor vehicles (``motor vehicle emissions budget''), as identified in a submitted or approved attainment demonstration or maintenance plan. Until an attainment demonstration or (for nonclassifiable areas) a maintenance plan is approved by EPA, the regional emissions analysis of the transportation system must also satisfy the ``build/no-build test.'' That is, the analysis must demonstrate that emissions from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program were implemented would be less than the emissions from the transportation system if only the previously applicable transportation plan and program were implemented. Furthermore, the regional emissions analysis must show that emissions from the transportation system if the transportation plan and program were implemented would be lower than 1990 levels by any nonzero amount. The transportation conformity rule as currently written provides for an exemption from these requirements with respect to NO x if the Administrator determines under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act that additional reductions of NO x would not contribute to attainment. This exemption is explicitly referred to and is described in similar language in §51.394(b)(3)(i) (the ``Applicability'' section of the rule) and in the preamble (58 FR 62197, November 24, 1993). The language is repeated in the provisions of the rule regarding the motor vehicle emissions budget test (§51.428(a)(1)(ii)) and the ``build/no-build'' test (§§51.436(e), 51.438(e)), although Clean Air Act section 182(f) is not specifically mentioned. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act contains requirements for_and in some cases, exemptions for_major stationary NO x sources in marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas and in an ozone transport region. EPA guidance for application of section 182(f) in these areas is briefly described and referenced in the next section of this preamble. Because the transportation conformity rule covers all nonattainment areas_including nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas ( i.e., submarginal, transitional, incomplete/no data areas) that are not necessarily covered under section 182(f)_corresponding guidance is needed for applying in these nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas the section 182(f) NO x exemption referenced in the transportation conformity rule. This guidance is described below (section II, ``EPA Policy'') and is consistent with the existing guidance that applies to the marginal and above areas outside an ozone transport region. The substantive test for a NO x exemption is the same in both sets of areas, but in nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas the effect of a NO x exemption is limited solely to the issue of whether such areas may be exempted from meeting the NO x requirements of the transportation conformity rule. B. General Conformity On November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214), EPA published the general conformity final rule, entitled ``Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.'' This action was required under section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Like the transportation conformity rule, the general conformity rule exempts an area from considering NO x emissions if the area has been exempted under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (see definition of ``precursors of a criteria pollutant,'' 58 FR 63248). In order to avoid repetition, this General Preamble describes guidance on NO x exemptions with respect to the transportation conformity rule. However, this guidance for transportation conformity is intended to also apply with respect to general conformity.
