The delegation is led by Yemeni Socialist Party Assistant Secretary General Salim Salih Muhammad. They discussed developments in Yemen. Salim Salih Muhammad said his meeting with the Chamber of Deputies speaker complemented earlier meetings the delegation had with the president and the prime minister. He added: We briefed him on the latest developments in Yemen and the ongoing fighting. We asked for Lebanese assistance to enable us to resume dialogue. We had a useful discussion and reached the conclusion that Lebanon's 16-year war experience proved that none of the parties involved could abolish the other parties and so dialogue proved indispensable. In Yemen we must learn a lesson from this experience, regardless of the ferocity of the fighting and one party's attempt to prevail over the other with guns and tanks. Nevertheless, this party will not be able to cancel the other party's political and natural rights. We need to draw lessons from the experience of other Arab countries that suffered civil wars. We must immediately accept a cease-fire, implement the relevant UN Security Council resolution, and start negotiations. Asked if on this visit to Lebanon he was carrying specific proposals or requests, he answered: We have made some proposals. Lebanon is an Arab League and United Nations member and has its own political and cultural role. Fraternal Lebanon can provide effective help in the difficult circumstances that Yemen is facing. Lebanon can join its Arab brothers who are following up the events in Yemen to help us emerge out of our difficulties.
