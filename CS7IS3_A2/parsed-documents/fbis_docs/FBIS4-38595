The statement says that a reinforced tank battalion and an antiaircraft battalion will soon be withdrawn from the strength and composition of the Black Sea Fleet forward defense combined unit and sent to Sevastopol to become part of the Black Sea Fleet marine brigade. Being formed at the present time are command structures for these subunits, some of whose officers have already moved to Sevastopol for permanent residence. It is characteristic, the statement says, that the Black Sea Fleet command should make a decision to pull the attack forces into Sevastopol with no prior notification to corresponding echelons or the necessary coordination. At the same time, the Black Sea Fleet command does not tire of stating its intention to stabilize the situation, and urges political figures "to do everything possible to resolve the questions under debate in a politically amicable way." The Ukrainian Navy press center statement voices bewilderment and alarm over the fact that "it has long been a practice with the Black Sea Fleet, which is subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia as before, to carry out a redeployment of forces, to have large groups of ships put out to sea." The Ukrainian Navy press center is authorized to make a resolute protest against the unilateral actions by the Black Sea Fleet command which hinder stabilization of the situation in Sevastopol and the Crimean region and stand in the way of developing normal friendly relations between Ukraine and Russia. The Navy command renews its readiness to solve the existing problems in a civilized way and counts on the prudence of the Black Sea Fleet command, and of all on whom peace and quiet on Crimean soil depend in some way or another.
