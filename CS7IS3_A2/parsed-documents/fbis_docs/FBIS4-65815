Before the end of the year, Banco de Santander will increase its ownership in the First Fidelity Bank from 22.7 percent to 24.9 percent, exercising all the warrants it expects to receive from the agreement it signed in 1991. At the same time, First Fidelity just acquired the Baltimore Bancorp, a Maryland bank with branches in Virginia, Delaware, and North Carolina, for $346 million. It is the fifth bank acquired by First Fidelity during the last i2 months, after Northeast Bancorporation, Village Financial of New York, People's Westchester, and the First People National Bank. Three Types of Activities To Be Developed Last summer the Banco de Santander requested permission from the Federal Reserve to operate as an investment bank and stock brokerage on the U.S. financial market through its affiliate Santander Securities, Inc. If the [Federal Reserve] response turns out to be positive, the bank group will invest $20 million in the capital of this affiliate. Banco de Santander wants to develop three types of activities on the U.S. market: to negotiate government securities and corporate stocks from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and South America; support companies in stock operations, mergers and reorganizations; and develop an active presence on the futures and options market. The Banco de Santander explains that the activity of its affiliate will be carried out as a priority in cooperation with institutional investors. If the Federal Reserve gives its green light, the Banco de Santander will be the first Spanish bank to operate as an investment bank and stock brokerage on the U.S. market. The bank group is already the first Spanish group on the U.S. market in terms of its assets, which have reached $8.127 billion--$3.5 billion alone for the Banco Santander Puerto Rico affiliate. Since August 1993, the bank also has owned 89.3 percent of the Kemper Corporation, which fulfills for Santander today the role which the new affiliate will play tomorrow. In fact, Santander intends to acquire the stock brokerage business of the U.S. group. Since 1982, Kemper Securities has lost $207 million. The commercial bank, Santander de Negocios, also helps Kemper manage the investment fund, The Growth Fund of Spain. All these operations will in the future be subject to the fate of the Banesto reorganization of its operations on the American continent and on their eventual integration into the Santander network.
