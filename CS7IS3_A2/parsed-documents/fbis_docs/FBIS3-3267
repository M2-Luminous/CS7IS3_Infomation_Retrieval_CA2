Airports for civilian use in seven local cities have been expanded, rebuilt or renovated, with original soil runways replaced by cement ones, advanced lightning equipment installed and other basic facilities greatly improved. Renovated airports in Huhhot and Hailar can now accommodate Boeing-737 and MD-82 airplanes day and night. Along with the improvement of airport conditions, the Inner Mongolia subsidiary of Air China has also brought in BAE-146 and Boeing-737 jets to replace older and smaller airliners. The increased number of airplanes of varying sizes has greatly enlarged total turnover of air transportation in Inner Mongolia with today's 15 airline routes of 20,000 kilometers long, linking the autonomous region with nine large domestic cities, Hong Kong and Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. This new air corridor over the endless grasslands and Gobi Desert in northern China has contributed a lot and will contribute more to local economic prosperity.
