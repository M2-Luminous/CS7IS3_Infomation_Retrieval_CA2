While some members called for stern measures against Togo, others urged the government to exercise restraint. This is because any war will result in the destruction of lives and property. This followed a statement by the member for Hoehoe-South, Mr. Koffi Kedem, at today's sitting of the house in Accra. The statement called for a quick and resolute response from the government for the crimes, unwarranted murders, and flagrant violation of the country's territory by Togo.
