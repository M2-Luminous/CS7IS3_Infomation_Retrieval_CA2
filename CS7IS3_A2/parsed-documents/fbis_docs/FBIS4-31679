His excuse was that the time is not right for giving interviews until the negotiations with the opposition are over. After much insisting and persuasion, and after saying that the representatives of the opposition make public appearances while the other side is silent, Radic agreed to give us an interview. As practically the second man of the state, Jure Radic is always an interesting interviewee, but the topic of this conversation was defined in advance by unsolved personnel problems in the Assembly. Obviously, this time we are not talking about mere political haggling, but about a process that could, in the next couple of years, define important political processes in the state, so we tried to focus our questions on that subject and reveal present positions of the ruling party. It is indeed strange that the HDZ, though it claims it has the majority, still agrees to make compromises that sometimes grow into blackmail. [Gugo] As we speak (Tuesday evening), the media are revealing the information about new positions in negotiations between the HDZ and the opposition, which has reiterated the demand to annul the session of the Chamber of Representatives. What do you think about that? [Radic] It is an unreasonable demand. That which is legal and constitutional, and does not go against the Standing Orders of the Parliament, cannot be annulled at the request of the opposition or any other political factor. The Croatian Assembly is a legislative institution defined by the Constitution and activities in the Assembly cannot be dealt with as controversial outside the Assembly. Therefore, the work of the Assembly can only be discussed by its legal bodies. All proposals of the opposition are based on the allegation that, for the time being, there are no other deputies in the Assembly except those representing the HDZ, which is not true. However, even if it were true, the work of the Assembly would be legal and legitimate provided that the HDZ has the majority vote. There is no reason to question the legality of its work. [Gugo] If that is so, i.e., if there is a quorum in the Assembly, why do you persist in reaching an agreement with the opposition? [Radic] We showed that the Assembly, in which the HDZ has the majority in both chambers, must work so as not to threaten the functioning of any other institution in Croatia. Many activities are dependent upon the work of the Assembly and we were aware of that. On the other hand, we wanted to hear out all proposals and suggestions of other political parties in order to use everything that might contribute to the general prosperity and interests of the Republic of Croatia. We do not want to use the power of majority at all times and work like that with regard to all activities of the Assembly. We have been trying to reinstate the opposition in the Assembly, to the benefit of the Croatian state. Nothing bad will come out of that. However, we will not do so at all costs. If they will not accept our good intentions, we are helpless. I am deeply convinced that the representatives of the opposition have left the Assembly quite unnecessarily. We are prepared to make certain compromises, but only provided they do not bring the essence of the functioning of Croatia into danger. That means we will not accept that what is legal and legitimate be declared illegal for the sake of political agreements. We understand and accept the new situation in the Assembly, and we are prepared to cooperate in accordance with the new circumstances, but only if that is politically correct. More In Than Out [Gugo] Why is the HDZ against Mr. Mesic and Mr. Manolic as vice presidents of parliamentary chambers? [Radic] The Club of the HDZ Deputies gave the freedom of choice to every deputy to decide as he or she thinks fit. We did not want to put pressure on anybody. I would not say that the HDZ does not accept certain individuals, since the HDZ did not make decisions with regard to individual members of the opposition. Mr. Mesic and Mr. Manolic were not accepted because the majority of parliamentary deputies, voting of their own free will, did not want to elect them. Those people have probably had their reasons for doing so. I think that the strongest reason for voting against them was that they left the HDZ, and turncoats always arouse indignation. The second reason are the letters written by Manolic and Mesic, which are negative about Croatia and which were sent abroad. [Gugo] A couple of days ago, Bozo Kovacevic, secretary general of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, was the guest star of an OTV [Youth Television] broadcast. On that occasion, in a discussion with Drago Krpina [HDZ deputy; currently advisor to the president on military matters], he gave an example of Stipe Mesic's unconstitutional behavior when he was the president of the Assembly. Today, the opposition in which the Liberals are the strongest party, insist on having Stipe Mesic. Could you comment on that? [Radic] I have not seen that program, so I do not know any details. I am convinced that there were no unconstitutional procedures in the Assembly, for the proper authorities would react to that. Personally, I am glad the opposition considers those two gentlemen their best representatives, for the Croatian public will be able to see their true colors. [Gugo] Mladen Vedris has also recently left the party. Since his function is important for the economy of Croatia, this could be considered a serious blow to the party in which you are secretary general. Will that influence the stability of the HDZ? [Radic] I was not surprised to see him leave. We were not weakened by the departure of some ten party members. Today, the Secretariat sent me new data which say that, in the past couple of months, 49 members left the party, but 796 new members joined the party in the same period. I have exact information about every county and I was particularly pleased to read this analysis. No member of ours is irreplaceable. We all have our reasons and those reasons should be dignified, so that we can realize our political plight, our confrontation of ideas, in a democratic and civilized manner. [Gugo] What will happen if the opposition maintains its demand to trade Manolic and Mesic for the annulment of the session of the Chamber of Representatives? Will the HDZ manage to keep the Assembly functioning or will there be early elections? [Radic] During those negotiations, an opposition leader asked us whether we negotiated because we wanted to develop democracy or whether we acted from the position of being a parliamentary majority. I said we negotiated from the position of a party that wanted to develop democracy in Croatia and we would do everything within limits to achieve that. At the same time, we are aware that we have the majority in the Assembly. We will try to reach an agreement with the opposition. Our concessions will not go below certain minimums which enable the functioning of the Assembly at present and in the future. [Gugo] So you are not considering early elections in the HDZ? [Radic] There is no reason for that, although I am convinced that would be beneficial for the HDZ. [Gugo] Everything that happened in the Assembly boils down to fighting for power. Some analysts are trying to make it look like the defeat of the left in the HDZ, i.e., of the state leadership, and the same sources report that extreme rightists, who hinder the functioning of the institutions of the political system, are coming to power. Is there any truth in that? [Radic] It is true that this is fighting for power. However, it is not true that this is the victory of the right wing of the party, i.e., that the HDZ lost its democratic quality. The latest events contributed to exactly the opposite. I am aware that we are losing the extreme left wing of the party, but that is good. At the Second General Assembly of the HDZ, we determined we wanted to be a firm party of the center with a very broad program. All those who cannot fit into that program will drop out. Our presidency and secretariat general implement this program. This does not mean that there are no extremes in our midst, but the problem lies in the fact that those people do not exert much influence on the work of the party. They act individually, and everyone has the right to do that. The most important thing is that no one can accuse of being extreme left or extreme right in our program or activities. Those events have taught us procedure and democratic process. On several occasions we confirmed our democratic orientation, and the presidential candidate for the Assembly was chosen by a secret ballot. We are aiming toward building a firmly central democratic orientation. No Conflicts With the Church [Gugo] Rumor has it that relations between Church and state have been strained. Is there any truth in that? [Radic] No. If each of those two institutions acts within its competence, there will be no conflict. It is important that the Church and the state do not interfere in each others' activity. I have personally witnessed good relations between the Church and the state and I know there are no conflicts, although there still is an occasional lack of understanding. However, that is mostly part of tradition, which can be transcended if there is a will. The Church and the state are working together for the benefit of the Croats. [Gugo] As we speak, Russian envoy Churkin is negotiating with Martic and Mikelic in Belgrade. Does that mean we are facing a new round of talks with the authorities in the temporarily occupied territory? [Radic] That gentleman will be here any minute now, and it is a pity that we cannot talk in a couple of hours. Our view is crystal clear: We do not want and will not delay solving the problem of our occupied areas. I say with full responsibility that this is the last mandate of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]! Our refugees can no longer bear the solution of their problems being postponed and we must remember that. The state leadership, considering the international circumstances, has no right to postpone the solution to those problems. An intensive diplomatic action is under way and we must explain to important international factors that this is the time to take concrete steps to solve the Croatian problem. Furthermore, we are prepared -- if the international community does not make any progress -- to start solving the problem with all the means at the disposal of a rule-of-law state. Those who died for our freedom oblige us to bring freedom into every Croatian home. That is our principal task in the following period.
