A 2.5 metre dish in Golm on a building of Potsdam University is connected to the Dubna nuclear research institute near Moscow. The institute in Dubna will have access to international scientific networks via the Potsdam link. The Institut fuer ComputerIntegriertes Engineering (CoIn) [Institute of computer-integrated engineering] in Potsdam is involved on the German side. EuroDATA Berlin, which established the communications needs of both sides on behalf of the state of Brandenburg, provides the service. Both the Dubna institute and the satellite project are supported by the Federal Research Ministry. Presently, 64,000 bits per second can be transmitted. According to the Brandenburg Transport Ministry, the system is to be expanded technically and related systems for links to Kiev and Minsk added to it. Scientists will thus gradually have better opportunities for exchanging data and pictures, and using future systems they will be able to hold video conferences.
