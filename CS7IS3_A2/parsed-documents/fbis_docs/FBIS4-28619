Security Council decides on sanctions against North Korea, Seiji Morimoto, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Saturday. Japan, South Korea and the United States did not discuss sanctions outside the United Nations at the tripartite talks in Washington, he said. Morimoto gave a press conference at the end of talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu. Kakizawa, who flew into Seoul earlier Saturday, called on President Kim Yong-sam. "The Japanese Government did not discuss specifics on sanctions against North Korea so far," said Morimoto, "but we are discussing the purpose of the sanctions and how to go about it within a big framework." The spokesman, as did Kakizawa, denied reports that Tokyo was passive about the sanctions. Asked about possibility of Japan's rearmament caused by North Korea's nuclear development, Morimoto reminded that Japan is the sole victim of a nuclear bomb. He said Japan will strictly adhere to its three principles -- not to develop, possess or introduce nuclear weapons. On groups of Japanese Socialist Party lawmakers visiting North Korea, Morimoto said they are irrelevant to the stance of the Japanese Government. "It is a matter entirely up to each, individual lawmaker," he said.
