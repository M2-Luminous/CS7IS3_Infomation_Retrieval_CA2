The whole world saw it. Nevertheless, diplomats were more interested in Warren Christopher's bland reaction. Nobody was surprised. In certain respects, the status of the U.S. representative at the Cairo ceremony was similar to that of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Both their contributions to the agreement signed by Israel and the PLO were paltry. Nobody in official Jerusalem is saying a word on the issue. On the contrary, Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres lavished praise on Christopher's objectivity. The man with the Indian features is considered one of the fairest statesmen Israel has had contact with since the Six-Day War. Beyond his personal attributes, however, how beneficial can he be in the Middle East arena? There has been no dearth of U.S. blunders in the 27 years since Israel took over the territories in a defensive war and declared its willingness to return to the international border in the Sinai and the Golan taking its security needs into account. Nevertheless, William Quandt's 460-page book "The Peace Process" shows that the Israeli-Arab conflict constantly featured in U.S. foreign policy. To wit, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger saw to linking the Israeli-Arab conflict to the world's oil reserves, the Vietnam war, the detente with the USSR and the openness toward China, and what not. Jimmy Carter was almost obsessive in his efforts to bring about peace between Israel and Egypt in Camp David, although he was not the one who initiated the move. How many lines will be devoted to Christopher's actions on behalf of Bill Clinton? There were years when Israel wished U.S. diplomacy would butt out, but that old pattern has long vanished. Assuming that 1994's Israel is interested in an active and spirited political process, the U.S. level of performance is disappointing to Jerusalem. After all, behind the smoke screen of flattery, Israeli experts gained the impression that Christopher did not fully grasp Hafiz al-Asad's sly intentions; that the Syrian president took the U.S. secretary for a ride; that he is actually unfit to steer the process upon his return to the region next week for a shuttle trip between Jerusalem and Damascus. What he brought back from his previous meeting with al-Asad aroused serious suspicions that he is unable to fully grasp the Syrians' true intentions, which the world must glean from hints and by reading between the lines. Israel's unofficial disappointment with the U.S. ability to perform the Herculean task the Israeli-Syrian contacts will entail is not detached from the overall Clinton Administration's foreign policy. After the retreat in Somalia, the disgrace in Haiti, the capitulation in North Korea, and the fears in Bosnia, U.S. allies around the world are having a hard time trusting its diplomatic mettle. Al-Asad, who is not thrilled about peace with Israel anyway and merely wants to have Syria struck from the list of terror-supporting states, does not really care that such doubts come up. Now, on the eve of the negotiations with Syria, Israel is clearly interested to monitor the actions of the U.S. diplomats who will be sent to the Middle East to carry out what they did with partial success in other areas around the globe. From Margaret Thatcher, America's loyal ally, going through the liberal commentator Anthony Lewis and the conservative Charles Krauthammer, the disappointment is sweeping and absolute. Thatcher has already warned Clinton about the conclusions his allies will draw from his failure in Bosnia. Such an event does not go without leaving an imprint. Also, using the United Nations as an alibi for the failures is pathetic. Krauthammer wrote in TIME magazine that when it comes to foreign policy Clinton must think as a President and not make decisions based on an analysis of UN Security Council resolutions. Israel has some experience of its own. Eytan Bentzur, the Foreign Ministry's assistant director general, sought to forge a link with North Korea which had been developing long-range missiles and avoiding international supervision of its nuclear facilities. The State Department dissuaded Israel from speaking on its own to North Korea, which had been developing a dangerous arms trade with Iran. The United States promised Israel to take action on the issue. How much weight does such a commitment carry in view of the recurring signs that Washington is not entirely averse to including Pyongyang in the nuclear club? In the context of the Middle East, Washington promised not to have a repeat performance of the Madrid conference under joint U.S.- Russian auspices. Although it trusts Clinton's goodwill, Jerusalem cannot trust his ability to stick to his guns. This is only the beginning. Furthermore, although America's status in the international arena is an indisputable fact -- even at a time when the man sitting in the White House is a President who is mostly engrossed in domestic policies -- Christopher and his entourage must still earn a solid position vis-a-vis al-Asad to enable Rabin to deal with Syria through them. Can they do that? On the eve of the resumption of the talks on the Jerusalem-Damascus track, one cannot avoid hearing the whisper of doubts.
