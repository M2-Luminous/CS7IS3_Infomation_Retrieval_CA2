FR941130-2-00021 FR941130-2-00010 (3) Adjust the reservation charges applicable to Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8 to reflect the impact of ``rolling in'' the costs associated with the expanded facilities. Texas Eastern states that the rate treatment is a material aspect of the agreements between it and the customers and therefore requests that the Commission specifically authorize this treatment, consistent with the Commission's previous ``firm-up'' orders, the agreement of the parties and Section 10 of Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8 Based on the annual cost of service for the facilities proposed herein, Texas Eastern proposes for Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;7, a revised reservation charge of $7.138 per dth. For Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;8, Texas Eastern estimates a revised reservation charge of $6.972 per dth. Texas Eastern asserts that provision of this service will, therefore, have no impact on the rate or services of Texas Eastern's other customers. Prior to the commencement of the proposed incremental services, Texas Eastern states that it will file revised tariff sheets for Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8 to reflect the adjusted reservation charges. Comment date: December 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 4. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation [Docket No. CP95&hyph;78&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), Post Office Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;78&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.208 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to construct and operate facilities located at Compressor Station 200, Chester County, Pennsylvania to comply with the Clear Air Act Amendments of 1990, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;426&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Transco states that the Clear Air Act Amendments of 1990 and state implementation plans pursuant thereto require certain reductions of NO X (oxides of nitrogen) air emissions at certain of Transco's compressor stations. Transco proposes to install certain facilities at the compressor stations to achieve the reductions of NO X . It is stated that Transco plans to install these facilities pursuant to its part 157 subpart F blanket certificate. 1 Transco states that it would file under the prior notice procedure if the total cost of installing facilities at a compressor station exceeded $6.6 million. 1 Transco states that it plans to install these facilities under the blanket authorization based on the precedent established in an order issued to Transco on December 27, 1993, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;737&hyph;000 (65 FERC ¶ 61,408). It is indicated that in that order the Commission authorized Transco to install under its blanket certificate a turbocharger at one of its compressor stations as a pilot project to reduce NO X emissions. Specifically, Transco states that at Station No. 200 in Chester County, Pennsylvania it plans to install turbocharger and associated equipment on six of the thirteen existing engines in order to reduce NO X emissions. It is stated that these engines currently do not have turbochargers on them. It is also stated that on the other seven engines, Transco states that it plans to modify the existing turbochargers to increase their capacity and install associated equipment in order to reduce NO X emissions. It is stated that, in both cases, these emissions would be reduced because of an increase in the air-to-fuel ratio and other engine adjustments. Transco states that the higher air content serves to increase the heat capacity of the mixture in the combustion chamber, which lowers combustion temperature and thus reduces the formation of NO X .
