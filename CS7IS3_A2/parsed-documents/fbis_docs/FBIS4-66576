The parties to the dispute are meeting today. Because of the absence of a minimum amount of service, several ships carrying semolina, flour, rice, and other food products have been waiting for days in hope of being unloaded, while other freighters are simply switching ports (and going to Mostaganem or Oran). The situation is causing the loss of an estimated 60 million centimes per day. The dockworkers are expressing their dissatisfaction with implementation of a traffic plan established by the port authority and stipulating where the various categories of personnel will enter the port. In accordance with that plan, it was decided on 9 October 1993 that dockworkers and day workers would not be allowed to enter through the main gate. Gate 17 was fitted out especially for them. When contacted by us, the port's general director, Boumessila, said that "the dockworkers have launched an illegal and unexpected strike without submitting a list of demands or undertaking negotiations with the management." For his part, Abdellah Redjadj, a member of the local union, said in the columns of ALGER REPUBLICAIN that the dockworkers were not on strike: "We come here every day to work, but they deny us access." He was referring to the main gate, where "everybody except us goes in." Consequently, they are refusing to go through Gate 17, which they say is dangerous: "That is where the trucks and the train enter." Redjadj also mentioned their chief demands, namely the opening of the main gate, pay for the days on strike, and a halt to the threats and acts of intimidation to which the dockworkers have been subjected. The meeting scheduled for today between the Labor Inspectorate, the local union, and the port authority should result in a quick solution to this problem, which has brought one of Algeria's biggest port enterprises to a standstill.
