He said: The Saudis could have acted more sensibly and not caused differences between the two important countries of the region. Today, Islamic unity is a principle as important for us as the disavowal of infidels principle. He added: Considering the crisis points in various parts of the world, and with the wise leadership of the honorable leader of the Islamic revolution [Khamene'i], another crisis was averted over this matter. The president advised the Saudis to think harder and to take on more correct methods in future years. He said: We hope that in the future, a program on the hajj acceptable to both countries will be formulated which will take into account the views of both sides. [passage omitted]
