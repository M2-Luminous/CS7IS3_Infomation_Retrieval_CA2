Swart] [Text] Johannesburg April 25 SAPA -- Bomb blasts damaged at least four polling stations on Sunday [25 April] night and Monday morning. The stations hit by the bombings were in Potgietersrus in the Northern Transvaal, Boksburg north on the East Rand, Bloemhof in the Western Transvaal and two in Steynsburg in the Eastern Cape. Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Ben van der Ross said the IEC was examining alternative sites and other requirements that had arisen as a result of damage to voting stations. The IEC did not foresee any difficulties in establishing alternative polling booths at short notice or directing voters to nearby stations. Further information would be made known to affected communities through the nearest IEC sub-provincial office. "The IEC deplores the loss of life in the spate of bombings during the night and this morning," Mr van der Ross said. The two explosions in Steynsburg on Sunday night caused an estimated R10,000 damage to the Khayamandi community hall polling station, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported. A second explosion rocked the town hall a short while later, causing slight damage. There were no injuries in either explosion and no-one had claimed responsibility by Monday morning. It was not yet known what type of explosives were used.
