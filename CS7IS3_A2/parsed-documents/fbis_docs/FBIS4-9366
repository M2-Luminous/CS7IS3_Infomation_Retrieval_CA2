The letter is based on Article 94, Paragraph 2, of the Croatian Constitution, which defines the president's obligation to secure adherence to the Constitution and the regular functioning of the state authorities. The letter demands that they investigate and establish the real state of facts, within their powers, regarding the claims by Stipe Mesic published in FERAL TRIBUNE on 25 March, in which he says: A number of murders have been committed, whose perpetrators have still not been arrested, although their identity is known. It is known who killed Reihl-Kir [head of Osijek police, killed in summer 1991], Saban Krivokuca, and the Zec family. The letter demands that the government and the relevant parliamentary committees, within their defined powers, examine the situation regarding protection of human rights and the implementation of the principles of a law-governed state, in particular all incidents which violate the legal order and all forms of crime. I am proceeding from the belief that the Croatian state authorities, despite the war, paid particular attention to the protection of human rights and implementation of all basic principles of a law-governed state, to the importance of the rule of law and the need for all state authority bodies strictly to adhere to law and the constitution and to effectively take measures to curb all forms of crime. I have emphasized this on many occasions, for instance in my address to the parliament on 23 March 1993, the letter says.
