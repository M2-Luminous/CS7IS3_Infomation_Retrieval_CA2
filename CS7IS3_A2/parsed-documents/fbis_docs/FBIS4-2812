The government said the peacekeeping forces must get visas before entering and staying in the Federal Yugoslavia and their vehicles must get approval before driving into the republic. The Yugoslav government, which met today to discuss the question of cooperation with the UN peacekeeping forces, denounced them for calling in NATO war planes to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. The government said that the UN peacekeeping forces ignored the Muslim forces' attempt to make use of the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde to attack the Serb positions. It accused the UN peacekeeping forces of siding with the Muslims and being completely involved in the Bosnia civil war. The government stressed that the UN and NATO actions will directly threaten the Bosnian peace process and could lead to escalation of the war.
