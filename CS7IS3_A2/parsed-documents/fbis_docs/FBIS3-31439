We sought to clarify and elaborate on this matter with Bosnian UN Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey. On the phone from New York this morning, we first asked him to tell us how he perceives and interprets Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's evidently dramatic declaration that the war has come to an end. [Sacirbey] These are the words of a man, of course, who has lied in the past and who has misrepresented the situation in the past. So, we will wait for his deeds rather than for his words. [Engel] Sacirbey emphasized that he was not thrilled by the idea of deploying Russian troops on the hills surrounding Sarajevo, even if this results in a Serbian retreat. [Sacirbey] As we know right now, there is growing Russian nationalism that now is gaining its expression through the Serbian fascism. We certainly do not welcome the presence of Russian troops overlooking the hills of Sarajevo. We were not consulted on this matter, and we should not accept it. Certainly, this would be akin to an invasion for us. [Engel] At this point, Sacirbey quite skeptically referred to another positive development in Sarajevo over the past 24 hours: the surrender of Serbian weapons to UN troops. [Sacirbey] While, in fact, the heavy weapons, at least some of them, may be withdrawn or placed under the control of the United Nations -- the Serbian heavy weapons -- it is important that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted. And as long as the Serbians continue to control the communications, the transportation lines in and out of Sarajevo, as long as they continue to control the electricity, the water, then I do not believe the siege is lifted. [Engel] Finally, in view of his interpretation of the events and two days before the deadline on the ultimatum to end the Serbian siege of Sarajevo, we asked the Bosnian UN ambassador whether he believes air strikes by NATO troops are still the right thing to do. [Sacirbey] Well, of course, we need to see if the heavy weapons are withdrawn, but it's my opinion that there are too many elements that are opposed to the air strikes at any cost and that the air strikes, I think, are sought to be avoided by any means, including the means of defining withdrawal and control of Serbian heavy weapons in such a way that it's so permissive that the Serbians.... [Engel] Sacirbey went on to say that some people are so convinced that such air strikes should be avoided at any cost that they are even persuading themselves that the Serbians are handing in their weapons to the United Nations and, consequently, are meeting the conditions imposed by the United Nations in a way that obviates the need for air strikes. Sacirbey said: I only hope that NATO and the West make sure that their demands are met in the field in an objective and genuine manner which at least coincides with the way I interpret terms such as cease-fire and withdrawal.
