Last week, Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress; Hubert de Ronceray's Mobilization For National Development; the National Conference; and the Congress of Haitian People for National Rescue submitted a joint resolution demanding a solution to the political crisis. The leaders of these political parties suggested the definitive closing of the file on negotiating the return of President Aristide, the restoration of state authority, the priority of a national constitutional solution, the formation of an ad hoc government capable of managing the embargo and executing a precise political agenda, and finally, the organization of general elections. The promoters of this resolution assert they have received a very large consensus on this proposal, a copy of which was sent to the Army General Staff, the Chamber of Deputies, as well as organizations and institutions from civilian society. In this resolution, an ultimatum was given to parliament. Parliament should come to a decision on the situation no later than this week.
