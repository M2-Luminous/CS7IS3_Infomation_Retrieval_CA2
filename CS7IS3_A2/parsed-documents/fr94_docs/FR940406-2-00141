FR940406-2-00141 FR940406-2-00090 Wednesday April 6, 1994 Part V Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing; Federal Housing Commissioner Notice of Funding Availability for Intermediaries to Administer Preservation Technical Assistance Grants; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 66␣/␣Wednesday, April 6, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing; Federal Housing Commissioner [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3719; FR&hyph;3473&hyph;N&hyph;02] NOFA for Intermediaries to Administer Preservation Technical Assistance Grants AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Notice of funding availability. SUMMARY: The Department requests applications from intermediaries seeking to administer grant funds as described in the body of this NOFA. An intermediary that applies to cover an area smaller than one State must seek to administer grants in a jurisdiction covering at least one HUD area office. Intermediaries will receive funding, to be used as processing fees, from a portion of the $45 million funding that is available for technical assistance grants to promote the ability of residents of eligible low-income housing to participate meaningfully in the preservation process established by the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA) and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA). The NOFA describes the technical assistance grants that will be made available through intermediaries and the selection criteria that will be used for those grants; however, this is not a request for applications for those direct technical assistance grants. Of the available funds, $13.5 million will be available for Resident Capacity Grants and $31.5 million will be available for Predevelopment grants. Both of these grant categories are described in Appendix A of this NOFA. Dollar amounts have been made available by State, utilizing the Department's estimates of preservation activity. Any additional amounts made available from the termination of the September 3, 1992, NOFA, or by appropriation in future years, if any, will be divided proportionately between the grant categories. In the body of this document is information concerning eligible intermediary applicants; the funding available by State; HUD's processing of the intermediary applications; grant applicants eligible for technical assistance; and the selection criteria for both the intermediary applicants and technical assistance grant applicants. Technical assistance applicants should be aware that the determination of which regulatory requirements apply to an applicant's purchase depends on the preservation program under which the owner has filed a Notice of Intent. Thus, applicants must comply with 24 CFR part 248 and with either ELIHPA or LIHPRHA, as appropriate. (Applicants should note that part 248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was amended subsequently in a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384), which reflects requirements of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.) DATES: The deadline for submission of intermediary applications is June 6, 1994. Applications must be physically received in the Preservation Division, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 6284, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410, by 5 p.m., EST, on the due date.
