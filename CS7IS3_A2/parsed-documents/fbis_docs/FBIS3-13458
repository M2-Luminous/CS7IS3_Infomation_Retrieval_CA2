How do you view Lebanon's position? ['Awn] Lebanon does not exist. Lebanon today represents a differential in the Syrian-Israeli equation. It has surrendered itself to Syria and can no longer sign or reject anything. It is completely silent. The Lebanese negotiator's position has been humanly disgraceful, standing like a dummy in front of the Israeli negotiator. It cannot discuss anything, or say yes or no. So it has become the object of ridicule. The proper thing is for the Lebanese to suspend their participation in the negotiations so that Syrian negotiations can advance. It is not a vacation in Washington. Let them wait for Damascus' signal to return. I say that Lebanon's participation does not mean it exists. It only exists as a differential variable between the Syrian view and Israeli view of Lebanon. It is regrettable for us to become a margin in an equation, not a personality in its own right. This is what I meant before when I said that we should sit at -- not on -- the negotiating table [as published], and I called for a three-sided, not two-sided table, that is a table at which Lebanon, Syria, and Israel would sit and through which Lebanon could talk about its right. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] You reject what you call Syrian occupation of Lebanon and yet accept what the Arabs consider Jewish occupation of Palestine. ['Awn] No. I reject the Israeli occupation. But is the Jew present in Israel not entitled to set up his entity or not? Is Palestine not his territory or not? Your will tell me that he is an immigrant and a stranger. But I ask you: When have human societies ever been fixed? Are there not ten times more Arabs in the United States than Israelis in Palestine? Here, in France, there are some 3 million people of Algerian origin. Human societies are not fixed ethnically or religiously. [Shirbil] But ethnic and Arab communities in France or the United States do not set up separate entities hostile toward their environment. ['Awn] Yes, there are entities causing problems. But their members enjoy the civil and political rights enjoyed by the Americans or the French. There is no discrimination in the law. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] What is your expectation as regards the future of fundamentalism? ['Awn] It will inevitably come to power in Islamic states, but it will fall after reaching power. Then a reexamination will be conducted from within Islam. [Shirbil] Did you hope that fundamentalism would assume power in Algeria? ['Awn] I do not wish that to happen, but they will come to power. It is a natural, historic rule. It has nothing to do with whether or not I wish that to happen. I am not a fundamentalist, and I reject fundamentalism openly. However, I expect them to come to power. Then they will fail because they make many promises of solutions to the problems. But they are primitive solutions which will complicate difficult problems. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] How can the fundamentalist tendencies which you expect to come to power influence Lebanon? ['Awn] We are in the region, and certainly fundamentalism will influence Lebanon. We have people who support fundamentalism and consider it a hope for a reasonable solution. [Shirbil] You cannot say that there is a sweeping fundamentalist tendency in Lebanon. It is one of the parties... ['Awn] Lebanon is disorganized demographically. There is horrific population growth. A sizable proportion of Lebanese used to emigrate, but this is not possible now. The Lebanese abroad cannot find jobs, and they want to return to Lebanon. Western societies are full of unemployed people. France has 4 million of them, and the United States 23 million. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] Can the growing fundamentalist tide lead to a coexistence crisis in Lebanon, or does the crisis already exist? ['Awn] A coexistence crisis exists in most pluralistic societies. But when there is a national authority and dialogue over the issue, problems will be solved. It is always possible to find solutions for them. But what happened in Lebanon was that, as a result of existing pressures caused by coexistence and pluralism, some external parties intervened and stability was undermined and Lebanon taken over by Syria. This is in addition to the Israeli occupation in the south. Every occupier says the other occupier is the cause of its presence. But both are occupiers: an enemy occupation and a brotherly occupation, as they say. Their effects on citizens are the same. There is social pressure in a country that is pluralistic ethnically, religiously, and culturally. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to himself. Freedom and equality are the foundation of the relationship among the Lebanese. Equality should be through opportunities, not rights, because rights necessitate justice, and justice necessitates distinguishing between people: everyone should be rewarded on the basis of his competence. [sentence as published] If a section of the Lebanese does not accept that, a referendum should be held -- a referendum on political ideas. So if the idea is accepted, it should be accepted with all its results. And if it is rejected, it should be rejected with all its results. On that basis, if unification is not accepted on the basis of a constitution, equality, and everyone's rights and duties, federalism becomes a solution. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] The events witnessed in pluralistic states that include sectarian and ethnic... ['Awn, interrupting] Let us talk freely and very openly. The ball of unification is in the Lebanese Muslims' court. If they have any courage, let them embark on unification within not 'Awn's concepts but universal concepts, because these concepts are not mine. [Shirbil] As though your plan is outside... ['Awn] Let them adopt the Bosnia plan. [Shirbil] Which is? ['Awn] A federation and a confederation like the one signed between the Croats and the Bosnians. This or that. [Shirbil] Is there anything else which you consider amiss? ['Awn] The present situation is not under control. There are no state structures to exercise powers and assume responsibilities at all levels. Because the state is based on excesses. The head of state said that General 'Awn left Lebanon following an agreement with him and with several other parties. Do you imagine that they hit me by aircraft under an agreement with me. And that they stripped me of my rights in the military establishment under an agreement with me. [passage omitted] [Shirbil] Do you support the resistance against the Israeli occupation in the south? ['Awn] I support the resistance in every sense of the word. However, I would to explain one point: At the negotiations held in Washington Israel clearly announced that it does not want a single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of water in return for border security. Israel says that it wants to withdraw in return for border security and joining the peace process, which is supported by the Arab states and on the basis of which they are negotiating. So why the resistance now? I should ask this resistance about its links. You should not ask me whether or not I support the resistance. The continuation of the resistance forced Israel to stay and forced the parties using Israel's presence as an excuse to stay. If Syria's value increases as a result of the resistance, who is going to pay the price? Will Israel pay Syria from Israel, or will the resistance pay the price if a solution is secured? [passage omitted] [Shirbil] Has anyone invited you to return to Lebanon? ['Awn] There are numerous offers. There are open invitations from Nabih Birri, Eilie al-Farzali, and Eilie Hubayqah. [Shirbil] Do you believe your security is not guaranteed? ['Awn] Nothing is guaranteed in Lebanon. Tell me any major crime whose clues have been unraveled. [Shirbil] Will your remain as an oppositionist... ['Awn] More than an oppositionist. I am not an oppositionist. I am a resister. Oppositionists recognize the regime and oppose it. I do not recognize the present regime, which is why I am resisting. Resistance does not necessarily mean carrying a gun. [passage omitted]
