FBIS3-16325 "drsov051cc_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-051 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 16 Mar LD1603071094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0538 GMT 16 Mar 94 LD1603071094 Moscow ITAR-TASS Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow March 16 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the situation in Tajikistan: "The situation has now radically changed: Moscow has managed to do what seemed impossible only recently -- to persuade the present Dushanbe authorities and the opposition into sitting down at the negotiating table". "Moscow's rather rigid stand in the reassessment of events in Tajikistan by the leader of the regional superpower, Islam Karimov, make it possible to hope that at the forthcoming talks the conflicting sides will reach some kind of compromise: If moscow succeeds in achieving success, that will be a major triumph of Russian diplomacy". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Umerserik Kasenov, director of the Institute of Strategic Studies to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kosenov points out: "The process of the formation and development of newly-independent states is now under way in Central Asia in difficult conditions. Much in this process undoubtedly depends on Russia which keeps hold of powerful economic, political and military levers for influencing the situation in the Central Asian region... "Unfortunately, Russia's foreign-policy course with regard to the ex-Soviet republics, including Central Asian ones, increasingly indicates that it pursues a divide-and-rule policy". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict: "Vladislav Ardzinba availed himself of the ground provided by the Georgian parliament to announce the termination of political talks between Georgia and Abkhazia until the decision to dissolve the Abkhazian parliament and to institute judicial proceedings against its members is cancelled. "Despite the fact that the dispute, it would seem, is a formal legal one and concerns the situation which preceded the start of the armed conflict, the Georgian parliament's resolution really interrupted the contradictory as it was dialogue which has been conducted until now between representatives of the two conflicting sides". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an interview with Ramiz Razayev, plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of Azerbaijan to Russia, who points out: "As far as Russia's role in a peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is concerned, one should proceed from the assumption that Russia's geopolitical and economic interests are in need of stability on its southern borders... Therefore, we regard Russia's active participation in settlement efforts and the country's unprejudiced stand as major factors leading to a resolution of this complex problem". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Mikhail Mironov, chief of the mail department of the presidential staff. He said that up to 1,500 letters addressed to the country's president come in every day and deal with a broad spectrum of problems while the department has 100 staff members. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA referring to an informed staff member of the central office of the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS) asserts that "the presidential administration is studying as one of reorganisation options the possibility of dividing the FCS with a transfer of its functions to other bodies. "The FCS counter-intelligence operations directorate is expected, in particular, to be turned over to the Ministry of Justice and to be transformed into a federal investigation directorate. "The economic counter-intelligence directorate and directorate for the security of strategically important industrial facilities is suggested to be subordinated to the Ministry of Economics while the military counterintelligence will be brought under the authority of the General Staff as an independent directorate. "The anti-terrorism directorate is expected to be brought within the competence of the Interior Ministry. The idea of dividing the FCS is authored by one of the members of the Russian Security Council... "FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin said he will have a meeting with the Russian president soon. He did not refute the information that proposals to reorganise the FCS and transfer its powers to other agencies come in to Boris Yeltsin. "If the proposals are implemented, a serious blow will be dealt to security agencies. I categorically object to it and I oppose those who make such proposals. One should ponder what for they do that. I am deeply convinced that Russia and the president need strong secret services. I will uphold this thesis during a meeting with Yeltsin," Stepashin said. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) Carries an interview with Major-General Yuriy Drozdov, former chief of illegals' counterintelligence. He expressed regret that the Vympel special-purpose unit has broken up. He regarded with understanding the Vympel officers who did not opt to serve on the payroll of the Interior Ministry. "I do not censure them. They were prepared to uphold the interests of the native land and their people from an outside foe and outside their country. The sense of devotion to their people, the duty and honour of the intelligence officer did not allow them to act otherwise". The general referred to the break-up of the unit as "the worst thing that could happen". He is convinced that such a unit is necessary for the country now as well, emphasising that a special- purpose unit, whose officers did not know what the word 'impossible' meant, has ceased to exist. In PRAVDA, prominent film director Stanislav Govorukhin said on the same subject: "the October events showed: the Ministry of Security will not carry out criminal orders and will not act against their people. To my mind, it has already become a commonly known fact how worthily the ministry's units Alpha and Vympel behaved in those days. "I want to draw the readers' particular attention to the following circumstance: the Security Ministry was disbanded at a time when it almost entirely switched over to action against economic crime which inflicts the greatest damage on the state". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an interview with Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, who said that the operational structure of troops has been basically broken up following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. "We have lost territory and, accordingly, the strategic echelon, while the reserve forces constitute the core of the first operational echelon. It was needed to create groups of troops throughout the western and southwestern sectors practically anew". Kolesnikov said the complexity was in the fact that units subject to withdrawal had to settle in places which lacked the necessary infrastructure. "This was taking place during the period of the development and reforming of the Armed Forces with an acute shortage of material resources and funds", Kolesnikov said. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma committee on information policy and communications, who suggests that the powers of the president and parliament be extended until 1998. Poltoranin touched upon the problem of drawing up a memorandum of civil accord. His opinion is that such a document should be backed up by deeds without fail. "Let it be a small memorandum with clear-cut declarations but it should be supplemented without fail with a treaty on coordinated actions of the authorities, specific actions with a specific time-frame." ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE reports that the Ivangorod mayor's office has reinstated a voluntary public order maintenance squad. The newspaper points out that every member of the public order squad will be paid for every hour on duty from the funds of the city department of internal affairs while the maintenance of the chief of staff of the squad has been assumed by the mayor's office.
