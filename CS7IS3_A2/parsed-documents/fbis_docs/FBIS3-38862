In a letter to the prime ministers, he also announced that he would contact them directly in the event the negotiations become difficult. "The issues of transit, agriculture, and holiday homes remain unsolved. Austria's position on these issues has nothing to do with the wish to get special treatment, but it is the result of a businesslike effort to show the differences from other situations or to ask for a step-by-step adaptation to a joint system, which was conceded to other member states in the past, too," Vranitzky writes. For the government it is, therefore, essential to reach a result in the negotiations that takes these special features into account.
