[Horn] Yes, I said this at the beginning of 1990, taking Hungary's situation into consideration. For I am yet to be shown another state having such a large national minority living beyond its borders than Hungary. There are nearly 4 million people living in the vicinity beyond our borders and this has always been the source of some sort of tension. When we raise our voice to secure their rights, it inevitably creates tensions in bilateral state relations. Therefore, it would have been good if NATO related to us a little bit differently than to the other neighboring countries, taking Hungary's special position into consideration. However, this is a question for NATO; it is their affair and they should have perhaps followed a slightly more circumspect policy toward us. [Bankuti] But I think your views have not changed on this score. [Horn] Not at all. I remain a believer in joining the Western European integration organizations. I wish to remind people that the predecessor of this government, of which I was also a member, submitted the bid for associate membership. [passage omitted] [Bankuti] Your party says that the eastern markets have to be revived. However, these eastern markets have collapsed. [Horn] [passage omitted] We can see that the western markets are rather limited for us, precisely because of the recession, which we talked about earlier. However, I consider that, for example, in the field of agriculture....[pauses] We can put agriculture back on its feet and we want to do this. If there is a national issue, than it is the issue of putting agriculture back on its feet. The market for our products from agriculture and the food industry can primarily be eastern Europe. I agree that the method of payment for goods is the greatest difficulty in relation to the eastern markets. However, if need be, we have to adjust to the conditions. If need be, we have to create barter trade, product for product. It is not the most modern form but excuse me, we have to stay alive, what is more, we have to progress. [passage omitted] The task of a government is to create the fiscal and other conditions and structures to enable the progress of this kind of trade. So we cannot give up the eastern markets, which, nevertheless, does not mean the weakening of Hungary's relations with the western states in the least. [Bankuti] [passage omitted] Let us now listen to our talks with Gabor Kuncze [leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ]. [passage omitted] [Kuncze] The current situation must not be conceived as if the opposition roundtable was now being reformed again, as if the opposition were again in a resolute confrontation with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], should the MSZP form a government on its own. [passage omitted] [Bankuti] Still, once upon a time you [the Alliance of Free Democrats] were in alliance with the other opposition parties, whereas now you think that this MSZP is different from that MSZP, or rather its predecessor the MSZMP [Hungarian Socialist Workers Party], with which the opposition roundtable negotiated. [Kuncze] This MSZP is certainly not the MSZMP, it is different even in name, it refuses even to identify itself with the MSZMP past. The MSZP has been conducting its policy in parliament during the past four years and on the basis of all this one must not identify the MSZP with the earlier MSZMP. I agree with this. [passage omitted] [Bankuti] [passage omitted] Is there full unity within the MSZP? [Kuncze] [passage omitted] It is not my task to speak about the internal affairs of the MSZP and I would not like to do so. Obviously there are problems there because it is perhaps not by coincidence that the MSZP was unable to name a candidate for the post of prime minister. The question is whether it will be the ideas of Laszlo Bekesi and those around him that will prevail or the line of Gyula Horn and Sandor Nagy that will be followed. There is a great question mark as to what is happening to Matyas Szueroes and those around him. However, I consider this to be an MSZP internal affair and I am not sure that I have to deal with this. However, one thing is certain: The SZDSZ -- should there be any coalition negotiations -- can conceive of such negotiations only on the basis of the MSZP's written economic program, a program that Laszlo Bekesi described as a liberal-minded economic program. From this point of view it is interesting that last week Sandor Nagy published a statement in which he addressed the issue of a coalition with the SZDSZ saying that it would be a very difficult one, because for a Socialist Party a liberal economic policy is unacceptable. [passage omitted] [Bankuti] Would you like to comment on this? [Horn] Well, I have to comment quite a lot. [passage omitted] As to what kind of trends exist within the MSZP, well let me tell you again, and please believe me: The MSZP has one economic program. This program was prepared by Laszlo Bekesi and this program was adopted by the MSZP congress. This program was adopted by the candidates of the party, Sandor Nagy included. As to how this program can be realized -- and let me tell you that many outsiders considered it to contain more liberal elements than the similar program of the SZDSZ -- this is an enormous question. Nobody has the panacea for solving the problems of the country. So we have one program and it is time to stop this debate about which trend will be the winner. People usually say that I represent the so-called centrist line. I do not mind this description at all. However, I would rather say that I represent the line that unites the different views within the party and prevents the party's cart being tugged this way and that way, neither to the right nor to the left. I consider this very important. Naturally, there are differences of opinion within the party that only proves that this is a big party. [passage omitted] If we manage to come to an agreement with the SZDSZ, I emphasize, the program adopted at our congress on 28 February 1994 will be realized. [passage omitted] What we promised during the election campaign is true: We want to improve the situation of the people and we want to start this as soon as tomorrow. No, we want to start today. We pledged our life and our political work to this.
