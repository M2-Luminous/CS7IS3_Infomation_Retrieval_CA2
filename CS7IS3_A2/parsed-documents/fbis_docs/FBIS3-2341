Before this, the area had already set records for constructing a 24-km highway within a year and two world-level bridges within five years. Jointly invested by Japan's Hitachi Ltd, a Shanghai company in the sector and a Chinese investment company, the Shanghai Hitachi Appliances Co. Ltd, aims to introduce advanced compressors from Hitachi to give a push to the domestic industry. According to Shen Jianfang, two modern workshops with a total floor space of over 10,000 sq m, have been erected in the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone. He said that the project is listed among the state-level high- tech projects and is planned to be built into China's biggest production center in the industry, with an annual capacity of 1.4 million compressors and an output value of 1.6 billion yuan. He attributed the high efficiency to the urgent demand on the domestic market. In 1992 over 1.57 million air-conditioners were sold, while only 300,000 compressors were produced. The project introduced highly automated equipment from Japan, the United States and Germany. Tested by Japanese quality supervisors, the products have overtaken those from its counterparts in Southeast Asian countries which were also launched by Hitachi, Shen said.
