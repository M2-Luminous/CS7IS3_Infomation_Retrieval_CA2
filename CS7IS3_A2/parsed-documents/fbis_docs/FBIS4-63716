Sergey Shakhray Is Sure: the Russian Federation Constitution Is Not a Bronze Monument"] [Text] Opening parliamentary hearings on the issue of compatibility of the constitutions of the republics and the charters of the territories as part of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Lysenko called on the few participants to look at the experience of China which, according to him, "has created a liberal market economy, preserved a communist ideology and thereby ensured the country's integrity." The thrust of Mr. Lysenko's complaints against the republican constitutions was that some of them enshrine what he sees as excessive independence. An ideal regional constitution, "which draws virtually no criticisms at all," is, in Mr. Lysenko's view, Kalmykia's Steppe Code [Stepnoye ulozheniye] (Kirsan Ilyumshinov even proposed that his republic be equated to a governorate). A deputy from Tataria, Mr. Lazovoy, objected to this: "If there are so many constitutions which contradict the Russian Constitution, is it not easier to change it then?" Federal Council Committee Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko sharply disagreed with "the introduction of a treaty-based system" in relations between the center and the regions. Bilateral agreements between Moscow and individual republics, in his opinion, create "a legal system that runs parallel with the constitution." The senator complained: The economically stronger krays and oblasts "are justly annoyed by the fact that the republics are in a privileged position." The sole "high guest" at the hearings -- Sergey Shakhray -- on the other hand advocated wide dissemination of "Tataria's experience." According to him, the contradictions between the republics' constitutions and the federal Fundamental Law must be adjusted through bilateral treaties. In parting, Mr. Shakhray said that the Russian Constitution itself "is not a bronze monument either..." Representatives of approximately 20 regions took part in the hearings, mainly of rank no higher than deputy chairmen, deputy chiefs, or advisers.
