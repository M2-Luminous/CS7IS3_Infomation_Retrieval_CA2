The two A321 flight prototypes equipped with V2500 reactors supplied by International Aero Engines (IAE) had accumulated 605 flight hours on 17 December 1993, when the aircraft was approved by the European certification authority (JAA). This paved the way for a first delivery to Lufthansa, the German airlines, next 27 January. The other two flight prototypes, equipped with CFM56-5B engines, already total 400 flight hours and are still being tested in Toulouse. This second A321 version should be approved by the JAA some time next March. JAA approval should occur simultaneously with that of U.S. certification authorities (FAA), for versions equipped with either engine. Alitalia, who bought 40 A321 equipped with CFM engines should receive its first aircraft immediately after this certification, late in March. The A321 is the elongated version of the A320, which means that it has a longer fuselage, as well as modified flaps and more powerful thrust engines (133.4 kilonewtons [kN] for the V2530-A5 engine, and 137.9 kN for the CFM56-5B2 engine, i.e. respectively 30,000 and 31,200 lbs of thrust). It also includes modifications enabling it to carry 185 passengers (or a maximum takeoff payload of 83 tons or 183,000 lbs) over up to 4,250 km (2,300 nautical miles) and at a cruising speed of up to Mach 0.82, while benefiting from the experience of an aircraft that has been in service since 1988. The Airbus Industrie backlog of orders includes 153 A321 ordered so far by 11 clients. Deutsche Airbus, which makes them, has already assembled eight aircraft (including the four prototypes). Production Authorization Simultaneously with the certification of the A321 IAE version, Airbus Industrie was just authorized to produce this entire aircraft line by French and German certification authorities (the DGAC [General Directorate of Civil Aviation] and the LBA [Germany's equivalent of the FAA]). This authorization will enable the consortium to complete on its own the compliance statement procedures for each unit produced in Toulouse or Hamburg. This obligation must be fulfilled before the certification authorities of the country of origin (in this case France and Germany) will issue the aircraft airworthiness certificate required for delivery. Until now, these procedures were completed by Bureau Veritas, a body approved by the DGAC.
