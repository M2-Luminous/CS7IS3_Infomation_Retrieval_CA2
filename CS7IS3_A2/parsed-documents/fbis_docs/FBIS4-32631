This statement was made at a press briefing held yesterday by Deputy Minister Miroslav Kalousek. He described the ACR's drawing on the budget this year as equable. The development plan should include stipulations concerning the human, material, and financial resources for the Army and its programs up to the year 2005 in accordance with the priorities of the defense strategy. According to M. Kalousek, the ACR's acquisition plan for its modernization should be defined by mid-1995. At the same time, the Defense Ministry will give preference to negotiations with direct producers, and the final supplier should be a domestic company. Public competitions and tenders, with the exception of cases where the nature of the order makes this impossible, will be implemented as much as possible in making purchases and sales. To simplify the contractual relationship, the ministry will try--as, for example, it is doing at the moment in selecting a food supplier--to find a central guarantor who would, among other things, make it possible to resolve the problem of different regional prices. In this connection, Kalousek referred to the ministry's attempt to create the most clear-cut system possible in harmony with legal and ethical norms, a system that would eliminate the risk of influence being brought to bear on the choice of Army suppliers. The new Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), which is operating in parallel with the system utilized to date, should make the Army's economic management considerably clearer. The ACR will transfer to double-entry bookkeeping in 1995. In assessing the Army's transformation, Kalousek emphasized its quite reductive nature. For example, only five of the original 12 military airfields should remain in operation. The ACR intends to offer to interested parties, within the framework of stipulated contractual conditions, those reserve airfields whose operation is costly. Projects are now being drawn up for the airfields in Bechyne, Zatec, and Hradec Kralove and for combined operations in Pardubice. The Army is selling off or transferring to other entities its unserviceable facilities and hardware. The money saved by reducing the cost of maintaining the Army can be used for its modernization, said Kalousek.
