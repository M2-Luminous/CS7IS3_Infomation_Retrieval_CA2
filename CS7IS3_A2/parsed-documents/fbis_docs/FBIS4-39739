The deputies thought the submitted budget scandalous. Deputy Bakur Gulua described the very attempt to propose such a budget for parliament's consideration as immoral and insulting. Bitter dissatisfaction greeted the point in the budget that speaks about parliament's needs -- as little as 0.3 percent is set aside for them. Dissatisfaction was also expressed with regard to the sum reserved for the head of state's staff -- 0.7 percent. Little more than that was allowed for the entire system of education. "We have no use for a government that counts already worthless money in such an original manner," the parliamentarians said in almost one voice. The din in the room rose a notch when Basiliya gave even more totally unacceptable figures for the deputies: 6 percent of the budget was earmarked for the needs of governing the state and not more than 4 percent toward the Defense Ministry's enormous demands. "Enough of deceiving each other," Deputy Tengiz Kitovani stated, and moved that discussion of the budget be postponed so that the head of state, the prime minister, the vice prime ministers, as well as the president of the National Bank and the finance ministers, who are away on trips at the moment, could be present. The discussion of the budget will continue today.
