The letter expressed regret at the fact that the South Korean Red Cross was still failing to exert efforts for the two old men's repatriation. To meet their demand for repatriation is a just and fair behavior in view of humanitarianism and the international law, it noted, urging the South Korean Red Cross to help so that Kim and Ham may return to the DPRK without delay. The letter strongly demanded that the South Korean authorities abrogate the "National Security Law" and set free all the prisoners of conscience including unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea.
