This was stressed by Qian Fenyong, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, at the 24 January regional meeting of presidents of intermediate people's courts. The fundamental tasks on the judicial work of people's courts in 1994 are: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, people's courts should continue to deal strict blows to criminal offenses, make greater efforts to try major and appalling cases, particularly major economic cases, energetically regulate the relations between different economic sectors, actually safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations, strict enforce laws, enhance the level of judicial work, help safeguard social stability, help strengthen administrative honesty, and help accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. Qian Fenyong said in his speech: This year, reform, opening up, and economic construction will enter a new stage of all-round acceleration. The more reform and opening up is deepened, the faster the economy will develop, and the more important the endeavor of safeguarding social stability will become. Establishing the socialist market economic structure constitutes a large-scale readjustment of economic interests in the whole society. Along with the increase in the dynamics of reform, some new contradictions and problems will emerge, and the factors affecting social stability will probably increase in a certain period. To successfully safeguard social stability, people's courts must successfully exploit all their functions of dealing blows to crimes, regulating the relations between different sectors of the economy, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the people. In the course of dealing strict blows to crimes, people's courts at all levels should make greater efforts to try economic cases, civil cases, administrative cases, accusations, and appeals and should consciously apply the legal means to standardize market behaviors, to regulate the relations between different sectors of the economy, and to appropriately tackle all sorts of contradictions in society. People's courts should successfully safeguard social stability in basic and essential fields. He said: Success or failure in the anticorruption campaign has a direct bearing on the success or failure in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. For now and and in the foreseeable future, a number of lawsuits on major and appalling economic cases are and will soon be soon brought to people's courts for lawsuit. Successfully trying these cases and strictly punishing a number of corrupt elements according to the law constitutes an important sign of the in-depth launching of the region's anticorruption campaign as well as a hot spot closely related to the masses. People's courts at all levels must now pay attention to trying economic cases, major and appalling ones in particular, by regarding it as a key task. Moreover, major and appalling cases which have strong repercussions in society and which concern the masses must be handled and punished resolutely, no matter what interferences arise. Attending the meeting were Wang Xiumei, vice chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee; Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the region; and other pertinent leaders.
