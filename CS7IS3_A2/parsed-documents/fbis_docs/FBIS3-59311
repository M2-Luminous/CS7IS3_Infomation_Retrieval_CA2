Inherent Causes of, Legal Countermeasures Against Antidumping Actions Apart from some irrational provisions of antidumping laws in foreign countries and in the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and in their application, there are also in China's own present political and economic system many deficiencies and problems which have given cause for investigations of China's conditions by various European and American countries. A. China's foreign trade system is basically one of strict controls, but in actual fact, exports are not effectively administered, and imports too are not strictly controlled. On the other hand, all export-import companies and foreign trade-oriented enterprises are themselves responsible for earning their own foreign exchange and for their own profits, and they are also ignorant of the law. For these reasons they will not hesitate to fight among themselves, pushing down each other's export prices, causing a continuous decline in the prices of China's export products. This then of course easily incurs accusations of dumping. B. Target areas of China's exports are limited and export distribution is irrational. Because China's reform and opening up has only been going on for a short time, China's markets abroad are still very limited. The countries and territories to which China presently exports on a regular basis are Hong Kong, the European Community, and the United States. Chinese products have not yet penetrated other markets, such as Latin America, for example. Under these circumstances, export products are being distributed to an extremely narrow field, and there is also no unified coordination between China's enterprises, so that the allocation of markets has very obviously become somewhat irrational. Even more serious is the widespread practice of the "three ins and one compensation" trade (importing materials for processing, importing samples and ordering corresponding goods, importing parts for assembly, and compensation trade). Although these types of trade have, to a certain extent, been profitable for China, the various countries will compute quantities and prices according to the origin of the merchandise. China's profits will then be extremely small, while Hong Kong, the main entrepot for such trade, will reap the largest share of the profits, while China will also have to bear the risk of antidumping measures by foreign countries. In view of the two points mentioned above, China must adopt, in legal respects and as soon as possible, the following measures: 1. In legal respects, there has to be a further clarification of the legal position of the various state agencies in charge of import-export affairs and of all import-export companies and enterprises, and a clarification of their respective rights and obligations. This would require that China promulgate as soon as possible a "Foreign Trade Law," which would have to fix in legal terms the whole series of mutual relations involved, and should lead to a state of affairs in which economic activities would have laws to rely on and rules to follow. The state's import-export administration must combine the strict with the moderate, and must take firm control of the main issues. At present, China's agencies in charge are assuming administrative charge of everything, but in actual fact administer everything badly. In my opinion, an agency, placed in administrative charge by the government, must not take on and concern itself with all matters, big and small. Moreover, China's present system of strict administrative controls is unsuited to China's further efforts at reform and opening up, and incompatible with the policy of moving the foreign trade companies and enterprises toward the international market and having them participate directly in the competition. The state organs in charge should as soon as possible readjust the direction and mechanism of their own administrative controls. They should adhere for themselves to the larger orientation of serving the enterprises, they should strengthen contacts with foreign governments, help enterprises actively open up overseas markets, transmit information, exert efforts in dispelling concerns and resolving difficulties on the part of the enterprises, and should do a good job of well-coordinated controls and effective guidance. In their capacity of agents of foreign trade, the import-export companies and enterprises must then, with regard to their organizational setup and with regard to the macro-controls they are subjected to, actively and of their own accord respect and comply with administrative measures of control by superior departments in charge. There must be no passive resistance and going one's own way. At the same time, the foreign trade enterprises and companies in all regions and of all systems must strengthen their lateral economic associations, mutually exchange information, and mutually coordinate action. There must be no "civil war" among ourselves, we must take a unified stand against the outside world, and there must be, as far as possible, identity of prices for the same king of commodities. At the same time as we shall actively open up and expand international markets, we must better coordinate the allocation of present international markets. It has already been proven that engaging highhandedly in internal competition among ourselves, to gain profits merely for one's own unit, may result in a temporary and one-time profit, but that it will ultimately not only harm the interests of others and of the state, but also not necessarily be of profit for oneself. 2. Strengthening investigation and study of the legal antidumping code of GATT and relevant legislation in other countries, and compiling a Chinese antidumping law, antisubsidy law, and other relevant laws. As Chinese products are imported by other countries, they will be subject to the limitations of the antidumping laws of those countries, while when foreign products enter China, China has no corresponding limitations or restrictions by way of antidumping legislation. This is not fair, and is also not a normal situation. Even though China is presently achieving a certain positive result in protecting the Chinese internal market by means of quantitative restrictions and raising import duty, this is not a good long-range device. If it is the intention to actively develop national industries, achieve a smooth entry into GATT and as quickly as possible adjust to the situation after joining GATT, the most positive and active alternative is to set up, as quickly as possible, a Chinese antidumping system. This would prevent the large-scale dumping of foreign products in China, would prevent irrational harm being thereby done to China's national industries by foreign imports, and would promote China's industrial readjustment and the healthy development of China's market economy. Enactment of a Chinese antidumping law would necessitate a more intensive investigation and study of the antidumping rules of GATT and the antidumping laws of other countries. We should take GATT's antidumping rules as basis, give in addition consideration to the specific conditions in China, in formulating an antidumping law and antisubsidy law that has Chinese characteristics and is consonant with the international developmental trend. Simultaneously, China also needs to perfect its present legislation concerning foreign economic relations, to suit the ongoing reform and opening up, especially with a view to the new situation after joining GATT. Everything that is outdated and backward in Chinas' legislation must be changed, and made to conform with the demands of world standards in economics and trade and with the fundamental principles of GATT. 3. Adopting effective countermeasures in actual practice, no passive attitude and suffering a beating. First of all, we must thoroughly study and utilize the exceptional clauses in GATT rules to protect China's national industries. GATT, being an international economic treaty, is at the same time the product of antagonisms and compromises between the signatory states. In order to coordinate the interests of the various signatory states, GATT included certain exceptional clauses. Through sustained struggle and effort, the developing countries gained inclusion of some additional preferential measures favoring the developing countries. Among these, the ones that China can use to its advantage are: 1) The clause concerning the balance of international receipts and payments. According to Article 12, China may, for the reason of protecting its foreign financial status and international balance of payments, place a limit on the quantity and value of imported commodities. 2) The protective clause. According to Article 18, China may, for the reason of raising the general living standards of its people and of accelerating the buildup of its infant industry, adopt appropriate customs- and non-customs-related measures. According to the provisions of Article 19, China, having undertaken the obligations that include a reduction of customs duties, may, if that would allow a large influx of certain products and thereby seriously harm or seriously threaten domestic production of the same kind of products, completely or partly abrogate, for a time, the said obligation. 3) Exceptional clause. If certain particular commodities pose a problem as to a country's protection of natural resources, environmental protection, its public health or national security, GATT rules allow the importing country in question to impose restrictions on the importation or prohibit the importation of this kind of articles. Apart from making full use of the legal provisions, China's import-export companies and enterprises should also give serious attention to the utilization of legal techniques. Many Chinese import-export companies and enterprises are little knowledgeable as to international treaties and foreign laws, and pay little attention even to domestic laws. If they are one day brought before a court of law as defendants, they will therefore, not know what law to adduce to protect their own interests. Their methods will then be merely negative and passive; they will in such a case try to shift responsibility to others and argue back and forth, and not actively meet the accusation. At the same time, they do not know how to utilize the special advantages of joint interests with export merchants, distributors, or commission agents, and will make no effort to gain their cooperation and support. Enterprises and companies engaged in foreign trade should employ legal advisors on permanent contract, and have the lawyers check contracts before signing, to ensure accuracy, so as to avoid as much as possible any future economic disputes. If one day a dispute should occur, an experienced lawyer should promptly be asked to assist in the lawsuit, utilizing his expertise in legal matters and any of his relevant social relations, so as to have him help come out victorious.
