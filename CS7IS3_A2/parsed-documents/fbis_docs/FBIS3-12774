I hope you are well. As you know, last Friday the Zionists attacked the shrine of his holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, and martyred a number of fasting Muslim Palestinians who were saying their prayers. The subject of this program is to investigate the dimensions of this great catastrophe. His excellency Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani is the esteemed guest of this program. During the course of this program, we will benefit from his views. [passage omitted] As my last question, at the beginning of our discussion, you referred to countries such as Lebanon or Syria. What will be the external effects of the massacre on Arab countries, such as the countries you mentioned or on Jordan--in view of the fact that those countries have announced that they will not take part in the peace talks? [Larijani] In my view, the first repercussion will come from inside. 'Arafat has completely lost his credibility for the talks. On one level, this means that all the peace talks have been delivered such a blow that, in my view, they cannot be revived. Of course, it is possible that they may hold two or three meetings and such like. However, to Israel the suppression of the intifadah is the precondition for any peace. Therefore, peace talks suffered a major defeat as a whole, the intensity of which was not predicted by any of the countries that took part in the peace talks. The Islamic Republic was the only country that rejected the talks from the start and predicted their failure. I believe that a much stronger resistance has started against the peace talks throughout the Islamic world. It is clear that this resistance will influence the political leaders. Perhaps, if the political leaders of the Islamic world pay attention, this is the best opportunity to at least pay careful attention for once to the basic issue of peace and security instead of to all the lies that have been spoken about peace. The real basis of this peace and security will be to change the regime in the occupied territories. The regime is, in essence, an illegal, racist, and aggressive regime. [Correspondent] And against human rights? [Larijani] Yes, and against human rights. It has the worst record as a racist country, even when compared to the regimes of South Africa or the former Zimbabwe. Therefore, let us talk about the real, basic issue. Let us talk about a regime in which Muslims, Christian, and Jews all live freely and enjoy equal civil rights. Such a new regime will be the cure for the present problems. No peace will be possible without it. I believe that, under present conditions, the Islamic Republic--while continuing its strong support on the international scene for Islamic movements in the occupied territories--should also present new ideas for the solution of the problems. Those ideas should also be based on the evolution of a regime--the changing of the present aggressive regime to a legal regime that ensures equal rights for all. If that idea is realized, I believe that it would be one of the best fruits of the Islamic resistance for the Muslims, for Christians, and even in the future for the Jews. This will be a very important outcome. [Correspondent] Once again, I thank you for your participation in this program. [Larijani] Thank you.
