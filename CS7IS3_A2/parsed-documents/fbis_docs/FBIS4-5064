FBIS4-5064 "dreas067_a_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Official: Economy `Not Yet Set To Recover' Official: Economy `Not Yet Set To Recover' OW0704094894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0922 GMT 7 Apr 94 OW0704094894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan's economy is not yet set to recover but a further fall is unlikely, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Thursday [7 April]. "As we have been saying, the economy is unlikely to deteriorate further," Saito told a scheduled news conference, referring to remarks Wednesday by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno. The BOJ chief virtually declared an end to the three-year recession by saying the economy is showing signs of hitting bottom. But Saito remained cautious about projecting recovery as did Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii when he met reporters after Mieno. "There may be some differences in nuances, but they (Mieno's comments) are basically the same as the latest (monthly) economic report by the Economic Planning Agency," Saito said. "Mieno also did not completely mention a recovery," Saito said. Under these circumstances, Saito stressed the government must steadily implement the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package and enact the fiscal 1994 budget as early as possible to put the economy on a "full-fledged recovery track." Considering the tax issue, Saito welcomed the recent direction indicated by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to accepting a consumption tax hike. But he declined to comment further on ongoing discussions among the ruling coalition parties which are to decide on a full-scale tax reform by the end of the year.
