FR940803-1-00078 FR940803-1-00015 A non-native population of Arkansas River shiners has become established in the Pecos River in New Mexico, presumably originating from the release of bait fish downstream of Sumner Dam in 1978 (Bestgen et al . 1989). The species is presently known to occupy a portion of the Pecos River extending from Ft. Sumner to Carlsbad, New Mexico. The largest populations, based on the number of fish collected, occur in the vicinity of Lake Arthur Falls. Natural flow patterns in the Pecos River have been altered by reservoir releases and irrigation withdrawals and return flows. Flow regimes in the Pecos River now mimic the intermittent flows formerly present within areas historically supporting natural populations of Arkansas River shiners, and are presently serving to maintain habitat and provide discharge pulses necessary for reproduction and survival of this population (Bestgen et al . 1989). As demand for water increases in New Mexico, the success of this artificial population may decline or the population may cease to exist. Protection of this artificial population would also conflict with efforts to manage native fish populations in the Pecos River. The Pecos River supports populations of the federally threatened Pecos bluntnose shiner ( Notropis simus pecosensis ) and once supported the proposed federally endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow ( Hybognathus amarus ). The establishment of Arkansas River shiners in the Pecos River is a potential threat to the Pecos bluntnose shiner (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992). Recovery of the native fish fauna of the Pecos River may eventually require restoration of historic flow conditions and eradication of competitive, non-native fishes such as the Arkansas River shiner. Management and recovery efforts for the Pecos bluntnose shiner and other fish species native to the Pecos River will focus on the preservation of native species to the detriment of the Arkansas River shiner population. Listing and protection of the Pecos River population of the Arkansas River shiner would conflict with the preservation of the Pecos bluntnose shiner and possibly the Rio Grande silvery minnow. While the Pecos River population may be important in efforts to supplement natural, native populations within the historic range of the species, protection of this artificial population would not improve the status of the Arkansas River shiner within its historic range. Therefore, the Service is not proposing to list the introduced population in the Pecos River. The Arkansas River shiner first received listing consideration when the species was included in the September 18, 1985, Review of Vertebrate Wildlife (50 FR 37958) as a category 2 candidate for listing. Category 2 comprises taxa for which information indicates that a proposal to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats are not currently available to support proposed rules. A January 6, 1989, revised Animal Notice of Review (54 FR 554) retained this status for the Arkansas River shiner. Detailed information on the status of the species was first provided to the Service in 1989 by Pigg (1989). Additional information on the status of this species was obtained through a partial status survey by Larson et al . (1990). The Service subsequently prepared a status report on this species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). In the November 21, 1991, Animal Candidate Review for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species (56 FR 58804), the Arkansas River shiner was reclassified as a category 1 candidate. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service has substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals to list the taxa as endangered or threatened. Additional status survey information was provided in Larson et al . (1991) and Pigg (1991). Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants''. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Arkansas River basin population of the Arkansas River shiner ( Notropis girardi ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range . Once abundant and widely distributed throughout the Arkansas River basin, the Arkansas River shiner now inhabits about 20 percent of its historic range. Navigation improvements on the Arkansas River by the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers (Corps) began in Arkansas in 1832, 4 years before Arkansas gained statehood (Corps of Engineers 1989). Initially, construction projects generally consisted of small improvements, such as clearing and snagging operations, until passage of the River and Harbor Act in 1946 authorized construction of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System from the Mississippi River upstream to Catoosa, Oklahoma. Project construction began in the 1950's and intensified during the 1960's. Project segments from the Mississippi confluence upstream to Fort Smith, Arkansas, were completed by 1969. By 1970, the channel had been extended up the Arkansas River as far as Muskogee, Oklahoma, and was essentially complete. The project included numerous bank stabilization and channel rectification projects, 17 locks and dams (12 in Arkansas), annual channel maintenance, and port facilities. Several of the locks and dams are multipurpose facilities, providing peak power generation. The Corps maintains a minimum channel depth of 3 meters (m) (9 feet (ft)) and minimum width of 76 m (250 ft). These modifications have eliminated suitable habitat and are presumably responsible for the extirpation of the Arkansas River shiner within the State of Arkansas and contributed to the decline of the species in Oklahoma. Buchanan (1976) failed to collect any Arkansas River shiners from the Arkansas River Navigation System in Arkansas, and fish collections between 1972 and 1988 from the Arkansas River near Ft. Smith, Arkansas also failed to produce any Arkansas River shiner specimens (Robison and Buchanan 1988). Arkansas River shiners were last observed within the Arkansas River downstream of Muskogee in 1985 (Pigg 1991).
