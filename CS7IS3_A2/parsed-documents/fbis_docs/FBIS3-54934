In contrast to the apparatus of the former Russian Supreme Soviet, which numbered 1,350 people, he noted, the new parliament's apparatus will consist of 537 employees. Since the Russian Federal Assembly consists of two independent chambers (the Federation Council and the State Duma) there will correspondingly be two secretariats in the apparatus. A workable nucleus has been formed. The first experience of work with the deputies' commissions created by the chambers has shown that the parliamentary apparatus workers can fully cope with the set tasks. The testing which has been carried out on the staffers has confirmed their high level of professional training. That is understandable, for 90 percent of the apparatus workers are employees of the former Supreme Soviet. These people have resolved and are capable of resolving tasks of any complexity. What tasks will be set them, and by whom, is another question. The main task of the Russian parliamentary apparatus is to ensure the effect work of the deputies, to supply them with the necessary information in an entirely complete and objective manner, and to promote the high-quality formulation of the decisions the deputies will make. And they must do everything to ensure that they exert no influence in any way on the nature of the decisions which are made or on their content.
