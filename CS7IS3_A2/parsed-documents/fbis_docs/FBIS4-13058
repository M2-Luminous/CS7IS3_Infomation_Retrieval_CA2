CONTENTS: 1. Awqaf Minister Praised for Confronting Extremism 2. Secularists' Criticism of Religious Practices Refuted 3. Religious Seminar Stresses Adherence to Religion 4. Al-Azhar Mufti Explains Position on Progeny Cloning 5. Turkish Islamic Party's Strong Showing in Election Viewed AWQAF MINISTER PRAISED FOR CONFRONTING EXTREMISM In a 400-word article on page one, Samir Rajab, the newspaper's board chairman, praises the religious seminars organized by the Awqaf Ministry throughout Egypt to explain true Islam and protect the youth from extremist ideas. He says the Awqaf minister, through those seminars, took action "when minds were ready to receive that bad extremist thought." When the minister found that there was no point in dealing with the extremists themselves, he instructed that the broad bases in schools, universities, and factories be addressed. "The results were very promising. Honestly, without that effort many would have fallen in the quagmire, far more than those who are pointing their guns at the chests of our sons and daughters, desecrating our women, and indiscriminately destroying private and public property." SECULARISTS' CRITICISM OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES REFUTED An approximately 2,000-word article by al-Azhar professor Dr. 'Abd-al-Jawad Sabir Isma'il on page six essentially reacts to an article entitled, "Who Is the Apostate?" which Isma'il says he read in some newspaper. Isma'il, who does not identify the newspaper or the writer, begins by stating that one of the "bizarre phenomena" these days is that some writers who know nothing about Islam are writing in newspapers about religious issues, making mistakes and telling lies, and trying to harm Islamic clerics and level false accusations against them. Commenting on a claim in the article that religious sermons and preaching recorded by some ulema on audio cassettes contain material that is almost destructive to the country, Isma'il says: "Those ulema, in fact, were the reason for a religious and national awakening that is no secret to anyone. The destruction feared by the writer of that article will only be the destruction of corruption, treason, agentry, and apostasy." Isma'il adds: "Had the writer of that article been fair, he would have drawn the reader's attention to another area where cassettes are used: to promote vice and eliminate ethics and virtue. But this is not in the interest of the secular approach, which defends everything Western, even vice." The author also refutes claims that there is an attempt "to establish Islamic priesthood" in Egypt. He says this is a big lie because Islam eliminated priesthood as it did idols. "Muslim ulema receive the credit for their knowledge, and we have never known in history, or in this contemporary age, a scholar who so sanctified himself or who people held as holy." He says this fact was understood by the orientals, who called those specializing in religion and its sciences ulema. Isma'il also defends Shaykh al-Ghazali, whom the writer of the article allegedly tried to discredit, saying that he rejects the implementation of shari'ah. Preparing individuals and groups for shari'ah rule, says Isma'il, does not mean rejecting the implementation of shari'ah. --A 200-word article by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 says linking Islam and extremism is no longer justified after the confessions of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi on television. The writer says: "It is very regrettable that some tendentious people who hate Islam are trying to fish in troubled waters and use the confessions as a pretext to foolishly confuse right and wrong, good and bad, and to harm any religious trend." The writer notes that one of the things that made the terrorist repent was a book he read for imam al-Ghazali. He says Egypt is full of sincere and renowned ulema, but they are all viewed by the "tendentious" ones as terrorists. The writer addresses those tendentious ones: "Die in your fury, Egypt will remain Islamic. Islam is its official religion, Islamic shari'ah is its main source of legislation, and holy al-Azhar will continue to stand as fast as towering mountains against both the extremists and the deviants alike." RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ADHERENCE TO RELIGION An approximately 1,500-word report on page four gives an account of a religious seminar organized by the newspaper in a Cairo mosque. Men of religion answer questions posed by the audience on religious and civil matters, such as marriage, mosques, prayers, and family affairs. Speakers reportedly stress the role of the mosque in Islamic education and maintain that "religion is the spirit of this people, the source of their power, and the basis of their unity. Without adhering to our religion and acting accordingly, we cannot solve our problems." AL-AZHAR MUFTI EXPLAINS POSITION ON PROGENY CLONING A 1,500-word report by Amal Hasan on page 14 cites Shaykh 'Atiyah Saqr, head of al-Azhar's Fatwa [religious ruling] Committee, as saying that Islam is a religion of science. He encourages scientific research as long as it observes three conditions: legitimate purpose, legitimate means, and belief that things can only happen under God's order and will. He tells a medical seminar that "cloning, if meant to improve the selection of the species and treat some kinds of infertility, and the use of genetic engineering to treat cancer and some hereditary diseases, are no problem." He adds: "If cloning is aimed at producing males instead of females, or females instead of males, or at forming human progenies as needed, then it is a major mistake." TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY'S STRONG SHOWING IN ELECTION VIEWED Page 21 contains an 800-word comment by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl on the results of the Turkish municipal election in which the Islamic Welfare Party made a strong showing. The writer notes Western anxiety over the results of the election. Although the Welfare Party is not a fundamentalist Islamic party in the sense we know it in Egypt, he writes, "The enemies of Islam, both in Turkey and abroad, rushed to attack it fiercely and to belittle its achievement. Indeed, they implicitly called for outlawing the party under the pretext of fear for freedoms and the democratic achievements of the secular state." The writer maintains that Turks "began to feel that the current Turkish crisis is caused by the enemies of Islam, who divided the Turks on nationalist grounds, tried to isolate Turkey from its historical Islamic roots, and promoted the idea of European Turkey."
