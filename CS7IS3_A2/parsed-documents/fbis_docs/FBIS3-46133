Speaking at the end of a two-day session, acting Hong Kong co- convenor of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) legal sub-group, Lo Tak-shing, said there were sufficient mechanisms in place to cope with any problems that arose during the transition. "We have a sovereign in power and a Basic Law in place. The Basic Law preserves all the existing laws of Hong Kong, except those which conflict with the Basic Law." He said the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had already empowered the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Preparatory Committee to do almost anything needed to prepare for the establishment of the first government. The legal sub-group's conclusion implied that it was possibly unnecessary to devise a mechanism to cope with any legal vacuum at July 1, 1997, he said. "We have in place a complete structure and laws for the Hong Kong society. There is no problem at all." The question of a legal vacuum was raised by the political sub- group in discussions of the formation of the first government and the first SAR legislature. Given the collapse of the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements and the need to hold fresh elections by mid-1997, some members feared that Hong Kong would have no legislature for several months after July 1 997. They suggested interim measures such as forming a provisional legislature, allowing the National People's Congress to legislate on behalf of Hong Kong or delegating legislative power to the SAR chief executive. The political sub-group will meet on Friday and Saturday in Beijing. Mr Lo said it was a misunderstanding that the absence of a legislature in 1997 would mean that there would be no laws in Hong Kong or no mechanism to enact legislation. "The fact is that the SAR Preparatory Committee can rule Hong Kong in accordance with Hong Kong laws," he said. Mainland co-convenor Shao Tianren said there would be no vacuum in the transition as China would resume sovereignty over Hong Kong immediately on July 1, 1997. "There exists no legal vacuum," Mr Shao said. Mr Shao said few laws would need to be changed because they failed to comply with the Basic Law. Changes would mainly be amending terms such as "colonial", "your majesty" and "governor". But Preliminary Working Committee member Tam Yiu-chung held reservations, saying it was difficult to determine so early that there would not be a legal vacuum.
