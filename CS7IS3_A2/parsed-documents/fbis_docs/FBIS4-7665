We still have much to do prior to membership. This opportunity is mainly accompanied by obligations," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said on Saturday [2 April], in Pacin, along the Hungarian-Slovak border. The foreign minister held a press conference at the new building of the border station on the Hungarian side. Jeszenszky visited the border town to view the planned border station, meeting an invitation from Richard Horcsik, the region's parliamentary MPs and chairman of parliament's European Affairs Committee, and the mayors of 21 villages along the Bodrog River. The foreign minister exchanged views with the locals about the opening of border stations in Satoraljaujhely, Pacin and Lacacseke, and the off-shore area planned to be created in the Lacacseke-Perbenyik region. In Pacin, Mayor Attila Barati guided Jeszenszky through the completed and furnished border station and customs building. The facility will also ensure smooth work for Slovak border guard and customs authorities. The mayor said people on both sides of the Bodrog are awaiting the opening of the Pacin-Velky Kamenec border station. Jeszenszky said it was regrettable that a struggle is needed to open a border station on the Slovak border, where families and relatives live in different countries. The demand of people living on both sides of the border for the immediate opening of the station is understandable, he said. The new Central Europe should be without borders, with local authorities cooperating in issues as this. "We have opened many border stations towards the neighbouring countries, and in the case of Slovakia it is unfortunate that we were unable to meet the expectations. I very much hope that the fine words of the new, genuinely good intentioned Slovak Government will be followed by actions. We have replied to words with action, as we have built the border station," Jeszenszky said.
