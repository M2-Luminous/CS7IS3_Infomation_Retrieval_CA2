At a news conference, Ulmanis said that in his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, they discussed the issue of the problems of the Skrunda radar station. Special attention was also paid to the Russian Army's Paldiski nuclear center in Estonia and the Kaliningrad region as possible flash-points in the Baltic region. The UN secretary general agreed that the progress of the treaty on the Skrunda radar station must also be monitored by this internatonal organization. The state president also particularly noted that no one has reproached Latvia for not observing human rights, and this problem was not discussed. It is possible that in a few years a conference of national leaders could be held in Riga on the problems of disarmament and the environment.
