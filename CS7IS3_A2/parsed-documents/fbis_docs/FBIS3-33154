Some 150 Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] members have been reassigned to other regional terrorism units, while the National Crime Investigative Directorate [Dinincri] is as yet untouched. [EXPRESO] Is it true that 30 percent of the Dincote personnel are being reduced? [Briones] We are doing the following: Dincote personnel have been sent to reinforce regional counterterrorism divisions to improve the countersubversive action at a national level. Among the 12 police regions are the Jecotes (Counterterrorism Provincial Police) and the Secotes (Counterterrorism Section) [Seccion contra el terrorismo]. We are reinforcing them to finish off the last few subversives. [EXPRESO] Have 30 percent of the members gone to the Jecotes? [Briones] Much less. They total 150 members. But we will not remove support from the Dincote. The idea is to improve our action at a regional level without reducing support. [EXPRESO] But it has also been said that personnel from other police units will be retired. [Briones] No. We have already announced that the police schools will not receive new students for a determined period of time. The schools will train personnel who are currently holding desk jobs so that they return to police work in the police stations. An enormous number of people worked in the Police Staff. No one wanted to go to the streets for fear of the terrorists. Instead of being on the streets, they held desk jobs. [EXPRESO] How many men are we talking about? [Briones] About 2,500. [EXPRESO] It is said that personnel in the Dinincri have also been reduced. [Briones] No. There will be investigative police members in each police station from now on. If the case is more complicated or if it has national ramifications it will pass under the jurisdiction of the Dinincri. This unit is like the FBI in the United States which intervenes when a case goes beyond a local jurisdiction. [EXPRESO] But will investigative police members leave the Dinincri? [Briones] No, they are already in the police stations. The Dinincri will not be touched. There is no change. I do not know where that rumor came from. The only changes are the normal police reassignments according to the rules.
