FBIS3-5115 "dreas043_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 North Korea ROK's Use of National Security Law Criticized SK0403045994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0444 GMT 4 Mar 94 SK0403045994 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Sword-brandishing Cannot Be a Way Out" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique recently threw behind bars students of Chonnam National University and Choson University on the pretext that the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils (Chongnyon) orchestrated a "violent demonstration" and "attempted to neutralize government power". It also arrested students of Kyongbuk National University by invoking the "National Security Law", charging them with "posting an article sympathizing with the North's demand". An analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: The fact that the Kim Yong-sam group makes patriotic students a target of ruthless suppression shows that they are now seeking in a more undisguised way dependence on outside forces, not national independence, and North-South confrontation, not national unity, and fascist rule, not democracy. Nowadays the Kim Yong-sam group is invoking the "National Security Law" quite often, charging students with connection with the North. This reveals once again its wicked intention to follow the road of confrontation with the North to its dying breath. The puppets' grumble about "violent demonstrations" of students is a ridiculous jargon reminding one of a thief crying "stop thief!" Students have staged peaceful demonstrations urging the refusal of "parliamentary ratification" and renegotiation regarding the rice market opening, enraged at the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's flunkeyist treachery in selling off the rice market. It is a duplication of the method employed by the military fascists of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" to brand them as "rioters". The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's fascist suppression will result in digging its own grave.
