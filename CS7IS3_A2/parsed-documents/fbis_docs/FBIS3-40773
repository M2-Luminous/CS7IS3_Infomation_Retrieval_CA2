It was wrong to argue that India's interest would be served best by giving up the GATT membership, it said. In its third report on Dunkel draft proposals, tabled in the Rajya Sabha by its chairman, Mr. I.K. Gujral, the committee admitted that the final outcome was not in the best interest of India on every count. But, it argued, in multilateral agreements, "it is always a question of give and take." Stating that in today's world with increasing inter-dependence of nations multilateral pacts with Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) status were advantageous compared to bilateral pacts, the committee cautioned that the country's commercial interests would be ill-served by giving up the GATT membership. It asked the Government to actively negotiate to bring about a more reasonable balance in the proposed agreement which remains loaded against developing countries, and consider ways to safeguard the sovereign economic rights of developing countries by making common cause with other developing countries. The committee said that with the ratification of the present round of GATT negotiations, the option now available with the United States to clamp Super 301 unilaterally against any country should also cease. However, it urged Indian negotiations to obtain specific clarifications to that effect. Referring to individual issues that have a bearing on the country's economic well-being, the committee said a witness deposing before it stated he did not think that Indian agriculture would gain the export market due to reduction in subsidies made by the developed countries. This was because liberalisation in agriculture would be limited and the international support levels for their agricultural products would be reduced by 20 per cent only. Besides, the witness argued the Dunkel text provided for very strict phytosanitary (plant related) standards to be observed for agricultural exports. India and other developing countries would hardly be able to meet these standards, resulting in rejection of their exports. The committee said the Dunkel proposals would discriminate against Indian agriculture as the subsidies have to be limited to an upper bound of 10 percent of the value of the output for developing countries. This might have grave implications for the poor resource farmers because with increasing cost of energy and other inputs the sectorwise subsidy might exceed this limit. The committee was of the opinion that contrary to the avowed object of including agriculture in GATT, the result of complying with the Dunkel draft proposal could enable the developed countries to capture the food markets of developing countries and also to control the gene sequences, microbiological resources and genetic engineering. Threat to PDS [public distribution system]: The committee said if the Dunkel draft was accepted at its face value, the public distribution system could come under severe strain and jeopardy and as such a clear understanding must be obtained from the GATT Secretariat that the country's PDS would not be hit in any way now or in future. Taking exception to the informality of the understanding that the traditional rights and practices of the Indian farmer for preservation, sale and free exchange of seeds must remain unaffected, the committee said this might not serve the purpose in the days to come and wanted these safeguards given "specific mention" in the GATT. Referring to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the committee viewed with grave concern the impact the proposed patent regime would have on India's drug prices. It was of the view that specific instruments must be provided in the TRIPS agreement to ensure that the patent holders did not use their monopoly power to cause steep increase in the prices of drugs and also to ensure that India's fast developing indigenous drug industry was not "gobbled up" by the multinationals. "The primacy of public interests over the rights of the patent holders should be ensured," it added. The committee said the Indian patent law had been rightly emphasising patenting of the process and not the product and this should be maintained. Patent regime: The proposed extension of patent from the current five to seven years to 20 years period virtually discourages any research and development and this should not be conceded, the committee said. It said India should insist on grant of automatic licensing in certain circumstances from the patent-holders in public interests. It said micro-organism and biological process should be kept out of the patent regime. The committee said to sustain the ongoing modernisation of the Indian industry, it was important that technology transfers continued unimpaired. "The Dunkel draft on TRIPS militates against GATT principles that countries at different stages of development need to be treated differently in as much as the interests of developing countries like India have been ignored in favour of developed countries," the committee said. On textiles and clothing, the committee said India should explore possibilities to get reasonable improvement in the text as this was one area where India's interest from a liberalised trade was clearly visible and there should be efforts to ensure that potential gains were realised. On Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), the committee noted the proposed TRIPS restricted the power of the Government to regulate and control foreign investment. The provisions of the Dunkel draft grant foreign investors advantageous position vis-a-vis Indian investors. Services sector: On services, the committee said given the stage of India's development, "we should be wary in accepting any binding commitments to open up our services sector where we do not see any economic advantages and what may militate against domestic enterprises." The committee observed point-blank that no access should be offered as a matter of right in spheres of banking, insurance and telecommunication services. It also viewed with concern the "unbalanced" nature of General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which while allowing for unrestrained flow of capital-related services, said little about the labour-related services. The committee was also of the view the integrated dispute settlement mechanism as provided in the Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) was heavily loaded against developing countries like India, as they could be easily subjected to cross-retaliation. Fresh discussion sought: Members in the Rajya Sabha today demanded a fresh discussion on the Dunkel draft proposals. Drawing attention of the chairperson to the report, Mr. Kamal Morarka (Samajwadi Party) said during zero-hour that the tabling of the report comes at a time when important talks are on between the United States and European Community--the outcome of which could have far-reaching implications for India. Mr. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) also supported the demand for fresh discussion on the report.
