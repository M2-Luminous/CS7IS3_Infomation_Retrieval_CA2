The economic differences between the EU countries and the former East Bloc countries, such as Poland or Hungary, are still dramatically big, Stihl said on Bavarian Radio on Easter Sunday. In the next 10 years it will be unthinkable to accept these countries as full members into the EU. Until then, such a development could be initiated through associate membership agreements. Moreover, the EU must now gather its strength for the planned enlargement by another four countries. Over the next few years, the EU will be tied up with creating an economic, and maybe even a political, community. With a view to Brussels, Stihl criticized the EU's interventionism in trade issues. Bilateral agreements with individual countries, such as the recent new agreement with Japan on car exports, would encumber free trade, Stihl concluded.
