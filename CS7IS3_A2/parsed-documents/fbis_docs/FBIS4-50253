He must decide before 3 June whether or not to extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, which, as the date nears, is becoming a hot issue in the media here. Calls for the revocation of China's MFN status this year are more subdued than a few years ago. An increasing number of people of perception are voicing their support for the continuance of China's MFN status and favor delinking the MFN issue from the so- called human rights issue in order to solve this "thorny issue," which troubles the U.S. Government every year, once and for all. Businessmen and industrialists, the people who are most realistic, are asking the Clinton administration to take China--the world's biggest market--seriously and face up to the fact that China's economy is developing rapidly. They believe that, in the interests of the enormous U.S. commercial stake in China, the Clinton administration should continue to grant China MFN status. It is understood that close to 1,000 U.S. companies have written to President Clinton urging him to extend China's MFN status. John (Hayden), vice president of the Boeing Corporation, which sold 47 Boeing airplanes to China last year, said that the effort to keep the rapidly developing Chinese market open to the United States is most important to ensure the U.S.' leading position in international commercial aviation and other sectors. Many American businessmen went further in pointing out that if the U.S. Government made a wrong decision on the issue of extending China's MFN status, Sino-U.S. relations would seriously deteriorate [yan zhong dao tui 0917 6850 0227 6622], and the United States would pay dearly for this. Many well-known business executives have also raised doubts about the whole entanglement of the so-called China human rights issue. (Gerlinberger), chairman of the board of directors of the American International Insurance Corporation, said that pinning the entire foreign policy on one issue, the human rights issue, was neither reasonable nor sensible. Many in the U.S. Congress have sobered up to reality. Hatfield, a Republican senator from Oregon, pointed out in an earlier report that American consumers would pay $10 billion more each year and some important U.S. firms would see their interests damaged if China's MFN status was revoked. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, also said a few days ago that China's MFN status should be extended. At present, there are indeed some people inside and outside Congress who stubbornly persist in linking MFN status with the so- called human rights issue. It has been suggested that before China can satisfy the terms set in the presidential executive order signed by Clinton last year, the United States should, while extending China's MFN status, apply selective trade sanctions on China, that is, restricting imports from state-owned enterprises by withholding trade privileges from them. However, the media generally think this simply will not work. Reports in the media here say that the White House is working furiously to get President Clinton out of this "self-inflicted trap." People hope that this President, like the late former President Nixon, can focus on overall U.S. interests and the long- term strategic interests between the United States and China and make a wise decision on the issue of China's MFN trade status.
