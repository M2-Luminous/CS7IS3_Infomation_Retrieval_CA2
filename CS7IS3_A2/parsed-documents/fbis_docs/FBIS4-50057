Briefing the meeting on the results of his recent inspection of township and town enterprises in Jiangsu, he said: Jiangsu has superior geographic conditions. Its drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and its economic development program are progressing rapidly. Particularly, township and town enterprises in Jiangsu have played a leading role in the country as a whole and have made important contributions in terms of development. At present its township and town enterprises have made certain achievements in terms of scope, quality, and level and have occupied a decisive position in the province's national economic development. Township and town enterprises have scaled new heights in terms of quality, grade, scope, and efficiency. The export-oriented economy has developed vigorously. Jiangsu has utilized large quantities of foreign capital and is home to many joint-venture enterprises. The development of township and town enterprises is closely integrated with rural construction. The grand prospect for a new socialist countryside characterized by the modernization of agriculture, industrialization of rural areas, urbanization of villages, socialization of services, and education of peasants is gradually being materialized. Yin Kesheng said: Considering the development of township and town enterprises in Jiangsu Province, our province must learn from and use as a reference Jiangsu's experience in the following areas: 1. We should always implement the leading principle of grasping opportunities and accelerating development, firmly foster the idea of development being the last word, and persist in striving for rapid development with good results if conditions permit. 2. We should persist in promoting development with reform and place great stress on seeking solutions to the contradictions and problems that crop up in the course of economic operation by deepening reform. 3. We should encourage township and town enterprises to get involved in the market so that they will decide their development orientation, seek development, optimize their structure, and establish their own operational mechanisms. 4. We should persist in simultaneously grasping the two civilizations and strive for new breakthroughs in building spiritual civilization while accelerating economic development. Yin Kesheng pointed out: The development situation of township and town enterprises in our province in the last few years is fine on the whole, but, compared with the other parts of the country, we still have a long way to go. 1) Our province's township and town enterprises are small in scope; 2) the strong points which ought to be brought into play have not been duly brought into play; 3) fund and talent shortages are relatively pronounced; 4) the level of enterprise management is low. [passage omitted] The provincial party committee will hold a township and town enterprise work meeting at an appropriate time this year to study, in a concentrated way, ways of developing our province's township and town enterprises more rapidly and with better results. [passage omitted] Yin Kesheng urged the principal party and government leaders of prefectures and cities to personally take up the work of developing township and town enterprises and township and town enterprise bureaus at all levels to strengthen themselves organizationally by providing more and better leaders and personnel, fulfilling their duties, and boldly carrying out their work. [passage omitted] Present at the meeting were the standing committee members of the provincial party committee, including Cai Zhulin, Doba, Tang Zhengren, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng.
