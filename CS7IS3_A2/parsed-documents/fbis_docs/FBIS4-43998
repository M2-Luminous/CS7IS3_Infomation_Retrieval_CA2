The party of Eurocritic Manfred Brunner, former cabinet chief for EU [European Union] Commissioner Martin Bangemann, wants to make the 12 June European Parliament election a "plebiscite on Maastricht." The Republikaner are following suit with their appeal to the voters to "help us save the German mark." Because the Maastricht opponents have the majority of citizens behind them, the Bonn politicians, out of fear of an election defeat, are offering almost nothing to counter the protest parties' polemics. According to opinion surveys, between 50 and 80 percent of Germans--depending on the formulation of the question--reject monetary union. East Germans in particular do not want to give up the mark they acquired just three years ago. For all that, the established parties could effortlessly ally the concerns of mark fans because the plan for a common currency is turning out to be more and more a distant illusion: - The timetable for monetary union, which according to the Maastricht Treaty is to begin in 1997 at the earliest and by 1999 at the latest, is much too ambitious. - Not a single EU country met the stringent accession criteria last year; proliferating government deficits in particular are becoming stumbling blocks to Euromoney. - The Federal Constitutional Court's ruling on Maastricht prohibits Germany from participating in a watering down of the convergence criteria--yet monetary union without German participation is hardly conceivable - In the coming years, the political will for European integration will be tested in an unprecedented election marathon in which nationalistic elements could gain the upper hand--as has already happened in Italy. Moreover, the practical problems involved in introducing a common currency are proving to be treacherous as well. According to Bundesbank Foreign Minister Helmut Schieber, the "technical issues" involved with Euromoney are "more complicated than expected." And, to be sure, while the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which is supposed to prepare the introduction of a common currency, started on time at the beginning of the year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy had to start almost at ground zero because the Maastricht Treaty took effect nearly one year late as a result of the ratification marathon. According to central banker Schieber, the organizational work that really should have been taken care of in 1993 can only now be caught up on--"at the expense of substantive work." Lamfalussy's little staff initially found shelter at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel where the Committee of EC Central Bank Presidents had already taken up residence. The move to Frankfurt, the EMI's proper headquarters, continues to be delayed. After a summer date was initially envisioned, the first board meeting in the new domicile has now slipped to 15 November. At the present time, the top 10 floors of the 36-story former BfG [Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft] high-rise--today the "Eurotower"--are being refurbished to include an elegant conference floor at the top of the tower. To be sure, the EMI will certainly have to forego excessive luxury after the Eastern Europe Bank in London wound up in the headlines as a result of its excessive ostentatiousness and luxurious appointments. For the startup, therefore, old office furniture was even borrowed from the Bundesbank. Such unpretentiousness is entirely in keeping with EMI chief Lamfalussy's style and this is not the least of the reasons why the former BIS general manager was chosen in the autumn of last year. By foregoing interviews entirely, for example, the Belgian has accommodated Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer who jealously guards his prerogatives ("The EMI is not a central bank"). To date, the EMI has published just a single report, and it deals with the rather peripheral topic of "prepaid credit cards." It is thus understandable that doubts are now arising as to whether the EMI can become the "driving force" for the implementation of monetary union as French Minister of Economy Edmond Alphandery has called for. Thus far, EMI members have tackled their Herculean task in the manner of good bureaucrats. Experts of the 12 EU central banks are working on plans in three committees and five subcommittees and the deeper they delve into the problems, the more difficult the solutions seem. Example bank notes: The Bundesbank needed nearly six years to design and bring into circulation new paper money. Experience shows that a European process of coordinating safety features, the design, and the representation of national symbols, would certainly take even longer. Example coinage: With the striking of Eurotalers, all European coinage would be fully utilized for years. The vending machine industry needs exact specifications for the conversion to be provided expeditiously. Experts calculate a conversion period of six to eight years. Example statistics: Terms and definitions for banking and balance of payment systems have to be harmonized. A Bundesbank statistician complains that "entirely different concepts are still being used" in EU countries. The conversion of foreign trade statistics in the context of the European internal market has demonstrated how great the chaos can become. Closely related to statistics issues is the EMI's greatest challenge: to devise a common monetary policy and to develop the appropriate instruments for it. To date it has been taken for granted that, after all the discussions have been concluded, the German money supply concept--in more or less modified form--would be adopted. Since the Bundesbank has apparently lost control of the M3 money supply, however, doubts are increasing as to whether Europe should pursue a money supply target at all--particularly in view of the fact that this indicator has failed in past years in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. Wuerzburg Professor Peter Bofinger believes that "the Bundesbank's problem is becoming a European problem." To introduce a new currency when monetary policy is flying blind could quickly result in a crash. Before there can be any progress in Europe, therefore, the Bundesbank must do its homework: Why has the growth in the money supply--apart from all special factors--been so immense in the last three years? Why have the monetary regulators nonetheless been able to reduce interest rates so sharply? Trier Professor Wolfgang Flic is calling upon the monetary regulators to "reveal their indicators," and monetary expert Bofinger--successor in the professorship occupied by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing--complains: "The discussion regarding the proper monetary policy is not being conducted in Germany." For all that, the success of the guardians of the mark is uncontested. Economics expert Wolfgang Franz, commenting on the most recent 2.9-percent inflation figure for western Germany, says "The Bundesbank has won the battle against inflation." Monetary expert Bofinger sees a real opportunity for EMI in an impartial investigation of the reasons for the currency guardians' success, but Tietmeyer, Issing, and Co. are not yet showing their cards. And EMI President Lamfalussy realistically assesses the work that lies ahead of him: "It will not be an easy task." Bad luck for populists--the mark does not yet have to be saved.
