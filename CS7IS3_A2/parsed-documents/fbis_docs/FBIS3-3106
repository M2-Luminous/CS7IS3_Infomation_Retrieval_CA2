After Japan, Australia, and Canada had done so, the United States and the EU expressed their support for China's resuming GATT status. In other words, China has broken through important obstacles to reenter the GATT. If a basic agreement can be reached at the "16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China," which will be held in Geneva in mid-March, there will be more hope for China to resume GATT status. China was an original GATT signatory in 1948. In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded. Logically, it should have been entitled to continue GATT membership. However, the Kuomintang authorities, which had retreated to Taiwan, announced their withdrawal from GATT in March 1950. Since then, China's seat has been vacant. It was not until July 1986 that China formally asked to restore its GATT signatory status. But the light of China's return to GATT has appeared only after eight-odd years of marathon-like negotiations, during which all sorts of obstacles have been encountered. The main obstacles to China's readmission to GATT have come from the United States. In 1989, the United States set a number of conditions on China's resumption of GATT status. These include: 1) increasing the transparency of economic information and trade regulations; 2) unifying the country's foreign trade policy and abolishing export subsidies; 3) formulating social insurance clauses and working out a minimum wage system for staff members and workers; 4) reducing tariffs on thousands of commodity categories; and 5) abolishing nontariff measures, such as quota certificates and so on. Last year the United States set new conditions on China, demanding that the renminbi correspond with free exchange rate standards, prohibiting the use of fluctuating exchange rates as a means of trade protection, and demanding the abolition of cities with separate listing and preferential policies, the uniformity of taxation laws, and the opening of its services market to the outside world. The EU has basically followed the United States and asked China to abide by these conditions. Due to different social and economic systems, China, of course, finds it difficult to completely follow these U.S. and European economic measures. As a matter of fact, most of the 100-odd GATT members do not comply with the above conditions, and the United States itself has built trade barriers and practices a quota system. However, following the in-depth development of reform and opening up, many aspects of China's economic structure have gradually converged with the international economic structure. To expand foreign trade and strive for an early resumption of GATT status, the mainland twice reduced the import tariffs on some 2,800 categories of commodities last year, including raw materials and machinery. In addition, it took the initiative to announce a list of tariff reductions for agricultural products and a list of tariff reductions on service trades. Although tariff reductions on nonagricultural products has not reached the required 30 percent, China has expressed its readiness to meet these before reentering GATT. Moreover, to meet the actual needs of GATT reentry, China unified its official renminbi exchange rate and the regulatory foreign exchange market exchange rate on 1 January this year. This year, it will also relax foreign exchange controls over trade and allow foreign-funded banks to deal in foreign exchange and provide renminbi loans to create adequate conditions for completely free renminbi exchange rates in the years to come. Apart from these, this year China will implement a new unified taxation system throughout the country, abolish preferential policies for eight cities with separate listings [in State plans], open its retail market to the outside world, and partly open its telecommunications market and civil aviation market. In many aspects, China has met the conditions for readmission to GATT. Viewing these major concessions by China, we believe that it will make every possible effort to resume GATT status this year. According to the provisions of the Uruguay Round document of December last year, a new GATT agreement will be signed in January 1995, during which the old organization will be dissolved and a new one--the World Trade Organization--established; signatory nations will automatically become members. If China cannot reenter GATT before the signing of the new agreement, it will spend a lot of effort again in applying for admission to the new organization. Therefore, this is a crucial year for China to resume its GATT status. During a visit to China in late February, U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin joined the eighth round of bilateral talks on China resuming GATT status. After the talks, Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, told Dwoskin that China had demonstrated its flexibility on conditions for resuming GATT status. Dwoskin spoke highly of China's recent economic and trade reform measures, particularly the unification of the renminbi exchange rates, adding explicitly: "The United States firmly supports China's resumption of GATT status." EU Commissioner Leon Brittan came to China after Dwoskin's visit. Despite differences during a meeting with Minister Wu Yi on whether or not the Hong Kong issue will affect Sino-British economic and trade relations, Brittan indicated affirmatively after the meeting that "China can join GATT this year."
