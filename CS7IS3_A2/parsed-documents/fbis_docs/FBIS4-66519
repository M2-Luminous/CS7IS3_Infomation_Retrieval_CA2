No country recognized this annexation--just as no country recognized the annexation of the Golan 14 years ago--and no UN framework gave it its blessing. Legally, these annexations are no more valid than the annexation of the West Bank to Transjordan in 1950, given the reservations of the entire world (except for Britain and Pakistan). Politically, the powers recognized over the years that there was no point in an immediate clash over Jerusalem, lest it frustrate at the outset any Israeli-Arab negotiation. This problem was therefore left for the end of the bargaining, but we should not make the mistake of confusing this with acceptance of the Israeli course of action. In one sense, there has even been something of a retreat in Israel's bargaining power with the recognition of the PLO and the separation of the discussion over the future of the territories from the discussions with Jordan--since the previous argument that Jordan, as annexer of the West Bank, had no advantage over Israel with regard to the partition resolution of 1947 is no longer valid when it comes to a permanent agreement with the Palestinian entity. The preinterim agreement known as "Gaza and Jericho First" is again supposed to postpone discussion of Jerusalem to the time of the final agreement. The UN condemnation in the wake of the Hebron slaughter does not change the timetable, but only serves to remind us of Jerusalem's controversial status in international eyes. There is no substantive change in the situation: The annexation goes unrecognized but also does not constitute a basis for a claim of compensation against Israel. This is not a pleasant situation for Israel, knowing that the day of reckoning is yet to come, but it is also no pretext for ridiculous shouts of crisis by the opponents of the Rabin government. In the period of the Begin and Shamir governments, the political situation of Jerusalem was no better, just the contrary--their stubborn policy threatened to bring Israel into conflict with her worldwide supporters to such an extent that control of Jerusalem itself would emerge from that confrontation injured and bruised. No one should delude himself with the idea that the status of Jerusalem in the final agreement will be identical to the present situation. Certainly there will be various changes, both in terms of the connection of the eastern part of the city with the Palestinian entity (Israel, after all, is not interested in the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Jerusalem Arabs) and in terms of supervision over the Christian and Muslim holy places. An enlightened policy would be working even now to consolidate a complex balance of appropriate authorities for the non-Jewish quarters of the city, in cooperation with Muslim bodies (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and, perhaps, even a non-Arab state like Turkey) and others (the Vatican). A pilot test of this balance could be conducted in miniature at other sites of religious significance in the territories--in Nablus, in Bethlehem and, above all, in Hebron. The idea of the Palestinian police force in Hebron is not harmful, even if it is not particularly helpful, as long as the Jewish settlers in Hebron (and those on their way from Qiryat Arba' to the Cave of the Patriarchs) constitute the "time bomb" that Yitzhaq Rabin warned about, since the first clash between those settlers and the Palestinian policemen is likely to end in human and political disaster. The principal significance of this suggested police force and of the condemnation in the United Nations is to supply a pretext to the Palestinians to do what it is worthwhile for them to do in any case--come back to substantive talks with Israel in order to win in good time the first slice of the autonomy administration in the territories. Following this slice there will be others, along with Israeli accords with Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. Jerusalem's turn will be late, but will also come to pass--and as Baruch Goldstein certainly also understood, what happens in Hebron at the beginning will happen in Jerusalem at the end.
