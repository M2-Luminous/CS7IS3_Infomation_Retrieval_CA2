And even though I did not have a sense of seeing something new when I looked at the numerous screens and monitors [tablo], on this occasion, as well, I could not rid myself of the feeling that I was in the most important facility. How else could it be, given that everything that happens here is the final result of the work of all the country's air defense forces? The training exercise that was being conducted that day at the command post's intelligence-gathering and information processing center [RITs] was no exception. In our present situation, it is no exaggeration to say that it is very important to have as much information about the enemy as possible. This is especially true in the case of the Air Defense Forces. Without accurate and timely information about hostile aircraft, the highly accurate SAM complex and interceptors remain blind. To prevent this from happening, the Radiotechnical Troops of the Air Defense Forces of Ukraine constantly conduct training exercises at various levels of subordination for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of air reconnaissance. ...It is never quiet and calm in the RITs room. Information about the situation in the air over the whole country and beyond its borders arrives here all day and all night from subunits, command posts, units, and formations stationed across the whole of Ukraine. The large screen was lit up with markers of planned [side-] numbers [borty]. Every so often, the monitor lit up -- a new target had appeared. However, the first part of the exercise was already in full swing. As it progressed, the officers of the RITs command post and their colleagues from the mobile command post were undergoing a theoretical test of their knowledge of documents on organizing combat duties, combat operations in the RITs, and the operational use of the combat arms of the Air Defense Forces. The usual procedure was used: a question on a card, twenty minutes to prepare, and then the answer. The examiners were officers in charge of the training exercise. Col. R. Kim, chief of the combat training division of the Radiotechnical Troops [RTV], and Col. H. Avramenko, chief of the command post of the Air Defense Forces, did not stint in asking additional questions to assess how well the officers were prepared. Lt. Col. O. Ohoreltsev and Lt. Col. V. Moshenskiy demonstrated excellent skills. Lt. Col. Serebryakov and majors Kolesnikov and Polyanskyy gave assured answers. On the other hand, officers Potyomkin, Kublo, Sokol, and Latyshkevych gave answers that were not up to their expected level of nowledge. They ran into difficulties answering questions on the structure and organization of foreign armies and on the tactical and technical features of Air Defense equipment. After the last answer is heard, the examiners announce the results. Officials are charged with holding additional classes on subjects in which individual officers demonstrated insufficient proficiency. This time no drastic measures are taken; requirements with respect to the theoretical knowledge of officers are very strict at the command post. An unsatisfactory level of knowledge can result in disciplinary action here, even removal from the performance of service duties. Then the crew take up their usual places. The last orders ring out. The numbers on the electronic clock have already passed the "H-hour". Groups of "enemy" targets begin to appear on the screens and plotting boards, where just seconds ago there were only individual blips. Several directions light up virtually at the same time. More than half the blips symbolizing the "enemy" are red in color. These need to be dealt with first, because these targets are coming it at low and very low altitudes. For that reason, the leader of the exercise gives special instructions on following them and producing the information needed to destroy them. Gradually, the tension in the RITs approaches the critical point. But the faces of the officers of the duty watch remain calm and concentrated. Reports are coming in over the communication channels from the various sectors about the actions of the "enemy." The "enemy" gives no quarter, as they say. Across the entire range of altitudes, from very low all the way into the stratosphere, despite the mounting of active resistance, the strike group of targets is approaching ever closer to the country's border. "In the southwestern sector, the target is... the command post!" states another report. The information about this target is processed as quickly as possible and passed on to the commander for a decision. Fighter aircraft lift off. Radar conditions become even more complicated. Given the situation, Col. R. Kim assigns part of the information for manual processing. While the automated command and control system [ASU] responded faultlessly to changes in the situation in the air (it is, after all, a machine), those manning the plotting board performed somewhat less efficiently. Lacking sufficient experience, they were unable to deal with the large volume of work. As a result, the amount of information given them was decreased in the course of the exercise. Despite this, they made many mistakes in depicting the actions of "enemy" targets. This was revealed when they compared the situation on the map board with the attack plan. But it would not be fair to blame only those manning the plotting board. After all, their job is only the final link in the long information transmission chain, which consists of many specialists at various levels. As became obvious later, the telegraph operators at the communications node also made mistakes. The RITs officers should also have reacted more decisively when information disappeared, and they should have acted more boldly in checking through the communication channels. But this will become apparent later; meanwhile, the RITs is receiving the first reports about targets that have been destroyed. The numbered arrows that had just "crossed" the state border are being replaced by markers that resemble envelopes. However, it is too early to speak of complete success. There are still many hostile aircraft in the skies, attempting to reach their assigned targets. Colonels R. Kim and H. Avramenko are devoting particular attention to the interaction of units and formations. Their concern is understandable: this is one of the most important prerequisites for carrying out the combat mission. ...The exercise is over. The hour of intense combat activity has passed with lightning speed. It is now time to analyze the actions of the duty watch of the RITs. "The objective of this training exercise for the battle crew has been attained in all respects," states Col. H. Avramenko. "The work was done using both automated and nonautomated means, which required of the specialists the ability to combine these two methods during the course of a massive strike. The exercise also exposed the shortcomings in our work. Above all, it revealed an inability to quickly analyze the actions of the targets depending on their importance and other factors. It also revealed inadequate oversight of the quality and quantity of information. In the future, we will have to devote more attention to ensuring more decisive action by the crew of the RITs as well as the communications center specialists to avoid information gaps." At the outset of the exercise, Hennadiy Volodymyrovych had said that when surface-to-air missile operators shoot in the rear hemisphere, this signifies a defect in the work the Radiotechnicaol Tropps. Applying his statement to everything that I heard and saw, I think that the SAM operators would not need to do so. The level of air surveillance remains high, as does the performance of the brain center in this chain -- that is, the RITs command post of the Air Defense Forces.
