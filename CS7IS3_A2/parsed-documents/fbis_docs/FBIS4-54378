FBIS4-54378 "dreas103_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 North Korea Gore's Remarks on Nuclear Issue Denounced Gore's Remarks on Nuclear Issue Denounced SK2605151094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 26 May 94 SK2605151094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1300 GMT 26 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a report, in his recent television program, U.S. Vice President Gore has made an absurd remark by saying that continuing talks with North Korea is dangerous, and that the steps taken by the United States to strengthen security for South Korea is wise. This is a challenging remark to create obstacles to resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, as well as to further lead the situation of the Korean peninsula to the crisis situation. [chongseul wigisanghanguro] Judging from the open remarks made by U.S. hardline conservative forces indicating that continuing talks with the DPRK is dangerous, they are not interested in resolving the nuclear issue, but rather plot to isolate and crush [apsal] us by force. The U.S. hardline conservative forces' pursuing its unchanged policy of crushing Korea and of regarding it as an enemy has been well disclosed in the open remarks made by U.S. Senator McCain, at the Senate on 24 May demanding that the United States execute a policy of force [wanryok chongchaek], such as carrying out an air raid on the North Korean nuclear facility or attacking it with cruise missiles. Such violent remarks by the U.S. hardline conservative forces regarding war can never be forgiven because their remarks are very dangerous ones that make it possible to bring about an unpredictable situation [yechuhalsuopnun satae] on the Korean peninsula.
