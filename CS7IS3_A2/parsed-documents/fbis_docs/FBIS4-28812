FBIS4-28812 "dreas114_a_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Naval Exchange Program With SKN Planned Naval Exchange Program With SKN Planned OW1406033694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0304 GMT 14 Jun 94 OW1406033694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Plans for the first ever exchange of Japanese and South Korean naval training squadrons are moving forward, Defense Agency sources said Tuesday [14 Jun]. The two countries are working out the schedule, ports of call and other details for the exchange between Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the South Korean Navy [SKN], the sources said. Former Defense Agency Chief Kazuo Aichi and South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae agreed during Yi's visit to Japan in April that the exchange would be one link in realizing broader military exchanges. Progress on the exchange comes as Japanese and South Korean vessels are taking part for the first time together in the six-nation RIMPAC naval exercises near Hawaii and as concern over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program continues to mount on the Korean peninsula. According to the agency sources, South Korea proposed the mutual exchange immediately after Yi returned to South Korea from Japan. A South Korean squadron will visit Japan followed by a return visit by a Japanese squadron to a South Korean port. Japanese officials say that "fundamentally there are no obstacles" for the exchange but add the situation in North Korea could alter the plans. Young officers in the MSDF training squadron have just recently completed their land-based training and have visited different parts of the world every year for their training at sea. In the Asia-Pacific region, the officer trainees have visited the Philippines and Guam but have yet to make a port call in South Korea. In the past, South Korea has suggested that its submarine personnel train on Japanese submarines, but the Defense Agency has never taken any action. In its 1992-93 white paper on defense, South Korea called for broader military exchanges with Japan as a contribution to the reunification of the Korean peninsula.
