He said his ministry demanded a special resolution to prevent Russia from further dumping of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan. He said the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations was not entitled to issue licences for imports of nuclear waste from other countries until after the go-ahead from environmental experts. However, the minister said that much too often, nuclear waste was imported into Russia under the guise of materials intended for reprocessing as evidenced by a recent incident in Orenburg. The minister denied media accusations that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a deal on imports of liquid nuclear waste from Hungary for reprocessing in Russia. He blamed Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov for signing this deal instead. The minister said the agreement did not go through an ecological safety study and "is therefore illegal." Danilov-Danilyan called for a review of all previous international agreements on nuclear waste disposal in Russia to be followed by parliamentary ratification.
