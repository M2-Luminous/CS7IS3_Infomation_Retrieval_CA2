The article says: By defeating fascist Germany in the past patriotic war, the people and Army of the former Soviet Union defended the socialist state, the first of its kind in the world, relieved peoples of many countries from the danger of fascist enslavement and greatly contributed to the human cause of liberation. After the downfall of international fascism with the end of the Second World War, the popular masses, who had been the objects of history in the past, have now become the driving forces of history, shouldering the cause of independence. But, the old forces of imperialism still remain and they are seeking the ambition for domination over the world as ever. They are economically blockading and strangling and militarily threatening and crushing the countries that are going against them, while fostering national and regional contradictions, confrontations and division in different areas of the world. The facts show that the aggressive nature of imperialism has never been changed and cannot be changed. The obtaining situation requires the people the world over to unite for an active struggle against imperialism under the banner of anti-imperialist independence. Only when the people of the world vigorously conduct the peace- defending movement against imperialism and war, will imperialism and dominationism become impotent and the people's cause of independence and socialism advance.
