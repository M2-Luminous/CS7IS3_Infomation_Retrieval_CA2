A GPC spokesman, quoted by the official news agency SABA', said one of the missiles exploded near Sanaa international airport and another three in mountainous areas. It gave no location for the other two. "These missiles caused only horror for children, women and the elderly," said the spokesman, warning that the southern forces of the Yemen Socialist Party would be tried for war crimes. He denied earlier reports from the south that the presidential palace in Sanaa had been hit. With Yemen's four-year-old union in peril, President 'Ali Abdallah Salih's GPC has said its troops are bearing down on the southern port city of Aden with the aim of capturing it. The forces of Salih, a northerner, are locked in a bitter struggle with those of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, who was dismissed by parliament on Thursday night at the end of a first day of heavy fighting. Southern officials said their planes had hit the presidential palace with missiles and set it ablaze.
