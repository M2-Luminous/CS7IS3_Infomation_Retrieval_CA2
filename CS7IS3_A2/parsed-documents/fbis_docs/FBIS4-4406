He said such remarks are aggravating the risk of war on the Korean peninsula just as much as North Korea's mentioning Seoul as a sea of fire. Chairman Yi Ki-taek met with journalists this morning and said that Defense Secretary Perry's remarks may be one of the double-faced, hard and moderate tactics of the United States but are intimidating the people of the ROK. Chairman Yi Ki-taek also said that diplomatic and security policy regarding sanctions on North Korea should not cause confusion and that the president should have a clear picture of the situation and replace inharmonious diplomatic and security policymakers.
