Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water Act, any substances or parameters at any location. Section D. Reporting Requirements 1. Reporting Requirements a. Planned changes. The permittee shall give notice to the Regional Administrator as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when: (1) The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source in 40 CFR 122.29(b); or (2) The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification applies to pollutants which are subject to the effluent limitations in the permit, nor to the notification requirements under 40 CFR 122.42(a)(1). (3) The alteration or addition results in a significant change in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration, addition or change may justify the application of permit conditions different from or absent in the existing permit, including notification of additional use or disposal sites not reported during the permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved land application plan. b. Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give advance notice to the Regional Administrator of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements. c. Transfers. This permit is not transferable to any person except after notice to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator may require modification or revocation and reissuance of the permit to change the name of the permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under the Clean Water Act. (See ยง122.61; in some cases, modification or revocation and reissuance is mandatory.) d. Monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the intervals specified elsewhere in this permit. (1) Monitoring results must be reported on a Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) or forms provided or specified by the Regional Administrator for reporting results of monitoring of sludge use or disposal practices. (2) If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the permit using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136 or, in the case of sludge use or disposal, approved under 40 CFR Part 136 unless otherwise specified in 40 CFR Part 503, or as specified in the permit, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR or sludge reporting form specified by the Regional Administrator. (3) Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the Regional Administrator in the permit. e. Twenty-four hour reporting. (1) The permittee shall report any noncompliance which may endanger health or the environment. Any information shall be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. The written submission shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. (2) The following shall be included as information which must be reported within 24 hours under this paragraph. (a) Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. (See ยง122.41(g).) (b) Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. (c) Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the pollutants listed by the Regional Administrator in the permit to be reported within 24 hours. (See ยง122.44(g).) (3) The Regional Administrator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis for reports under Paragraph D.1.e if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. f. Compliance Schedules. Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements contained in any compliance schedule of this permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each schedule date. g. Other noncompliance. The permittee shall report all instances of noncompliance not reported under Paragraphs D.1.d, D.1.e and D.1.f of this section, at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports shall contain the information listed in Paragraph D.1.e of this section. h. Other information. Where the permittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or submitted incorrect information in a permit application or in any report to the Regional Administrator, it shall promptly submit such facts or information. 2.
