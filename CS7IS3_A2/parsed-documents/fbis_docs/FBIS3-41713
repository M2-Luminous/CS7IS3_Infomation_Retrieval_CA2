This week a focus of infection was revealed in Moscow. A press conference held by the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight (GKSEN) was devoted to an analysis of the alarming situation now developing. As was noted by Aleksandr Monisov, deputy chairman of the GKSEN and assistant Russian chief state public health physician, the epidemiological situation in Russia can be characterized today as alarming. This is associated primarily with interstate migration of the population within the CIS and abroad, and with expansion of the channels of exchange of freight, goods, food products and agricultural raw materials. Outbreaks and spreading of dangerous infectious diseases such as plague, yellow fever, typhoid fever and especially cholera have been observed in this connection. Thus, an unprecedented cholera outbreak was observed in 1992--El Tor Ogava vibrio was discovered in 68 countries of the world, with the total number of patients being 461,000 persons (see table). This year 118,000 patients were revealed in 6 months. The largest proportion of infected individuals is found in the countries of the Near and Central East--Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Syria. An outbreak of cholera was recently noted in a number of regions of Latin America as well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |World Cholera Morbidity From 1983 to 1992 (Thousands of Cases) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1983 |64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1984-1989 |29-48 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |594 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |461.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As Mr Monisov noted, Russia has not been spared this fate either. The last 3 years were extremely strained for Russian epidemiologists: Following a mass outbreak of cholera in 1990 in Stavropol imported from Syria (49 persons fell ill), the situation stabilized, but not for long. This year an outbreak of cholera epidemic imported from India and Turkey was noted (a total of 17 patients in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar and Naberezhnyye Chelny). However, medical workers are troubled even more by the appearance of ``home-grown'' cholera, the source of which is found in Russia's own biological environment. Thus, this year medical workers noted three cholera foci in this country. The first case was documented in May in Kaspiysk (Dagestan)--a certain Sergey Makhin drank his fill of untreated water from a canal. The result--cholera in its most acute form. It was impossible to save the patient. His wife was infected as well. A month later cholera vibrio was found in the body of a 4-month infant in Makhachkala. And then the most alarming communication: On 8 August the police picked up Vladimir Shabunov, a 40-year-old person without a permanent place of residence, at Kursk Station in Moscow. He was in a coma. After he underwent resuscitation El Tor Ogava cholera vibrio was isolated from him. Twenty persons who had come in contact with the patient were revealed. Cholera virus has already been detected in the body of one of the orderlies. Yet another person who had come into contact with Shabunov--a 26-year-old driver--fled the hospital on 12 August, and the police are actively searching for him. The agent of cholera infection--El Tor Ogava vibrio--is classified as a ``waterborne infection,'' and therefore it lives and multiplies in the untreated water of open-air sources. According to specialists 50 percent of Russia's population uses water that potentially favors cholera infection. Responding to questions from a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Mr Monisov said that the former USSR republics through which infection penetrates to Russian territory unhindered present the greatest danger to Russia. Thus, cholera is raging now in Tajikistan. Over 100 patients have already been documented, of whom 41 have died. Presence of infamous Somali refugees in the country is also an unfavorable factor. They are a ``risk factor'' not only in relation to cholera but also in relation to the entire spectrum of dangerous infections. All of this, Mr Monisov emphasized, led to the need for drafting a law ``On Protection of Russian Federation Territory From Importation and Spread of Especially Dangerous Infections'' and a federal ``Migration'' program regulating migration processes.
