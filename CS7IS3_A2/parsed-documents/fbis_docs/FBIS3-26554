Its white body, emblazoned with a bright-red drawing of the national flag and the characters "China Aerospace," glistened in the bright afternoon sunlight. This was the Long March 3-A, a new type of carrier rocket developed by our country scheduled to be launched soon. Inside the cowling at the tip of the rocket were a space survey satellite codenamed "Shijian-4" and a simulated satellite a total of 52.52 meters high. The new rocket is a single-body, three-stage, heavy-thrust carrier rocket developed on the basis of the "Long March-3." It is capable of lifting a 2.5-tonne payload into geosynchronous orbit around the earth. At 1530 [0730 GMT], the first long wail of the siren pierced the sky. The launch site was unusually quiet, except for the commands transmitted through the loudspeaker and the noise caused by liquid hydrogen and oxygen burning in the combustion pond. The vast blue sky was cloudless. The row of huge slogans at the bottom of the launch tower was exceptionally striking: Each and every screw links up to form the space industry, whereas small buttons hold the motherland's dignity together. At 1615, commander No. 1 issued a command: "We have entered a 20-minute state of readiness. Only one of the five work platforms on the tower is not yet open. The last stage of fueling is in full swing. The work platform, which ran parallel to the cowling, spewed white clouds of smoke generated by the fueling process. [no closing quotation marks as received] Thereafter, commander No. 1 ordered operator No. 301 to leave the site and to enter a five-minute state of readiness for the launch. The siren sounded for a fourth time, and the last group of people on the tower ran away from the launch site. At 1634, a loud sound rattled the entire valley as the Long March 3-A emitted a huge, bright orange plume from its rear portion. The launch site was filled with smoke as the white body of the rocket lifted off into the cloudless sky. Scores of fluorescent screens kept flickering on the work counters in the room of the command and control center. The gigantic main display screen illustrated the rocket's path. Data relayed from the Xian Satellite Monitoring and Control Center and the Yuanwang survey ship in the Pacific Ocean showed that the satellites had entered geosynchronous orbit with the earth. At 1717, a responsible person from the China Aerospace Industry Corporation proclaimed: The experiment of the Long March 3-A's maiden flight is successful. The room was filled with joy. Bursts of firecrackers erupted outside the room, greeting the successful launch and bringing in the Spring Festival.
