Zaveryukha, vice premier of the Government of Russia: "Related Sectors, One Interest"] [Text] Aleksandr Kharlampiyevich Zaveryukha was born in the settlement of the Sovkhoz imeni Elektrozavod in Novosergiyevskiy Rayon, Orenburg Oblast, in the prewar year of 1940. He began his labor activity as a tractor operator on his native sovkhoz, from where he left to serve in the ranks of the Soviet Army. He came to the first course of the Orenburg Agricultural Institute with quite a rich life experience and serious labor and army training, which, obviously, was useful. The newly fledged agronomist grasped the rudiments of vocational skills after graduation from the higher educational institution when he assumed the post of chief economist of the Uran Sovkhoz in his native Novosergiyevskiy Rayon. He grasped them very successfully if after 3 years in the same rayon members of the Komsomolskiy Kolkhoz elected him their chairman. He worked in this post for 11 years. In 1978 straight from the [post of] kolkhoz chairman, bypassing intermediate levels of authority, A.Kh. Zaveryukha right away was appointed deputy chief of the production administration of agriculture in the oblast, which he headed soon. Then he worked as first deputy chairman of the oblast agro-industrial committee and as chairman of the oblast soviet of agro-industrial formations. In 1992 he was appointed general director of the All-Russian Scientific Production Association of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Beef Cattle Breeding. He defended his dissertation without giving up his work. He is candidate of economic sciences. A.Kh. Zaveryukha, people's deputy of the Russian Federation, vice premier of the Government of Russia, among several national economic sectors, also manages the Russian Federal Forest Service. From time immemorial two concepts--forest and arable land--have been indivisible in the consciousness of the Russian man. Time has confirmed with all obviousness: They cannot be examined separately--this is fraught with big losses. Successful work by peasants largely depends on the state of the country's agriculture and, naturally, they are vitally interested in seeing to it that forestry affairs are conducted competently and sensibly. The state privatization program determines: Russia's forest lands are federal property and are not subject to privatization. The Federal Forest Service should now become the only owner of Russian forests. However, at the beginning of 1993 about 80 percent of the country's forests were under its authority. As before, 7 million hectares of plantings are under the authority of various ministries and departments (the Ministry of Defense, hunting establishments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and administrations of the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg). The Federal Forest Service and its local bodies, fulfilling the requirements of the new forest legislation, must immediately accept all forests and bear responsibility for their preservation and reproduction. When there is one owner in the forest, it will be possible to solve the problems of agricultural workers more successfully. Agricultural workers count on forestry experts in many ways. They hope that state bodies for the sector's management, jointly with territorial bodies of power, will be able to solve the problem of leasing available plots of forest lands on favorable terms to timber cutters meeting the needs of rural dwellers for lumber. It is also necessary to examine with territorial bodies of power problems concerning the preferential supply of felled and sawn timber for the rural population. It would be advisable for the Russian Federal Forest Service to prepare on behalf of the government recommendations to territorial bodies of power about the free sale of dead-standing and windfallen trees to the population. In 1993 forestry establishments of the Russian Federal Forest Service procured 18 million cubic meters of timber by way of improvement tree felling. This timber is used for the needs of the local (basically rural) population. The production cost of timber procured by forestry establishments is much lower than that of commercial structures. Moreover, in accordance with the president's edict the profit from the processing of timber from improvement felling is not taxed. To increase improvement felling volumes to scientifically substantiated norms and to more fully meet the needs of the rural population for timber and fuel are important tasks of forestry bodies. One would like forestry bodies to pay more attention to the farms that are being established. In particular, for their stabilization and support the Federal Forest Service must develop a program for leasing sections of forest lands to farmers on favorable terms. Soil erosion does irreparable damage to land resources, the environment, and our economy. The soil of eroded and erosion-dangerous agricultural areas now makes up 56 percent. Erosion annually devours about 1 and 1/2 billion tonnes of fertile soil. The president of the Russian Federation and the Government of Russia are disturbed by the existing situation with the protection of land against degradation. Urgent actions are necessary. The examination of this matter was referred to the Security Council of the Russian Federation. In erosion control it is difficult to overestimate the significance of forest reclamation measures. Field-protective forest belts ensure not only soil protection against erosion, but, at the same time, greatly increase harvests and lower production costs. The afforestation of gully and ravine systems eliminates their desiccating and draining effect on adjoining territories and brings destroyed lands back into the economic turnover. The forest reclamation of sandy lands and arid pastures counteracts deflation processes to a considerable extent and makes it possible to obtain a variety of agricultural and forestry products scarce in these regions. For example, 3 to 5 hectares of sand in the Lower Volga Area put into agricultural turnover under the protection of forest plantings are equivalent in plant output to 1 irrigated hectare of high-grade soil. For the complete protection of agricultural land in the Russian Federation it is necessary to have 12.3 million hectares of forest belts. The long-term plan for anti-erosion measures determined the immediate volumes of work on protective afforestation--5.1 million hectares. A total of 2.9 million--only one-fourth of the scientifically substantiated need--were established. The program for an increase in Russia's soil fertility envisaged the establishment of 252,000 hectares of all types of protective plantings in 1992-1993. According to preliminary data, execution will make up 60 percent. Why have the volumes of work been curtailed? Local agricultural enterprises refuse to allocate land plots for forest plantings (this problem is aggravated owing to the change in the forms of land ownership) and problems concerning the financing of this work are solved poorly. Russia's forests represent a vast storeroom for the replenishment of food in the country through the use of wild-growing berries, mushrooms, nuts, medicinal raw materials, and other gifts of the forest. For now, however, these resources are utilized poorly. In the last 2 years the procurement of wild-growing fruits and berries has decreased by a factor of five and of medicinal-technical raw materials, by a factor of more than two. There is a similar picture with respect to other indicators. But forestry experts in the Republic of Kalmykia and in Vologda, Karachayevo-Cherkess, and Kemerovo forestry administrations have been able to organize work quite well. Russian forests have many honey-bearing resources, which creates a good basis for the development of bee-keeping. This potential is also by no means fully utilized everywhere. Whereas Tatarstan annually procures honey at the level of 340 quintals, Samara Oblast, 140, Altay Kray, 210, and Sakhalin, 335, Krasnodar Kray, only at the level of 60 quintals and the Republic of Mari El, 31. Honey production is also poorly organized in a number of other regions. Forestry establishments have plenty of opportunities to develop subsidiary farms. However, the results of work in 1993 point to an alarming situation with the supply of products of agricultural production. Whereas in 1991 subsidiary farms of forestry establishments produced almost 12,000 tonnes of meat, which is more than 30 kg per worker, in 1993 they produced only about 8,000 tonnes. Forestry experts in Vladimir, Pskov, Smolensk, and a number of other forestry administrations unjustifiably refused to manage subsidiary farms. They transferred up to 90 percent of the available livestock to various structures under a department of the industrial sphere. But forestry experts in the Udmurt Republic and Voronezh, Tambov, Tula, Rostov, Kurgan, and Kemerovo oblasts, despite difficulties, not only have preserved the production of agricultural products, but also have a rise in basic indicators. In brief, under the most difficult conditions of the transitional period of the market economy, with a desire and a skillful approach it is possible to have one's own meat, milk, and other products, which becomes a good support for workers. I deliberately do not dwell here on the "pure" problems of forestry--a great deal is written about this in the pages of LESNAYA GAZETA. Nevertheless, it is worth talking about one. It is known that, owing to the reduction in production and the sharp rise in the cost of machinery, the degree of equipment of forestry establishments with labor-saving and ecologically safe machines and mechanisms used in improvement felling, in reforestation, and in other operations has dropped in recent years. Therefore, proposals on granting goal-oriented preferential credits for the purchase of machinery, which contributes to an increase in the volumes of forest tending and to an improvement in its quality, should be submitted to the government.
