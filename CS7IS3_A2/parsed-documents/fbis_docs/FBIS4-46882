Solovov, candidate of economic sciences and deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia: "The Monetary Policy of the CIS Countries: Coordination Is Needed"] [Text] At the initiative of the Association of Russian Banks, the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, Mezhekonomsberbank [Intereconomic Savings Bank], and the "Novaya Politika" [New Politics] Center for Humanitarian Relations and Business Cooperation, an international banking conference is being held with the title "Possible ways to establish an efficient mutual settlement of accounts system for Russia with the states of the near abroad on the level of central and commercial banks." Taking part in the conference's work will be representatives of the central and commercial banks of Russia and the countries of the near abroad and managers of state departments. The material by deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia V. Solovov has also been prepared within the framework of this conference. At the present time, resolving the problems of developing the monetary systems of the CIS states and organizing payments between the legal and physical persons of these states is becoming increasingly urgent. Introducing national currencies and making the currencies and credit markets of the states of the former Union distinctive have generated a lot of questions which must be answered to eliminate the obstacles which have formed in mutual settlement of accounts and to create an effective payment system. I must confess that at this time there is no proper coordination of monetary-credit policy of the CIS states, most economic organizations are experiencing serious difficulties in transferring money from one country to another, the national currencies market is not developed, and certain currencies of these states are not quoted at all by the Bank of Russia, even for accounting purposes. Accordingly, there is no developed system of exchange of currencies of the Commonwealth states, freely convertible currencies and the Russian Federation ruble act as the real means of payment when citizens travel to neighboring states, and the Russian ruble's role on the "black" market of virtually all the CIS states remains significant, which naturally concerns their central banks when they are resolving questions of stabilizing their national currencies. In these conditions, the desire to solve the problems of the accounts-payment relations of the members of the Commonwealth is becoming stronger and stronger. The need for such a solution is the result of the extremely close economic interrelations between the enterprises of these states, the many relations of kinship and friendship among citizens, traditional passenger traffic, and other factors which allowed the Soviet Union to be a real unified national economic and civil complex. Resolving the problem should provide legal entities the opportunity to make payments for output delivered and settle accounts on other debt obligations. Since there are different currencies in the two states, payments must be made either in one currency or the currency the payer has must be converted beforehand into the currency the recipient of the payment needs. The first thing all the participants in interstate settlement of accounts of the states of the former Union encountered was their lack of an organized currency market. The central banks have to perform the task of creating currency exchanges. Not all states have managed to this at this point. A currency policy requires coordination. After July 1992, the tendency toward a policy focused on full-scale introduction of national currencies in the states of the former Union increased. However, representatives of many states continued to declare their commitment to preserving the common ruble space and their intention to follow coordinated monetary-credit, currency, budget, tax, customs, and price policies. These sentiments were most fully reflected in the interstate agreement signed in Bishkek on 9 October 1992. But by November 1992, Ukraine had already introduced its own national currency, and then Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, and Turkmenistan did so. With the introduction of national currencies, the central (national) banks faced the task of supporting the payments of economic subjects to their partners from other states of the former Union, which is feasible with mutually convertible currencies. Banks, with the exception of the Bank of Russia, had no experience in currency regulation and the organization of trade in currencies, and many questions had to be resolved in slapdash fashion. Since both the Russian Federation ruble and the currencies of the other CIS states were constantly being devalued, the exchange rates of the currencies could not be stabilized. The Russian Federation currency in fact played the leading role in interstate settlement of accounts of the CIS countries, which again put the question of the role of the Russian ruble and the Bank of Russia on the agenda. In practice, the mechanism for managing payments in the central (national) banks of the states of the former USSR (other than Russia) was reduced to selecting the top priority payments (at the discretion of the representatives of the governments and national banks) which the balance in the correspondent account in the Bank of Russia (in Russian book entry rubles) permitted to be transferred to the banks of Russia. With such a practice, commercial banks and their clients were deprived of the opportunity to manage receipts from the banks of Russia, and the capital passed entirely to the disposal of the national banks, which was not in the interests of the commercial banks' clients. It got somewhat easier for commercial banks to handle interstate accounts in the second half of 1992 after the Bank of Russia allowed accounts to be done through the correspondent accounts of the commercial banks which they opened in others' banks. When an account was opened, certain conditions had to be met, in particular the requirements of legislation of both the Russian Federation and the state of the nonresident bank. As for payments through the central banks, to an increasing degree they began to depend on the amount of technical credit which the Russian Federation offered to the particular state of the former USSR. From the very start, the Russian Federation government restricted the granting of technical credits, and starting on 1 July 1993, by decree of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet of 30 June 1993, the Bank of Russia was prohibited from offering credits to governments and central (national) banks of the states of the former USSR. The new state credits began to be offered using only the capital of the Russian Federation budget. By the second quarter of 1993, a substantial part of trade exchange had already begun to be served by settlements on the accounts of commercial banks, and the role of the correspondent accounts of central banks in serving commodity turnover substantially declined. This situation was the result of the fact that the currency and credit policy followed by the central (national) banks and governments of the CIS states did not give incentive to enterprises and commercial banks to transfer Russian rubles through the central (national) banks' accounts in the Bank of Russia. The problem of currency regulation and organization of a currency market arose in all its fullness for the central banks. A normal market of the currencies of the CIS states has still not been organized in the Russian Federation's currency exchanges. The volumes of national currencies offered on the Russian Federation's currency exchanges are much greater than the demand for these currencies, and the quotation of these currencies made by the Bank of Russia based on the results of trading sessions can hardly be called representative. And it is no accident that in publishing these rates, the Bank of Russia does not assume the obligation of buying or selling the corresponding currencies at the rates set, and they are largely employed only for the purposes of accounting and taxation. The shortage of Russian rubles on the markets of the CIS countries was created not only by objective factors (the imbalance of commodity exchange with Russia and the nonpayments of Russian purchasers), but is also a result of the currency policy of the corresponding states which makes it unprofitable for exporters of goods to Russia to transfer the rubles received through the official channels of the central banks. Commercial structures are actively speculating on various currency rates. At present Russian sellers still have little interest in receiving payment in the national currency, since they experience some difficulty spending this capital on the territory of the corresponding states, including because of limited potential to convert the national currencies into rubles or freely convertible currency, as well as limited access to highly liquid goods of the local market, which is frequently monopolized. The condition of the Russian Federation's credit-settlements and payment relations with the CIS states throughout 1993 was an object of special concern during all interstate negotiations. The crisis in interstate accounts settlement was in many respects also tied to the insolvency of Russian enterprises, and because of that the CIS states could not have at their disposal all the revenue from exporting output to Russia which could have been used to stabilize the national currency's rate relative to the ruble. The fact that the customers from the CIS countries did not have ruble assets and that the Russian sellers were unwilling to accept payment in their national currencies from them in itself paralyzed normal market relations and led to a cutback in economic ties, which, given the high degree to which the economies of the members of the Commonwealth were integrated, had extremely bad consequences for all the states, including Russia. So-called barter clearing began to be used as one of the measures for maintaining interstate cooperation; this meant that products vitally important to the states were exchanged in kind based on their equivalent values in world prices. But barter clearing substantially impaired the possibility of forming currency markets both in Russia (in view of the demand for the national currencies of the CIS countries) and in the Commonwealth states (in view of the supply of Russian rubles). On 22 January 1993, the Agreement on the Creation of an Interstate Bank of the CIS States was signed, and it was supposed to help primarily in improving interstate settlement of accounts. But up to this point, this bank has not begun to perform its operations, since not all the founding states and members of the Interstate Bank have fulfilled their obligations to the bank. The difficulties in handling interstate settlement of accounts by book entry instead of cash created increased interest in settlements in cash. Despite the prohibitions, these settlements became more and more popular. The migration to Russia of cash in the form of 1961-1992 series ruble notes of USSR Gosbank and the Bank of Russia, issued by the banks of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and other states which had not introduced their own bank notes, reached a scale which threatened the interests of monetary circulation in the Russian Federation. For this reason, on 23 July 1993 the Bank of Russia declared that 1961-1992 series banknotes of USSR Gosbank and the Bank of Russia would cease to circulate on Russia's territory starting on 26 July 1993. Previous to this decision, from the very start of 1993, the Bank of Russia had been putting exclusively 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia into circulation on Russia's territory, and they were not turned over to the disposal of the central (national) banks of the other states of the ruble zone. The result of this action was completion of the process of Russia's introducing a national currency, which started in mid-1992 with the introduction of a correspondent accounts system for interstate settlement of accounts. This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation required that Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Armenia immediately decide what paper money they were going to use on their territories and how their monetary systems would be managed in the future. The Russian Federation expressed its readiness to offer the 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia to the disposal of the central (national) banks of these states, but given that they definitely comply with a number of conditions, the most important ones being that they transfer to the Bank of Russia the authority to regulate the volumes of credit and cash-money emission, strictly comply with the unified rules for completing banking transactions and interbank settlement of accounts, and follow a unified currency and interest policy. These conditions defined the essence of the new type of ruble zone, and the agreement on practical measures for its creation was signed in Moscow on 7 September 1993 by the heads of the governments and central (national) banks of the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and Tajikistan. Turkmenistan had already made the decision to introduce its own national currency by this time and did not take part in the agreement. During interstate negotiations on the intergovernmental and interbank levels which took place afterward on particular conditions for combining the monetary systems of the states participating in the agreement of 7 September 1993, the parties did not manage to achieve accord on the conditions for the central (national) banks to immediately receive for their disposal cash in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia, which these states (other than Belarus) desperately needed. The adoption of a decision dragged out for an indefinite time and that destabilized the domestic market of the states where the Soviet ruble continued to circulate; in connection with that, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Armenia made the decision to refrain from hastily combining the monetary systems and introduced national currencies (November-December 1993), while Tajikistan received a state credit from the Russian Federation in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia. In this way, in 1993 the new type of ruble zone did not come about on the territories of six CIS states. At this time (late March 1994), negotiations on unifying the monetary systems of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus continue and are close to completion. So, as a result of the lack of proper coordination of monetary-credit policy followed in 1991-1993 by the states of the former USSR, the monetary system of the Soviet Union had ceased to exist by the end of 1993 and all states of the former USSR had acquired their own monetary systems headed by the central (national) banks formed on the basis of former USSR Gosbank institutions. These banks are accumulating experience in autonomous existence and almost all of them are encountering the same problems of development and growth. So regular exchange of experience is important and a joint search for decisions to the problems arising is necessary. The extreme interdependence of the economies of the CIS states objectively serves as the basis for currency integration. It cannot be considered accidental that there is a growing awareness of the importance and objective need for economic integration of all or some of the CIS countries with the creation of superstate organs, including an emissions bank. It is noteworthy in the situation in the Commonwealth states that they are able, by relying on recent past experience, to resolve the problems of a currency union much faster than, say, the states of the European Community.
