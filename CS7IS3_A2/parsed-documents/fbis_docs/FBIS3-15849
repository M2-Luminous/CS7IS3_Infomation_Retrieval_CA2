Paulauskas and his Chechen counterpart I. Sheripova signed an agreement on cooperation between the two offices in investigating criminal cases. Chechen Prosecutor General I. Sheripova arrived in Vilnius on Tuesday [1 March]. The visit was shrouded in secrecy from the very beginning. V. Eidukaitis, representative of Chechen President D. Dudayev in Lithuania, told RESPUBLIKA that Mrs. I. Sheripova had arrived at his invitation to "settle certain issues." According to Seimas [parliament] Deputy A. Endriukaitis, leader of the group for Lithuanian-Chechen parliamentary relations, employees of the Lithuanian and the Chechen Prosecutor General's Offices have cooperated constantly. I. Sheripova also avoided a definitive reply by telling a RESPUBLIKA correspondent that she, as well as her Lithuanian colleagues, were concerned with the same problem -- crime. As one employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told RESPUBLIKA, by signing the agreement, the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office has found itself in an "awkward" position. The reason is that the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is worried that the agreement with the Chechen Republic as an independent state might harm our relations with Russia, which views this Caucasian state as its republic. Nor has Lithuania recognized the independence of this country. It was decided not to publicize this agreement so as to avoid a diplomatic incident.
