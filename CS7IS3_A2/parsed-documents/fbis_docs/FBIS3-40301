Bresan: "Company Travels to Position"] [Text] Trogir--It is very lively every 10 days at the Trogir [a town near Split] railroad station. The reason is that members of the King Tomislav 2d Trogir Company of the 114th Brigade of the Croatian Army are leaving for positions on the southern battlefield. Thus, we photographed the members of the 2d Trogir Company while they waited for the bus before their departure. They will replace their friends and fellow fighters, also members of the Trogir Company.
