In the first meeting of trade and corporate officials since NAFTA took effect last month, the government decided to expand the foreign investment fund from 100 billion won last year to 200 billion won in 1994. Officials said they hope to register the South Korea-U.S. Industrial Cooperation Foundation this month and raise 20 million U.S. dollars by 1997 to finance joint new technology development in nine areas chosen as main exports to the United States. This would include semiconductors, machinery, construction, aviation, telecommunications equipment, computers, medical equipment, environment facilities, power generation facilities and automobiles. One of the concerns here on NAFTA has been the strengthened regulation on country-of-origin labeling. Officials said they expect makers of home appliances, automobiles and fabrics to use locally made parts due to the new regulations and decided to urge parts suppliers and manufacturing companies to jointly enter the North American market. In case of color television sets, manufacturers must use locally made braun tube and printed circuit board in order to be counted as regional trade. Officials said Korea's three major color television exporters -- Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo -- have already advanced into Mexico and will establish both assembly and parts manufacturing lines there. Korean car manufacturers will be urged to look into southern states as a new region of interest to maintain their hold on the American market, which has a relatively low 2.5 percent import tariff, officials said. In fabric, the government wants yarn makers, fabric dealers and clothing companies to enter the market together, officials said. To counter falling behind Mexico in price competitiveness due to NAFTA, the government plans to open group sales outlets by industry. It also plans to operate both wholesale and retail outlets in areas with large resident Korean populations, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, the officials said.
