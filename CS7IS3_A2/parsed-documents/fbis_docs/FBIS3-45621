However, the authorities will also take into consideration the political background of the relevant foreign companies, and those which attempt to impair the interests of our country will not be welcome. Li Ziliu noted at a public occasion in Macao that after China and France have resumed normal diplomatic relations, French companies can join the others in tendering for all construction projects in Guangzhou on the basis of mutual benefits and equality. However, French companies missed many opportunities during the initial stage of Guangzhou's subway construction. Now, they are mainly engaged in software projects. Li Ziliu added: Generally speaking, Guangzhou is mainly concerned with the real strength of the companies concerned when assessing their tenders. However, "if Sino-British relations continue to deteriorate, the economic interests of both sides will unavoidably suffer losses," he indicated.
