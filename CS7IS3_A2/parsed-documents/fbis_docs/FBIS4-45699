Attending a conference organised by Forum Europe on the theme of "the Greening of Eastern Europe," the Commissioner added "we cannot afford to let Central and Eastern Europe's environment slip down the European agenda." He said that EU standards and practices such as environmental impact assessment, as well as the polluter-pays principle "would have to be implemented step by step in the candidate countries." The Romanian Environment Minister Aurel Constantin Ilie was also attending the Forum Europe conference, and held talks with the Commissioner. He felt that for there to be any chance of Eastern Europe being "cleaned up" in the near future, the West would have to finance projects and give access to the necessary modern technologies.
