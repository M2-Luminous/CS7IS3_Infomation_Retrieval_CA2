According to his widow, the ex-president shot himself in western Georgia on December 31. Dzhordzhikia, senior assistant to Georgia's prosecutor general, told INTERFAX no evidence had been found to prove the reports that Gamsakhurdia had been wounded in Chechnya. Dzhordzhikia said two witnesses of Gamsakhurdia's death had been found. One of them is in Chechnya, but it has been impossible to contact him, for Gamsakhurdia's family, living in Groznyy, objects to this, Dzhordzhikia said. He said President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya had given a "good and friendly" reception to the Georgian investigators. The latter, who include staff from the Prosecutor General's Office and the Interior and Security Ministries, had an hour-and-a-half-long meeting with Dudayev, who promised them whatever help they might need, Dzhordzhikia said. The investigators also met Merab Kiknadze, a member of the former Georgian parliament, who said the Gamsakhurdia family objected to a post mortem. It is still unknown where the ex-president is buried, but the Tbilisi team has had a letter from his widow, Manana Gamsakhurdia, who, "on behalf of the whole family of the deceased president," asks for his body to be buried in Chechnya, "where his family has lived in exile for the past two years." She has made the same request to Dudayev.
