ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule sets forth the basic policies and procedures that govern the disposition of HUD-held multifamily project mortgages. 1 In general, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. However, the Department will not sell delinquent mortgages if foreclosure is unavoidable and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage. In addition, mortgages on subsidized properties will only be sold with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections; mortgages for unsubsidized projects may be sold without FHA insurance. 1 This rule and the policies contained in this rule are intended to satisfy HUD's obligations under the settlement agreement in Walker v. Kemp, No. C 87 2628 (N.D. Cal.), with regard to the Exhibit B mortgages. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this rule will be October 24, 1994, unless a subsequent notice announcing an earlier effective date is published in the Federal Register .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 13, 1994, the Department published a proposed rule on the sale of HUD-held multifamily mortgages (59 FR 17500). Two days earlier, on April 11, 1994, President Clinton approved the Multifamily Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;233) (Multifamily Property Disposition Act). Section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property Disposition Act revised section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1701z&hyph;11) (HCD Amendments of 1978). This final rule incorporates technical changes to section 203 of the HCD Amendments of 1978, as amended by section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property Disposition Act, as those provisions affect the sale of HUD-held mortgages. HUD will be publishing, shortly, an interim rule to implement the statutory amendments affecting the management and disposition of HUD-owned multifamily projects. Summary of Comments_Generally The Department received a total of 11 comments on this proposed rule. The majority of the comments dealt with features of the Department's planned mortgage sale program rather than with specifics of the proposed rule. However, two commenters made recommendations regarding the negotiated sale of subsidized mortgages to State and local governments, and one commenter recommended changes to the proposed rule. All of the comments are discussed in more detail below, and, when appropriate, are addressed in the text of the rule. Only the National Housing Law Project (NHLP) focused specifically upon the text of the proposed rule. The NHLP acknowledged HUD's authority to sell HUD-held mortgages, but urged that ``the utmost care should be taken to ensure that low-income tenants do not lose benefits to which they are entitled.'' With regard to the sale of subsidized mortgages with insurance, the NHLP stated that: ``The mere act of selling with insurance will not necessarily by itself satisfy the statutory goal of continuing the protections for each project that are at least as advantageous as the prior program's.'' The NHLP sought assurance that, at a minimum, the regulatory protections contained in, for example, the regulatory agreement, note, and program regulations also would apply.
