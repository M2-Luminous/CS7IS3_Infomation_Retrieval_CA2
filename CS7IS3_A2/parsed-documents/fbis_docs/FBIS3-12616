[Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq] Your question appears to concern media reports on clashes between some groups and the police under the name of (terrorism and combating terrorism). I would like to say first and very clearly: Events in Egypt cannot be called terrorism. Most of the incidents and attacks by groups on policemen are reaction. The incidents are either criminal ones that violate the law or acts of revenge. Revenge is well known in Upper Egypt. It is wrong to say that these incidents and their causes are terrorism. "I believe that this is very clear." [AL-WAFD] But aren't they attributed to religion? [Jad-al-Haqq] That is something else. If a thief steals and says (in the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful), what do we do with him? There is nothing we can do. But it is wrong to call this Islam or the Islamic groups and not say what it really is: This is a thief and this is a killer. Every incident must be identified for what it really is. Not everything need be attributed to an Islamic group, because Islam is innocent of these actions. Islam gives no one the right to exact punishment himself. It permits no one to steal, kill, or scare people. How can we affiliate those who do such things with Islam and say that these are Islamic groups? This is wrong. [AL-WAFD] But you might agree with me that there are particular ideas of which some people are convinced. Are their actions based on these ideas? [Jad-al-Haqq] This might be the case but the al-Azhar has called on these people to go to the clerics when they are in doubt about something. If these people do not go to the clerics and raise their ideas with them, how can we identify them? Let them be described by the crimes they have committed when they are tried. Their ideas will then become known and the clerics can debate them. [Al-WAFD] Your Eminence, remember how the military court that tried the killers of [former Awqaf minister] Shaykh al-Dhahabi in 1977 said the al-Azhar and its clerics failed to play their role and added that their absence from the arena was a reason for the religious vacuum. It saw the al-Azhar as responsible for the appearance and spread of terrorism. As in the past, the same words are reiterated very often these days, are they not? [Jad-al-Haqq] Without criticizing the ruling to which you referred, that was a judicial point of view. It wasn't fair in terms of the reality. Those who take their information from the media are slack in their duties. The media does not cover the al-Azhar and does not report the steps taken by it or the things it is doing. Preachers are all over the country, institutes' clerics are in all the villages and throughout the whole country, and everyone is performing his propagation duty. Where is the slackness? Al-Azhar's task is to give advice, not to carry weapons or chase the outlaws. This is the task of other quarters. If the al-Azhar's effort is not known to those who take their information from the media, then it is they who have fallen short in their knowledge. Al-Azhar has never been absent from the arena and it isn't now. [AL-WAFD] Does this mean that you don't agree there is a religious vacuum? [Jad-al-Haqq] The religious vacuum is in education, not in life in general. The clerics are doing their job everywhere. The real vacuum is in education, from the nursery school to the university. [AL-WAFD] Criticism addressed to al-Azhar in the past few years did not come from outside al-Azhar alone, but from its own scholars as well. [Jad-al-Haqq] Every man has his own way; not everyone upholds the same views. The clerics who accuse al-Azhar of slackness should ask themselves what they are offering. [AL-WAFD] We cannot overlook that the major extremist organization is led by an al-Azhar scholar, Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. [Jad-al-Haqq] God knows that al-Azhar is doing its duty, from the oldest shaykhs to the youngest student. But every man has his own beliefs and his approach to performing his duties. With all due respect for his person, Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman has his own beliefs and his approach, which is not approved by Islam. [AL-WAFD] What is your view of that approach? [Jad-al-Haqq] I have nothing to add to what I have already said. You said that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman criticizes al-Azhar although he is an al-Azhar graduate. I said satan disobeyed the orders of the lord. [AL-WAFD] In 1977, al-Azhar Grand Imam 'Abd-al-Halim Mahmud had to issue a statement, which was not published at the time, defending al-Azhar over accusations leveled by the state and Islamic groups. Do you think you need such a statement? [Jad-al-Haqq] No, we do not need it, because we promote the call and defend nobody. We advise all the people. Al-Azhar statements were issued at the right time. As I said, everyone has his way. [AL-WAFD] But the state and society are demanding that you play some role in fighting the growing Islamic violence. Do you think you have a role to play? [Jad-al-Haqq] The role of al-Azhar or propagation is to give advice. If the target population fails to respond, al-Azhar does not have the physical power to impose order. This is the job of the other apparatuses. [AL-WAFD] You have not been involved in the mediation attempts that some people are trying to undertake. Why? [Jad-al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not involve itself in everything that comes to people's minds. It is always useful to give the opportunity to other institutions that are involved in propagating Islam, such as the licensed associations. There is no harm if people intervene in this issue or if they offer to mediate in it. I have no information on the details. They offered mediation more than once and I don't know what has been done about it. [AL-WAFD] Do you think al-Azhar can play a role in patching up discord or in curbing the extent of the violence? [Jad al-Haqq] We can only rectify the discord if we know about it. Al-Azhar knows only one party to the conflict, namely, the government. But if the other party becomes known, then al-Azhar could intercede. We don't know them personally and we don't know their principles. This is because we read about them in the press only when events occur. [AL-WAFD] But haven't you received their writings (books and leaflets)? [Jad al-Haqq] Yes. We receive some of their ideas and books. We study them in a scientific way. But the names of their authors do not appear in the books. The books have no titles or addresses. They are merely books seized by the police. Then we are asked if the books contain sound ideas. We respond accordingly. [AL-WAFD] Don't you believe that the discussion of these ideas in the media would produce good results? [Jad al-Haqq] It would have been better for the media to keep away from the rumors and exaggeration of events. But the media, be they in Egypt or abroad, have failed to do so. Perhaps the media in Egypt have, regrettably, been affected by reports coming from abroad. [AL-WAFD] In the early eighties, you were one of those who supervised dialogue with the youths who are described as extremists. Now, after 10 years, do you believe the dialogue represents the ideal method? [Jad al-Haqq] Doubtless, prophets were not sent to the people by means of guns, but by the word, which calls for righteousness and peace, as well as by the call for dialogue. The Koran is full of dialogue between the prophets and their peoples and between Prophet Muhammad, God bless him and grant him salvation, and his people. The dialogue must come first. [AL-WAFD] Some people blame you, saying that instead of focusing on confronting the extremists, you are fighting others by confiscating their books. [Jad al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not confiscate books or ideas. It only prohibits those attacking religion. [AL-WAFD] Does al-Azhar have its chance to reply in the various media? [Jad al-Haqq] No. Al-Azhar has a limited framework that is not part of censorship. Al-Azhar authorizes the printing of the Koran and the prophet's sayings only. These can only be printed with the permission of al-Azhar. Al-Azhar revises the text of the prophet's sayings and authorizes the printing. Apart from that, al-Azhar does not interfere. Al-Azhar only examines that which comes from individuals, groups, or the state. Al-Azhar gives its opinion as an expert, not as a censor. [AL-WAFD] Many writings and official opinions in the West, particularly in the United States, started referring to the Muslim world as the new enemy and the substitute for Communism. What is your comment? [Jad al-Haqq] This is obvious. They mean what they say. This is evident in the United States and Europe's campaign against the Muslims and their issues. But particular spots in the Muslim world have enough problems, which prevent them from carrying out their humanitarian duties and developing and promoting their financial and economic resources. Thorns are being planted in the Muslim world.
