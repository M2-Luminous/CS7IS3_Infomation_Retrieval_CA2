Approximately 13,000 tonnes of this is war chemicals. The dumping continued until the end of 1947. In addition, the former East Germany dumped 200 tonnes of ammunition in the Baltic Sea during the 1950's. The Protection Commission is still awaiting more information from Russia about the destruction of chemical weapons. According to the report, known dumping sites in the Baltic Sea are situated on the southeastern side of Gotland [island off Sweden], on the eastern side of [the Danish island of] Bornholm, and in the Little Belt in the Danish Straits. The report urges the Protection Commission to issue general rules for fishermen in case chemical weapons get entangled in their catching equipment.
