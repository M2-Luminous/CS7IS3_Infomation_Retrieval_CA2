He said: "Just like accomplishing all other projects, we must strategically despise them but tactically take them seriously. So not only must we have the determination and confidence, but we must also have the capabilities and methods for accomplishing them." Li Ruihuan made the statement this morning while meeting at the Great Hall of the People with the delegation of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong headed by its president Herbert Liang. Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle was Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the interests of all Chinese people, including our countrymen in Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance. We will unswervingly implement this principle. Li Ruihuan urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely as possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens themselves." When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on its 60th founding anniversary and welcomed the association's friends on their visit to Beijing. He said: The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong is a business group with extensive influence. Over the years you have accomplished a great deal of work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and development, as well as in supporting China's reform, opening up, and modernization. Li Ruihuan urged the association's friends to continue to work hard to make new contributions to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. During the meeting, Li Ruihuan also answered the visitors' questions on how to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity during the transitional period. Also present at the meeting were Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and head of the CPC Central Committee United Front Department; Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Chen Ziying, vice chairman of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.
