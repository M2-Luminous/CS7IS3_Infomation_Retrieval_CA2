This draft bill has been languishing in national Congress drawers. The solution consists of dividing the Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc [Eletrobras] into two companies by separating what is a typical government function from what can be exploited by the private sector. A provisional measure accompanied by a report on the reasons for this proposal -- which was signed by Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko, Planning Minister Beni Veras, and former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- has been under study at the Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat. The idea is to send this proposal and the studies, as soon as possible, to the presidency of the Republic, which will then send them to the national Congress. The proposal to divide Eletrobras into two enterprises -- Eletrobras Participacoes (Eletropart) and Eletrobras -- resulted from studies made by the Eletrobras technical team, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, and the Mines and Energy Ministry. The objective of these studies was to privatize the field of electrical energy, which yields an overall $15 billion per year. Half of this amount is produced by the companies owned by the federal government. Eletropart would have control over the shares of Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company, Southern Electric Power Plants, and Northern Electric Power Plants, and would be able to open its capital and sell the shares of these companies at the stock market of [unfinished sentence as published]. This proposal changes the government concept of privatization only through the sale of physical assets. According to government sources, this system would represent a sort of "socialization of capital" of the federal state-owned companies in the electrical energy field. The provisional measure that would make this possible establishes that all Eletrobras areas that have functions typical of those performed by the government will remain with the company that will retain this name. Such will be the case of the Electrical Energy Research Center, the planning and coordination areas, the nuclear energy enterprises, and the Itaipu Binational Enterprise. Eletrobras would continue to manage two companies that are already in the privatization list: the Light and Power Company and Escelsa (Espirito Santo State). According to official sources, the current text of the proposed provisional measure would receive a favorable report from jurist Fabio Konder Comparato. It has still not been sent to the presidency of the Republic because of the recent installation of a new finance minister. As a result, the Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat is late in examining this new privatization model. Another contribution this model could bring to the privatization of the federal state-owned companies in the electrical energy field would be to make biddings unnecessary. The draft bill on franchising for the exploitation of the energy field by private sector companies makes biddings mandatory. Privatization through the sale of shares and the system of share control would not alter the franchise contracts. The privatization program has been dragging on, and the companies producing electrical energy represent nowadays the most attractive companies in the hands of the federal government unless constitutional monopolies become more flexible. The government has been keeping this provisional measure secret, at least for the time being, so as not to have to face corporatist reactions from employees of the electrical energy producing companies. Official sources believe that this proposal is, therefore, an effort to preserve the field and to create the required conditions to finish construction work that has been paralyzed for lack of resources.
