Three hours before the closure of voting centers at 1700 (2300 GMT), the minister pointed out that there is absolute normalcy nationwide and added that voter turnout appears to be low. Ortiz, as well as the magistrates of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), attributed the apparent abstentionism to citizens fearful of possible explosions and bomb threats, of which there were dozens in the past weeks. The police reported that a grenade, which did not explode, was found today inside an abandoned car in the capital. It is not known when it was planted there. The police attributed the explosions to the guerrillas who urged the people to abstain and boycott the referendum. Ortiz said that the police assigned to voting centers are protecting 3.4 million citizens, more than a third of the population. The Army, which stays away from voting centers, has also guaranteed security along highways and at bridges and towns, but men in uniform are virtually absent in the capital. Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna also reported absolute normalcy during the referendum that will approve or reject 43 reforms to the Constitution. Among other things, they would allow legislative elections within three months and the replacement of members of the Supreme Court of Justice. TSE Magistrate Marco Guerra told ACAN-EFE that terrorist actions promoted abstentionism, which could reach 50 percent, according to Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger.
