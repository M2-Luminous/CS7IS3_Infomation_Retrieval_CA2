According to the Haitian Press Agency correspondent in Upper Artibonite, most of the youths seen at the time ran away when strangers came. According to rare testimonies collected on the spot, the bodies of those killed on 22 April while trying to escape by sea continue to surface, increasing the total number of dead, which had been assessed at over 23 on 25 April. According to the same witnesses, the body of a well known local soccer player is reputed to have been among those buried by the military. By the way, according to the Interpress Agency, Bouter Mtayer, brother of Arnault Mtayer, who was also known as "The Cuban," and whose pursuit by the Army was the origin of the slaughter, was spotted by the military in the area of Sedren, 5 km from Gonaives, and has been reported missing since then. Observers note that apart from a communique issued by the resigning government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, condemning the Raboteau slaughter, none of the political class -- except for Aristide's spokesman -- has reacted to this situation so far. In its communique published on the night of 26 April, the Army talked about a police operation carried out in Raboteau to find the individuals who authored reprehensible actions committed throughout the country, which according to the Haitian Armed Forces is a destabilization plan conceived in Washington by the legitimate Haitian authorities. President Aristide's spokesman has denied this.
