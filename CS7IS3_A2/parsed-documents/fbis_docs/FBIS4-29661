After a battle lasting an hour, we fully controlled this district township. Fifteen of the invading troops of the puppets of communist Vietnam were killed and eight others wounded. Ten army shelters and three district office buildings were destroyed. We seized eight AK rifles, three AR-15's, and three (BH) mines. At the same time, 20 soldiers of the puppets of communist Vietnam and 11 officials serving the communist Vietnam's puppets surrendered and joined the people and the NADK. They said that they will stop serving the communist Vietnamese, who are continuing to attack and kill the nation. These compatriots asked to join forces with the people and the NADK to fight the military and civilian state authorities of the puppets of communist Vietnam to quickly destroy them so that there will be peace, without anyone forcing the compatriots to fight. However, the people and the NADK suggested that these compatriots return home and join forces with the people in their localities to fight the warmongers in their dens. This way there will be no one to force the compatriots to fight and die, leaving their families behind, and there will be no one to force compatriots to round up the people's relatives to serve as soldiers --- an act which makes the people angry and causes them to loath and hurl insults at these compatriots.
