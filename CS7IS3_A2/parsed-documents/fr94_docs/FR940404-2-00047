FR940404-2-00047 FR940404-2-00034 Conclusion It is therefore ordered that: (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Asko [Case No. CW&hyph;002] is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4) and (5). (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of section 430.22 or Appendix J of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Asko shall be permitted to test its washing machines, models 10504, 12004, and 20004 with the modification set forth below: (i) Add new §§1.19 and 1.20 in appendix J to read as follows: 1.19␣ ``Water-heating clothes washer'' means a clothes washer that has an internal electrical heater which provides all the energy needed to heat water for washing. 1.20␣ ``Non-water-heating clothes washer'' means a clothes washer that does not have an internal electrical heater which provides the energy needed to heat water for washing. (ii) Sections 2.2 and 2.3 in appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 2.2␣ Electrical energy supply. Maintain the electrical supply to the clothes washer terminal block within 1.7 percent of 120/208Y or 120/240 volts as applicable to the particular terminal block wiring system as specified by the manufacturer. If the clothes washer has a dual voltage conversion capability, conduct the test at the highest voltage recommended by the manufacturer. 2.3␣ Water temperature. 2.3.1␣ Water-heating clothes washers. The temperature of the water supply shall be maintained at a minimum of 55 ○F (12.8 ○C) and a maximum of 60 ○F (15.6 ○C). (iii) Sections 3.2.1 through 3.3.5 in Appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 3.2.1␣ Per-cycle electrical energy consumption at maximum fill. Set the water level selector to the maximum fill position, if manually controlled. 3.2.1.1␣ Hottest wash at maximum fill. Activate the machine and insert the appropriate test load as specified in section 2.8.2.1. Select the normal or its equivalent wash cycle. Where spin speed selection is available, set the control to its maximum setting. Set the water temperature selector to the hottest setting and activate the wash cycle. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E ht,max . 3.2.1.2␣ Hot wash at maximum fill. Insert a water temperature sensing device inside the inner drum prior to testing. Activate the machine and insert the appropriate test load as specified in section 2.8.2.1. Select the normal or its equivalent wash cycle. Where spin speed selection is available, set the control to its maximum setting. Set the water temperature selector to the hot setting (a minimum of 140 ○F (60 ○C) and a maximum of 145 ○F (62.8 ○C)) and activate the wash cycle. Verify the wash water temperature, which must be at a minimum of 140 ○F (60 ○C) and a maximum of 145 ○F (62.8 ○C). If the measured water temperature is not within the specified range, stop testing, adjust the temperature selector accordingly and repeat the procedure. Otherwise, proceed and complete testing. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E h,max . 3.2.1.3␣ Warm wash at maximum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.2 for a warm wash setting at a minimum of 100 ○F (37.8 ○C) and a maximum of 105 ○F (40.6 ○C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E w,max . 3.2.1.4␣ Cold wash at maximum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.1 for the coldest water setting. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E c,max . Ensure that the inlet water temperature is maintained per section 2.3.1. 3.2.2␣ Per-cycle electrical energy consumption at minimum fill. Set the water level selector to the minimum fill position, if manually controlled.
