Experts at the Consultation Committee of the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) warned that although cholera and typhoid situations in China have stabilized somewhat in recent two years, yet poor sanitary conditions, low living standards, and floating population in South China may trigger outbreaks in that area. MPH urges all concerned epidemic disease prevention departments to closely monitor trends of the epidemic, and implement quarantine on floating population.
