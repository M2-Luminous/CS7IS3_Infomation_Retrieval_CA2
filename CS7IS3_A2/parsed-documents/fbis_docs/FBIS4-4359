Why hasn't the government said anything about this? [Trinh] The government has read those articles and is paying attention to this. But because this is an historical and scientific problem, we must study the matter and get the views of more scientists. That is why the government has not yet responded to this. [Reporter for Vietnam TV] How will major cases of corruption be handled? We welcome the fact that the government has "allowed" Vietnam TV's leadership board to "retire." But why did it take so long to deal with the negative acts of these people? [Trinh] Corruption has been dealt with too slowly as compared with the needs and hopes of the masses. The premier, too, is unhappy about this. But the government is not the only one involved in handling a case. This must be coordinated with the organs of control and the courts. Unfortunately, this coordination has long been sluggish. There has been corruption at Vietnam TV for a long time. Actually, it would have been better if we had dealt with those things sooner. But in dealing with cadres at that level and with such an important sector, we have to get the ideas of the Politburo and the Secretariat. [Reporter for TUOI TRE] The public recognizes that the government is resolved to fight corruption and smuggling, but in order to do this, does the government have any new measures? Recently, a number of vice ministers and chairmen of provincial people's committees acted contrary to a number of the premier's policies, including the smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and the smuggling of "Po-mu" timber in Nghe An. Why hasn't the premier dismissed or suspended those cadres involved in this based on the authority given him by the government organization law? Has he failed to carry out his responsibilities fully or has he been unable to carry our his responsibilities? [Trinh] Having effective measures is something that the premier is very concerned about. First of all, the government will implement a new organizational measures: An anti-corruption committee headed by a minister will be established. Although a special state anti-corruption commission will not be established, the government and the Standing Committee of the National Assembly are united, and each month the Standing Committee of the National Assembly will hear reports on the situation in fighting corruption in order to provide guidance to the organs of control and courts. Also, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly is requiring that the committees of the National Assembly regard fighting corruption as one of their tasks in order to monitor this regularly. The Politburo, too, agrees that if a case involving a provincial chairman, minister, vice minister, or cadre subordinate to a management echelon of the Politburo arises, the anti-corruption leadership collective (the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, the Ministry of Interior, the organs of control, and the courts) have the right to take whatever steps are necessary in accord with the law and then report this to the Politburo. Last year, a number of the cases that occurred, such as the smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and the smuggling of Po-mu timber in Nghe An, should have been dealt with immediately. But under the old mechanism, the views of others had to be obtained first and so things were done slowly and this affected the situation in fighting corruption. But in any event, these cases have now been dealt with. [TUOI TRE] On what basis will the 1994 administrative reforms be made? [Trinh] Administrative reform is an urgent task. This will be carried on based on clearly determining the responsibilities of the legislative, administrative, and judicial organizations. In our country, the responsibilities of the legislative, administrative, and judicial organizations still overlap. The responsibilities of the central and local organizations must be clearly determined, and there must be a clear distinction between the responsibilities of the state management organizations and those of the commercial production organizations. The administrative apparatus must be reorganized to make it smaller but stronger. Most countries have only 12-13 ministries, but we now have 30 ministries and equivalent-level organizations and 30 other organizations. Thus, it's as if there are 60 ministries directly subordinate to the government that have dispersed administrative powers. Along with this, we must build a standardized system of civil servants having clear rights and responsibilities. The government has guided the committee handling this work. This committee is receiving help from the United Nations. [TUOI TRE] As you have admitted, in Vietnam there is still much confusion regarding the responsibilities of the administrative, legislative, and judicial organizations. Actually, there are also many unstable power relationships between the premier and local leaders. In view of this, does the government's reform program contain any proposals for revising a number of the articles in the constitution and government organization law? [Trinh] In implementing things, a number of problems have arisen. For example, the government organization law stipulates that the ministry is to control the commercial units. But we now realize that agricultural management must be separated from commercial production management and that the concept of a management ministry must be abandoned. Thus, we must experiment and revise the laws. Administrative reform is related to the problem of organizing local administration. For example, should there be precinct- and district-level people's councils? Issues such as transferring and dismissing chairmen of provincial and municipal people's committees touch on the constitution, but these issues are being studied. [Hong Phuong, deputy secretary of the Municipal Reporters Association] Recently, delineating and disbanding things have become issues nationwide. Why isn't there a unified policy for the entire country? [Trinh] That is a major concern of ours. The government has discussed this and agrees that the most effective measure is to implement a policy of paying adequate compensation to the people. There will be a number of foreign investment projects, and much compensation will be paid to the people. This morning, at a government meeting, Vice Premier Phan Van Khai said that there have been cases in which the compensation paid to the people has been reduced. The government is requiring that the localities and sectors refrain from reducing the compensation of these people. [TUOI TRE] The constitution has stipulations on buying assets of the people. Why hasn't the government submitted a purchase law instead of continuing to use that disbanding and compensation form, which is not unified? [Trinh] To date, no organization has submitted a draft purchase law. In my view, the constitution stipulates this and so there must be a law to provide guidance. [Trinh ends] Minister Le Xuan Trinh also said that the premier is very concerned about other issues raised in the press. TUOI TRE, THANH NIEN, LAO DONG, and PHU NU have published stories about a number of negative cases and losses at various corporations such as Liksin, the Ben Thanh Tobacco Corporation, and the Hung Vuong Refrigeration Corporation. The premier is directly guiding the Municipal People's Committee which is reporting on and dealing with these cases. In particular, the premier is very interested in the series of stories on the customs office that have appeared in TUOI TRE. The premier has ordered that the customs office be reorganized. Minister Le Xuan Trinh also criticized a number of newspapers that have published inaccurate stories. Some newspapers have published corrections, but others have not yet done so.
