Explaining the reason why the world began to have a new understanding of China in 1993, Premier Li said the fundamental reason lies in the fact that guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has scored great progress in reform, opening up and economic development. Only a few years ago, amidst the drastic changes in eastern Europe and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, some people abroad spread the idea that China would collapse. "Facts have shown that China, instead of collapsing, has developed and grown in strength," Li noted. "Some economists, critics and statesmen in the world have made more optimistic estimation and prediction than we do with regard to China's economic strength and prospect of development," Li said. "though not tallying with the realities, this reflects the world's acknowledgement of China's achievements from one perspective." A full set of Deng's theories on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has not only taken shape, but also displayed great power in practice, Li said. "The third generation of Chinese leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the core, has not only been established, but has been maturing as well." "Thus, our modernization drive is blessed with organizational guarantee as well as a theoretical basis," Li said. "Today, we are more confident than ever about the future of China." However, he pointed out that some people are spreading a theory that a powerful China would constitute a threat, with the purpose of sowing dissension between China and its neighbors, and thus to spoil China's good surrounding environment. "From the theory of collapse to the theory of threat, this is indeed a 180-degree turn and is really hard to understand," Li said. "These two ideas, which both go to extremes, show total ignorance of China's realities." A developing and more powerful China will not threaten any country, Li said. "Instead, it will only make greater contribution to world peace and development." As for how to view possible differences between the central government and localities and the imbalanced development between different parts of the country, Li said: "The socialist market economy we are going to build up is a unified market." Though the gap between China's eastern and western parts has expanded, the western part has been developing and the people's life there has been improved, Li said, adding that imbalance of development is a universal phenomenon in the world. "The party and government are fully aware of this problem and taking measures to solve it. "It is understandable if some people, out of goodwill, worry that contradictions might arise from the imbalanced development between different regions and some reform measures that affect some local interests," Li said. "If some hostile people expected or even predicted that the gap between China's eastern and western parts would lead to a split in the country, hoping to see problems occur inside China, they are doomed to be disappointed," he said.
