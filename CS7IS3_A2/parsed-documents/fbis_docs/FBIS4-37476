In a statement to the Kuwaiti news agency he said: Military cooperation between France and Kuwait goes a long time back, we now have teams working on helicopters and aircraft. We are also in the process of discussing joint projects in connection with other aspects of the armed forces. He added that he had discussed with Kuwaiti officials a project on patrol boats. These boats are being manufactured by a French company that supplies the French Armed Forces with boats. Oman also has purchased a number of boats from this company. The French admiral, who is on a two-day visit to Kuwait said that France is concerned with the security of the Gulf region. Admiral Lanxade said: France clearly supports the need for Iraq to implement all the UN Security Council resolutions and recognize Kuwait's sovereignty. He went on to say that he had told Kuwaiti officials France could supply Kuwait with radar equipment and air defense rockets. France is making considerable efforts in the field of defense because we realize that the world is currently unstable and we have a role to play as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said. Admiral Lanxade added: We have elements working now in Saudi Arabia and Turkey to follow up the monitoring of Iraqi air space and we took part in the embargo on the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah. He said that the current exercises between the Kuwaitis and the French are aimed at stressing that there is military cooperation between the two countries. Admiral Lanxade said: These exercises are a message to the neighborhood and are a means of developing the operational aspects of relations between our forces. They are also a means that would enable us to work together if the need rises. [passage omitted] Lanxade stressed: The importance of the military deals between France and Kuwait are not of mere commercial importance. In fact the existence of a joint project between the Armed Forces of the two countries provides a real opportunity for joint operations, an element that is more important than the commercial interests. Regarding the situation in Yemen he said: We believe the situation is serious in Yemen and wish for the hostilities to be stopped. He added that the French naval forces had evacuated a number of people out of Yemen including foreign nationals more than French citizens. The Yemeni issue is serious because it affects the security of the Arab peninsular, he said. Lanxade said that France had 10 warships opposite Djibouti, about 4,000 French troops stationed there, forces in the south of the Indian Ocean, and 150 soldiers of the French Air Force in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
