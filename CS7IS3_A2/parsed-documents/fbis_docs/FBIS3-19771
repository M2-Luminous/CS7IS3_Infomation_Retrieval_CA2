Speaking with the press after his meeting with General George Joulwan, commander of Atlantic alliance forces in Europe, the Italian minister said that, until now, no request has been made for the deployment of Italian troops in Bosnia and, were this to occur in the future, the decision would be up to the Italian Government and parliament. Nevertheless, Fabbri did state that "in the future, I think that, with a peace agreement signed by all sides and in the framework of a NATO operation to ensure its application, the possible use of the Italian military would be, in effect, plausible." During today's meeting, Fabbri said General Joulwan voiced the gratitude of the Atlantic alliance for the "extraordinary" support for operations in the former Yugoslavia.
