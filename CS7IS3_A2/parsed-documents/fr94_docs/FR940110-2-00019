FR940110-2-00019 FR940110-2-00011 Petitioners argue that these facts, in addition to other proprietary information, indicate Toyota assumed negative U.S. value-added expenses on any sale for which the cost of the options removed from the forklift by TIE exceeded the cost of options installed by TIE. Petitioners contend that Toyota incurs actual expenses to operate its value-added facilities and to perform switching operations. They state that, for example, removing the forks from an imported forklift results in an actual expense rather than a negative expense to TIE. Petitioners request that the Department correct the negative costs and expenses reported by Toyota for net selling price proxy 3 by using the absolute values of the negative amounts reported by Toyota. Toyota contends that petitioners misinterpreted Toyota's value-added calculation. Toyota explains that labor and overhead are always positive; however, if the value-added materials are negative and are added to labor and overhead, the value-added will be increased, but remain negative. Department's Position: We agree with Toyota. While the reported amount for value-added and switching operations is negative, Toyota accounted for its expenses of labor and overhead in its calculation. For further discussion of respondents' further processing operations and the potential for negative value-added, refer to the discussion of TCM's further processing in Comment 20 below. Comment 17: Petitioners argue that Toyota's claimed credit revenue for its U.S. sales should be rejected because the credit revenue for certain sales is actually earned on sales by unrelated dealers to end-user customers and not on the sale from Toyota to the unrelated dealer. Petitioners state that Toyota sells forklifts in the United States to unrelated dealers and that the first unrelated sale is the sale from Toyota to the dealer. Petitioners contend that the purpose of this review, as stated in the questionnaire, is to examine sales by Toyota to the first unrelated customer. Petitioners argue that credit revenue earned on sales from the unrelated dealer to the end-user, which are financed through TMCC, is therefore irrelevant to this review, because the financing arranged by TMCC is a separate transaction from the sale of the forklift. Toyota argues that TMCC retains both the title to, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) interest in, the forklift until TMCC receives payment from either the dealer or end-user. Toyota contends that a shift in the credit transaction from the dealer to the end-user is no more than a shift in the source of payment. In both cases, TMCC retains ownership and the UCC interest in the forklift. Because Toyota retains a direct relationship with the dealer or end-user, the credit revenue is directly related to the sale of the forklift, and therefore, the credit transaction should be adjusted for. Toyota further contends that its ability to sell forklifts is contingent upon its ability to encourage end-users to buy forklifts. Toyota notes, for example, that the Department considers its subsidies of yellow page advertisements for dealers a direct selling expense. Toyota's provision of favorable financing to end-users similarly is intended to encourage end-user sales, which in turn create sales to dealers. Toyota concludes by noting that it would be unfair and illogical to account for TMCC's credit expense and not its revenue. Department's Position: In accordance with section 353.41 of the Department's regulations, we used the price to the first unrelated purchaser in the United States as the basis of U.S. price. Toyota's USP was based on the price TMS/TIE charged its unrelated dealers. Therefore, we consider revenue generated as a result of the sale by the dealer to the end-user through a financing arrangement a separate transaction, and as such, not directly associated with the sales under review, as claimed by Toyota. This credit arrangement is unlike Toyota's subsidy for yellow pages advertisements, which is properly treated as a direct selling expense. That TMCC retains both the title to, and the UCC interest in, the financed forklift until TMCC receives the final payment from the end-user has no bearing on the calculation of USP. Finally, we note that, contrary to Toyota's assertion, we are not accounting for TMCC's credit expense. We therefore disallowed the claimed adjustment for credit revenue for the sales financed by the end-user. Comment 18: Petitioners contend that the Department should not have deducted Toyota's HM advertising costs as a direct selling expense for PP comparisons. Petitioners contend that the Department should follow its practice in the first review and treat these expenses as ISE. Toyota does not believe that the Department applied the correct legal test for determining whether these advertising expenses are direct or indirect. Toyota submits that these expenses, incurred on behalf of Toyota's customers, are direct and should therefore be deducted from FMV in PP comparisons. Department's Position: We agree with petitioners. These advertising expenses are indirect because they are not directed at Toyota's customer's customer. In the first administrative review, we determined that these advertising expenses were indirect selling expenses. See Forklifts I, Comment 18. The data submitted in this proceeding is very similar to that submitted and disproved during verification in the previous administrative review. We have no compelling evidence on the record in this proceeding which indicates that the situation is any different from that found previously. We have therefore continued to treat these HM expenses as ISE and have not deducted them from FMV in PP comparisons. Comment 19: Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to support adequately its claim concerning credit expenses incurred by Toyota on PP sales. Petitioners state that, for reasons based on proprietary information, the claimed method of payment used with respect to these sales is incorrect. Petitioners assert that, accordingly, the Department should use BIA with respect to this expense for the final results. According to petitioners, the Department should also consider associated bank charges in determining this BIA. Petitioners state that bank charges should be among several elements considered in this BIA. Petitioners provide a calculation, using data from Toyota's ESP response, of the average time between the date the forklifts were exported from Japan and the date the forklifts were imported into the United States. Petitioners contend that this calculation represents the best method for imputing Toyota's credit expense for PP sales. Toyota asserts that, because of the immediate payment term on PP sales, there is no credit expense, as concluded by the Department in Forklifts LTFV and Forklifts I, which included two verifications. Toyota states that the Department should not change its practice in this administrative review.
