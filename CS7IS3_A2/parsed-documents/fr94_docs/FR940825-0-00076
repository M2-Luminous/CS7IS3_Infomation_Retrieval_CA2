For the hearing impaired only: TDD, (202) 690&hyph;6415. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Purpose of the Interim Rule Since it was first issued in 1976, HHS has applied the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 in making awards to institutions of higher education, hospitals and other non-profit organizations through its regulations at 45 CFR part 74. Except for a minor change made in 1987, the provisions of Circular A&hyph;110 remained intact until OMB published a comprehensive revision on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). OMB and other executive agencies, including HHS, have expended considerable effort over the years to produce an updated Circular. In 1987, OMB organized an interagency task force to review the Circular with a view toward its revision based on recommendations solicited from affected organizations such as universities and other non-profit groups. The work of that task force resulted in the publication of a notice of a proposed common rule that would have combined Circular A&hyph;110 with OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Agreements with State and Local Governments.'' (53 FR 44716 (Nov. 4, 1988)). The public response led to a decision to abandon further efforts to bring that proposal to final rulemaking. In November 1990, OMB established another interagency task force with the same assignment_to revise Circular A&hyph;110. The task force developed a proposed revision of the Circular, which OMB published with a request for comments on August 27, 1992 (57 FR 39018). After considering the over 200 comments from a wide variety of federal and non-federal respondents, OMB published the final revised Circular in the Federal Register on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). OMB Circular A&hyph;110 sets forth government-wide standards governing Federal agency administration of grants and other agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals and other non-profit organizations. Federal agencies must apply the provisions of the Circular in making awards to the covered entities; all primary recipients (including governments) of Federal awards must also apply the Circular's provisions to any subawards they make to such entities. Those provisions that affect Federal agencies were effective on December 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992&hyph;93). With respect to the Circular's application to recipients of Federal agency awards, OMB's notice directed each affected agency to promulgate its own rules adopting the provisions of the Circular (58 FR 62992&hyph;93).
