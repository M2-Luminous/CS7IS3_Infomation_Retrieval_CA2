Communists Striving To Join This Group"] [Text] The elections on 27 March have once again confirmed that Galicia is distinct even from its neighboring Western Ukrainian oblasts. While voters in Zakarpattya, Bukovyna [Chernivtsi Oblast], and Volyn, elected only one deputy in each of these oblasts in the first round, and not a single deputy was elected in Rivne Oblast, Lviv [Lvov] Oblast has already elected nine deputies in 23 districts, Ternopil Oblast -- four in 10 districts, and Ivano-Frankivsk -- a total of six in 12 districts. However, there are differences between these three oblasts as well. In Forecarpathia [Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], a conclusive victory over Rukh members has been scored by the "Volkovetskyy team" -- a group of prominent Kiev "Vikings" (V. Pylypchuk, V. Mulyava, P. Movchan, Ye. Pronyuk), invited to run here by the chairman of the oblast council of people's deputies [Stepan Volkovetskyy] (who has long been battling the local supporters of [Vyacheslav] Chornovil, entrenched in the oblast state administration). They were joined by Stepan Volkovetskyy himself and the leader of the local Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN]. On the other hand, in Ternopil Oblast, each of four parties (Rukh, Ukrainian Republican Party [URP], KUN, and the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA]) have so far won one seat each. The situation in Lviv Oblast is somewhat more complicated. So far (as anticipated), those forces that put their stakes on well-known public figures have been most successful -- namely, Rukh and the New Wave [Nova khvylya] Union. Outright victories were scored by the well-known deputies and Rukh members Les Tanyuk and Yaroslav Kendzyor, Viktor Pynzenyk from the New Wave Union, and Mykhaylo Kosiv and Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who cooperated with both political currents. Also in this group are Stepan Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP], who won overwhelmingly over his long-time opponent, Mykhaylo Horyn, head of the URP, as is Ivan Bilas, member of KUN and a well-known military historian. The exception here was an independent candidate -- Yevhen Zherebetskyy, an associate of the Academy's Institute of Ukrainian Studies, who was one of the founders of the Lviv organization of Rukh in 1989 and then lay very low in political terms for the next five years (colleagues new to this job asked this author in amazement "Who is this man?"). Another event that created a sensation was the lightning-quick victory of Ihor Koliushko, a young politician from the New Wave Union (who was also active five years ago). However, there were losses even among the leaders. Left behind in the first round were the New Wave's Ihor Hryniv, heretofore a people's deputy, and several other of this union's favorites. The Lviv organization of Rukh lost its leader, Yuriy Klyuchkovskyy; Lyubomyra Boychyshyn of recent fame; the young and promising politician, Ihor Derzhko; yet another of its celebrities, Volodymyr Chernyak (the latter ran in Lviv Oblast against the will of the regional organization of Rukh); and a few other candidates. KUN lost General Oleksandr Rol. Still, the "New Wave" can take comfort in the fact that People's Deputy Taras Steckiv made it to the second round, running ahead of his rival (33.9% as against 18.7%), People's Deputy Iryna Kalynets. Rukh can count on victories by People's Deputy Dmytro Chobit, deputy Rukh chairman Oleksandr Lavrynovych, and two more of its candidates. Running in the second round from KUN will be Serhiy Zhyzhko, head of the KUN secretariat, and five of his comrades-in-arms. Among those continuing to battle it out in the electoral marathon are people's deputies of Ukraine Larysa Skoryk (All-Ukrainian Rukh [VNRU] and Orest Vlokh (DemPU). Meanwhile, their independent parliamentary colleagues, Ivan Makar and Ihor Derkach, have left the race. The URP also finds itself among the outsiders. After the defeat of its all- Ukrainian leader, its main hope lies with the economist Oleksandr Shandryuk, who fell short of outright victory in the first round in Lviv's Shevchenkivskyy electoral district by a mere 0.37%. This district serves as a perfect example of what the fragmentation of democratic forces leads to: Due to the large number of democratic candidates (which included many well-known figures), the electorate split the vote to such a degree that the Communist Oleksandr Holub was able to make it to the second round with a paltry (but guaranteed) number of votes (7.7%), while a Republican was unable to gain an outright victory in the first round. In addition to Shandryuk, those still in the fight include Oleh Pavlyshyn, head of the oblast organization of the URP, and two other members of this party. The UNA has good chances in Lviv Oblast. In his district, Oleh Vitovych, the regional commander of the Ukrainian National Self-Defense Force [UNSO], is leading (38.5% versus 24.5%) against Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast council of people's deputies, while Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of the same team, is leading against Zoreslava Romovska, a law professor (48.9% against 11.3%). In contrast, even the name of his legendary father, the commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army [UPA], did not help Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the UNA, in the elections. Presumably, voters were stopped by the candidate's age and poor health. Andriy Shkil, a young and promising politician known for his eloquence, who heads the oblast committee of the UNA, could have won in many districts of Lviv Oblast, but not in the Pivdennyi district, where he ran against the unrivaled Viktor Pynzenyk. But, based on the results of the first round in Ternopil Oblast, the UNA can count on at least three seats. The electoral campaign of the other ultra-right party -- the Social- Nationalist Party of Ukraine [SNPU] -- produced almost zero results. It is unseemly to count other people's money, but judging by the number of leaflets bearing a symbol resembling a swastika (to be sure, the SNPU claims that the symbol represents a combination of the letters "I" and "N" -- "national idea," the number of huge yellow banners bearing the same symbol that covered Lviv's most important buildings, and the number of evening hours bought on the local television program "Mist," one can imagine how much money was spent on the campaign by the Social-Nationalists. Nevertheless, not a single one of the SNPU's 21 candidates (including its leaders) made it to the second round -- apparently their unusual emblem, black shirts, and their name, which evokes certain associations, made a different impression on the voters than what the SNPU expected. All that the Social-Nationalists are left with is taking comfort in the victory of their ally, S. Khmara, and the hope that their other ally, Iryna Kalynets, wins.
