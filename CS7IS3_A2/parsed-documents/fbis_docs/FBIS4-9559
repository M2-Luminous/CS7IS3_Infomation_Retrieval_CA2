Here is a report by Zdenko Vranjes: [Vranjes] The delegation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna has already been to Sarajevo three times and they were also willing to reach a compromise in order for a political agreement on the nationality of the president, vice president and prime minister of the federation to be reached. Despite the fact that the deadline for the election of the leaders of the federation is drawing to an end -- according to the constitution, the assembly should reach a decision on this by 30 April at the latest -- the Bosniak side, in the talks hitherto, has shown absolute disinterest and a lack of readiness to discuss this. The Bosniak side, furthermore, has also failed to fulfil the obligations it took on with the agreement between the government of Herzeg-Bosna and the government in Sarajevo. In addition to this assessment, the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna also concluded that the Croatian representatives and the authorities of Herzeg-Bosna -- if the Bosniak side does not soon fulfill its obligations and fails to come up with an initiative for political agreements -- will interpret this as its unwillingness to implement the Washington agreement consistently and will propose measures within its competence which, in this situation would protect Croatian interests. This conclusion could even have been sharper in view of the fact that several examples were cited which indicate that the Bosniak side has not taken the provisions of the Washington agreement sufficiently seriously and responsibly. Both in Sarajevo and in Mostar there are all too many public statements which show that the Bosniak side has not halted the media war, but is even intensifying it. The Bosniak members of the commission for development are not coming to meetings because they are refusing to answer the question of where are the 26 Croats, whom Muslim soldiers took away from their prison in Bugojno and led off in an unknown direction. Bosniak representatives are not only not giving proof of their interest in implementing the constitution of the federation, but want to conduct all talks on the basis of old relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not on the basis of the declared constitution of the federation, it was said at the session of the Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council which is still going on in Mostar.
