He held a meeting with the participation of presidium members of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and the leadership of the secretariat. They decided to hold on 12 January a joint meeting of the Supreme Council standing commissions. As Matviyenko noted, the urgent convening of the meeting is connected with the Kravchuk and Clinton meeting and in particular with the possibility of signing, on 14 January in Moscow, a document on issues of disarmament. Since, in the opinion of some deputies, the signing of such a document by Kravchuk is a direct violation of current legislation and Ukraine's Constitution and contradicts many points of the conditions to the ratification of the START Treaty of 18 November, Ukraine's Supreme Council should draw up a single position on these issues.
