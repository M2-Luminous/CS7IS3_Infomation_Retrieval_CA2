About 2,000 students of the Federal University of Technology in Akure chanted slogans calling for an immediate end to military rule and installation of Chief Moshood Abiola, who recently proclaimed himself president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Nigeria, the reports said. The stone-throwing students barricaded the way to the convocation hall and prevented the state military administrator, Colonel Mike Torey, from leaving the hall until he addressed their demands, the reports said. The students smashed the windscreen of his official car and wrote Abiola's name on the sides of the vehicle. Torey, who came to represent President Sani Abacha at a convocation ceremony, later addressed the students, promising that the government would address the issue of last June's annulled presidential election during a constitutional conference scheduled to begin June 27 in Abuja. That election, claimed to have been won by Abiola, was annulled by the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for alleged irregularities.
