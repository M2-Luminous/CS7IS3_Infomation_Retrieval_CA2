The request was due to the fact that this year the term of the agreement whereby the Ostankino TV Company covered the costs of beaming its programs to Lithuania has run out. As of April, Channel I programs were to be broadcast free of charge only up to the borders. In Lithuania, where Russian speakers constitute less than 20 percent, Ostankino's rating is substantially higher than of other TV companies, including state TV. Therefore Lithuanian Radio and TV Company executives decided to conduct a survey to make sure whether it is worth asking the government to allocate funds from its scarce budget to pay for Ostankino programs. In spite of the fact that this appeal to viewers came on the eve of a holiday -- the Catholic Easter -- the Radio and TV Committee was showered with letters. According to Committee Board Chairman Gedeminas Ilgunas, 90 percent of correspondents -- predominantly Lithuanians -- spoke in favor of keeping the Ostankino channel. The Lithuanian Radio and TV directors considered this sufficient grounds for forwarding an official request to the government on allocating the requisite funds. Experts estimate that to satisfy the Lithuanians' wish to watch Ostankino from 1800 till the end of the programs (on average 45 hours a week), 800,000 lits ($200,000) will be needed annually. The board is going to ask the government for another 200,000 lits to pay for Mayak radio broadcasts. These spending plans were called into question by opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis. He promised to state his case in a special letter to the premier. Now it is up to the government to decide who has a stronger case to argue.
