They reached the al-Halilayn Subdistrict in Radfan District and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of apostasy and secession in equipment and field weapons. They seized four tanks and two BM-21 and two 130-mm howitzers, one double-barreled gun and eight trucks. The air defense forces shot down two helicopters, capturing one pilot. On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy continued their advance with firmness and capability. They absorbed the fire of various weapons of the forces of rebellion and secession who joined the rest of the retreating brigades facing their inevitable fate. The forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy are boldly confronting the fire and bombardment of the naval units of the forces of apostasy and secession and aborting their aggressive goals. The valiant eagles of the Air Forces today continued the execution of their combat and offensive duties in a number of the arenas of battle, scoring direct hits against their set targets, with all the planes returning safely to base. As the deserved end of the elements of apostasy and rebellion and secession in the great battles of the triumph of right over wrong and the defeat of all the delusions of the separatists and their rancor for the blessed Yemeni land approaches, we reiterate the call to all officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of the military units that are still under the domination of the sinful secessionist forces in Aden Governorate to hasten to seize the valuable national opportunity open to them today by disobeying the aggressive instructions of the forces of rebellion and secession and disengaging themselves from the trap of the heinous crime plotted by the rebellious separatists against the homeland, the people, unity, and democracy. We call on them to return to their senses and their generous and noble posts within the ranks of the proud Armed Forces -- the forces of the people and the homeland, and they will find complete understanding of their coerced conditions and circumstances. They will even receive the kind of estimation and respect worthy of the noble act of stemming the flow of the blood and protecting achievements.
