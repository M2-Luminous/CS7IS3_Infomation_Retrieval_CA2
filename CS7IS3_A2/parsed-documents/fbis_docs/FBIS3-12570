The cables said in part: The horrendous massacre that the Zionists committed today against innocent Palestinian worshippers is the greatest evidence of terrorism and delinquent behavior demonstrated by the usurping Israeli entity since it was founded with the help of those who claim to be concerned about civilization, democracy, freedom, and human rights. If this is the promised Israeli peace, then let it be seen by the entire world's international, regional, and humanitarian institutions. We and history await your stance and your verdict. The Lebanese Communist Party [LCP] denounced the massacre and said it was an attempt to impose additional conditions on the Palestinian side and put pressure on other Arab parties.
