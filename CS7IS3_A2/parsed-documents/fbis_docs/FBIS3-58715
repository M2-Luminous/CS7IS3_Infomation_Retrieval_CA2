The Committee stressed that these countries: a) would soon be bringing a significant contribution in strengthening the EU's environmental legislation; b) must, as far as possible, be authorized by the Council and Commission to maintain their current environmental standards in those fields where the "acquis communautaire" is less advanced. She also hoped that these two institutions would begin revising this acquis as soon as possible with a view to the harmonization of the environmental regulations of an enlarged Europe at the highest level.
