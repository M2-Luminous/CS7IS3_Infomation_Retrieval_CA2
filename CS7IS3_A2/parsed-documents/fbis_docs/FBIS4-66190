Unfortunately, when I visited the village, he was away on a buying trip. His family members said he goes on these trips for two to three months every year. In Guoji village, there are already several of these "amphibians" who have one foot in the city and the other in the village. Ou was in the army, and after his discharged, he became village cadre (company commander of the village militia). In the 1980's, he was among the first to leave the village to work on the outside. Lately he has accumulated substantial amount of money and experience and has forged personal ties at work which prompted him to turn around and head back to the village to take up the pig-feed additive business. Usually he stays home to tend to his farm, and when farm work is slow, he goes on his business trips. Some of his business is all the way out in Guangdong. Today, his is the best house in the village (repaired once when he was still working for others and repaired again when he got into business for himself). Many in Guozi village who have dreams of becoming well-off are envious of him. Yang Shicheng [2789 0013 7022] is another of such "amphibians." His business is a mixed-bag -- he picks up whatever there is to do. When the reporter visited him at his house, he was just buying up the local oranges to ship them out-of-town. "This is but my odd job. My main business out there is in lumber. There is money to be made out there everyday, and coming home, I find it uncomfortable to be idle all day long. Everybody wants to make money." Perhaps having been out and about in the world has given him a better sense and better judgment about commodities; Yang is clearly ahead of everybody else. Even though most people who have retired and gone back to the villages are those who had left early and had reaped substantial profit, the material and cultural differences between town and country and their anxiety about future competition still make them ambivalent about returning to their ancestral homes like fallen leaves returning to their roots. Like "amphibians," they don't know where they really belong. Shao Yuanshou [6730 0337 1108] and Liu Yanlin left the village at about the same time. He has gone through 14 provinces and municipalities. Today, he is home taking care of some sideline business. Because he is very skillful, he can make 300-400 yuan a month weaving bamboo. In talking to the reporter, he sighed and said, "I have never wanted to live in the city permanently. I was not born for that kind of life. But having been out there to see the sights and experience the fun, I am not satisfied with being back here again. Life is hard out there. There is always someone looking over your shoulders, and even when the wind is blowing and the snow is falling, you still have to go to work. But there is one good thing about it: Usually, the harder you work, the more money you make. You can figure it out for yourself. Moreover, it makes a difference if you are skilled, and so it forces one to learn. At the beginning, I could not adapt to city life. People are yelling at you and ordering you around all day long, and everything is so rigid. But now that I am back home, I can't get used to things here either. You may be free here, but you have nothing to do all day, and you have no steady income. Here in the village, besides watching TV, there is no other form of entertainment. If you have never experienced life on the outside, you will never think about it, but once you had a taste of it but can't get it anymore, it is hard to take. Is this ironic or what?" A Step Ahead of the Others--by reporter Da Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388] Let us return to Chen Liang's home and listen to his story. Those who know Chen Liang know that he failed to get a job in Suzhou's Wuxian County and Shanghai's Chongming one year. When he returned to the village, mentally he went through a very difficult period. The closer he got to his home, the more he worried about running into people he knew, and the more he worried, the more people he ran into. On the boat to the village, he ran into a relative. "How come you are back?" He detested that question the most. "Coming home to visit the family." Those who left always come home "in their silken robes" -- a sign of success -- clutching gift packages of all sizes, but Chen had lost his job and was kind of ashamed to come home to face the village elders and worried even more about others suspecting that he had done something wrong and that was why he was fired. Later, whenever he left the village, he would put on a pair of sunglasses. He and his father wanted to contract or buy the village's plastic factory which had shut down earlier, but the deal fell through because the price was not right. The factories in the township were beyond their reach, and some were not that profitable. His father recalled that back then, whenever they had time, they would search for a newspaper to read. People always look down on young people who are still living at home. "One must get ahead, just like knives must be sharpened. You should go out to see the world." Chen Liang said, "When you are out there, even in your dreams, you dream about working alongside your father and washing clothes beside your mother." Even if the food is plain and the tea coarse, they are still sweet. "There is an inexplicable tenderness about them." But he still wants to get away. "You know, my parents have kept me for more than 20 years. It just doesn't feel right to spend another cent of my father's money. To earn more money and find more business is the best way to repay my parents. That was why I left when I had a chance." Of course people look for work away from home in order to make money. But "city life has its attractions too. Sitting at home makes one feel as if one is looking at the sky from the bottom of a well." "Listening to tapes at home is no longer fun. Life in the village is too monotonous. One has to go 4 li just to catch a movie; there are no karaoke, no books, no song and dance shows that one likes. Before, I would watch other people dance on TV, but I didn't know how. Today, even I can dance a little--not that I think about dancing all the time or dance away all my free time." "There is no room for me in the village." Upon saying that, Chen felt that he had mis-spoken himself. He thought for a while and corrected himself, saying, "There is no future here." Chen Liang left several times and came back several times. His father said, "If he hadn't leave, his sister couldn't leave." It turned out that when Chen Liang sister failed to find a job in Kunshan, it was Chen Liang who found a place for her at the Wuxi Textile Goods Research Institute's Zhongshi Factory not far from his own work place." "What young people would want to remain at home?" Chen Liang's younger sister who had just graduated from middle school interjected. Her grandmother chided her, "You wish your brother would come home tomorrow and leave on the next day. How terrible." "Water drains down; people heads up. People absolutely want that work permit." Usually after one person leaves a village, others will follow. Dagang's villagers told me that none of those who have left have returned. Secretly Giving Him the Thumbs-Up--by reporter Liu Jian [0491 1696] Liujiaguanfang's peasants are not satisfied with making some money on the outside to feed the family. They want to get the "green card" to the "new world." People here are very keen about "emigrating." The reason the peasants from the Liujiaguanfang area often go out to the northeast, besides the fact that they are familiar with the place and have friends and relatives there, is that household registration is less strict and outsiders are usually allowed to settle there. One's highest ideal of course is to get an official post. Two li away from Liujiaguanfnag is Zhangjiaguanfang. In 1963, Ji Qingren [4764 1987 0088] left the village for Heilongjiang's Qitaihe. Today, Ji is the head of Qitaihe's City mines as well as its party committee secretary. Everybody in Qitaihe City knows his nickname "Ji Dahu--Tiger Ji." When he arrived in the coal pits, he truly "worked hard and sweated hard," and soon became a model production trooper. In 1973, he was promoted to deputy head of the mine; it took him only 10 years. Today he is in charge of more than 3,800 workers; he is a county-level cadre and is Qitaihe's number one enterpreneur. Most of Liujiaguanfang's peasants who venture out to the northeast are trying to follow in Ji's example; they just don't want to admit it. If one can't make it as a cadre, a lesser goal is to become an official employee in a state-owned enterprise and live on the "state's payroll." Dozens in Liujiaguanfang have succeeded with this approach. In fact, in the more than 40 years since the founding of the PRC, most of those in Liujiaguanfang village who have managed to get on the state's payroll had started on in the northeast. Liu Huitian [0491 2585 3944], a young trooper who ventured out to Qitaihe alongside Ji Qingren in 1963 and engaged in the same death-defying struggles in the same pit with him, has now settled in Qitaihe with his family, all legal and proper. Last year, having been away from the village for 30 years, he took his wife and children back home to visit his ancestors' graves. They set off enough firecrackers to litter the whole street. Though not the grandest by comparison, his was nevertheless a glorious homecoming, sufficient to make his ancestors proud. Only a handful can triumphantly land in the "new world." Most return home to Liujiaguanfang village after three to five months or even three to five years, upon making some money here and there. Eighty percent of Liujiaguanfang's male between the ages of 30 and 60 fall into this category. They either had little luck or had just missed the opportunities, or they have simply lost the patience to "wait a little while longer" after waiting and waiting for a long time. Like those workers who go overseas to work, they make some hard-earned money and head home. They are neither success stories nor are they failures. No matter where the Liujiaguanfang villagers go, and no matter how far they travel, their standard for success or failure is still Liujiaguanfang's standard and not the "new world's" standard. They seem to have eyes on their backs. Books Make People Ambitious--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] When I arrived at Huang Xiaomin's [7806 2556 2404] house, they had just finished cleaning house and had just started a large frying pan to heat some honey. They told me that they were getting ready to make some local yellow wine to celebrate an important occasion. Twenty-four-year-old Huang was getting married in a few days, but he looked rather sad. Huang joined a construction brigade two years ago upon graduating from high school. Today, he has traveled a long way home for his wedding. He said, "After graduating from high school, I didn't make it to college, but I still felt good about myself. I still believed that I could accomplish something. I have always loved to write, and I figured that with my education, I could always make some money. But once out there, I realized how naive I was." In the construction bridgade, he was an unskilled labor just like any other civilian worker. He worked more than 10 hours a day. He has been to Xinjiang and Qinghai. During the day, he set tiles, and at night, when the others laid in bed chatting with one another, he would play the flute or read a book about tile-setting, and only at that time would it become apparant that he was an educated man. He also admitted that because he was educated, the team leaders and others always looked up to him. He said, "Actually I would still like to go back to school. If my family had money, I would like to get another year of schooling. But having worked out there for a couple of years has its merits. At least I am more mature. When I first went out there, I was vain. I never ventured out of the construction site and was too embarrassed to meet people. Now I am a changed man." At one time, Huang Xiaomin submitted some articles to the newspapers and magazines. He did not even get a letter of rejection. He also tried getting into business for himself but was too shy to talk to people. So he ended up becoming an unskilled laborer. Today, after having wandered around for two years, marriage has brought him back to the village. The outside world is illusive, and the air in the village is oppressive. His worries about the future keeps bearing down on him. He said, "After the wedding, I am sure I will have to stay home for a while, and I am sure I will not be able to accomplish much at home. So I am sure I will leave again." He said, "I have to get out there and do something for my father and mother and everybody to see, to make society acknowledge my worth. One day, if I manage to accomplish something big, I will return and change the face of this village." Torn Between Coming and Going--by reporter Lu Yuegang [4151 6460 0474] Two things bothered me incessantly while I was staying in Huxia village. The first was insomnia, because of the rats, and the other was the language problem. Huxia village's grain silos used to be built out of reed or wood. No one knows when the rats began to run amuck. What is interesting is that instead of working together to rid the village of rats, every family began to build cement silos. Even if the rats had steel fangs, they couldn't chew through the cement walls. Starving rats are everywhere, and they gnaw at anything that they can sink their teeth into. Sometimes, a foot-long rat would crawl along the bed-rail. They would look straight into your eyes, showing no fear at all. What can you do? People speak the Hu native dialect here. Outsiders simply can't understand them. Fortunately, I had Zou Binzi [6760 2430 1311] to interpret for me. Actually, Zou is around because of this piece of poverty-stricken land. He was in the military police army for 3 years and joined the Party while serving. After he returned home, he wanted to do something big, but every time he returned home full of hope he was forced to leave full of despair. It was as if there was no room for him on that piece of land. He worked as a hired hand everywhere. He worked hard. He went all over the country, but he always felt that he had an unfulfilled dream. In July 1993, he drummed up enough courage to write Wu Guanzheng [0702 1351 2973], governor of Jiangxi Province, a letter in which he said, "Upon returning to the village, I wanted to embark on the road to riches along with my fellow villagers. But alas there was 'no room for a hero to display his prowess' there." He went on to make some good suggestions about many rural projects. His letter was forwarded from the province to Yichuan Prefecture and from the prefecture to Zhangshu City and then to Huangtugang Town, from level to level, and eventually the town's leader met with him. This kind of sensationalism only invited the villagers' criticism. Another failure. He was forced to go to work in Guangdong: First, he could avoid further criticisms, and second, he could make some money to support himself. He told me that as far as Huxia village is concerned, there are only two kinds of resources: the land and the surplus labor. In particular, he said that the land has not been properly utilized. He showed me his plan. He pointed to a field at the foothill and said, "There are more than 40 mu of red-loam, low-yield farms. Planting rice will yield only several hundred jin. If we do some excavating, it will be a perfect place for ecology-based breeding [SHENGTAI YANGZHI]." Ecology-based breeding techniques can be brought in from the outside, but who will put up the 40 to 50,000 yuan in initial investments? It will be harder to get the money than to get into heaven. In early February, I received a letter from Zou. He said that upon parting with me in Nanchang, he thought about starting an all-purpose agricultural development company, but his family was dead against it. The reason was quite simple: they did not have the means to support him. He is already 26 years old. In the village, the pressure is already unbearable if one is still not married at that age. Even worse is, what is he going to do with himself? He plays mahjong during the day, and at night, there is no electricity, so he goes to bed early. Is this the way to fritter one's life away? Should he go out to work again? Once Spring Festival is over, he will have to make a decision. He must be torn between coming and going at this point.
