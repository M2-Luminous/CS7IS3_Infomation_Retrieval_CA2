In the opinion of Alla Moshkina, a leading scientific associate at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of the Consumer Market and Marketing, in 1992 Russians passed the lowest point of decline in food consumption (2,400 calories per day). In 1993 there was a small increase (2,600), and in 1994 (2,700) our ration will exceed the 1991 level. True, calories represent a gross indicator, which is not very indicative of the crux of the matter. As in bygone days the quantity of steel and wool did not guarantee the appearance of reliable combines and fashionable blouses, so the number of calories is not an indication of good nutrition. Most Russians have a food ration of a carbohydrate nature (they eat bread and potatoes more often than meat and milk). However, little by little the consumption of livestock products is also increasing. For example, in 1990 Russians consumed 6.3 kg of meat and meat products per month, in 1991, 5.8, in 1992, 4.8, in 1993, 5.2, and in 1994 (according to forecasts), 5.5. Furthermore, the consumption of vegetables should be restored this year and that of fruits and berries will even exceed last year. True, our previous nutritional level is not a standard. In 1990 a Russian consumed 49 grams of animal protein per day and in 1993, 39.7, while the recommended norm is 55.7. However, in Alla Moshkina's opinion, the general trend, nevertheless, is favorable: Food consumption will grow slowly despite the reduction in its production. The population's gradual adaptation to new market conditions, rapid growth of production on private subsidiary plots, direct trade, from vehicles, by agricultural producers, expansion of trade by private individuals (especially from near abroad), an economical expenditure of food, and, of course, import are the main reasons. The Most Unpleasant Trend: Day-to-Day Goods Are Becoming Fewer The washing away of relatively inexpensive day-to-day goods--milk, vegetables, potatoes, sour cream, and frozen fish--and their replacement either with expensive products, or simply with any junk, are the most unpleasant trends noted on the food market recently. The paradox lies in the fact that the country is overflowing with food raw materials (in many regions stocks for 1 month and longer have accumulated) and there is a big demand for them, but primarily the processing industry prevents those that want to sell, for example, milk and those that want to buy it from making contacts. This is the "bottleneck" on the consumer market. Monopolism, technological backwardness, the habit to dictate terms both to producers of agricultural products and to consumers, and high, but "eaten through," profits--the food industry would be happy to preserve such a situation for a long time. Imported food is in the way. It simply forces it out from the market. This forces food industry workers to make a move. And it is worth making a move. According to Alla Moshkina, technologies, for example, for the quick freezing of 40 types of fruits and vegetables were developed in the country as far back as 15 years ago: Take and use them. Trade, like the food industry, is not very concerned about the impoverishment of the assortment of inexpensive goods and their disappearance; in part, because to trade in potatoes every day is a more labor-intensive occupation than to doze near a bar of imported chocolate for 1 month. Moreover, it has been noted more than once that trade "circulates" the money made from the sale of potatoes or milk instead of returning it to processors and agricultural producers. If it is impossible to count on administrative measures, in Alla Moshkina's opinion, only an increase in prices of basic necessities can bring them back to the counter. It will be necessary to pay "bread" and "milk" money, that is, subsidies to consumers, but, nevertheless, to release the prices that, for the most part, are maintained. True, a stereotype has already been formed in our country: If oil prices are released, this is a new step on the path to the market and, if bread prices, this is a knife in the back of reforms. Triumphal March of Imported Food Throughout Russia and Its Consequences Imported food is rapidly expanding the geography of sales and the trade assortment. In March alone regular trade in imported pastry and fruit cakes in private stores increased from 60 to 87 percent, in chocolate, from 87 to 93 percent, and in chicken legs, from 13 to 53. The market is simply saturated with some imported products, for example, chocolate, but the rise in its prices has stopped. However, unfavorable trends are also present here: There is an expansion in the assortment of goods that are not most essential and not of the highest quality. Researchers say that Italian canned meat and Danish sausage have already acquired the steady status of "those that are disliked." Still, domestic producers have a serious chance for success. Consumer patriotism safeguards them. According to observations, in Germany's eastern lands an unequivocal preference for imported food lasted 3 years, but in our country tastes, possibly, will change even more rapidly--if a serious domestic competitor is found. A curious situation has emerged on the market of domestic candy and chocolate. "Mishka kosolapyy" [Pigeon-toed Mishka] and "Krasnaya shapochka" [Little Red Riding Hood] appeared in stores (in the same wrappers, which our fellow-citizens pasted in family albums in order to preserve them in historical memory), raising a storm of nostalgic feelings in the souls of Russian consumers. It seems that "Gusinyye lapki" [Crow's Feet] and "Rakovaya sheyka" [Crawfish Tail], which sank into oblivion, have been added to them, but in new attractive wrappers. Judging by surveys, people of the older generation unequivocally prefer former Soviet candy and caramel. If confectioners remember the provinces, to which "Gusinyye lapki" have not yet returned, the widest sales market will open to them. Everyone--confectioners, dairy industry workers, and margarine producers--can count on consumer patriotism if they begin to produce high-quality, tasty, and beautifully packaged products. It Would Be Good To Eat Not Only Well, but Also Correctly It is interesting that in our country there are problems not only in the "practice" of the diet, but also in "theory"--more accurately, in ideology. In the Western world the theory of a balanced diet, which requires the purification and refining of products, has long been defeated by the theory of an adequate diet, which insists on the preservation of basic natural components. (In luxurious Western restaurants dark unrefined sugar or bread with bran will be served without fail to you). However, our consumers seem to get stuck at the crossing from one theory to another; all the more so, producers, from whom the new diet ideology will require new technologies. However, according to the data of surveys by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of the Consumer Market and Marketing, our patriotic consumer, at the same time, is very amenable to the appearance of new products on the market; for example, soybean protein, or spring water. Who Is Short of What? Judging by surveys, needy families experience a shortage of the most essential goods, that is, milk, sour cream, pot cheese, onions, and garlic, which are "washed away" from the assortment. Average and highly paid population groups would like to have constantly on sale fresh and frozen fruits and natural juices (especially in winter), dry fruits, cheeses, buckwheat, Krasnodar tea, mayonnaise, and live fish... High-income families are short of fine grape wines, fruit and chocolate creams, black and green olives, fillet steaks, caviar, and bitter chocolate. The distribution of preferences seemingly does not contain discoveries, but there are curious exceptions. Research by the All-Union Scientific Research Institute has shown that Russian students are perfectly well familiar with the assortment of imported chocolate and often buy it by no means out of considerations of prestige, but simply to satisfy their hunger; as before, cabbage pies.
