The officials said Aichi and Yi, who met at Defense Agency Headquarters in Tokyo, agreed that their respective countries, along with the United States, will maintain close cooperation. Aichi told Yi that Japan is studying the problem as "a matter for Japan itself" and if the United Nations Security Council votes for sanctions against North Korea, Japan will "respond responsibly within the bounds of the Constitution," they said. It is the first time a South Korean defense minister has visited Japan. Aichi and Yi also agreed on exchange visits between training fleets and to work toward early implementation of procedures to prevent air accidents, officials said. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wants to inspect the spent fuel core of North Korea's Yongbyon reactor for evidence of whether any material has been diverted for possible use in a covert nuclear weapons development program. On Monday, North Korea said it wants IAEA inspectors to monitor the refueling of its main nuclear reactor at the end of the month. But an IAEA source said the agency needs to further sound out Pyongyang on an inspection mission, noting North Korea has yet to reply to the agency's inquiries.
