"Yes, a government with Berlusconi and the fascists will be formed." This is exactly how he calls them, fascists. However, he is firm about governing with them. [Vimercati] But Professor, how can you really believe that National Alliance will accept federalism, after having defended a strong and centralized state for years? [Miglio] It was easy because they gave in immediately. There was agreement on the need for a strong decisionmakerr, elected directly by the people, who would act as a meeting point for the federal macroregions. We wanted this person to be the prime minister, they were focusing on the president of the republic. Our formulation was the one that passed, the head of state will simply be a guarantor and the president of the Constitutional Court. [Vimercati] What did they say to you about the macroregions that were judged as being synonymous with an attack on national unity until just a few days ago? [Miglio] We did not enter into the details, but the MSI [Italian Social Movement] people agree in substance. Also because they know very well that the governor of the macroregion in the South will be one of them, they will have the South in their grasp. The same applies for the Reds, who own the center. [Vimercati] Yes, the Reds. How do you foresee reforming the Constitution without support from the Left? In the Senate you do not have the absolute majority. [Miglio] Well, I hope that Berlusconi will see to buying some representative from the opposition. I, personally, am convinced about the timeliness of having contacts with the left-wing parties, also because I know that I have good arguments. Moreover, I am really curious about what will happen in that field. If they divide themselves, which could be possible, we can negotiate. However, I am not obsessed with this problem. [Vimercati] Do you not think that a new Constitution should have a consensus that is wider than the one that forms the basis of a hard-earned majority government? [Miglio] Absolutely not. We and the fascists have agreed that the initiative must be a governmental and not a parliamentary one. One twin-assembly associative commission is sufficient. The people will then decide. [Vimercati] You keep on repeating: discussing, governing with the fascists. As a federalist, does this not have a strange effect on you? [Miglio] There are some problems, especially at an international level. Public opinion overseas is concerned. A private meeting of all the European autonomist movements represented in Strasbourg [European Parliament] was held in Linate [Milan] today. They let us know that they are not happy. However, we are committed to a decisive battle for federalism and we cannot be too nice. Even they, the fascists, who until a short while ago were asking for the abolition of the regions, understand that dangers do exist. [Vimercati] Which dangers? [Miglio] I say that federalism is close, but that if something were to go wrong, problems would arise. The North is enticed by independence. I will confess that we talked about this at the League's last federal council. We asked ourselves: Is it perhaps the case of trying to play the card of independence? For the time being we are following the principal path of federalism, we hope that they are not teasing us. [Vimercati] And if this should happen? [Miglio] We would leave the government immediately. We would not keep watch over a dead body. [Vimercati] Does it not seem that the League is experiencing a phase of eclipse? [Miglio] On the contrary, the League has demonstrated itself to be the central force, it has forced every one to revolve around the pivot of federalism. [Vimercati] Observers have the impression that everything is revolving around [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. [Miglio] I spoke with him recently. He said that he was enthusiastic about our contacts with the MSI people. He added that there will be a federal constituent assembly. [Vimercati] And what do you expect from Bossi at Pontida [League rally venue]? [Miglio] He will say that he wants federalism immediately of course. He will rightly ask for specific and clear pacts. [Vimercati] Are you concerned about Berlusconi's TV stations? [Miglio] I am convinced that he has already decided to move aside, despite the screams of his plenipotentiary, [Fininvest Chairman] Confalonieri. Berlusconi has already reconverted himself many times, he can do this one more time. [Vimercati] There is no danger for democracy then? [Miglio] Not if we succeed in imposing a federalism that will limit any strong power. [Vimercati] And if you do not succeed? [Miglio] Then we can do nothing else but ask Andreotti and De Mita to return and take charge of the country again. This means that we will change the seventh commandment as Dario Fo suggested: instead of "no stealing" it will be "steal a little less."
