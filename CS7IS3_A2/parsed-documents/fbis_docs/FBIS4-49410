The comprehensive reform program adopted earlier this year, and aimed at making major breakthroughs in shifting from the planned to the market economy, is now facing a range of difficulties. It is believed that, after tiding over mountains of difficulties, the situation will become bright again. The difficulties are mainly reflected in the following: Prices are increasing by too big a margin and state-owned enterprises are operating under more difficult conditions (because their economic results are getting even worse, their business losses are increasing, their debt chains are accumulating, the income of their workers is decreasing, and there are great difficulties in their social insurance arrangements). A potential crisis exists in agricultural production, which is vitally important to the people's livelihood, because it is affected by market competition. In addition, sensitive and unstable factors exist in the months of April, May, and June. The CPC top leadership thus emphasized the need to advance reform in an orderly way and coordinate reform with development and stability under the precondition of maintaining the current political framework. In such circumstances, the CPC authorities have obviously replaced the previous guideline of laying equal stress on economic and political reforms with the general policy decision of taking economic construction as the central task and making everything suit the needs of the economic structural reform, to implement Deng Xiaoping's line and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and foreign minister, announced that without continuous economic growth, it is difficult to develop democracy. This precisely reflected the policy orientation of the third-generation CPC leading body. Premier Li Peng said recently: In the course of gradually establishing the socialist market economic structure, China also attaches great importance to developing democracy and the legal system and boosting spiritual civilization. China pays attention to adopting and assimilating advanced scientific and technological achievements, management expertise, and cultural achievements from foreign countries; at the same time, it also pays attention to resisting decadent things. In particular, China pays attention to maintaining its fine national tradition and the cream of its national culture. This can be viewed as an explicit definition of the contents and orientation of the political structural reform, as well its position of being subordinate to and guaranteeing the economic reform. Therefore, Li Peng pointed out that the CPC's plan was to basically establish the new economic structure in the 1990's and then further build up a set of mature and fixed systems in various aspects through efforts over the following 20 years. In a previous period, the opinions about "greatly developing the nonpublic economy" and establishing "a new type of mixed economy" prevailed. Some people even advocated that like planning and market, the system of ownership is also a means and that only economic development is the end. They called for respecting the independent status and interests of commodity producers and dealers, arguing that the market economy is in essence linked only with private ownership. At a theoretical symposium on the private economy, a private entrepreneur read an essay entitled "Keep Wealth in the Hands of the People--the Only Way To Make a Country Prosperous and Powerful." He asserted that "China is now undergoing the process of relative privatization." This is characterized by the fact that "the proportion of the private economy among other economic elements in society is increasing and private enterprises are becoming main pay contributors in the country" and "an increasing number of individuals have, and will, become shareholders or owners of former state-owned enterprises." As a result, "private property is dramatically increasing" in society. He also held that the countryside is the "source of privatization" and "the adoption of the production responsibility system based on output contracts has become the prelude to the process of privatization." "As a result of the reforms, private enterprises appeared on the Chinese mainland, a group of native capitalists were fostered, and foreign capitalists were brought in together with their investments." The essay said: "By the end of this century, with the return of Hong Kong and Macao, the private economy in the mainland will gain a natural ally and the unexpected convergence will make the number of China's national capitalists more impressive." Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We allow the individual economy to develop and also allow Sino-foreign joint ventures and the enterprises solely owned by foreign investors to develop but socialist public ownership should always be the mainstay of the economy." He stressed that "in the course of reform, we should always adhere to basic principles: One is to keep the dominant position of the public economy and the other is to seek common affluence." Therefore, the 14th CPC National Congress drew a particularly explicit conclusion: "In the ownership structure, public ownership, including the economy under whole people ownership and collective ownership, will be the mainstay and the individual economy, the private economy, the foreign-funded economy will be supplementary, and a variety of economic elements will develop, side by side, over a long period of time." In fact, the state-owned economy remains the main source of tax revenue for the state, accounting for about 60 to 70 percent of the total. The private economy is still far from being the main taxpayer. Some experts hold that the fact that the economic results in some state-owned enterprises are poor and some even incur serious business losses is caused, to a large extent, by the unfair competition. It is a biased opinion to say that state-owned enterprises cannot match collective enterprises, that collective enterprises cannot match private enterprises, that private enterprises cannot match foreign-funded enterprises, and that private ownership is superior to public ownership. A large part of state-owned enterprises are concentrated in the basic industries. They require high investments and are slow to yield returns, their products and services are sold at low prices, and thus their profit margins are lower than the average level in society. In fact, part of their economic results are transferred to private enterprises and their low economic efficiency guarantees the high efficiency of the national economy as a whole, including that of the private economy. State-owned enterprises employ 20 to 30 percent more workers than they actually need. They also have to bear the wages and welfare benefits paid to an increasing number of retired personnel and the load is getting increasingly heavy. On the other hand, the township and town enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises only need to pay the labor costs and they shift the welfare burdens onto society. In the process of accelerating the establishment of the market economic structure, the state-owned enterprises have lost their advantages in raw materials and in production costs but they still have to shoulder heavy burdens. On the other hand, the township and town enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises can enjoy various preferential tax terms. More importantly, although the management and operation mechanisms of the state-owned enterprises have been transformed somewhat, they are still subject to administrative interference and it is still hard for them to actually exercise independent decisionmaking power in investment, production distribution, personnel appointment, and price-fixing. Naturally, they cannot adapt themselves flexibly to the market economy. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is now in charge of the reform oriented to the establishment of the modern enterprise system, said that as long as the management and operation mechanisms of the state-owned enterprises have been thoroughly changed, such enterprises are given independent decisionmaking power for business operations; their property rights are explicitly defined; a reasonable internal organizational structure, the stimulating and self-control mechanisms, and the environment for fair competition are set up; and then they will also be able to achieve high economic efficiency. Privatization is never the only way out. Public ownership is not the cause of the poor economic results. The current economic difficulties in Western countries also proves this. With the in-depth development of the economy, individual investment in state-owned enterprises will increase and individual investors will become shareholders in such enterprises. Moreover, some small- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises will be sold to individuals by auction. The CPC authorities stress that this does not mean any privatization of state-owned enterprises; instead, this is just a measure for deepening the enterprise reform and invigorating the economy. According to the relevant state regulations, the proportion of shares held by individuals is limited and public ownership will remain predominant. Deng Xiaoping said: "According to the current practice of opening, there will not be a newborn bourgeois class when our country's per capita GNP increases to several thousand dollars." "If there is a newborn bourgeois class then we will have really gone astray." Among CPC cadres at all levels, there are many different opinions about the country's development orientation and about the contents and intensity of the reforms; there are also differences in the implementation of the established policies. Many cadres only stress the need to quicken development and do not pay attention to various new economic phenomena and the implementation of various reform measures. Some of them are even tired of so many "twists and turns." CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin particularly instructed the State Council's Development Research Center, headed by Ma Hong and Sun Shangqing, to organize some experts in compiling textbooks for provincial, prefectural, city, township, and enterprises leaders to popularize knowledge about the socialist market economy among them. In early April, Jiang Zemin telephoned Ma Hong and said: The ongoing transformation from a traditional planned economic structure to a socialist market economic structure is a great historical change but leading cadres at all levels are still unclear about the basic facts and the basic concepts of the market economy. It is now urgently necessary to popularize the ABC's of the market economy, such as basic knowledge about stocks, bonds, real estate, and futures. In the past, our cadres learned little about such things while working under the planned economy structure but now, they must have knowledge about the market economy to develop the socialist market economy and must be familiar with the market and understand the contents and operation of the market economy in order to do a good job. Since the beginning of this year, principal provincial-level leading cadres have received training in turn at the CPC High-Level Party School led by Hu Jintao. They mainly studied Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the major principles and policies for establishing the socialist market economy and the reform arrangements. In particular, stress was laid on the need to unify thinking, to coordinate the steps, to act in accordance with the overall interests of the whole nation, and to safeguard the authority of the central leadership. As a result, such things as ignoring central instructions, working out "countermeasures" against central policies, taking advantage of loopholes in the policies, and going one's own way have been seen to decrease. After the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, the CPC leaders inspected various localities to see how the reform measures were being implemented. Zhu Rongji's inspection of Heilongjiang was most impressive in terms of size and influence. He led 10 principal State Council ministry and state commission leaders to "work on the spot," dealing mainly with difficult issues in the economic layout and in large state-owned enterprises (including those in the war industry). Some enterprises were forced to suspend operations and production because of the industrial restructuring and enterprise mergers. Some workers gathered to protest and this caused a bad atmosphere. Zhu Rongji announced that he visited Heilongjiang in accordance with the instructions of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. Thus, he brought with him the supreme policy decisions. At the end of the inspection, on 17 April, he openly announced that Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee was relieved of office and would be succeeded by Yue Qifeng, former governor of Liaoning Province. This showed that Zhu Rongji was resolute in making decisions as a troubleshooter and could seize the crux of the problem. Whether or not the CPC's reform measures for improving macrocontrol will achieve the expected results is contingent on whether or not social and economic operations can be kept in a healthy and stable condition during the first half of this year. Although the results of production, sales, tax revenue, and foreign trade in the first quarter of 1994 show that the economic conditions can basically meet the macrocontrol targets, retail prices still increased by 20.1 percent, much higher than Li Peng's target of keeping the margin of price increase within 10 percent for the whole year. Chen Jihua, minister of the State Planning Commission, said that in order to curb inflation and guarantee the smooth implementation of various reform measures, it is necessary to effect the following: First, maintaining the balance between gross supply and demand. In normal conditions, the difference should not be larger than 5 percent. At present, the difference is 7 percent. The investment-led demand is too great and supply is relatively insufficient and, if this situation continues, inflation will appear. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control the amount of investment in fixed assets. Second, attaching importance to agriculture and guaranteeing the supply of vegetables, eggs, meat, and other foodstuffs. Workers in the middle and lower income groups are strongly discontented with the fact that food prices are increasing by too wide a margin and this is greatly unfavorable to social stability. Third, properly handling the intensity of the price reform and selecting the right time for the adoption of the reform measures. That is, the reform measures should be adopted when the economic environment is relatively relaxed and the masses can endure higher prices. Public opinion should help adjust the psychological condition of the masses for inflation. Fourth, the government should be exercising management and interfering in market prices. At present, in such countries as the United States and Japan, which pursue typical free market economies, the commodity prices and service charges subject to government management account for 5 to 10 percent, or even 20 percent, of the gross volume of retail sales in society and the proportions there are even higher than those in China. Therefore, macrocontrol over the conditions of a market economy is still indispensable. Since Ding Guangen, CPC Central Political Bureau member, took charge of the party's ideological work, he has pointed out more explicitly the position of ideological and propaganda work as subordinate to the central task of economic construction and reforms. The position and role of opinion orientation is being strengthened and has become the important nerve of social stability. The CPC top leadership stressed that factors which may cause social instability must be wiped out when they are still in the embryonic stage to prevent them from causing major trouble. This is in fact the extensive application of Deng Xiaoping's idea about "no controversy." News reports, the arts, and other forms of propaganda should serve the central task, playing an assistant role, and must not add trouble to the situation. They should play the main theme and not add noise. This is the most important function of the propaganda methods. They must not create any unnecessary controversy or even sing an opposing tune to divert people's attention from economic construction. Stopping beauty pageants, stopping performers from moving all over to put on shows, checking young people's crazy admiration for some singing stars, clamping down on the illegal sale of book registration numbers and illegal publications, including pornographic publications, were all measures adopted by the CPC authorities to remove the unstable factors and resist the influence of the decadent Western lifestyle. Jiang Zemin pointed out that the first thing in building spiritual civilization is to cause creations to flourish and these works should play the main theme. The works should give expression to Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, and the spirit of patriotism, socialism, and collectivism. Literature and arts should follow the principle of "serving socialism" and "serving the people." In short, they should arouse the entire people's enthusiasm for socialist construction and should encourage them to make progress. The main theme must be played in the works being supported as key projects, in the main pages and columns of newspapers and magazines, and in the golden hours of television broadcasts. The main theme should be combined with a variety of vivid forms. The main theme is the ideological requirement for the works but the works giving expression to the main theme need not be serious or highly aesthetic in their style. Some works may be very easy to understand and should be popular with the masses. As long as they give a healthy feeling to the people, then they are works playing the main theme. We cannot demand that all works repeat the same thing and follow the same pattern while stressing the need to play the main theme. We should still let a hundred flowers blossom. We should also allow the existence of some works which are somewhat vulgar in style but are harmless in their contents. Jiang Zemin also said: We must boost spiritual civilization; otherwise, people at home and abroad can complain bitterly. For example, karaoke bars in some places hire young ladies to entertain customers by drinking, singing, and dancing with them. If there are additional services, things will become serious. Jiang Zemin said: Sweeping away pornographic things is a popular action supported by the people, so we should go all out to do this boldly. Of course, this is also a long-term task that cannot be finished in one single move. It is necessary to mobilize all quarters of society to sweep away pornographic things, just like the tasks being assigned to all units in public sanitary work. The tasks of eliminating pornographic things should also be assigned to all institutions, schools, and enterprises and routine management should be combined with sudden inspections. Unremitting efforts should be made and actions should be taken repeatedly. [passage omitted]
