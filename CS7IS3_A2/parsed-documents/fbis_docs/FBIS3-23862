The head of the Ministry, Boris Saltykov, who opened the meeting, emphasized that preserving the best part of Russia's scientific-technical potential in conditions of the economic slump is the main goal of state policy in the sphere of science and technology. Boris Saltykov noted bitterly that because of the shortage of finances, all last year scientists had to think more about preserving science than developing it. But even under these difficult conditions a great deal was accomplished. Forty-one state scientific-technical programs were formulated and are being realized. Proposals for realizing 117 priority technologies and new types of output within the framework of the state structural policy were prepared. Thirty-three state scientific centers received financial support, and that made it possible to preserve the leading scientific schools in the high technology fields. For the first time and as one of the first among the republics of the former Union, Russia became a full-fledged member in the European technological program "Eureka." An intergovernmental agreement on scientific-technical cooperation with the United States was concluded. Russia's international scientific-technical cooperation made it possible to continue many scientific research projects in the field of high-energy physics, the human genome and bioengineering, and promising information technologies. However, the speaker noted, the situation in the scientific-technical sphere is becoming increasingly strained. Science continues to be financed month by month and on the left-over principle. Thus, last year scientific organizations received about 300 billion rubles less than needed. The number of scientific personnel is also declining: both because of the exodus of scientists to commercial structures and owing to the "brain drain" abroad. The best are leaving. The prestige of scientific labor has dropped, the proportion of graduates of VUZes [higher educational institutions] which train scientific cadres is declining, and scientific schools and entire fields are collapsing. The volume of enterprise contracts with scientific organizations has sharply declined, construction of scientific facilities has ceased, and unique structures are becoming unusable. The disruption of contacts among organizations of the former Union republics is causing enormous losses to science and technology. The lack of hard currency is retarding and reducing the scope of international cooperation.
