FBIS4-36945 "drnes115_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 LEBANON Prosecutor Denies Reports of Lockerbie Confession Prosecutor Denies Reports of Lockerbie Confession NC1406151394 Paris AFP in English 1421 GMT 14 Jun 94 NC1406151394 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Beirut, June 14 (AFP) -- Lebanon on Tuesday dismissed a claim attributed to a Palestinian activist that he had placed the bomb which exploded on a US airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. Yusuf Sha'ban "never said that he had placed the bomb in the Pan Am plane" that killed 270 people, state prosecutor Munif 'Uwaydat told AFP. "But he said that under torture he was ready to confess to anything, even the Lockerbie bombing, if asked to," 'Uwaydat said, noting Sha'ban's comments were not logged in court records because they were not connected to his trial. The state prosecutor charged that statements attributed to Sha'ban on Monday were "deformed on purpose to embarrass (Lebanese) justice," and he ruled out any investigation into the claim. Sha'ban, according to the state-run news agency ANI, told a court here that he was responsible for bombing the plane. The 29-year-old member of Abu-Nidal's hardline Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) was being heard in the murder trial of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah who was shot dead outside his Beirut home in January. Sha'ban faces a possible death penalty. The United States said it had no evidence to corroborate Sha'ban's claim and reiterated its demand for the extradition of two Libyans who have been indicted in both Britain and the United States for the attack. Barbara Bodine, the State Department coordinator on counter-terrorism, said that Sha'ban "was not a suspect." "We feel very strong evidence against the two indicted Libyans, but we are serious in following up this lead to see if there is any veracity in it at all," Bodine said. London and Washington have for three years been trying to force court appearances of 'Abd-Basit al-Mijrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah, who are charged in the bombing. Britain also renewed its demand that the two Libyans be brought before a Scottish or a US court to answer the charges. Al-Mijrahi and Fahimah's Libyan lawyer, meanwhile, sent a letter to the Lebanese judicial authorities urging them to further interrogate Sha'ban on the Lockerbie bombing. Ibrahim Legwell asked that lawyers defending the Libyan suspects be allowed to take part in any investigation, according to a copy of the letter received by AFP in Tripoli. Libya has been under UN sanctions since April 1992 because of its refusal to hand over the two suspects. The sanctions cut international air links and arms sales, and limited diplomatic ties with Libya.
