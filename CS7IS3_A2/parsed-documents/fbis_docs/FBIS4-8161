This bill, however, was valid only until the end of 1993. A new bill, properly drafted and permanently valid, was expected to be passed by the end of 1993. However, it was not drafted by that date. To make it possible for BIS to operate even after this date, parliament at the very last moment extended the validity of the temporary bill until 31 July 1994. Recently, the government handed over to parliament a draft in which it proposed the principles of the bill. Some of its contents, however, are very questionable. For instance, if BIS decides to use intelligence-gathering technology against a constitutional official, then, according to the draft, this information must be indicated in the request handed over to the judge who approves the utilization of this technology. This means that only the judge has to be informed about the possible BIS eavesdropping on a constitutional official, and no one else--that is, neither the president, the prime minister, the chairman of parliament, nor the chairman of the senate (if the senate is established at all in the Czech Republic). It ensues that the government, particularly its prime minister, have waived their legal right to be informed about eavesdropping on constitutional officials. Vaclav Klaus has thus gotten rid of his responsibility. It is as if the prime minister told the secret service: "I do not want to know anything. It is your business if you want to eavesdrop on a constitutional official." The prime minister's reluctance to deal with problems that smack of troubles has certainly affected this decision. Had we not often heard Klaus call for civic responsibility the situation would be less absurd. Like that, responsibility for eavesdropping on constitutional officials falls only on the judge who has approved it and the BIS director who proposed it. No one else has to be informed about it and bear responsibility for possible illegal utilization of intelligence technology. In other words, if the BIS director believes that, for example, the Democratic Union (replace this name with any other name, if applicable) is an extremist organization (or is conducting activity that could be used as a token justification for eavesdropping) and finds a judge who is of the same opinion, there is nothing to prevent eavesdropping. The same applies to the eavesdropping on deputies, ministers, senators, etc. If the representatives of the Democratic Union or another party find out and prove that they have been the subjet of [illegal] eavesdropping, the BIS director and the judge may be dismissed, but that is all. Neither the government nor any other politician will be responsible because it knew nothing. The BIS director did not even have the obligation to inform them. In a similar way, this also applies to surveillance, where only the decision of the BIS director or a designated department chief is required. If the BIS director (or a subordinate to whom he has delegated this power) decides, for whatever reason, to carry out surveillance on a constitutional official, he does not have to have the approval of anyone else, nor does he have any obligation to inform anyone else--in this case, not even the judge. It is impossible to completely rule out the possibility that the Secret Service apparatus will be used for political objectives. However, we should make such a possibility as difficult to materialize as possible and indicate who is responsible for the abuse of the secret service. Even if it was true that in countries with a long democratic tradition the eavesdropping devices have never been misused, the powers delegated to the BIS director would still be excessive. The Watergate affair, where eavesdropping on the electoral staff of the Democrats was conducted with the knowledge of the then Republican President Richard Nixon at the beginning of the 1970's, shows us that it is important to protect ourselves as effectively as possible against the misuse of intelligence technology. Well-drafted laws are part of this protection. If the Chamber of Deputies approves the bill according to the government-drafted principles, this law will certainly be flawed. It would help if the ministers and the deputies imagined the situation where they themselves could be eavesdropped upon or targeted for surveillance.
