State Council Premier Li Peng has just had a vacation in Zhuhai and took the opportunity to inspect some large capital construction projects there. The informed source revealed that State Council Premier Li Peng's current southern tour is basically a winter vacation, and he is to carry out an inspection tour of the developing urban economy of the Zhu Jiang Delta in Guangdong in passing. Li Peng spent seven days in Zhuhai this time, the longest stay in a single place in his southern tour itinerary. While vacationing, he visited some large capital construction projects in Zhuhai. Endorsing Zhuhai's plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge, which will link the city with Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Li Peng urged Zhuhai to speed up the construction of the project. The informed source said several central leaders will take vacations in Zhuhai this year since it is quite cold in Beijing during winter. As the weather is fine in Zhuhai, the city is clean, and traffic and personnel control is easy here as a special economic zone, apart from Li Peng, who has just left Zhuhai after vacationing, Deng Xiaoping will also come to Zhuhai on the eve of the Spring Festival to pass the Lunar New Year here, and then return to Beijing after the Spring Festival.
