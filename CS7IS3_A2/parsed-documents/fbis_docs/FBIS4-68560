What were the results? What issues were discussed? What changes were observed? These are the topics our correspondent discussed with the first deputy minister in an interview. [Liparityan] Our principal goal was to convey to those countries our view of the present situation which was created as a result of the developments of recent months and to hear their assessments. When I was in the United States in January, I was able to convey our approaches to officials of the State Department. At that time I also met with Jan Eliason, the chairman of the Minsk Group of the CSCE. Let me note with regard to this trip that we discussed the issue of the development of bilateral relations with Iran. Although we do not have bilateral relations with Turkey, we agreed that we must reinstate the direct ties that were cut following the recent occupation of [Azerbaijani] territories. [AZG] Last year you visited Turkey again and, if I am not mistaken, at that time you noted a certain understanding in the Turks' position. Of course one cannot expect any change of position on matters of principle, but did you notice any movement in terms of the correct perception of the [Armenian-Azeri] conflict? [Liparityan] I think that there is such a movement. Our meetings were all working meetings. We were very interested in knowing the results of [Azerbaijani President Haydar] Aliyev's visit to Turkey. The Turks intend to back Azerbaijan's approaches, at least officially. When Azerbaijan began to respond negatively to all the proposals put forward, the Turks reaffirmed that Azerbaijan has the right to do that. Turkey's position is also that [Armenia] should withdraw from the [occupied] territories. During our talks we focused on that issue in greater detail and pointed out that it is impossible to solve the Azerbaijani problem with that approach. First, our position is that the problem is not one of territory because both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have endorsed the plan which envisages that they withdraw from those territories--except Lachin which, as a complex problem, must be discussed in the second stage. We asked why Azerbaijan is raising the issue of territories and is trying to seize by force what it can get without any fighting. Azerbaijan continues to state that it does not wish to discuss the issue of blockades. The Turks agree with these questions we raised. They are also in agreement on the issue of a ceasefire, but they are not so keen about the insertion of peacekeeping forces. We explained to them that the situation is already such that it is doubtful if a ceasefire can be maintained without separating forces. [AZG] Has there been any movement in Turkey's policy with regard to Azerbaijan? [Liparityan] I think that the Turks now realize the mistakes they permitted last year during Elchibey's tenure. Now that they see how Aliyev plays with different countries, they do not have the confidence they had during Elchibey's time. At the same time, however, they do not wish to lose their influence over Azerbaijan, and, as a result, do not want to engage in a confrontation with Aliyev. My impression is that Aliyev asked for many things but did not get much. He demanded much, but promised little. Consequently, the Turks were not very happy with his visit. [AZG] What is the situation in Iran relative to Turkey? [Liparityan] In our opinion, Iran's position is more practical. Iran is saying: We will accept and are prepared to contribute to any initiative which works, brings peace and ends the conflict. [AZG] But Iran persists in speaking out in favor of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Also, it has stopped offering its offices for mediation. [Liparityan] For the present time, Iran has not offered a mediation role. Our opinion is also that at this time what is needed is not a new mediation mission, but to reduce the existing missions and combine them into a single one. The Iranians are prepared to help in any way that the sides propose. Also, in their newspapers the Iranians refer to changes of borders rather than territorial integrity. In this regard the most severe comments were made by Rohani, the deputy speaker of the Iranian parliament. I told them that such a question does not exist. Azerbaijan can recover all of its territories if it wishes by agreeing to any peace plan. [AZG] Did you discuss the issue of the blockade around Armenia with Turkey? [Liparityan] We did. They have no intention of resolving that problem until the conflict ends and the peace process begins. If that happens they are also prepared to develop bilateral relations. [AZG] What is the status of Armenian-Iranian relations? [Liparityan] Those relations were frozen in a political sense. Now things have changed. We even agreed to exchange ambassadors instead of charges d'affaires. For the Iranians what is important is not so much the issue of occupied territories but the establishment of a ceasefire, because they are concerned that all these developments may have an effect on the Azeris living in Iran. However, this must not be interpreted in general that the issue of territories is not of great concern to Iran. [AZG] You also visited France. What is the position of French diplomats? [Liparityan] France believes that it is no longer possible to work with the Vienna plan. They think if one of the sides has rejected that plan, the others must work on new approaches. We explained to them that there are a few ways of solving that problem. First we must think about the cessation of hostilities and then move on to the other steps. At present there are two major difficulties. One is that the parties to the conflict do not trust each other. Azerbaijan believes that Karabakh wants to keep the occupied territories or to exchange some of them for recognition of its status. Karabakh believes Azerbaijan will use any ceasefire to rearm and to resume its offensive. The other difficulty is that there are countries that want to solve other problems. For example, Turkey wants to use this conflict to advance its agenda in Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Although Turkey is interested in ending the conflict it wants to develop its relations with Azerbaijan, and to that end has not established relations with Armenia. Unlike Turkey, the problem Iran wants to solve is not this. It has not predicated the development of its bilateral relations with Armenia on this conflict. In contrast, Turkey has not only refused to establish relations with Armenia, but has taken a position in the conflict which is not rational. [AZG] What is Russia's position in the wake of recent visits by Kazimirov and Kondratev to the region? [Liparityan] That is related to the 18 February document. Azerbaijan rejected it at the beginning but agreed to it later. However, there are no practical results because additional meetings are necessary to solve the technical problems. [AZG] Azerbaijan rejected that plan at the beginning, but they declared later that they accept it. Subsequently it was stated that they rejected it. How can that be interpreted? Are there differences within the Azeri leadership or is it another ploy? [Liparityan] It can be interpreted in two ways. It seems that there are some differences [within the Azeri government]. On the other hand, they can always agree to it today and reject it tomorrow. When Russia says a few words they say yes. When Russia's envoy returns to Moscow they say no again. Azerbaijan has always had that problem. Its representatives never had the necessary authority during negotiations in the Minsk Group. Even when they agreed to a plan, they reneged on it after they returned to Baku. We have never had such problems--saying yes first and then saying no.
