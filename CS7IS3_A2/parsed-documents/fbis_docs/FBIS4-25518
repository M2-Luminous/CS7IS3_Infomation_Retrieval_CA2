During a meeting with Mao Chih-kuo, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Kruger said he is confident that Taiwan is capable of becoming an Asian aircraft maintenance center with its skilled work force and increasingly upgraded facilities. Saab is cooperating with Formosa Airlines in expanding and upgrading a Formosa maintenance shop in Taichung to use as a base for the maintenance center, Kruger said. Several Formosa technicians have received a Collins' license for overhauling engines and navigation systems, certifying them capable of doing the maintenance work here rather than sending the machinery abroad for overhaul, according to an official of the Taipei-based airlines. Saab will also help Formosa acquire sophisticated equipment for aircraft safety inspections, such as X-ray systems and eddy current systems, the official said. Formosa Airlines, with seven 37-seat Saab-340b's in domestic flight service, is expanding its fleet with three 67-seat Saab- 2000's and three 107-seat Fokker 100's, the official added.
