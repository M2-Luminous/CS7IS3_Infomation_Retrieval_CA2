As our program predicted last week, the Defense Ministry attempted to increase budget expenditure on the Armed Forces and the military-industrial complex. Apart from that, Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of parliament's upper chamber, stated somewhat unexpectedly for the uninitiated, that the Federation Council will not approve the law on the draft budget in its current form. [Gerasimov] The Russian military, deeply offended by the amount allocated to them by the state budget last week, conducted a mass attack on legislators on the eve of the adoption of the budget by the State Duma. The State Duma Defense Committee, concerned by the results of the underfinancing of the Army, came out with a decision on increasing the military share from 37 to 55 trillion rubles. The last time that financing of troops took up 30 percent of the state budget was in the USSR in 1940 before the Second World War. However, this circumstance in no way reflects the real situation. Today, 60 percent of defense expenditure is on social provisions. The withdrawal of troops from the distant and near abroad, unprecedented in history, and support for the infrastructure of military bases eat up a significant part of the budget. According to Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, the Army is up to its ears in expenditure. For several years exercises have not been above regimental level and the number of inspection trips has fallen sharply, as has the receipt of new equipment. Andrey Kokoshin claims that 55 trillion does not mean a luxury life for the military, but money to stop the collapse of the Army. [Video shows Kokoshin addressing news conference] [Begin Kokoshin recording] It is absolutely not question of our are preparing for a major war, although you always have to be vigilant in this regard, and to a certain degree, defense capability is one of the main factors in preventing war. But the fact is that we need a minimum level to provide for the viability of the Armed Forces and preserve the unique defense producers, and preserve the opportunities for the Armed Forces, when the country is richer, when the country gets to its feet, to get hold of first class military equipment. [end recording] [Gerasimov] In the meantime, the Federation Council has seriously worked on support for the military budget. Its speaker, Vladimir Shumeyko, last week visited the Ivanovo strategic missile forces division. In his opinion, the Army today is the only stable institution of Russian statehood and it is dangerous for the state to save money on it. Vladimir Shumeyko said That the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly will only approve a budget that will be capable of strengthening the Armed Forces. [Begin Shumeyko recording] What does 55 mean? Is it enough or not? I am not prepared to go into these figures with you today. I am far from simply relying on figures. Until we sit down and check each article on each branch of the Armed Forces calmly, maybe it will not be 30 or 55. Because I have spoken with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin and know how difficult it is for the government today, how difficult it is to make allocations to the military in these conditions where there is a lack of revenue in the budget, especially when the agro-industrial complex is making demands, and so on. It will be necessary to defend every kopeck. Maybe it will be 57 or 48. [end recording] [Gerasimov] At the same time, according to a statement by General Vorobyev, the chief military financier, the money allocated by the Defense Ministry is barely enough to pay off the debts for supplies of equipment and weapons. The military budget approved by the State Duma in its first reading may deprive Russia of its strategic nuclear forces, the basis of ensuring national security. A new system created on the basis of solely Russian enterprises and constructors bureaus must replace the missile complex reaching the end of its guaranteed life. If this program is disrupted, then by the year 2000 Russia will have only 90 strategic missile launchers, which will lead to the complete destruction of nuclear parity with the United States. Igor Sergeyev, the commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, thinks that at current levels of finance the introduction of new missiles will be postponed indefinitely and his department will not be in a condition to carry out its present volume of tasks. [Begin Sergeyev recording] We have to start their introduction in 1995 to replace the 300 launchers that we have destroyed up to the present time, in accordance with the quota where the Americans chose 3,500 and we chose 3,000. We believe that this will be sufficient, but they needed to be assembled, they will not just appear. As of today, if you take 100 percent of the finance planned for this area, at the present time we are financed only for four percent. [end recording] [Gerasimov] The combination of arguments produced by the military to justify the necessity of increasing their share of the budget will most likely convince the legislators, moreover, since the State Duma is the only state body that has not yet expressed a positive attitude toward additional finance for the Army. The president and the Cabinet of Ministers have already supported an increase in the budget to 55 trillion rubles. The military's main ace is that political sympathy in an as yet unstable society remains on their side.
