Naturally, there was just one reason: They wanted to prevent stirring up social moods against the backdrop of possible conflicts between the former owners and the new users, and also given the issue of burdens on the budget. A draft reprivatization law prepared by the Ownership Transformations Ministry headed by Janusz Lewandowski, in cooperation with the Consultative Council for Reprivatization, was the one that was the most likely candidate for being submitted to a vote in the Sejm. Council Chairman Krzysztof Laszkiewicz says: "A year ago, we reached a consensus. The draft law was designed in a way that would prevent placing a burden on the budget and that would prevent taking anything out of anybody's pocket. Out of its 80 provisions, as many as 19 related to the protection of third parties, which means they were intended to prevent possible conflicts. Besides, the law treated all former owners in the same way." Chances and Nuances The draft law, the final stages of which were interrupted by the parliament's dissolution, provided for three forms of returning property that had been nationalized in the period of the Polish People's Republic [PRL]: return of property in its natural form, return in the form of substitute property, and return in the form of reprivatization coupons for which one could acquire shares in companies subject to privatization, as well as immovable property owned by the State Treasury, such as apartments. So former owners faced the prospect of regaining as much of the property that had been taken away by the PRL as possible. Both those who were deprived of property in violation of the law in effect in the PRL and those who fell victim to legally implemented nationalization measures were supposed to be treated on equal footing. So it is no wonder that, when Suchocka's government was heading for a fall, the Union of Real Politics approached the reprivatization issue as a bargaining chip in the no-confidence vote. The party's offer--to support the government in return for a speedy vote on the reprivatization law--was rejected, and rumor has it that the offer did not even reach all those concerned (a certain moral authority, Lech Prochno-Wroblewski says, assured that the law was blocked). The law in this shape and form, which is satisfactory to former owners, raised the doubts of both politicians and the public. The Catholic right wing raised the point that the property had often been acquired in a manner that could not be described as completely honest. The left wing, on the other hand, was trying to use the argument that, after several decades, workers have a right to regard themselves as owners of the enterprises in which they had invested their labor. Journalists reminded everyone that, in the PRL period, losses were suffered not just by owners of factories or of real estate holdings, but also by many ordinary citizens who were illegally arrested, deprived of educational opportunities, or denied passports, just to name a few injustices. If all of them decided to demand that the Third Republic compensate them for losses suffered, the state's finances would face the danger of disaster. Members of the Consultative Council for Reprivatization, however, argued that a return of property to its owners is the simplest form of reinstating a capitalist ownership structure that would not be excessively expensive for the state. Returning property in its natural form would apply mainly to small enterprises that currently are often being neglected or that have been devastated. The return of the owners was supposed to reinstate economic efficiency to enterprises. It was also argued that the same type of outcome should result from taking over substitution property, of which there is plenty in Poland and for which no owner can be found in many cases, even for a symbolic 1 zloty. Opponents, on the other hand, argued that there are no such guarantees because the former owners currently have no money, which means that they have no resources with which to invest, while possible heirs often have no idea of business dealings. Examples of enterprises going bankrupt shortly after their former owners were reinstated were cited. A Change of Course The draft law, which had not seen a vote because of the parliament's dissolution, returned to the Second Term Sejm in a slightly modified version and as an initiative coming from 79 Sejm deputies. Members of associations grouping former owners say they had had reason to believe that the government would support this version of the law. But what really happened was that there occurred a change of course a month ago. As a result, according to Tadeusz Koss, a spokesman for the president of the Polish Union of Real Estate Owners, the current worker/peasant government legitimized the nationalization that another worker/peasant government had implemented before. The decision to prepare a governmental draft law was made at a session of the Council of Ministers in April. The chief of the Ownership Transformations Ministry was given just a few weeks in which to come up with the draft. It is known right now that the draft differs substantially from the Sejm deputies' draft, to the disadvantage of former owners. First of all, claims are to be limited to cases of violation of the legal system in effect in the PRL in the 1944-58 period. The draft provides for reimbursement in the form of reprivatization coupons, but not up to the full amount of the value of the property concerned. Only owners of illegally nationalized property worth up to 1 billion zlotys would receive their equivalents in the form of coupons. With regard to the remaining owners, a regression scale will be applied. The possibility of returning some property in its natural form, which was suggested during last week's session of the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee, has not been settled yet. This would apply first of all to small enterprises loosely tied to the agricultural sector. According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the government, while working on the alternative draft, had to take into account the effects of the reprivatization law on the budget and also had to see to it that the legal provisions do not cause new grievances. Similar solutions, Kaczmarek stated, were adopted in other postsocialist countries, such as Hungary. Both draft laws will be debated by the Sejm in late May/early June. There is no doubt in the minds of the former owners that the governmental draft law will obtain a majority. The State as the Accused The Council of Ministers' decision raised an enormous commotion among former owners. Very strong words were voiced in assessments of the governmental draft. Krzysztof Laszkiewicz pointed out that the law in its new form will deprive of their rights those who were able to execute their claims based on the Code of Administrative Procedure. Up to now, courts have recognized applications for reimbursements worth a total of 690 billion zlotys, and these amounts have not been paid out by the budget. Those whose property was taken away from them in violation of the legal system do not need the law at all. According to Lech Prochno-Wroblewski, the draft law prepared by the government is of a partial nature and therefore will settle nothing and nobody will benefit. He also warns that the 500,000 former owners will, from now on, unanimously act to the right wing's advantage because they convinced themselves that heirs to robbers will not give anything back. On the other hand, Miroslaw Szypowski, chairman of the Polish Union of Real Estate Owners, says that applications will be sent out en masse to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva, to debate the rights of former owners whose property interests suffered. The committee's task is to guard the observance of ownership rights, based on the UN Charter that Poland has signed. Says Szypowski: "Verdicts may result in adjudication of many trillions of zlotys, and the Polish state will be the accused."
