The merger was announced at a joint news conference in the capital Harare. Mr. Muzorewa, aged 67, a retired clergyman of the U.S.-based United Methodist Church and leader of the now small opposition party United National African Council, and Mr. Tekere, leader of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, ZUM, became co-president of the new party which has retained the name ZUM. The retired bishop has made a comeback after retiring from politics in 1985 following 10 months of detention by Mr. Mugabe's government for alleged subversive activities. He was in the limelight in 1970's, when the other black nationalists like Mr. Mugabe and Vice President Dr. Joshua Nkomo were either exiled or detained by the former Rhodesian rebel leader, Mr. Ian Smith. Mr. Muzorewa headed the transitional government to a black majority rule set up by Mr. Smith, but lost to Mr. Mugabe in the 1980 elections because of his alignment to whites.
