He was met at the airport by the vice president, Mr. K.N. Arkaah. President Nujoma told newsmen that Belgium played a key role in Namibia's struggle for independence. He recalled that in 1972 and 1986, SWAPO [South West African People's Organization] organized international conferences to solicit support from the international community for the liberation struggle and Belgium readily came to her aid. According to the Namibian leader, he is going to Belgium to meet friends and consolidate their relationship. He said Namibia has a lot of raw materials while Belgium has technology. Both countries can, therefore, enter into viable ventures. President Nujoma said Namibia will also consolidate her relationship with South Africa to ensure regional economic unity. He noted that South Africa is a big country with a large population and will be expected to play a major role in consolidating African economic community. On Rwanda, President Nujoma said the tragedy in that country calls for international intervention. He stressed the need for the United Nations to cooperate with the OAU to restore peace.
