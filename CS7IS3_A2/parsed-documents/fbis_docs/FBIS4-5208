The figure represented the total cost of investments in 2,000 projects approved by the BoI. "But it is not too bad," the BoI said, "given the power generators, and iron and steel investment projects during the year were to be excluded, the total project cost of investments in 1993 would amount to P43.2 billion." This was 62.5 percent higher than the corresponding amount of P26.6 billion in 1992. Specifically, the BoI said investments in energy-related and power generator projects rose from P19.4 billion in 1992 to P30.4 billion in 1993, or an increase of 56.7 percent. Investments in iron and steel projects dropped from P53.8 billion in 1992 to P43.2 billion in 1993, or a hefty growth of 62.5 percent.
