Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev after his meeting with President Lennart Meri didn't give any definite assurances that the troops will be pulled out from Estonia by Aug. 31, 1994, like Estonia and Western states insist. Both Kozyrev and Meri, however, sounded optimistic. "I would like to sound as promising as possible because it is our common desire to open up a new page of relations," Kozyrev said after the meeting. The Estonian president, too, said he had a "friendly and fruitful discussion" with Kozyrev about the still unsolved questions that Russia and Estonia need to resolve. The two parties seem to have come closer on the main stumbling block, the issue of the 10,000 Russian military pensioners in Estonia. Estonia insists that most of retired servicemen should leave the country, whereas Russia has rejected this demand and is seeking social guarantees for the military retirees. "I understand that the Estonian leadership is also determined and eager to look into the question of military pensioners in order to solve this too," the Russian foreign minister told reporters. Meri said after the meeting both sides agreed that the military pensioners issue isn't linked with troop withdrawal. "I would like to add that we discussed in a very frank way the two problems which are not interlinked with each other," he said. Kozyrev didn't comment on this statement, although Russia has previously always maintained the opposite. Even before his departure for Tallinn yesterday, the Russian foreign minister said the military pensioners issue is a part of the troop withdrawal question and that the two cannot be treated separately. Meri also claimed Kozyrev "fully agrees that we will proceed" according to the Estonian legislation and government decisions. Yet it is those same laws and decisions that have earlier invited Russian protests because they don't guarantee that all retired servicemen may remain in Estonia. Kozyrev said there are some difficulties in solving the military retirees issue. "Some of them are probably related to existing legislation and decisions," he said. The Russian foreign minister wouldn't commit his country to a troop withdrawal deadline, but assured Russia wants to have the troops out as soon as possible. The speed of pullout depends on how quickly the problems can be ironed out, he said, and added that "there is still time to meet this deadline." The Estonian president, on the other hand, claimed he hasn't the "slightest doubt" the troops will be withdrawn by the Aug. 31, 1994 deadline. At those words, Kozyrev simply grinned. On his way to the presidential palace Kozyrev made an unscheduled stop on a Tallinn street corner where he spoke to city residents. He asked a Russian woman if she was happy with her life in Estonia. "Life here is in some ways better than in Russia," she said, but complained that Estonian citizenship laws were too tough. Other Russians the foreign minister spoke to grumbled about economic hardships caused by Estonia's radical free-market reforms. An Estonian said he was afraid that Moscow might restore the former Soviet Union and reabsorb the Baltic states. "Russia doesn't want to establish the old U.S.S.R. -- never," Kozyrev responded. Some 2,500 Russian troops are still in Estonia, the only Baltic state that hasn't reached agreement with Russia on troop withdrawal. The 12,000 Russian military in Latvia will be pulled out from that Baltic nation by Aug. 31 according to the agreement signed April 30. Russian forces left Lithuania already last year. Kozyrev's visit to the former Soviet republic was his first since Estonia regained its independence in 1991.
