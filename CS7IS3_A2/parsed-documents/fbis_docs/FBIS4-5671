Quarrels over how to choose a replacement for Hosokawa, who suddenly offered to resign on Friday, resumed one day after executives of the ruling parties agreed to avert a split in the coalition and form a new government under the current framework. With the decision Tuesday to maintain unity, Foreign Minister and concurrently Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's chances of being named the next premier was almost certain. Wrangling between the groups resumed Wednesday morning, however, when Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of the new party Sakigake (Harbinger), aired his grievances over the selection process. Takemura told reporters that leaders of the coalition parties must first exchange views on the shape of a new coalition government before finding a successor to Hosokawa. This was in contrast with an agreement among the secretary general-level coalition representatives that their caucus, not a forum of coalition chiefs, would have the authority to take charge of selecting the next premier. Sakigake decided later to boycott a meeting of ruling party executives until a forum of coalition chiefs was given the authority to select Hosokawa's replacement. The move could result in a split in the eight-month-old coalition. The party insists that coalition heads should meet first to discuss the mandate of the coalition representatives' caucus -- the highest decision-making body under the Hosokawa administration -- and the selection of a new premier candidate. It also points to the need for the coalition partners to synchronize their basic policies, decide on the framework of a new coalition government and select a candidate for the premiership. "It runs counter to the founding principles of our party to approve a decision on a new premier through backroom talks," a senior Sakigake official said. "We cannot help but become an opposition party." In the absence of a Sakigake figure, the executives of the other ruling parties agreed in their Wednesday evening meeting to continue discussing the matter on Thursday morning, coalition officials said. Social Democratic Socialist Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference that SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama will ask his coalition counterparts to meet all together so as not to isolate Sakigake and cause the ruling union to collapse. "The SDP chairman says he wishes to do his best to realize a meeting of coalition chiefs, which will allow Sakigake to come back and hammer out an accord on how to solve this difficult problem," Kubo said. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent, added he will report to Thursday's gathering of coalition representatives on the outcome of Murayama's efforts to bring together all the heads of the ruling parties. Murayama had twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition chiefs -- once Monday and again Tuesday -- to break a stalemate over the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa and avert a collapse of the coalition. Sakigake, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP favored the selection of a new premier at a forum of the coalition party leaders. But leaders of four coalition partners -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party -- rejected the bid and boycotted the two sessions. The row over the procedures to pick a candidate to replace Hosokawa stems from the deep gulf between the moderate-to-leftist Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more conservative Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies and some key national policies. Bickering between Sakigake's Takemura and Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa, the main coalition strategist, over political management is also regarded as a source of trouble within the coalition. Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday reaffirmed his desire to run for the highest government office, even by defecting from the primary opposition party with fellow LDP members. Some LDP sources said late Tuesday night Watanabe gave up the idea of defecting from the once-dominant party due to the unlikelihood of his garnering a sufficient number of supporters from among LDP members to succeed. The Shinseito-Komeito camp has also explored the possibility of fielding Watanabe, a close friend of Ozawa, as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa, should he bolt from the LDP along with a large number of his followers and join the coalition.
