Al-Majali asserted that Jordan has never thought of sending weapons to any side in Yemen and reiterated that Jordan does not support one side against the other, and that it opposes infighting and believes in dialogue to resolve the bloody crisis in that country. Al-Majli also said that Jordan supports unity and legitimacy in Yemen, that the unity was carried out as a result of the Yemeni people's decision, and that Jordan will continue to believe in that unless the Yemeni people want otherwise. With regard to planes, al-Majali said that Amman had sent Royal Jordanian aircraft, and C-130 transportation planes to evacuate its nationals from Yemen, as well as other European and Asian nationals on humanitarian grounds, and that these aircraft carried nothing other than passengers.
