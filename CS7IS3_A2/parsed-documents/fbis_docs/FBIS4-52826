FBIS4-52826 "dreas093_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 21 Oct 1993 South Korea * DPRK's Foreign Investment Laws, Implications * DPRK's Foreign Investment Laws, Implications 942C0052 Seoul NAEWOE TONGSIN in Korean No 870, 21 Oct 93 942C0052 Seoul NAEWOE TONGSIN Korean CSO [Text] Seoul (NAEWOE) -- Having established three laws including "The Foreigners' Investment Law" last October, North Korea, which has recently been actively pursuing economic cooperation with foreign countries, established three more laws including "The Foreign Exchange Control Law" last February to complement the system related to investment. But it appears to have failed to realize the anticipated results, as usual, due to the poor investment climate and imperfect laws. More than one year after the laws related to foreigners' investments were established, the economic trade group of Nampo City, North Korea, visited the Korean Autonomous Government of Yanbian on the 11th of the month, calling for economic trade and joint ventures. Even last July, Pak Hwa-ryong, Vice-Chairman of Administrative Economic Committee of North Hamkyong Province is said to have visited here to explain the construction of the Chongjin-Najin and Chongjin-Hoeryong Expressways. This means North Korea devotes all its energies to expanding the social overhead capital to invite foreign investment. In addition, it concluded with China an "Economic Trade Cooperation Protocol" the gist of which is to activate border trade, etc., and an "Agreement to Construct Railroads and Harbors on the Tumen," and made a contract for the development of the Najin-Sonbong area which will cost $100 million and involve 21 Russian enterprises, they say. Since the Cooperation Law was established in 1984, North Korea has been said to explain the inactivity of foreign investment as due not only to the poor infrastructure but also to the imperfect investment system. Accordingly, as measures following the three Laws, the "Foreigners' Investment Law," "Joint Venture Law," and "Foreigners' Enterprise Law," which were established last year, North Korea established the "Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law," "Foreign Exchange Control Law," and "Free Economic Trade Zone Law" last February to invite foreign investment, they say. But North Korea's laws on foreign investment are abstract and mutually inconsistent--possibly the general trend of socialist states' laws. The three laws established at the beginning of this year are also seen as more logically complemented and followed by additional legislative measures. Foreigners' Investment Enterprise and Foreigners' Tax Law (Chapter 8, Article 57). This is a basic law related to taxes which should be paid by foreigners' investment enterprises or foreigners performing economic activities within the North Korean territory. It prescribes income-, property-, inheritance-, sales-, and local taxes, as well as related sanctions and exemptions. Because this law has many points conflicting with established cooperation companies' and foreigners' income tax laws and their detailed rules, some provisions of the law seem to lose their validity on the principle of the priority of the new law. The causes of inactivity are inconsistent laws and poor infrastructure. North Korea levies graduated income tax rates on foreign enterprises -- 25% (general area) and 14% (free economic trade zone) of the settled rate of interest. It is known that the law levies lower tax rates than those (30% and 15%) of China, which it views as a rival. And it prescribes that foreigners staying more than one year pay personal income tax on income from outside as well as inside the territory (Article 17). Although North Korea has more favorable tax rates on enterprises than does China, it levies more unfavorable income tax rates on private persons. This seems to negatively influence foreign investment plans. Property tax is levied on buildings, ships and aircraft in North Korea (Article 25). Inheritance tax is levied not only inside but outside of North Korea (Article 31). This seems to be a step to confiscate assets that residents repatriate from Japan and those of Japanese wives residing in North Korea who inherit from their families in Japan. But as the provisions of the law apply to "Korean residents residing outside the territory of the Republic who perform economic activities within its territory," questions are raised as to whether the provisions apply to South Korean enterprises. Because North Korea has thus far insisted politically on the concept of "One Korea," the territory of the "Republic" as the whole Korean peninsula, some say that South Korea is included in the territory of the "Republic." In the Cooperation Law, the first law related to foreign investment, its application is to be limited to "foreign enterprises and individuals" and "Korean residents abroad including Korean merchants and industrialists in Japan," clearly eliminating South Korean enterprises from participation. But in the laws on foreigners' investments established after last year, the subject of application, unlike the Cooperation Law, is prescribed to be "Korean residents residing outside of the territory of the Republic." Accordingly, a dominant opinion is that it allows South Korean enterprises (and individuals) to participate. A noticeable problem is how North Korea interprets this in connection with the idea of "One Korea." In addition, even if South Korean enterprises are subject to the laws in the same way as foreign enterprises, a question is raised as to which of the two, the North-South Fundamental Agreement or these laws, is applied to South Korean enterprises when the North levies taxes. It is prescribed in the laws that foreign enterprises and individuals should observe the agreement concluded by their government and North Korea's government on taxes when the agreement is different from the laws (Article 17). In relation to this provision, when the North-South Joint Economic Cooperation Committee concludes agreements on dual taxation prevention and investment promotion, will such an exception in the laws be applied even to South Korean enterprises? Because the North-South Fundamental Agreement is applicable, the North and South are in "a special relationship which is not one between nations." If South Korean enterprises are not subject to the exceptional provision (Article 17) of the law due to the special relationship, they may have more unfavorable liability to taxation than other countries. Free Economic Trade Zone Law (Chapter 7, Article 43). This is a basic law that regulates foreign investment in the Najin-Sonbong area, which is called a small golden triangle, and another free economic trade zone which will be designated in the future. The law prescribes the authority and duties of an agency to manage the area, maintenance of circumstances for economic activities, tariffs, currency, finance, security and preference, and settlement of disputes, etc. The law reflects North Korea's intentions to make good use of the free economic trade zone as a window for opening their economy by bestowing tax privileges on business activities and opening up foreign exchange markets to foreigners within the zone. The law stipulates that the organizations which develop and manage the zone are the Foreign Economic Committee of the central government and the local authorities. By the suggestion that the central government is one organization which controls and leads the open-economy policy, it has been made clear what organization takes charge of the policy. Because the law mandates that foreign enterprises should, even in the zone, employ and dismiss manpower on contracts made with North Korean manpower supply organizations, inflexibility of labor management has been raised as a major potential problem. And every account must settled in Korean "Won" or convertible foreign currency. This will mean North Korea will aim at collecting foreign currency. Foreign Exchange Control Law (Chapter 4, Article 31). This law outlines the general rules and system of foreign currency transactions, foreign securities issues, movement of foreign currency in and out of the country, securities and precious metals, etc. Carrying foreign currency into the country is not limited. But approval by the foreign currency management agency is required for its removal, except for currency reported when entering the country and foreign currency within the free economic trade zone. This seems to be aimed at increasing foreign exchange reserves. Foreign investment enterprises are strictly required to keep accounts with the Trade Bank or banks designated by the foreign currency management agency and report their foreign exchange situation to the agency quarterly and annually. This system means that foreign enterprises should raise their necessary foreign exchange by exporting or borrowing from foreign countries, and they cannot systematically convert Korean Won profit made in the domestic market to hard currency. Even in the three laws established this year, there appears the intention of North Korea to carry forward only "an open-door policy under strict control," under the closed and rigid structure as usual. Even if the laws related to foreign investment are improved, as long as the economic structure and system are not reformed, the investment climate will not materialize, and accordingly, the success of an open-economy policy cannot be expected.
