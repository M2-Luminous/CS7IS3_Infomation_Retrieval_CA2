In the course of an hour the two politicians discussed the changes in East Europe and Bulgaria after their previous meeting four years ago. Dr. Zhelev arrived here yesterday to attend the UNESCO commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews. The analysis of the ways in which France and the Western democracies could assist economic reform in Bulgaria and help it overcome the negative consequences of the Yugo-embargo and the Yugo-crisis revealed the decisive importance of foreign investment, access to Western markets and modern infrastructure. Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans and in respect to the different ethnic and religious groups in this country was assessed as worthy of respect and meeting European standards and principles. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he believed France's parliament would soon ratify Bulgaria's Europe agreement. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing also believes that French private capital is now experiencing an upsurge and may take leading positions in East European markets and industry. More than 300 representatives of France's political elite, academic and business circles responded to the invitation of the French Institute of International Relations and gathered at the French Automobile Club to hear President Zhelev's lecture and to ask him questions about Bulgaria's foreign investment regulations and its economic and foreign policy. In his lecture, titled "Bulgaria Today," Dr. Zhelev focused on the present state of this country's economy, the prospects for its future development and the possibilities it provides for foreign investment. For Bulgaria there is no alternative to intensive structural adjustment of the economy, President Zhelev said. Foreign investment, modern infrastructure and access to foreign markets are of decisive importance for this country today. Dr. Zhelev described foreign capital as the most important factor for this country's economic progress against the background of consumption and accumulation slump, export shrinkage and production stagnation. Though foreign investment alone would not solve these problems, without such investment all solutions would be incomplete from the technological point of view, said the President. Dr. Zhelev recalled Bulgaria's liberal investment regulations, guaranteed by this country's Constitution and laws. The low price of labour in Bulgaria, its well-trained and highly qualified work force and traditionally strong positions on the markets of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East and its geographical location at the crossroads between the East and the West are among Bulgaria's other advantages, according to Dr. Zhelev. But despite all this Bulgaria is still regarded by foreign business as a relatively high risk country, he said. President Zhelev listed the negative consequences of the war in the former Yugoslavia for Bulgaria. One of them is fear to invest which foreign investors mechanically transfer to countries neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] Without expecting streams of foreign capital, we are convinced that investment in this country will mark a considerable growth this and next year, the President said, citing the recently signed standby agreement with the IMF and the forthcoming agreement with the London Club, the stepping up of privatization in this country and the expected change in the business climate and economic recovery. Bulgaria is a good place to invest today, President Zhelev concluded. Information on Bulgaria's radical economic reforms and on possible ways to encourage foreign trade and foreign investment was met with great interest. Prospects for Bulgaria's participation in European and regional economic structures were also under discussion. Asked to comment on the "comeback" of Russian diplomacy to Europe through the crisis in Bosnia, Dr Zhelev said he was pleased with the unity of action between Russia and NATO to end fighting in Bosnia. He expressed hope that it is the prototype of future cooperation in the interests of European security. The NATO ultimatum had decisive impact; its success was largely the result of France's firm principled stance and its active commitment to international peacekeeping efforts, Dr. Zhelev said. [passage omitted] Participants in the discussion drew the conclusion that the orientation of Bulgaria's foreign policy to integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures is distinct and clear-cut and receives broad support from Bulgarian institutions and society.
