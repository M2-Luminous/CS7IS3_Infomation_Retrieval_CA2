Katyal: "India Will Foil Any Destabilisation Bid"] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 21. While giving an optimistic account of the gains of the recent past in economic and political areas, the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, today noted with concern Pakistan's activities and their fall-out in the bilateral field. Pakistan's support to terrorism and subversion in Jammu and Kashmir and its anti-India activities world-wide had hampered seriously efforts at normalising relations, he said. In his address to the members of the two Houses of Parliament, marking the beginning of the Budget session, Dr. Sharma recalled the Prime Minister's offer of dialogue to Pakistan, aimed at establishing good-neighbourly relations in terms of the Shimla Agreement. Bilateral talks had since taken place, he said, but the stridency of Pakistan's anti-India statements had grown, -- with its adverse consequences. He wanted Pakistan to give up its negative approach and reciprocate India's desire for normalising ties. The President, obviously, had in mind Pakistan's anti-India move at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva as part of its efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue, affecting adversely the process of dialogue. In a ringing categorical tone, the President observed: "Jammu and Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and we shall foil any attempt to destabilise it either from across the border or from any other quarter." This was not the first time that such a statement emanated from the top, but it had a special meaning now -- as a message to Pakistan in the midst of its stepped-up campaign to annex the State through devious, dishonest means, based on the human rights cry. Dealing with firm steps by police and security forces to counter terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Sharma said "every effort is made to see that the maximum restraint is exercised on the use of force. Whenever there has been any incident suggesting excessive use of force, an inquiry has been promptly instituted and action taken." This was meant for those accusing India of human rights violations. External relations accounted for a small portion of the President's address, but were the subject of sharp, specific, significant formulations. The reference to India's relations with the U.S., for instance, stressed the positive and not the negative which, as we know, had led to strains. Dealing with interaction with the U.S. in several areas, ranging from education and science and technology to culture and sports, and cooperation on the issue of a comprehensive test ban treaty, he said: "The response from the United States to our economic liberalisation policies had been very positive and the U.S. investments in India in the last two years were very substantial. We look forward to working with the United States towards mutual understanding, including on those issues on which such understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the vibrant democratic and secular ideals of our two countries." Then there was satisfaction over the course of relationship with China -- with particular reference to efforts for peace and tranquillity along the border -- with Russia -- "despite certain difficulties, cooperation in political, economic, commercial and other areas was sought to be promoted by both sides" -- the new era of cooperation with ASEAN, increased economic interaction with the Gulf countries and the European Union. As regards the domestic scene, Dr. Sharma referred to steady progress on all fronts as evidenced by the improved law and order situation, a record foodgrain output, containment of the rate of inflation at a single digit level, comfortable foreign exchange reserves, reduction in the trade gap, buoyancy in exports, improved performance in essential areas of the infrastructural sector, and increased inflow of foreign investment. All these had symbolised and justified "this emerging optimism.... We have regained our elan internally and our confidence globally." The gains of last year in Punjab had been consolidated, he said. As regards the Ayodhya issue, the President contrasted the situation at the beginning of last year with that obtaining now. "There was a great deal of concern over the possible fall-out of the demolition and the riots that followed. The grim predictions that were being made have proved wrong. The atmosphere has improved considerably and we can hope for a lasting solution to the dispute." The Government, according to him, "would take appropriate measures in the light of the opinion of the Supreme Court." Dealing with economic reforms, the President referred to the momentum gained since 1991. Still much more needed to be done, he noted, adding: "The reform is an irreversible and continuous process and needs to be implemented with determination and foresight, keeping the responses and circumstances in the country constantly in view. We shall hasten with care."
