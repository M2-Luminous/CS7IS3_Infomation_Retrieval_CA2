According to the Belarusian prime minister, the pact consists of two parts; only seven articles were put in force at the time of the signing. They relate, in particular, to the lifting of customs duties on Belarusian goods exported to Russia. Russia's losses in this case will not exceed its expenditures for maintaining Russian troops on Belarusian territory as well as for transporting industrial cargo, oil, gas, etc. The strongest difference of opinion in the process of signing arose during the discussion of the second part of the agreement, which is related directly to the creation of the monetary union and comes into conflict with Article 145 of the Belarusian Constitution. Kebich told journalists that Belarusian people's deputies will have to consider introducing amendments to the Constitution in force, which will deprive the Belarusian Central Bank of being first to determine money issuing policy on the territory of Belarus, and will transfer this function, as well as some others, to the Russian Central Bank. In the event of Supreme Soviet's refusal to carry out such manipulations [as received] with the Constitution, Kebich intends to launch a national referendum on this issue. The Belarusian prime minister also informed of the free-of-interest credit in the amount of 200 million rubles, which will be granted to Belarus in the first half of 1994 for balancing the monetary systems of both countries. In the event of the cancellation of the agreement, this sum must be returned to Russia. "This is a choice of my life. I have made it and I do not feel sorry about it," Kebich stated. By now, the final word rests with the Belarusian parliament, because a real rapprochement of the two Slav states can be achieved only after the ratification of the agreement and the introduction of amendments to the Constitution.
