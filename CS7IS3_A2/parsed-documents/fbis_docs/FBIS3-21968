Police and customs agents confiscated roughly 20 kilograms of hashish, a record 3.3 kilograms of amphetamines, and 200 grams of cocaine in 1993, with the above-cited monetary figure based on a 15 percent catch rate for illegal drug smugglers and current street prices for the poison. "It's often been said that we ferret out and confiscate from 10 to 15 percent of the substances that enter the country. Whether this is right I dare not comment on, but it is clear that we fail to stop all but a fraction of what comes to Iceland," daily DV [Reykjavik DAGVISIR] quoted narcotics officer Gudmundur Baldursson as saying. Baldursson said the surprising drop in cocaine seizures--a mere 200 grams was snatched in 1993, compared to 1.3 kilograms the previous year--was likely attributable to the economic recession and the drug's high street price.
