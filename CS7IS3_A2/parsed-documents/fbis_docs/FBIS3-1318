The USTN is demanding the cancellation of the ordinance banning workers' right to go on strike, and a 30 to 50 percent salary increase. The USTN organized a rally at the Place de la Concertation today before conducting a peaceful march to the prime minister's office, where its leaders presented workers' grievances to the premier's permanent undersecretary. A large contingent of security forces supervised the demonstration, and no incidents were reported. The strike seems to have been widely followed in the capital despite various orders given to workers to report for work. In Zinder, the strike was widely followed but the peaceful march failed. According to the NIGER NEWS AGENCY [ANP], only about 50 labor activists joined the march organized by the local USTN secretary general. In Diffa, the strike call was widely followed, the local ANP correspondent noted. The march was also a success and union activists chanted slogans hostile to the ordinance on the right to go on strike. Meanwhile, several labor unions, particularly the National Union of Commerce Workers, have sent motions to the USTN expressing their unflinching support for the USTN and calling on their activists to respect and follow the strike call. The Autonomous Union of Magistrates has also expressed total moral support for the USTN in its demand for salary increases and for payment of salary arrears. It called on the USTN and the government to find a solution to the dispute over the law ratifying the bill on the right to go on strike. The Executive Bureau of the Union of National Administration School Students, after analyzing the situation, regretted the showdown between the various parties and called on the government and the USTN to show a higher degree of patriotism by making every effort to give priority to dialogue in finding a solution to the problem. It urged members of parliament to fully play their role as people's representatives by helping to ease all tensions. The union also called on Nigerois to be aware of the various dangers that are looming and threatening our dear country. The National Executive Bureau of the Union of Youth, Culture, and Sports Workers also reminded some officials that the exceptional period and the period of intimidation are gone for ever. It gave its unwavering support to the USTN's struggle and urgently appealed to all its activists to heed the strike call.
