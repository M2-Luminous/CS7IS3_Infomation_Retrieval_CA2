Out of respect for the Slovak public and following a personal conversation with Marta Simeckova, the Bratislava representative of Amnesty International, J.S. Monroe, pledged already last year that he would personally plead for the revision of the verdict. This happened in March of this year and in April Martinez was released from prison. "Cuba did this as a friendly gesture toward the Slovak Republic," J.S. Monroe said. That is why he considers yesterday's demonstration, as well as the previous March demonstration, inappropriate interference in the Slovak-Cuban dialogue.
