In the early 1980s, New Helmsman Deng Xiaoping told foreigners he had no worries because his two lieutenants, then party boss Hu Yaobang and then premier Zhao Ziyang could "prevent the heavens from falling". Can President and party General Secretary Jiang hold up the sky? Events since late last year have shown that Mr Jiang, who is also Chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and head of the party's Leading Group on Finance and Economics, has been less than adept at preventing the ship of state from lunging first to port, then to starboard. Such flip-flops include Beijing's half-hearted pursuit of the austerity programme in the third quarter of 1993 and so far this year. Western economists have also been baffled by the authorities' lily-livered efforts to restructure the ailing state enterprises. Calls made last November for radical surgery have metamorphosed into Premier Li Peng's warning last week "not to draw an equation mark between state-owned firms and economically inefficient enterprises". Cynics have cited Mr Jiang's lack-lustre performance as party boss and mayor of Shanghai from 1986 to 1989 and his uneventful stint in the Ministry of Electronics from 1982 to 1985. An equally plausible explanation, however, may be that Mr Jiang, who is also the head of the party's Leading Group on Taiwan Affairs and Honorary President of the China Software Industry Association, might be too busy pursuing portfolios and peddling influence. Analysts were flabbergasted to learn last month that the supremo had put one more feather in his cap: Honorary Chairman of the China Red Cross. Attempts, however, by Mr Jiang to draw the 3.2 million-strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) into his fiefdom have raised the most eyebrows. Beijing tabled bills this month specifying that the CMC chairman must be a cadre without military insignia, and that the position of first-grade general be abolished. This was interpreted as a move to shore up Mr Jiang, who has no army credentials. In addition to installing cronies to key PLA slots, Mr Jiang has pulled out all the stops to ensure the loyalty of the People's Armed Police (PAP). Since Tiananmen Square, the brief of the PAP, whose strength is estimated at 800,000, has been changed to quelling "internal disorders". The para-military force has thus become a potent weapon in the post-Deng power struggle. PAP Commander Ba Zhongtan, a Jiang appointee, scandalised his less-politicised colleagues recently by asserting that the first duty of his force was to "protect party and state leaders", an unsubtle reference to mentor Mr Jiang. Analysts said General Ba's statement was tantamount to former Chief Political Commissar General Yang Baibing's claim in 1992 that the PLA's main task was to provide "an imperial escort" for Mr Deng's southern China tour, when radical reform initiatives were unveiled. Though Mr Jiang is but a helmsman in waiting, he and his personal office have built up a personality cult worthy of that of Great Helmsman Mao Zedong. After Mr Jiang's "triumphant summit" with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last November, PLA commissars urged the generals to heap praise in internal meetings on the statesmanlike exploits of the "President of the Republic". Last June, Mr Jiang fired the chief editors of the People's Liberation Army Daily for lese-majeste, putting his interview with CNN on the back page. During this year's Lunar New Year, Mr Jiang hosted a banquet for the editors of the national media in an apparent effort to boost his already ubiquitous profile. Chinese journalists say that not since Chairman Mao has a top cadre issued so many personal directives to newspapers and TV stations. The President's most recent instruction to party and media is reportedly an eight-point exhortation on preventing unrest, boosting agriculture, pacifying laid-off workers, and curbing corruption. Yet like all Jiang-inspired propaganda, the edict bore this overriding theme: highlight the president's status as the "core" of the new leadership and Mr Deng's anointed heir. Which leads us to a paradox in recent Chinese history: unlike Mr Hu or Mr Zhao, Mr Jiang was not Mr Deng's personal choice as successor. In the heady days of the 1989 "turmoil", Mr Deng acquiesced in the recommendation of conservative elders such as Li Xiannian and Chen Yun that "trustworthy Marxist" Mr Jiang took over from Mr Zhao. From then till the death of his chief patron Mr Li in mid-June, Mr Jiang displayed his expertise at what the Chinese call fengpei ("Wind Faction") politics by bending now with the New Helmsman and now with the former state president. His "protege's" failure to help propagate a new wave of reform was a key reason why Mr Deng needed to go south in early 1992 to proselytize to Guangdong's capitalist roaders. Luck, which is as important to Mr Jiang's rise as palace intrigues, however, is with the president. After Mr Li's death, the Wind Faction affiliate knew his fate was linked with that of Mr Deng. And Mr Jiang began at least to make the right noises about market reforms. A senior Chinese source said if Mr Li had died a year later -- and Mr Jiang gone on with his duplicitous game of pleasing two masters -- Mr Deng would have dumped him in late 1992 or early 1993. By late 1993, however, a pathetically frail Mr Deng had become a hostage of history. With "stability" uppermost in his mind, the patriarch could not but continue to funnel support to one of the few leaders who had sworn he would never overturn the verdict on June 4. Also by then, however, it had become apparent that the mantle thrust upon Mr Jiang was way too big for the 68-year-old. It is Mr Jiang who, playing fengpai politics to the hilt, is responsible for some of the most maddening tergiversations in policy. The first signal that the retrenchment policy of Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was being watered down came when, visiting southern China last September, Mr Jiang told the local "warlords" they could again go for no-holds-barred development. On the eve of the watershed party Third Plenum last November, a pro-Beijing paper in Hong Kong trumpeted how Mr Jiang helped to "liberate our thoughts" by no longer insisting that state enterprises be the mainstay of the economy. The shift to bailing out the dinosaurs, however, was also made by Mr Jiang, who told cadres in Shanxi province in February that Beijing would "provide necessary assistance and support" to the country's least efficient sector.
