He addressed on Tuesday an international conference on Russia's federal structure and the implementation of the principles of pluralistic democracy, rule-of-law state and human rights. Federalisation does not mean the weakening of the state. It means an opportunity to combine rich potentials of all regions and democratic unification of society, Shakhray said. A new form of state structure has emerged and is developing. The notion of federalism includes economic and territorial aspects. The new constitution ensures equal rights of all subjects of the federation, Shakhray said. He pointed to the importance of working out various forms in integration within Russia. The initial experience in this respect is the activity of interregional economic associations in whose framework subjects with different status interact. The constitution laid down the principles of self-regulation of the federation, the minister said. Preserving Russia's character it registered the possibility of regulating processes of the separation of powers by federal and other treaties. It deals with matters that are in the competence of subjects and joint competence of central authorities and regions. A treaty with Tatarstan that may be concluded today is based on these articles of the constitution. Prevention and settlement of ethnic conflicts is the priority task, the minister said. He believes these conflicts are caused by redivision of power, of property, by organised crime. Shakhray said the ethnic form of conflicts is a most convenient camouflage for real aims of certain political forces. The Russian Federation is the common house where there is room for all forms of self-organisation -- republics, regions, autonomies, Shakhray said.
