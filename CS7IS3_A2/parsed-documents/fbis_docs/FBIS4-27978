"We will first try as far as possible to discuss the issue of possible sanctions (against North Korea) within the U.N. framework," said Hajime Funada, a ranking official in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a key component in the ruling coalition. "But... there is a possibility of our taking measures outside the U.N. framework in the event of an emergency," he told a press luncheon. "I don't think we can give up that option." But Funada, a protege of Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's backroom political deal maker, said Tokyo will do all it can to encourage Pyongyang to allay suspicions over its nuclear program within the bounds of its Constitution, which bans the use of force in resolving international disputes. On domestic politics, Funada showed interest in Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal for voluntary resignation of the Hata cabinet after passage of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget through the Diet. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the second largest opposition party, made the proposal as a prerequisite for opening talks on the SDP's return to the coalition. "This is a rescue boat for us," Funada said. "Whether or not a voluntary resignation is possible in real politics, we must seriously weigh the possibility of taking some action close to it," he noted, referring to a potential, full-scale cabinet shakeup to bring the SDP back to the fold. The SDP walked out of the governing alliance in late April in protest against the sudden formation by other coalition partners of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, a move that forced Hata to form the first minority government since 1955.
