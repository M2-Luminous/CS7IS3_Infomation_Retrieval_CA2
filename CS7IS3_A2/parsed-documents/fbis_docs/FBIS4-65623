Surveying the media situation in Berlin, the 25 April DER SPIEGEL weekly magazine noted that cumulative readership loss by Berlin newspapers in the last three years exceeds 250,000, a trend not even reversed by the Springer Verlag's flagship, DIE WELT, which, after moving its offices to Berlin, had 1993 losses of 70 million German marks [DM]. Eleven newspapers are competing for Berlin's readership and advertising revenue, making it "Germany's roughest and most chaotic press market." DER SPIEGEL speculated that "the combatants are thinking of the dazzling twenties, when 60 dailies were published in the national capital...," noting that government ministries, offices and associations are still in Bonn, while the "legions of educated officials everyone dreamed of," as well as a strong intellectual milieu, are lacking in Berlin. DER SPIEGEL also reports that Germany's largest publishers, Axel Springer Verlag and Gruner and Jahr, have invested triple-digit millions in the Berlin market, which an unnamed expert sees as a "warmup run for the year 2000," when the national government is due to complete its move from Bonn to Berlin. Circulation Losses and Promotion The 17 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that a recent meeting of its stockholders expressed concern about its Berlin-based subsidiary, Deutsche Zeitungsverlag GmbH, publisher of NEUE ZEIT. The latter daily, once the organ of the GDR's Christian Democratic Union, has a circulation of only 33,000 (compared to the 1990 figure of 104,000). The paper lost double-digit millions in 1993, and despite "widely recognized journalistic achievement and the redesign of the newspaper"--its unique blue newsprint and expanded eastern coverage, for example--its hoped for break-even point is expected in four years at the earliest. The report in DER SPIEGEL noted that despite costly promotional offers and extensive revisions in format, smaller publishers are having a hard time sustaining themselves in the current business environment: DER TAGESPIEGEL, a conservative and venerable daily, estimated it would reach 450,000 circulation after unification, equaling its 1946 level, but circulation has stagnated at about 130,000. The DM100 million invested in its staff and new printing plant have led to annual losses in double-digit millions, and the new press has been sold to Springer Verlag. Although a new Gruner and Jahr plant is being built in Berlin, DER SPIEGEL observed "there is a shortage of material for so great a capacity. The eastern Berliners' initial enthusiasm for newspapers from the west is gone." So, too, is the enthusiasm for the daily BERLINER ZEITUNG, the former Socialist Unity Party [SED] Berlin bezirk organ, a favorite of old former party members: its circulation has fallen from 303,000 at unification to about 250,000, as reported in IVW circulation bureau figures. Erich Boehme, one-time editor in chief of DER SPIEGEL, in his fourth year as publisher of the BERLINER ZEITUNG, was cited in the paper's 25 March issue as saying: "I want to get a foothold in western Berlin," claiming as inducements the impending introduction of a larger weekend edition and color presses and the expansion of the business section. Victims in the Competition According to DER SPIEGEL, six Berlin newspapers have folded since Germany's unification in 1990, and a longtime daily, the SPANDAUER VOLKSBLATT, has become a weekly. The end may be near for NEUE ZEIT; JUNGE WELT, once the central paper for the SED's youth corps; and for the one-time SED national organ, NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, which suffered a drop in circulation from 1.5 million to 80,000, and is being kept afloat by donations. The left-leaning western daily, TAGESZEITUNG, just celebrated its 15th anniversary and dismissed its editor in chief for writing that the editors had become too well-behaved and conservative. With circulation stagnating at 60,000, down from the 1990 figure of 100,000, and only 3,500 copies being sold in the east, the newspaper chose to make its editor a "victim of the rock-hard competition in the capital's media market," and to replace him with a former VOGUE editor, in the hope of succeeding in a media market changing "as fast as men's necktie styles."
