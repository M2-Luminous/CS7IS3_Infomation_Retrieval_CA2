FBIS4-11438 "drlat082_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 MEXICO Companies Seek More Trade Opportunities With Cuba Companies Seek More Trade Opportunities With Cuba PA2704023694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 22 Apr 94 p 10 PA2704023694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO Spanish BFN [By Claudia Villegas] [Text] Havana, 21 Apr -- More than 40 Mexican companies will begin trading with Cuba because of all that country has to offer, declared Diego Fernandez Roos, head of the CEMAI [Mexican Businessmen's Council for International Affairs] Latin America Coordination Committee. During the 11th full session of the Mexican-Cuban Businessmen's Commission, the CEMAI established closer ties between Mexican businessmen and Cuban authorities to make the initial contacts that will allow more trade between the countries. In an interview with EL FINANCIERO near the end of the businessmen's visit to Cuba, Fernandez Roos declared that there is a lot of disinformation about Cuba's economic situation and its capacity to become a real trading partner with Mexico. Trade between Mexico and Cuba currently amounts to only $150 million with a positive balance in favor of Mexican businesses. The chemical, agricultural and livestock, health, and construction sectors are among the most attractive areas for investment. The CEMAI representative believes political issues should not affect the choice of an export destination, as is the case with Cuba. One of the most important companies participating in this business meeting is Jugos de Valle, a corporation that considers Cuba to be among its most attractive export markets. Manuel Albarran, director of the company's international development department, asserted that any company that is planning to go to international operations should consider Cuba because it is practically a "virgin" market. He said the prospects for introducing bottled drinks to the island are particularly interesting because they imply introducing new products into the consumption patterns of the Cuban people, a market of more than 12 million people. Albarran, who described the 11th meeting of the Mexican-Cuban Businessmen's Committee as a complete "success," declared that Jugos del Valle has not ruled out the possibility of making direct investments in Cuba. Diego Fernandez explained that Cuba is ripe for foreign investment and asserted that Fidel Castro's government is seeking to widen the island's economic opening. He added that although the CEMAI has held 10 meetings between Mexican businessmen and Cuban authorities, there has never been so much interest shown by the two parties to increase commercial relations. Aside from the Cuban Government's large investments in Mexican corporations such as Cemex, Television Azteca, and Mexipetrol, there are midsize companies that view Cuba as an interesting trading partner able to fulfill its payment commitments. The National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), in collaboration with the CEMAI, sent invitations to Mexican companies interested in negotiating with Cuba, which has faced a U.S. Government economic embargo for more than two decades. Francisco Callarisa Salcedo, sales director of the Mac'Ma group -- cookies and pasta makers -- declared the Cuban market could become an important consumer of Mexican products. He added that it seemed illogical that although Mexico is only a two-hour flight from the island and only a day and a half by boat, countries like Spain -- Cuba's second largest commercial partner -- and France are conducting such a large amount of business with the Caribbean nation. Optimistic about statements Cuban authorities will make at the "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting, the first held since the Cuban Revolution, Mexican businessmen are convinced that Cuba is going through a period of change in which Mexico must participate. "The Nation and the Emigrants" meeting begins today with the attendance of Cuban emigrant organizations such as Cuba Libre and with the certainty that Fidel Castro, the island's leader, has not suffered any attack, according to reports from Cuban Government sources. Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina will for the first time address Cuban emigrants, most of whom live in the United States, on the topic: "The Relationship between the Nation and the Emigrants: Current Status and Prospects."
