The statement says that Thailand would like to reject the accusation because Thailand has a firm policy of recognizing the elected Cambodian Government and noninterference in Cambodia's internal affairs by not providing any assistance to the Khmer Rouge. The Cambodian side should send evidence to the Thai side if it has any evidence to support the accusation. The Thai side is ready to take appropriate action in this regard. If Cambodia cannot solve its internal problems and accuses another country of supporting any particular faction, it is incorrect and inappropriate.
