The Cuban foreign minister, who was stopping over in this city on his way back to Havana, has just visited Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay. He said: "It was an opportunity to better explain our situation and to learn more about the reality of the American continent, which now more than ever needs to be united." The foreign minister told PRELA that the objective of this visit was to explain what Cuba can contribute to the continent and what Cuba can receive from the region. He announced that businessmen from these four nations will begin visiting the island in the next few days. Robaina pointed out how convenient it is for Cuban diplomacy to reflect the needs of national reality. He also pointed out that the most important need nowadays is to find economic opportunity. To this end, he said that the natural stage for Cuba is Latin America, which Havana has always wanted to rescue and from which it was almost artificially cut. He underscored that it is very important for the Caribbean nation to explain that our plan has not only shortcomings and weaknesses but has also made many contributions. As an example, he cited the influx of foreign capital, because the country has raw materials, infrastructure, and a work force with great cultural, technical, and scientific qualifications. He believes that the basic priority for the subcontinent is economic integration, which will be discussed at the next Ibero-American Summit in June in Cartagena, Colombia. We can no longer continue to see how some countries are meeting and solving their problems due to their resources and geographic locations, while we, the poor ones, are more divided than ever and are being ignored during the distribution process, Robaina added. As he delved deeply into the issue during his visit to these countries, Robaina said that beyond the differing opinions made public in the last few months, there was some progress made in Argentina on the projects that the two nations can embark on together. As for Paraguay, the foreign minister stressed that Havana is not on the road to establishing diplomatic ties. He added, however, that his visit opened a door and that the island now has more friends in the Paraguayan political and socioeconomic arenas. As for the upcoming "Nation and Emigration" talks that will be held this weekend in Havana with members of the Cuban community living abroad, Robaina said that it is a natural step and recalled that most countries maintain relations with their citizens who live beyond their borders. He said the objective of the meeting is not to rescue the nation, as some have speculated, because Cuba has much more important priorities. He underscored: "We are not willing to let that community be used as an instrument against the island." To this effect, Robaina explained that dialogue opens the path to ensuring that "the communication that must exist comes from us and that others can no longer manipulate it."
