One of popular Ukrainian lawmakers, Mikhail Kosiv from Lvov, whose opinion is heeded by various segments of population, calmed down Ukrainians by saying that the Crimea would not join Russia. Kosiv who repeatedly visited the peninsula, gave a staggering forecast. He said that the Crimea will belong to Tatars in future, since every second newborn baby now is a Tatar. In Kosiv's opinion, Turkey is also interested in Tatars' domination of the peninsula: Over 500,000 Crimean Tatars now live in Turkey, and they helped and continue to help their countrymen on the peninsula. "If we also take into account such a factor as the Ukrainian Fleet on the Black Sea and Ukrainian bases in the Crimea, there will be no problems for Ukraine in that area," Kosiv concluded his forecast. Yuriy Shukhevich, right-wing leader of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defence, who is no less popular in Ukraine's western region than Kosiv, claims that Israel is interested in the Peninsula very much. "Remember that Jews always dreamt of their own autonomy back in the Soviet Union but in the Crimea rather than in Birobidzhan," he said. "Therefore, I believe that Israel's influence will grow there." In Shukhevich's opinion, the destiny of the Crimea will be decided not in Simferopol or Sevastopol but in Kiev where, as he believes, there is no firm presidential power for the time being.
