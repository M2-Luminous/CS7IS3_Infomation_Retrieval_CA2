FBIS3-33768 "drnes021_c_94010" FBIS-NES-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Feb 1994 Egypt AL-SHA'B Links Presidential Secretary to Fraud NC3001104494 NC3001104494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 21 January publishes two articles charging government officials of involvement in illicit dealings involving Fawzi al-Sayyid, a discredited construction contractor. The first article, a 300-word report by Mahmud Bakri, appears on the front page. Bakri writes: "New scandals are coming to light with regards to the illicit dealings of Fawzi al-Sayyid, Madinat al-Nasir multimillionaire. Al-Sayyid's illegal practices were committed with the help of National Democratic Party [NDP] officials, police officers, and members of the People's Assembly and Consultative Council. Al-Sayyid has been involved in various activities besides construction in the period 1985-90. Some security officials have concealed a report prepared by government circles about the multimillionaire's activities in this regard. In return, these officials accepted substantial kickbacks from al-Sayyid. Bakri adds that al-Sayyid transferred a large part of his financial assets abroad after "his relations with an official in the Presidential Office deteriorated." The reason for the strained relations was that the said official, whom Bakri declines to name, wanted al-Sayyid to foot most of the bill for land that the official bought in Ismailia and the Red Sea area. The second article, an 800-word report by 'Imad Mahjub, appears on the front and seventh pages. Mahjub begins by reviewing the career of the Presidential Office's secretary Zakariya 'Azmi and stating that "questions" remain about 'Azmi's dealings, despite the "smokescreen" he hoped to raise by filing a complaint against AL-SHA'B with the Public Prosecution Office. 'Azmi, Mahjub claims, owns a 10-million pound [$3 million] mansion, despite his humble beginnings as a junior employee in Cairo's municipal service. The mansion was built "by a certain contractor who has won other government contracts, including the mansions of ministers and senior government officials." 'Azmi also acquired various types of properties in the names of his family members and only won in the People's Assembly elections because of heavy support by the government apparatus. Mahjub then relates the story of a piece of land that ended up in the hands of Madinat al-Nasr multimillionaire al-Sayyid, after being owned before by a Greek immigrant and then a drug dealer. Mahjub claims that "a very senior official" helped al-Sayyid assume possession of the 6-million pound piece of land. Mahjub then claims that the government intends to stop investigations into al-Sayyid's and similar fraud cases "in order to save the necks of senior officials who are clearly involved in these cases." Mahjub then describes al-Sayyid's comfortable confinement in a prison hospital and predicts that he will be "released on bail in a few days, after which the storm will blow over and the case will be declared closed for good."
