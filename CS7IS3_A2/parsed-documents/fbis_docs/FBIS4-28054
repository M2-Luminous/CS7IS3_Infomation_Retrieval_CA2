The higher level of minimum taxable income should also provide relief. According to the new ordinance signed by the National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh on 19 May and taking effect on 3 June, a Vietnamese national is liable to pay tax on his income when it exceeds 1.2 million dong monthly. The percentage of tax will then rise to 10 percent increment to a maximum of 60 percent. This represents a more liberal figure as compared to the decree of 1st April 1991, when tax started at 650,000 Vietnamese dong, and a top end bracket of 80 percent. The liberalization also applies to foreigners who will be taxed 10 percent on monthly income of over 5 million dong as opposed to the previous 3 million.
