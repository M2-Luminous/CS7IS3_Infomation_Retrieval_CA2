Only a month later did the members of the Environment Committee hear that there had been a leak of radioactive water. A growing number of worrying aspects of the way Russia handles its nuclear reactors and nuclear waste on the Kola Peninsula are coming to light in similar ways. "The more we look into the problem of nuclear waste on the Kola Peninsula, the more we have come to realize how enormous is the cleanup operation that must be carried out and how small a role Norway can actually play. An international mobilization is needed to solve the problems." So said Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal who also wants a more dramatic appeal to public opinion. Norway is trying to get the rest of the world to take an interest in what is happening on the Kola Peninsula which, because it is far from the centers of population in Europe, is not being given priority in the international work on the environment. As part of this work a Norwegian public report has been written on nuclear safety and chemical weapons on the Kola Peninsula. The problem can be summarized as follows: -- There are 150 nuclear-powered military vessels in the Northern Fleet, the majority with two nuclear reactors on board. Some 50 of these have already been phased out, but only on a few has the spent and highly radioactive nuclear fuel been removed from the reactors. -- There are eight nuclear-powered icebreakers which have nowhere to store their nuclear waste. This is therefore being stored on board the ships which are docked in major population centers. -- Safety at the Russian nuclear power stations is poor. On the Kola Peninsula two of the four reactors are of the so-called VVER [light water reactor] type. This type of reactor has been classified as a high-risk reactor by Western experts. -- Russia has dumped nuclear waste and whole reactors in several locations in the Barents Sea. The sunken and damaged submarine, Komsomolets, is also on the sea bed off Bear Island. -- Novaya Zemlya is today Russia's only test site for nuclear weapons. -- According to international disarmament agreements Russia must destroy a large part of its chemical and nuclear arms. This is an operation which could have major environmental consequences if it is not carried out in a manner which ensures safety. The Norwegian foreign minister is unable to give any figure for how much it will cost to make existing reactors safe, build dumps, and clean up after past emissions. "The figure is in any case so large that a Norwegian national budget would not go far," he said. The report estimates the cost of breaking up the 90 submarines which are expected to be ready for scrapping in 1998 at 18 billion kronor. In addition money will be needed to build installations to receive, treat, and store the nuclear waste. According to information from the Russian authorities, the Northern Fleet's storage facility for radioactive waste in Lista Fjord is almost full. If this is true, this is a serious problem, the report states. Long-term storage alone for the reactor sections from the 60 submarines which have been phased out requires 40,000 cubic meters of storage space. So far the Norwegian Government has not given more than 36 million kronor to various environmental projects on the Kola Peninsula -- and 20 million of these went to improvements to safety at the Murmansk nuclear power station. "This is not a reflection of our level of ambition. Our contributions and those of others must be increased many times over," he said. In the last two years the Norwegian and Russian authorities have mounted two joint expeditions to measure radioactivity in the Barents and Kara seas. A third expedition, to the Abrosimov Bay on Novaya Zemlya, will now be undertaken after a long period in which the Russian authorities refused to grant permission. The investigations carried out so far show, however, that radiation in the Barents Sea is very low. It is half the level in the North Sea and the level in the Baltic is 18 times higher. The report nevertheless expresses concern that radioactivity will leak out from the underground tests that have been carried out on Novaya Zemlya. A satellite study which the Norwegian Foreign Policy Institute has carried out has shown three craters between 75 and 250 meters in diameter left by explosions and in another location a whole valley has collapsed. Internal developments in the Soviet Union and later in Russia have led to greater openness about and more attention being paid to the country's environmental problems. But developments have also made it more difficult to solve major national problems. The economic and political situation is unstable and it is more difficult to reach agreement on what priorities are to be adopted. The report's depressing conclusion is that not even with comprehensive international efforts can any rapid solution to these problems be expected.
