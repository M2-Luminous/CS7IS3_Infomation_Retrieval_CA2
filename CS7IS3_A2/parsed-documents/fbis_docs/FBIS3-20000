You said: "Nevroz will be celebrated in homes." What concrete measures will be taken in this direction. [Ocalan] People probably will be called on to stay at home during the day. They should light fires and gather at night. They could also fire guns if that poses no danger. The guerrillas too might carry out particular operations. This too is a form of celebration. Besides, it is not our position that "there must necessarily be a major explosion" on Nevruz. For us, every day is Nevruz. For us, Nevruz is disciplined, tactical work. We are not trying to turn particular days into days of special demonstrations. There are drawbacks in that. People must show understanding of our position, which aims at preventing massacres. There were a few massacres when an effort was made to mark 1 May [Workers Day] as a tradition in Turkey. Our decision is a precaution. That is how it should be seen. But the activities of the guerrillas will continue. [OZGUR GUNDEM] Tansu Ciller made a statement in connection with Nevruz. She said: "We were late this year but next year Nevruz will be declared a national holiday." The SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] and MHP [Nationalist Movement Party] supported this proposal. What is the motive behind this proposal? [Ocalan] [Motherland Party leader] Mesut Yilmaz said: "It is an election bribe." Apparently, this assessment is near the truth. I do not think it came from a serious thought or as a sign of a new process. The elections are nearing and she needs votes. It might have been made with this in mind. [OZGUR GUNDEM] There will be local elections a week after Nevruz. The DEP [Democracy Party] announced that it will have no part in these elections. How would you assess those who are trying to get the votes that would have gone to the DEP? [Ocalan] There are interesting developments in this regard. The DEP has vote-winning potential, on the basis of which a game is being played. In particular, [SHP leader and Deputy Prime Minister] Murat Karayalcin is engaged in a ploy. After the DEP was eliminated from the elections, he is trying to use its vote-winning potential. His statement that "we were thinking of legalizing Nevruz but it did not happen; next year it will be legalized" was partly made to win DEP votes. There are already reports that the immunity of DEP members was lifted to prevent them from participating in the elections. It was linked with speculation on votes. The SHP is acting with duplicity on this issue. It supported a parliamentary commission decision on lifting immunity. And, like Fehmi Isiklar and Feridun Yazar, he is using some Kurds as mediators to win over the Kurdish voters. They are creating particular lobbies to secure these votes for the SHP. While they ask for capital punishment for those who want to remain a bit honest and patriotic, they also ask for votes for the SHP, which passed the execution order. This is duplicity and a dangerous game. We will surely use our right to reply. If they are honest, they should make their position against this warning clear. But it is not admissible that they should first intimidate, jail, and provoke people and then appear in the role of a guardian angel and become part of the game. This is a dangerous path. We warn its authors. We will not lower ourselves to the extent of becoming tools in this game. Such an election game does exist. [OZGUR GUNDEM] Could we learn from you personally about the PKK position on these elections? [Ocalan] Ours is an active boycott of the elections. Anyway, in our view there is a war, not elections. They will never allow an election to be held. They have already taken measures. They have gathered the ballot boxes in villages under the control of village guards. The special warfare units will allow no democratic voting. They will do everything to rig the results in their favor. There is no sense in becoming a tool in such an election. We cannot concede to such a game. We will spoil this election deception that they have organized. I think the DEP too understood this reality, that is, contrary to some claims, the DEP did not withdraw from elections on "Apo's [Abdullah Ocalan] instructions." Rather, DEP people knew very well that they [the Turkish authorities] would not have allowed them to get elected. They took all the necessary measures. We are witnessing an open massacre of democratic people, the denial of every election right. We know the candidates that will now take the DEP's place. Take Cizre: Some 95 percent of the town's population is made up of patriots and democrats. But the RP [Welfare Party] is trying to get Karno, the head of 300 village guards, elected as mayor. Karno has always been a village guard chieftain and has served in the most dangerous special warfare teams. He is not the head of a town, but of a counterguerrilla team. He is a target. He became an RP member. That too was a tactic. They want to strengthen the RP in Kurdistan. This is being done in accordance with a decision made by the General Staff. We will eliminate any candidate, be he from the SHP or any other party, and particularly if he is a candidate from the RP, who wants to get the DEP's votes. Since they have set out to expel us from the elections and massacre us--massacres have indeed happened--we will use our right to resist. I am warning such people. Don't let them say later: "We did not hear" or "We have been given unduly severe punishment." It is clear which side was first to inflict severe punishment. We supported some of the people in the Turkish Parliament who might have been the real voice of the people. They were not PKK members. Despite that, we supported them for their attachment to the people and for hoping that they would speak out about particular demands from the rostrum. We expected nothing more from them. Considering that they are being suppressed and put on trial on charges of treason, we will use the same language against those who will supplant them. We are calling on such people not to become tools in this game. We don't want them to become tools, be it under the guise of the RP or SHP. We are strong. They must know that as our strength increases, they will be severely punished. This is the way we are entering the election period. We will employ the policy of preventing and boycotting the elections as much as our strength allows.
