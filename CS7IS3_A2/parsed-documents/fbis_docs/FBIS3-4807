After emerging from a talk with Hosokawa at the premier's official residence, Ouchi told reporters he called on Hosokawa to discuss the fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the apparent focus of the planned cabinet reshuffle. The DSP leader quoted the premier as saying a cabinet shake-up is necessary to help tackle economic issues such as strained trade ties with Washington and deregulation. The premier also cited as a major reason for the plan growing complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief policy coordinator. Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare minister, was the third leader of a ruling coalition party to be consulted by the premier concerning his plan to reorganize the seven-month-old cabinet, following Takemura and Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama.
