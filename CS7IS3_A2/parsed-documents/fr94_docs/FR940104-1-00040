FR940104-1-00040 FR940104-1-00009 NHTSA's preliminary evaluation of rear-wheel antilock brake systems indicates that such ABSs on light trucks are particularly effective in reducing the number of run-off-road crashes. Analyses of State accident files found that rear-wheel ABS was effective in reducing the risk of such nonfatal rollovers (and side and frontal impacts with fixed objects) for almost every type of truck, under any type of road condition. Reductions of rollovers were typically in the 30&hyph;40 percent range, reductions of side impacts with fixed objects in the 15&hyph;30 percent range, and reductions in frontal impacts with fixed objects in the 5&hyph;20 percent range. The risk of collisions with pedestrians, animals, bicycles, trains, or on-road objects was also significantly reduced, by about 5&hyph;15 percent. A copy of this preliminary evaluation is available in the public docket. NHTSA is continuing to analyze the data and a comprehensive report of the findings will be published at a later date. In the meantime, the agency requests additional information on braking induced loss-of-control crashes and inability-to-stop-in-time crashes from rental fleets, corporate fleets, insurance companies, police officers, and others. This information would assist the agency in its efforts to quantify the benefits from ABSs. Accordingly, the agency requests comments from these organizations and others about their experiences in which drivers of light vehicles have lost control during braking or been unable to stop before a crash. With these considerations in mind, the agency poses the following questions. 1. Based on the available data, what safety benefits would result from the issuance of requirements to prevent or minimize the effect of braking induced loss-of-control crashes or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes? In what types of crashes would these benefits occur? Please provide estimates in terms of accidents, injuries, and fatalities prevented. The agency also requests quantitative estimates of reductions in property damage. 2. What additional injury and non-injury data and other information exist about real-world crashes and near crashes involving drivers of light vehicles who skidded or otherwise lost control? 3. At the time of loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes, what were the driving conditions and weather environment? At what speed was the vehicle traveling? Was the roadway dry, wet, or icy? To what degree did these adverse driving conditions contribute to the crash and its severity? Did the crash occur on an interstate, secondary highway, or residential road? What, if any, crash avoidance maneuver precipitated the crash? 4. With respect to loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes known to the commenter, would equipping the vehicle with an ABS or a more effective ABS (e.g., an all-wheel system instead of a rear-wheel-only system) have helped in avoiding any of the crashes or reducing their severity? 5. With respect to fleets that have switched or begun switching to ABS-equipped light vehicles, have the ABS-equipped light vehicles had a lower crash rate than the non-ABS-equipped light vehicles? If there has been a reduction in crashes, please quantify the reduction in terms of lives saved, injuries prevented, and property damage reduced. C. Regulatory Approaches to Improve the Lateral Stability and Control of Light Vehicles If NHTSA were to propose amending its braking safety standards to improve the lateral stability and control of light vehicles during braking, the amendment would have to meet the Vehicle Safety Act's criteria that the requirement be practicable and be stated in objective terms (section 103(a)). Any rulemaking addressing antilock would also be guided by the findings in PACCAR v. NHTSA, 573 F.2d 632 (9th Cir. 1978) cert. denied 439 U.S. 862 (1978). Even though PACCAR concerned air braked vehicles subject to a different safety standard, some of that decision's concerns about testing brake systems are relevant to proposing to require ABSs on light vehicles. PACCAR held that at the time of their implementation, parts of Standard No. 121 were not reasonable nor practicable. The court held that objective test methods and more probative and convincing data evidencing the reliability and safety of vehicles that are equipped with antilock and in use must be available before the agency can enforce a standard requiring its installation. 6. In the NPRM addressing lateral stability and control for heavy vehicles, NHTSA proposed that each heavy vehicle be equipped with an antilock braking system that satisfies the agency's proposed definition of ``ABS.'' In addition, as a ``check'' on the performance of the ABS, the agency proposed that a heavy vehicle would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve test. The agency tentatively concluded that this approach would ensure that heavy vehicles would be able to significantly improve their lateral stability and control during braking.
