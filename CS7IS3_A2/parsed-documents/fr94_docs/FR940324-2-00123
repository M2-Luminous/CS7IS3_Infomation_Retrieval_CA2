(the licensee) to partially withdraw its May 8, 1991, application as supplemented by letters dated March 6, 1992, and January 28, 1993, for proposed amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;38 for the Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3, located in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The amendment revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) by revising the fuel oil amounts to the feed and storage tanks for the emergency diesel generators, clarifying the testing for the interconnecting piping, and revising the specific gravity of the fuel oil. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the Federal Register on June 26, 1991, (56 FR 29274) as revised April 14, 1993, (58 FR 19478). However, by supplemental letter dated March 6, 1992, the licensee partially withdrew the proposed change pertaining to the revised frequency of testing of the diesel generator. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated May 8, 1991, as supplemented by letters dated March 6, 1992, (which partially withdrew the application for license amendment), and January 28, 1993.
