Even as the Centre and the State ignore the enormity of arsenic poisoning in five other districts of West Bengal, surveys conducted by Jadavpur University's School of Environmental Studies in the past several weeks have turned up shocking evidence of how many more lakhs of people are now threatened in areas hardly a few kilometres from the city. On Saturday afternoon, as a team of scientists from the school, accompanied by doctors and environmental experts, arrived at Purandharpur, a village in Baruipur in the South 24-Parganas, they were besieged by scores of locals desperate to know the results of analysis of water samples taken from tubewells in the area by the team a week earlier. Far away from the corridors of power of Calcutta and New Delhi, a quiet tragedy unfolded as the villagers, their faces shot with anxiety, took in the terrifying news: barring two, all the tubewells of Purandharpur had arsenic contents more than 30 times the recommended level! Water from these tubewells, according to the School of Environmental Studies, is unfit for cattle, not to mention human consumption! For the school, which until now had been preoccupied with arsenic contamination in water elsewhere in the State, the finding of the dreaded metalloid in South 24-Parganas tubewell water was not something straight out of the blue. Last year, after detecting arsenic in water in a Jadavpur locality, the team had taken some random samples from several villages in the Baruipur block and found arsenic in three. A week ago, the team went back for more samples and the results confirmed the team's worst fears: arsenic turned up in alarming concentrations in almost 80 per cent of the affected areas. On Saturday at Purandharpur, in the crowd waiting for the results of the analysis of tubewell-water samples was Sankar Mondal (51), his body dotted with tell-tale signs of arsenic poisoning that doctors described as raindrop skin pigmentation. Mondal earns a living by playing the tabla, but that has been made increasingly difficult in the past few years by lesions on his palms and soles, a condition known in medical parlance as hyperkeratosis. As the Jadavpur University team weaved through standing crops and hushed households of this South 24-Parganas village, the symptoms that Sankar Mondal bore quickly became a familiar sight. Skin afflictions apart, explained Dr. Jayanta Dasgupta of SSKM [expansion not given] Hospital as he examined the arsenic-affected locals, they were suffering from either conjunctivitis, enlargement of the liver or affliction of the nerves of the upper and lower limbs. Purandharpur's residents are especially alarmed because the tubewell water used by more than 1,500 students of the village's educational institutions has been found to contain 35 times more arsenic than recommended! Paying the price for human avarice are nearly 32,000 people in the South 24-Parganas alone, found till now to be drinking arsenic-contaminated water. The actual figure could be mind-boggling. [28 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] Niranjan Das, a resident of gram panchayat Ramnagar II in the South 24-Parganas' Baruipur Block, is counting his days. Years of drinking arsenic-contaminated water has irreversibly damaged his body's vital organs -- a plight common to all four members of the Das family. Yet, that's only part of the tragedy. During the past few years, Niranjan Das's mother and two sisters died one after another -- all victims of arsenic poisoning that, after five districts of the State, has now been revealed to threaten lakhs of people in the South 24-Parganas. Out of the district's 30 blocks, Jadavpur University's School of Environmental Studies recently picked two and analysed tubewell-water samples from a total of 28 villages. Shockingly, not a single village has been found to be safe from the threat of arsenic. Till now, the school has found nearly 9,000 villagers with arsenic-related skin lesions in the two South 24-Parganas Blocks that they have surveyed. However, according to Dr. D.N. Guha Majumdar, who heads SSKM Hospital's gastro-enterology department, not all who are suffering from chronic arsenic toxicity will show skin lesions. "Many might be affected internally," he said. Not surprisingly, ignorance about melanosis and hyperkeratosis -- arsenic-induced skin afflictions -- is taking a heavy social toll in the villages. Wives are being sent back to their parents; finding grooms for daughters is proving an uphill task; and competent candidates are being turned down for jobs. Indeed, arsenicosis-affected persons are being treated not unlike leprosy patients in many of the districts. SSKM's Professor Guha Majumdar, who has been collaborating with the Jadavpur University team in studying arsenic poisoning, says that safe drinking water and a nutritious diet can help reverse early damage caused by arsenicosis. Till now, six districts of the State -- Nadia, Burdwan, Murshidabad, Malda and the North and South 24-Parganas -- have been found to be affected by arsenic-contaminated underground water. In all these places, the deadly metalloid has been gushing out of underground acquifers through water pumped out by tubewells. An ever increasing demand for water -- mainly for irrigation and partly for domestic use -- has spurred more and more tubewells to be sunk. "This has possibly upset the underground geological balance, causing arsenic to leach out of the iron pyrite's crystal lattice," said the school's director. The need of the hour, according to him, is to find out and isolate all the tubewells in the State spewing arsenic-contaminated water. Residents should be told to use only those tubewells whose water had tested arsenic-free. "Our studies have shown that tubewells up to even 450 feet deep are not safe," said a scientist of the school. Studies conducted so far suggest that the deeper the well, the lesser is the chance of arsenic contamination. To eliminate the scourge, the School of Environmental Studies, which is planning to convene an international seminar on arsenic poisoning in the State in January next year, advises boring tubewells deeper than 500 feet and monitoring their water quality constantly to keep tabs on the arsenic content. Solution in the long run, according to wetlands experts, lies in proper management of water resources, conservation of rain and surface water, and planned utilization of ponds and water-logged areas. Unless the Government moves in to stop the profligate spending of underground water, the experts warn, the fate of 30 million people in six districts of the State, could well go the same way as that of the more than 7.5 lakh people drinking arsenic-contaminated water in these districts now.
