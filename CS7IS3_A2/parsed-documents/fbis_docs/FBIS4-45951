Coming as they do in the wake of the Strobe Talbott visit one of whose main objectives was to persuade India and Pakistan to take a fresh look at their security perceptions, these developments are bound to raise questions and even fuel suspicions about a greater and more direct American involvement in the affairs of the subcontinent than has been the case in the recent past. This is all the more so because the United States is known to be unhappy about India's efforts to attain self-sufficiency in missile technology, as its embargo on the supply of Russian cryogenic rockets showed. Washington would also like India to be more receptive towards its plan for a nuclear-free South Asia. One of the purposes of the proposed multilateral conference on disarmament will be to discuss this very issue, notwithstanding India's long-held contention that non-nuclear pockets are meaningless when a selected group of countries are allowed to retain their deadly arsenal. It may well be that the London meeting will deal with some of these problems. But what is not a little disturbing is the unusual emphasis on secrecy placed by the Indian government on the conference. Subsequent clarifications that this was the fourth meeting in a series and a prelude to the Washington summit between Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton are unlikely to be fully convincing. Moreover, the inclusion of a retired diplomat known for his preference for the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] will be considered significant. It is, of course, up to the government to choose its team, but what is nevertheless necessary is that there should be an element of transparency in the entire exercise. Even if it is granted that diplomatic exchanges cannot be conducted in a market place, the government must still inform Parliament about what is being discussed with a country which not long ago had irked many people in India with its needlessly provocative attitude towards a complex and sensitive issue like Kashmir. There is also a need to reiterate India's position on some of the contentious issues if only to make it abundantly clear that there will be no compromises on matters crucial to Indian security. Since our concerns relate not to Pakistan alone, the government will do well to pay heed to what the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leaders said in Parliament about the "trap" into which India may walk at the five plus two plus two conference. The point the opposition members made about the holding of the latest meeting in a third country is also relevant, for it suggests that neither government wanted too close a monitoring of the discussions. However, such a calculation is a naive one in this age of instant communications. So New Delhi will be well advised to shed its attitude of secrecy and be more open about the talks.
