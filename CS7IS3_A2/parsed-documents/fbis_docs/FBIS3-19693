Weckbach-Mara; place and date not given: "German Blue Helmets To Sarajevo?"] [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are the topics with which you want to get the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] out of its low in the election year? [Schaeuble] The economic situation is improving. We are just starting to bring about a change in the labor market. The new laws and measures improve opportunities for people looking for jobs, especially by means of creating more part-time jobs. The effort to provide jobs for everybody is our foremost aim. [BILD AM SONNTAG] The Social Democratic Party's [SPD] objectives sound very similar; are there any differences left? [Schaeuble] Mr. Scharping has made his party look as though it is in agreement by sweeping all controversial issues under the carpet and avoiding clear standpoints. This can be seen from his election program. He announces higher taxes, at the same time saying that tax increases are very bad for economic recovery. We will force Scharping to put his cards on the table in many respects. For instance: Does the SPD want to go on ruining the car industry and pushing individual transport aside because it does not want to build any new roads but enforce new bans instead? And the crucial question whether he is prepared to enter into an alliance with the Greens is also something that Scharping will not be able to avoid until polling day. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Can you promise that the CDU/CSU is not planning any new tax increases? [Schaeuble] The introduction of the solidarity tax on 1 January 1995 has been decided upon, and we will not reverse this decision. But we will do everything we can to make do without any further tax increases. In the long run, we must be aiming at lowering the taxation level, that is, everything the state expects of its citizens in terms of taxes, from the current 52 to 45 percent. This means, taxes must be lowered in the long run. [BILD AM SONNTAG] How do you want to settle the billions in debts of the Federal Railroad, and how do you want to build additional roads? [Schaeuble] In building roads we will have to count on private funding. This will mean introducing charges for the use of certain railroad lines. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before the summer recess, the Federal Constitutional Court will announce its decision on Bundeswehr missions abroad. What consequences will this have? [Schaeuble] We will act politically on that decision. The CDU/CSU is convinced that peace in Europe and in the world can only be preserved by international solidarity in peacekeeping missions. But these cannot take place if the Germans refuse to participate. This is why we have to take part in missions abroad assuming equal rights and duties. I am convinced that the Federal Constitutional Court will confirm our view. Of course, we will have to decide carefully on a case by case basis whether and in what way we want to participate. But in principle, I do not rule out anything. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Not even a German blue-helmet participation in reconstructing Bosnia, if the parties concerned want it? [Schaeuble] If all the parties concerned want such a Bundeswehr mission in Bosnia, we, in agreement with our partners in Europe and the alliance, should not basically ignore these wishes. [BILD AM SONNTAG] You yourself have demanded that our Bundeswehr should also be used for tasks in Germany. Do you still hold this view? [Schaeuble] The Bundeswehr is not a reserve police force. But if situations occur where the police do not have sufficient staffing and equipment and where the Bundeswehr could help, we should discuss how this could be done. This is what has been happening for a long time in all other countries -- from Austria to new Zealand, from America to Holland. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Brandenburg Minister-President Stolpe has named a witness for the defense. Does this resolve the dispute? [Schaeuble] No, certainly not. Stolpe's example shows quite clearly: Political standards in Germany are no longer right. If Mr. Stolpe were a member of the CDU, he would have lost his office of minister-president long ago. The same goes for Oskar Lafontaine in the Saarland and Hans Eichel in Hesse, or Klaus Wedemeier in Bremen. The worst affairs remain without consequences in the SPD. The Stolpe case is no longer a matter that just concerns the land organization, it has become a case for the SPD leadership. I call on Mr. Scharping to make sure that all the cards are finally put on the table in Brandenburg. Scharping has to force Stolpe to tell the truth and take the consequences. Otherwise he is damaging democracy.
