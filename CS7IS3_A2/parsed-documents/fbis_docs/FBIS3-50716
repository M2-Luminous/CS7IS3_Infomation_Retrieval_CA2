The office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) pointed out that Sanchez Galicia "participated in two clashes in an area, tentatively identified as Tekom," where at least 40 members of the armed group that appeared last Saturday in the state of Chiapas were killed. The PGR details in a communique that when Sanchez Galicia was questioned after his arrest, he indicated that he had received "commando" training in Guatemala where he had learned to use long range and large caliber weapons. Sanchez Galicia, according to the PGR communique, said that he had also participated in the takeover of the community of Ocosingo where members of the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] had an intense encounter with the Army before withdrawing. The communique notes that following the Ocosingo incidents, Sanchez Galicia escaped into the mountains and subsequently boarded a bus headed toward Villahermosa, capital of Tabasco, a southeastern state neighboring Chiapas. Both Chiapas and Tabasco border Guatemala. Mexican authorities reported this Wednesday that they had captured 34 Zapatists, including Sanchez Galicia, after the EZLN violently attacked several communities and clashed with the Army in encounters which according to official reports resulted in hundreds of casualties. The PGR points out that Sanchez Galicia was assembling another group that was preparing operations in a region called Nueva Era, near the city of Champoton in the southeastern state of Campeche. The communique explains that Sanchez Galicia was captured at a checkpoint set up along the Chiapas-Catazaja junction in Tabasco, bordering Chiapas. Checkpoint officials, the PGR communique adds, decided to question Sanchez Galicia, who was travelling on a bus, because of suspicious looking "scratches" on his body and his soiled clothes. Sanchez Galicia was turned over to federal attorney general agents who continued the investigation. The communique also states that authorities have obtained a "composite sketch" of the so-called "Commander Marcos," who has been identified as one of the main Zapatist leaders. He is male, 1.74 meters tall, athletically built, light dark skin, approximately 25 years old, deep green and very large eyes, dark hair, straight and broad nose, round face, average mouth, and bushy eyebrows. The PGR added that two specific features of the so-called "Commander Marcos", who supposedlly speaks two languages, is that he is pockmarked and bald.
