[passage omitted] Here is Ritums Rozenbergs reporting by phone from Moscow: [Rozenbergs] Commenting on the blowing up of an electricity pylon of the Skrunda military site, (Sergey Grikhayko), head of the Baltic Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated the following: We hope that the Latvian authorities will adopt all necessary measures to clarify the causes and perpetrators of the incident, and we hope that this action will not affect the talks by our groups of experts and will not disturb the documents we have agreed on for the short term and the agreements signed on military questions. It seems that the Russian side's reaction to the explosion of the pylon will not arouse broad debate. At the moment Russia has on its agenda questions of a much more serious scale. First, the spy trial has to be concluded; second, it has to go on settling the question of the Bosnian Serbs; third, the debate on the consequences of the amnesty has to be concluded. Ritums Rozenbergs, special correspondent for the newspaper LABRIT in Moscow, specially for Latvian Radio.
