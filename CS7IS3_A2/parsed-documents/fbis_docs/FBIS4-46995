Acting as a foreign partner is the 4-M consortium, in which the American side is represented by the companies Marathon Oil Company, and McDermott International Inc. and the Japanese side by Mitsubishi and Mitsui. The essence of the project is to develop gas reserves on Sakhalin and carry out its initial refining with subsequent sale to a foreign consumer, the main one ready to play this role being South Korea and also, possibly, Japan after the year 2005. The implementation of the project is intended to take several decades. The cost of investments is estimated at $6 billion U.S. Negotiations on this contract have already been underway for a long time. They became especially active during the time Ye. Gaydar was in the post of Russian Government acting deputy prime minister. For the foreign partners the situation was exacerbated by the circumstance that the South Koreans became a dangerous competitor to 4-M. In particular, the Palmko Korn company, with support from the South Korea Ministry of Energy and Resources, offered the Russian Government its services for participating in the development of the Sakhalin-2 project. The political aspect was important here: South Korea did not want to obtain gas from Russia through the Japanese. Ye. Gaydar and certain members of the Russian Federation Government took advantage of the heightened competitive struggle fairly successfully. They did not give final guarantees to any of the parties but still they gave their assurances that they were ready to cooperate with each of them. To a certain degree by these actions they managed to stimulate among them competition that was advantageous to Russia. But at the same time the most highly placed figures in the Russian Government received on a regular basis fairly large "honoraria" for the corresponding lobbying efforts. The proposals from the South Koreans have unquestionable financial and also political advantages over the 4-M version. This pertains in particular to the higher profitability, more rapid return in hard currency, Russia's retention of possession of both the deposit itself and the gas that is sold. But because of their more energetic measures, including financial ones, by the middle of 1993, 4-M representatives had managed to sway a number of the leading members of the Russian Federation Government in their direction. The Russian Federation Supreme Soviet at that time received a fairly detailed documentary report on the degree of "personal involvement" of the aforementioned individuals in the process of rendering decisive assistance from 4-M in the realization of their plans. Some of these documents were to have been made public were it not for the use of gunfire on the White House. At the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, even in spite of the reshuffling and changes in the Russian Federation Government, the draft proposed by 4-M began to receive growing support. One of its main lobbyists was Sakhalin Governor Ye. Krasnoyarov. He worked very hard in the government, mainly in the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy. In an unofficial setting representatives of the consortium repeatedly emphasized that the governor was their "main motive force." The question of the Sakhalin-2 project was discussed several times in various expert commissions of the Russian Government and on the whole received support. They began to coordinate legal and technical details of the official contract, which could be signed between the Russian Federation Government and 4-M in the near future. At the same time the 4-M leadership is afraid that the State Duma, especially with its present membership, is capable of stopping the implementation of this project. One of the main provisions of the project is that the foreign side (4-M) will be given the right to own part of the Russian gas which, according to existing legislation, belongs to the state. In this connection there is a need to change the laws of the Russian Federation, which is the prerogative of the State Duma. Taking into account the situation that has developed, 4-M has begun to work out measures for exerting the corresponding influence on the Duma and creating the necessary channels of influence on its key figures. A most active role in this work is played by Ye. Krasnoyarov and also certain government representatives, including from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. The leader of this ministry himself, Yu. Shafranik, is in favor of beginning to implement the Sakhalin-2 project as quickly as possible. The ministry's main demand is that the foreign partners actually be ready to deliver the necessary investments for the project. But in the given stage 4-M is not prepared to allot the required investments. Within the corporation it is mainly Japanese companies that are to make these investments. But because of the ambiguous development of the domestic political situation in Russia, the current condition of Japanese-Russian relations, the fact that Japan will not have an additional need for gas until the year 2005, and a number of other factors, Mitsubishi and Mitsui so far are not ready to make the final decision to allot investments in the Sakhalin-2 project. In this situation the main task for 4-M, and mainly its American part, is to attempt to change the existing Russian legislation with respect to ownership of natural resources in the interests of the West and the largest transnational companies operating in the sphere of extraction and processing of minerals. It cannot be ruled out that under the cover of the future possibilities of realizing Sakhalin-2 and with the help of 4M these circles will try to push through the State Duma a decision which will create a precedent and could lead to a radical change in Russian legislation. The main aspect of these changes is the possibility for foreign legal entities to own Russia's natural resources. This step would open up new possibilities for foreign capital to pursue a policy of increasing the dependence of the Russian Federation on the leading states of the world.
