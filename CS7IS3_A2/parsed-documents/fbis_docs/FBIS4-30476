FBIS4-30476 "dreas124__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-124-A Daily Report 28 June 1994 ANNEX Japan * Flaws of Single-Seat Electoral System Viewed * Flaws of Single-Seat Electoral System Viewed 942B0089A Tokyo THIS IS YOMIURI in Japanese May 94 pp 92-101--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0089A Tokyo THIS IS YOMIURI Japanese CSO [Article by Hiroyuki Kawaguchi, senior researcher, Yomiuri Shimbun Research Center] [Excerpts] Masanori Tanimoto, a candidate recommended by the leading coalition parties, won a gubernatorial election in Ishikawa Prefecture on 27 March, where the leading coalition parties and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] crashed against each other for the first time following the collapse of the "1955 structure." Uniform local elections are scheduled to take place next spring, and an election for the upper house next summer. The recent election revealed what could be expected in showdowns in a series of future local elections and the next general election based on the system of small electoral districts. According to the election results, Tanimoto received 288,085 votes, winning over Hiroshi Ishikawa, a candidate recommended by the LDP, by a narrow margin of about 10,000 votes. Takashi Shimizu, chairman of the Prefectural Medical Association and a Communist-inclined independent, received only 48,417 votes. A New Governor for the First Time in 31 Years For the people in Ishikawa Prefecture, the gubernatorial election came about quite unexpectedly, for the death of Governor Yoichi Nakanishi in a hospital (on 2 February) brought a drastic change in the situation. Nakanishi in fact had occupied the top position in prefectural politics for 31 years since 1963. He planned to retire upon completion of his recent term in office. Maneuvering behind the scenes for new gubernatorial candidates was well in progress. But who could have predicted that the governor's death would open the curtain for election campaigns? There is a unique conservative political climate in Ishikawa Prefecture that disfavors conflicts. Also, a heavy residue remained from the gubernatorial election three years ago, the so-called "Mori-Oku war of representatives." If possible, therefore, the people must have hoped for an election without any waves. But, then, why did the central-government-style showdown ensue, pitting Hiroshi Ishikawa, a Dietman from the upper house backed by the LDP, against Masanori Tanimoto, a former vice governor backed by the leading coalition parties? In a sense, the nationwide trend in favor of change has also reached the conservative prefecture of Ishikawa. The situation seems to have been influenced by the change of power in the central government, which sent shock waves throughout Japan last year, and also by the system of small electoral districts to be introduced in the near future. However, we should not overlook the fact that both the demonic aspect of elections and the political climate peculiar to Ishikawa pushed the candidates and their associates into a maelstrom of conflicting interests, and, as a result, the structure of a showdown gradually became apparent. The gubernatorial election in Ishikawa showed clear evidence that the politics in Japan was changing at the grassroots level. Here is a vivid example that shows the conservative climate in Ishikawa Prefecture. Five Dietmen are elected from the prefecture: Yoshio Mori (LDP secretary general) from the first district, Keiwa Okuda (chairman of the lower house Committee on Rules and Administration and a member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), Yuzuru Shimazaki (chairman of the lower house Committee on Education and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]), Misoji Sakamoto (former chief cabinet secretary and a member of the LDP) from the second district, and Tsutomu Kawara (former director general of the Defense Agency and a member of the LDP). This roster of five individuals became complete by 1972, and hasn't changed at all since then. No other prefecture shares this experience. A similar situation exists in the business sector of the prefecture. Taro Miya (chairman of Daiwa Department Store) has been president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kanazawa since 1974. Incidentally, former Governor Nakanishi became a vice governor, being reassigned from a chief of the Accounting Section at the Ministry of Home Affairs in June 1961. In February 1963 he ran for the governorship and won a gubernatorial election for the first time. Having been reelected every time since then, he won an election for the eighth time in February 1991, the most wins in the nation, and in July 1992 he broke the record of the longest tenure as governor held by the late Ryozo Okuda, former governor of Nara. As a reason for his feat, some people point out the art of self-protection, a tradition since the Kaga clan. But, a reason should be traced to the regional character. Even today, the locals refer to those from other prefectures as "people from afar." Furthermore, the recent election was influenced heavily by the serious residue of the gubernatorial election three years ago, in which Eitaro Sugiyama, the then vice governor, challenged Nakanishi, who was fighting to get elected for the eighth time, developing the campaign into a mud-slinging contest that divided the prefecture into two sides. Nakanishi had support from Okuda and Kawara; Sugiyama from Mori and the then opposition parties. This gubernatorial race was called the "Mori-Oku war of representatives." In the end, Nakanishi gained support from Miya, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and won the election by a narrow margin. After the election, however, the situation developed into numerous acts of revenge, ranging from demotion of the opposing officials of the prefecture to "withholding of job contracts" from the construction companies that were in opposition. The Surge of Power To Stimulate Change [passage omitted] Kanazawa has an expression: The "Kanazawa Monroe Doctrine," signifying its "closed" nature. I've also heard an unfamiliar word, "Kokabukai," quite often. This word will be explained later, but it is likely to become an attribute for "change" in Kanazawa. Even until now, there has been some indication of change in Ishikawa Prefecture, the "LDP's kingdom." In the upper house election five years ago, which was said to have "moved the mountains," Takashi Kurimori of Rengo [Japanese Private-Sector Trade Union Confederation] defeated Hitoshi Shimazaki of the LDP. Again, Shimazaki was a veteran statesman with a 19-year political career, having served as justice minister. His defeat was a prelude to change in the LDP kingdom. However, a determining factor for the showdown in the recent gubernatorial election was the breakup of the Takeshita faction -- here, Okuda joined the forces creating Shinseito. The LDP had allocated its constituency in the first district for the lower house, clearly according to the native towns of its members -- Okuda to Kanazawa City and Mori to the South Kaga region. The first time I heard the unfamiliar word, "Kokabukai," was while having quite an ordinary conversation with a housewife. I repeated, "Kokabukai?" And, then, she asked me in turn, "Don't you know that?" I was flabbergasted. "Kokabukai" is a group of associations organized, like dragnets, according the 51 districts of elementary schools in Kanazawa. It is the LDP's network for gathering votes. It usually tries to promote a feeling of unity between the LDP and the voters; its members participate in various events sponsored by the LDP, sometimes in busloads. Its name is being used as a proper noun, and its superb ability to gather votes has been proved in various elections in the past. Once the LDP's two seats in the first district for the lower house became established, allocation of constituents was finalized by a tacit understanding. Naturally, Kanazawa's "Kokabukai" was became Okuda's supporters' association. As a result, when Shinseito was formed, Okuda took the LDP's enormous constituency in Kanazawa, the chief city of the prefecture. The LDP couldn't stomach this. The "Mori-Oku war" escalated, and its effect was felt in the recent gubernatorial election. In addition, as a coalition was formed in the central government, a liaison committee for the leading coalition parties at the prefectural level was established by the SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United Social Democratic Party [USDP]. Beating the Trump Card for Unified Candidacy Because of these circumstances and clashes, Misoji Sakamoto, chairman of the LDP's prefectural organization, took action quickly as soon as Governor Nakanishi was hospitalized on 4 October last year. He sounded out Keiwa Okuda of Shinseito regarding possible candidates for a future governor, saying, "We must avoid any vacuum in our prefectural politics." At that time, he had a reason to have absolute confidence in backing a unified candidate. He knew well the close human relationship between Okuda and Ishikawa, even when Hiroshi Ishikawa, who is a member of the upper house and was recommended by the LDP in the recent election, was named as a candidate three years ago. "Itchu-Yonko" -- "Kanazawa First Middle School and Fourth Higher School under the old educational system" -- is considered as the elite path in Kanazawa. Sakamoto, Ishikawa, and Okuda are all from this elite path. Ishikawa and Okuda in particular are only one year apart, and "they have been close in a personal, trusting relationship from their childhood days." Also, Okuda became a Dietman from a local politician as a successor to the late Eiichi Sakata, former agriculture minister and a don in the political circles of the prefecture. Ishikawa had a kinship with Sakata. As such, Okuda and Ishikawa are connected in many ways. Also, Ishikawa is a local, and after having served as a vice minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, he became a member of the upper house (in a proportional district) with support from the LDP. As a matter of course, he is deeply involved in prefectural politics, and has connections with Dietmen and other important people in the prefecture. Therefore, it is reasonable for Sakamoto to believe that "in any event, Okuda will support Ishikawa." When he sounded out Okuda, Sakamoto explained in earnest the importance of backing a unified candidate: "There won't be any changes in policies. And, a power struggle that divides the prefecture into two camps will only cause troubles to the people in our prefecture. We shouldn't repeat that sort of thing. Also, we shouldn't bring the political conflicts of the central government into our local politics." As expected, Okuda is said to have responded at that time, saying, "Would you recommend Mr. Ishikawa (as our unified candidate)?" In light of the mood against conflict permeating the prefecture and the close human relationship between the two individuals, it seemed that "the issue was resolved." However, following the death of Governor Nakanishi on 2 February, the situation gradually changed. As a statesman from the prefectural medical association, a young mayor, a famous village headman, and others showed their interests in running for governorship, and Ishikawa's name began to be mentioned as the LDP's official candidate, a sense of crisis developed within Shinseito and the SDPJ. Hiroshi Kanahara, the acting chairman of Shinseito's prefectural federation, was busy trying to make over "Kokabukai" into an organization to support Okuda. Many people sent a message to him, saying, "If we remain submissive to the LDP and don't fight, our organization will become moribund." Okuda began to waver a little, also. Because of this, he didn't accept any requests for press or TV interviews, saying, "I need to form a clear view of the situation first." Reflecting on this, Takeshi Ikeda, chairman of the SDPJ's prefectural headquarters that is part of the conference for representatives of the liaison committee for the leading coalition parties, says, "We were also under pressure from below. We had to do something, but we didn't know what to do." He adds: "Then, we thought it necessary first to find out what the people in our prefecture were thinking. We came up with an idea of surveying public opinion by randomly selecting individuals, and asked our office to study the cost and other aspects of conducting such a survey." In the meantime, Yutaka Kurihara, vice chairman, submitted this idea to the executive committee of the liaison committee, which in turn began to take action in earnest for the gubernatorial election. A Symposium That Changed the Course The liaison committee for the leading coalition parties, however, is in a sense only "glasswork" like the central government, a [fragile] collection of disparate groups. As a result of outspoken discussions, it was decided as a compromise, based on the proposal for a survey of public opinion, that they would convene a "symposium to discuss an ideal governor for Ishikawa Prefecture" on 12 February, and that they would concurrently conduct a questionnaire survey of those attending. They were to approach seven panelists individually, and they contacted the LDP and obtained its consent. In retrospect, however, this rather ordinary idea of having a symposium and a questionnaire survey turned out to be an important watershed in determining the course of selecting a gubernatorial candidate. It snowed heavily on the day of the symposium, but despite the worry about its effect on attendance, about 600 people gathered. During the symposium, various opinions were actively exchanged: "I don't consider it reasonable to follow the past practice of selecting candidates at the central government level"; "How about calling for candidates publicly"; and so on. There were also many people who wanted to speak during the question and answer period. The moderator was amazed. The response rate for the questionnaire survey was excellent; 480 people responded. What pleased the people from the leading coalition parties most were the contents of the response: To the question, "How do you like the relationship between the governor and the prefecture to be?" 46.1 percent of the respondents answered that "We have to seek a qualified individual anywhere, not just from within our prefecture." This was well beyond the response rate of 39.6 percent for the response that "The governor should be a person who was born and raised in the prefecture, and who is taking an active part in the prefectural affairs." Also, to the question on "the candidate's stance on party affiliation," 47.4 percent of the respondents answered that "the candidate as a person is more important than his party affiliation." This was well above the response rate of 26.1 percent for the answer, "The candidate can belong to any party as long as he can carry out the prefectural politics justly and fairly." Are these responses the result of an influence left by the former governor, who was from outside the prefecture and had prevailed in the prefectural politics for 31 years? It could be a strategic victory if the leading coalition parties were considering at that time to support Vice Governor Masanori Tanimoto, who shared a similar background. Tanimoto was from Hyogo Prefecture, and was transferred from his position as a section chief at the Ministry of Home Affairs to serve as vice governor -- he had been on his new post for only two years and three months. On the other hand, the survey results were rather mortifying for Ishikawa, who is a local and a member of the LDP and the upper house. They gave the leading coalition parties a justifiable reason "to oppose Mr. Ishikawa." They also made it impossible for the LDP to openly contradict this reason. Were this symposium and the questionnaire survey contrived in any way? To answer this question, I met one of the panelists, Yoshiko Hayakawa, and asked her candidly, "Did you receive any requests as to what you might say?" She responded rather vacantly: "Probably, it was four days before [the symposium] when Mr. Ikeda (chairman of the SDPJ's prefectural committee) telephoned me. I said to him, `As I'm a lone wolf (a conference interpreter), I may start saying something totally unexpected.' Then, he said, `You can say whatever you want.' So, I accepted the invitation." To be sure, there were some leading questions in the questionnaire survey. Judging from the stories told by the officials of the leading coalition parties, however, selection of candidates had not been negotiated among the parties at that time. In fact, the situation was that the entire process of candidate selection had not yet reached the stage of negotiation. Ironically, this tardiness, compared to the LDP's swift action, was later to become an important guidepost as well. For a moment, let's move the stage back to Tokyo. As the deadline for notification [of candidates] was approaching, the LDP members probably felt that there was not much time left. On 14 February, Sakamoto asked Okuda, Shimazaki, and Kurimori--all are members of the Diet from the leading coalition parties--to gather in the Diet building and formally asked for their cooperation to decide on a unified candidate. He asked them also to begin selecting a candidate at the beginning of the following week. It has been said that no particular candidates were mentioned during the meeting. However, Sakamoto said with full confidence: "Those who gathered today are all honest people. Although they didn't name any candidates, they will be able to come to terms with each other easily." Okuda, on the other hand, let his doubts be known, saying, "Will we be able to overcome all hurdles? I don't think it is that easy." In the final analysis, this meeting in Tokyo triggered a breakup. Komeito, the DSP, and the SDPJ in succession issued a statement of "rejection of unified candidacy," saying, "In light of the policy line drawn from the symposium of prefectural citizens, we cannot accept a Dietman candidate chosen in Tokyo." In other words, the meeting provided the leading coalition parties with another "justifiable reason" to "oppose selection of a candidate at the central level." Of course, the political motive of each party is obvious. Yuzuru Shimazaki, a Dietman from the SDPJ, made an honest confession: "If Mr. Okuda of Shinseito bands together with the LDP in Tokyo, our side will become stripped. Therefore, we tried to place our first priority on the framework of the leading coalition parties." Beaming, he said, "Honestly, I was surprised to discover that more than 45 percent of the respondents to the questionnaire survey conducted at the symposium felt it unnecessary for their governor to be from their own prefecture." He added further, "Times have changed, but the LDP refuses to become an opposition party, just as we are failing to become leading parties. We are no longer in the era when candidates for governor were chosen at the central government level." He probably wanted to emphasize the importance of the selection process itself. The LDP Took Decisive Action Okuda didn't make his stance clear even around that time. Keigo Ishimoto, the general secretary of the LDP's prefectural federation, vented his frustration: "I can't stand the teasing tactics any longer. If we keep going like this, our federation will break apart internally." At last on 21 February, the LDP took decisive action by holding a large-scale meeting in Tokyo with Diet members and the executives of the prefectural federation. They decided to ask Ishikawa to run for governor. At the same time, they also proposed to the leading coalition parties to make a joint recommendation. To this, Ishikawa replied curtly, "I'll give it serious consideration." He didn't make his intention clear. As "unification" [of candidacy] was a condition agreed upon during the previous sounding, he might have felt somehow that "the promise was not kept." Tsutomu Kawara, an LDP Dietman, explains: "Our procedure might have been deficient. We should have made our points clear in our public speeches why we needed Mr. Ishikawa now and why we had to make adjustments. To the members of the SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, and the DSP who had been affected by the action taken by the coalition government, we gave them a chance to enjoy their get-together." As a result, the leading coalition parties issued a statement of denunciation and immediately held a liaison conference to select an opposing candidate. They came up with five possible candidates, including a college professor, a high-ranking government official, and a vice governor. In the end, Tanimoto was judged to be "an ideal candidate for governor at the present time." On 24 February, the leading coalition parties made an official request to Tanimoto to run for governor. However, Tanimoto replied simply, "I consider it a very important request," and continued his duty as acting governor. By this time, Ishikawa made up his mind clearly to run for governorship, saying, "It is regrettable that unification was not achieved." According to a person within the LDP, a wavering Ishikawa finally made the decision because he was pressured by his local supporters who said, "You once were a vice minister. If you are sideswiped by a section chief (i.e., Mr. Tanimoto), you won't be able to walk about the town of Kanazawa at ease." Even around this time, a dominant opinion within the LDP was that "Mr. Tanimoto will probably not accept the request." As the LDP holds the majority of seats in the prefectural assembly in Ishikawa, "even if he [Tanimoto] wins, he will have a hellish time dealing with the assembly." However, Okuda indicated his intention to back Tanimoto during the rally for establishment of Shinseito in Mikawa on 27 February: "I would like to recommend the second-highest ranking individual, who has a promising future, rather than someone who was once a grand champion." This left no room for further negotiation. Tanimoto also made it clear that he would step forward as a candidate. Kanahara of Shinseito, who served as campaign manager for Tanimoto, says, "Mr. Tanimoto must have been shocked when we asked him to become a candidate. I'm so glad that he decided to run." Tanimoto speaks of the reason for his decision sparingly: "Because my wife let me make up my mind...." As he had been governing the prefectural politics since Nakanishi was hospitalized in October last year, he probably decided to bet on the attractiveness of the governorship, rather than on the hellish future of dealing with the assembly. For Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general, it was the worst outcome. Considering his relationship with Okuda, he delegated all negotiations to Sakamoto, chairman of the prefectural federation. He remained as a standby, saying, "I'll come forward if there is any chance for readjustment at the last minute." He lost this chance forever. But, as soon as he foresaw the coming fight, he didn't let his fighting spirit go unnoticed: "The belligerent attitude three years ago killed the governor (Nakanishi). This time again, they are trying to use the gubernatorial election as a means to expand their political power. I can't let that happen." It was only on 7 March that Okuda finally decided to disclose his thoughts on the [election] process. At the office of the lower house Committee on Rules and Administration, he said as follows, choosing his words carefully: "Mr. Ishikawa is my long-time friend. His character, personality, knowledge, and his intention to remain in Ishikawa Prefecture till the end -- all this considered, I still think he's best suited as governor. But, Mr. Tanimoto is also a very capable man. In any event, politics at the central government has been changing, and this change is pressing on us also. Throughout the prefectural assembly and supporters' associations, there has been a rise of the fighting spirit [against the LDP]. I myself made a difficult decision, thinking about how tightly the leading coalition parties could unite during this election. If things didn't go quite right, the solidarity would prove not to be genuine." No doubt, he must have agonized over his deep personal relationship with Ishikawa. On the other hand, however, he seriously considered protecting the supporters' organization--restructuring it as the Shinseito organization--and solidifying the leading coalition parties for elections under the system of small electoral districts. He [Okuda] is shrewd--at the time of the breakup of the Tanaka faction, he organized the middle-of-the-roaders and eventually went for Noboru Takeshita, and he later joined Shinseito after the breakup of the Takeshita faction. He already finished transforming all of the 51 "Kokabukai" in Kanazawa City into the "Shinseito Kokabukai," establishing "Shinseito Kanazawa." Probably because of this, he said with confidence, "If the LDP loses this election, its organization will become very shaky." The Lineup, Vying for the System of Small Electoral Districts Countering this, however, the LDP had also established its own "LDP Kokabukai" in every school district, although far less in membership. As a result, "Kokabukai," the famous word in Kanazawa City, is no longer a proper noun. As a harbinger of a series of political restructuring at the central government, this type of restructuring of local organizations is likely to spread quickly throughout the nation. Also, as soon as it was known that the election battle would take place, the LDP came up with a series of strategic measures based on the assumption of introduction of the system of small electoral districts. First, it brought forward a strategy to draw upon the full power of Dietmen by creating a tripartite system of campaign headquarters in Kanazawa, Kaga, and Noto. This system is sure to become a national model for future elections of governors and members of the upper house. Here, the leading coalition parties are having a difficult time. Ikeda of the SDPJ made a grave comment: "In gubernatorial elections, we have experienced a joint ride many times, so I don't see any problems here. But, it won't be that easy in a small electoral district. The results of the recent election will become a good reference point in selecting candidates for small districts. If they gobble up good districts only, like assigning Mr. Okuda to the new first district, and the SDPJ to somewhere else, we won't be able to stand it. We'll have to talk seriously when the time comes." Yet, he added: "The recent election is a touchstone. As we have to win at any cost, we are not thinking about the future. Rengo decided for the first time to initiate a drive for campaign contribution of 500 yen [per person]." In future elections in small districts, this kind of activity should become increasingly common. During the gathering of its Hakui branch office members to encourage the candidate at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Hall in Hakui, the LDP, which monopolizes two seats in Noto, orchestrated a stage performance of having Sakamoto and Kawara welcome and shake hands with Ishikawa for the first time in front of the supporters. At this, the supporters applauded. Although it used to be said that "the worst enemy of an LDP Dietman in a medium-constituency district is another LDP Dietman," the two [Sakamoto and Kawara] rode amicably in the same loudspeaker car. Seemingly embarrassed, however, Sakamoto feigned ignorance and said, "The gubernatorial election is our cause. If you don't agree with this cause, you'll be considered an enemy." On the other hand, Kawara explained the fact of the matter honestly: "We don't know who will be chosen (as a candidate for the new small third district), but we decided to establish a trusting relationship among the interested parties." Once chosen as a candidate in a small district, how completely you take the political foundation of the other Dietman from the same party will become a determining factor in winning the election. Therefore, we will be likely to see this kind of scene all over the nation. [passage omitted] The ceremonies at both camps in the morning of the notification date on 10 March were quite befitting as an oncoming battle between the leading coalition parties and the LDP. At the Tanimoto camp, an encouraging telegram from the prime minister was read aloud, boosting spirits: "This will have an important effect on the future of the coalition government as well. We must win for sure. Just as we changed the central government, we must also change local governments." At the Ishikawa camp, all Dietmen from the prefecture were present. In addition, three members of the upper house, who are Ishikawa's colleagues and from outside the prefecture, including Hiroshi Miyazawa, showed up at the ceremony and electrified the supporters. An election campaign, however, can be quite a cruel experience for certain individuals. As there is no predicting the eventual outcome of the election, many heads of local governments, including mayors of cities, towns, and villages, were confused and determined to remain silent. Almost tearfully, therefore, Kanazawa Mayor Tamotsu Yamaide, who has a support base of the "big alliance" between the LDP and the coalition parties, had to make "opening remarks for both ceremonies." First, at the ceremony for candidate Tanimoto at Ishikawa Gokoku Shrine, he praised the candidate: "I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Tanimoto. He understands the pains at the local government level. He is a wonderful man." Then, 40 minutes later at the ceremony for candidate Ishikawa at Oyama Shrine, he began similarly, showing his solicitude in a desperate attempt: "Mr. Ishikawa has experience in national politics. I'm sure he will satisfy our expectations. He is a wonderful man." Double Recommendation in Desperation Possibly, businessmen in the prefecture were much more desperate than others. As their position was not clear even on the notification day, I requested telephone interviews to the offices of President Miya of Kanazawa Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Vice President Toshio Magara, president of Magara Construction; and so on. Every one of their offices responded: "He is on a business trip." The mystery was solved when I saw the list of supporters for each candidate. Both lists for Tanimoto and Ishikawa contained the names of leading businessmen in the prefecture, including Miya, Magara, Chairman Heiji Etsuma (president of Tsudagoma Industries) of the Prefectural Management Association, and Executive Secretary Rioji Shibuya (chairman of Shibuya Industries) of the Kanazawa branch of the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives]. In short, they all made a double recommendation. One of the leading businessmen in the prefecture, whom I finally managed to interview that night, confided: "The reason we were troubled by the recent election is not only that the outcome was difficult to predict, but also that we know both candidates very well. Also, due to the recession, we couldn't make contributions, and knowing what had happened in the election three years ago, we were afraid to speak up. We simply remained as observers. We couldn't comment [on the election]. `Being out on a business trip' has been a tacit agreement among us. I also am supposed to be `on a business trip' since yesterday." The election battle increased in intensity as each of the two camps continued to invite big figures from the central government. Voting day finally arrived. Despite Ishikawa's last spurt, the candidate from the leading coalition parties won the election. As soon as the election results became known, I remembered various materials I had collected for this article, and couldn't stop thinking about the future with a gloomy feeling, wondering if this election would leave a heavy residue again. [passage omitted] When will the Japanese people reason out "political fights" as "political fights," enabling both friends and foes to "wine and dine at the same table"? If they can't do that, a small electoral district--one man, one district--will always be a hell.
