The Korea Securities Dealers Association decided at a meeting Thursday morning to lift the ban imposed on selling short in May 1990, when the market was depressed. To sell short is to sell shares borrowed from a broker and then repurchase them for return at a fixed future date. This is an expansion of margin transactions, where investors buy stock on credit. Selling short will be limited to shares of companies listed in the first section of the exchange, and a broker may lend no more than 20 million won of shares per investor provided that its total on loan is no more than 50 percent of its equity capital and that the total lending by all brokerage houses is no more than 10 percent of the total listed shares. The securities industry has long considered reviving short selling in preparation for opening a stock futures market, an event that no longer lies in the distant future. Institutional investors such as banks, and securities, short-term finance and investment trust firms, must now deposit at least 20 percent of the purchase price with a broker before bidding to buy stock. Since real-name financial transactions were introduced last August, institutional investors have carried a greater weight in the stock market, and some are suspected of manipulating stock prices by abusing their no-deposit privileges. Individual investors must deposit 40 percent of the purchase price.
