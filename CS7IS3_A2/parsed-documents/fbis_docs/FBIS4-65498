The country's most celebrated rocket designer is so angry and disillusioned that he is poised to take his expertise overseas. Alan Bond, the inventor of the revolutionary air breathing engines for Hotol (Horizontal Take Off and Landing), Britain's first -- abandoned -- space plane project, has been struggling for three years to raise the cash needed to develop a new plane, Skylon. He had pinned his hopes on Britain's participation in a European programme named FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme). FESTIP is to review the technology for space launchers and, in about two years, recommend which should be developed for the 21st century. Skylon would take off and land on a runway. Its new Sabre engines are designed to work in air and space and to cut the trip from London to Sydney to an hour. But spending cuts by the Department of Trade and Industry have left Britain's dwindling space budget too small to join Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Spain in FESTIP, it was disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the British National Space Centre in London said the overall budget to the European Space Agency [ESA] had been cut from 124 million pounds to 114 million pounds. "The space budget is already committed so we would be looking at an extra spend which we are not going to get." Germany, which has a space plane design called Sanger, has put up 8 million pounds despite budgetary pressures. Mr Bond, whose attempts to develop the engines for British Aerospace's [BAe] Hotol space plane were frustrated when the Ministry of Defence classified the patents, said yesterday that the Government was yet again throwing away a world lead in technology. "It is a disaster. Among the whole of Europe we are the only country without a space plane programme and we bloody well started it all," he said. Private financiers in Britain had told him that without government backing they were not prepared to fund the development of Skylon. Mr Bond, 49, said he was now planning to go overseas with Reaction Engines, the company he founded with two former members of the Hotol team. Among those showing interest were the Japanese. Mr Bond, whose firm is based at Stanford in the Vale, Oxfordshire, said: "We, including British Aerospace, have a technological lead, but the head of the British National Space Centre and ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry simply do not care." He said British Aerospace Space Systems in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, which had also hoped to join the ESA programme with a revised version of Hotol, had spent millions of pounds of its own and taxpayers' money. Paul Down, business development director at BAe, said yesterday: "We have gathered a vast amount of expertise working with Rolls-Royce and Alan Bond and we have been working with the Russians and Deutsche Aerospace.... We will be distressed beyond measure if we are not able to play our part." Derek Davis, director general of the British National Space Centre, said yesterday: "My heart goes out to Mr Bond...we are trying to find ways which would allow these companies to get involved." Britain's participation in FESTIP seemed assured last year, 30 years after it pulled out of the Blue Streak project. Edward Leigh, the former industry minister responsible for space, believed Britain could not be left behind. About 3 million pounds over three years was believed to be enough to assure British entry into FESTIP and the involvement of Skylon and the revised Hotol.
