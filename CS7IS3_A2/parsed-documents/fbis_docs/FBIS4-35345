The paper says: Some quarters' attempts to circumvent the Yemeni will came in the wake of recent national developments which proved that the Yemeni state has restored its influence and prestige in the face of the secessionists' attempts to exhaust the state and weaken its capabilities and authorities during these past months of the crisis, which is part of a foreign and domestic scheme to exhaust Yemen and dismember its new democratic entity. Hence, the suspicious moves are a reaction to Yemen's ability to maintain its unity in the face of the most difficult and critical circumstances. They are also an attempt to reverse the negative results of the unity enemies' wagers on dismembering Yemen through igniting a comprehensive war and involving the people in a civil strife. However, this attempt has ended in utter failure. Yemen has emerged from its bitter experience like the sphinx from the ashes. Everyone, here and abroad, has come to the conclusion that the unity and the state of law and order are neither theories nor slogans intended for boasting. Rather, they a realistic and firm fact that possesses all requirements of progress, self-protection, and survival throughout Yemen. This has been proved by the recent confrontation of the secession drama. The entire international community has come to realize that the director and characters of this drama are thieves and advocates of terrorism. Thus, the unity remained while they hid themselves like rats to look for new pretexts to destroy this national entity. The paper adds: When Yemen appeared before the world as a state with a fair cause, the international community understood the peculiarity of the recent events and the intentions of the forces fanning the war and the secessionist drive. Those forces, after they wagered on erasing Yemen from the map, were stunned to see Yemen rising to confront the challenges with greater ability than they anticipated. Although the UN Security Council permanent member states' efforts have exposed some parties' malicious intentions, what is reassuring is that throughout its history, the United Nations has never supported any secessionist trend in any country. States' domestic affairs are respected by the permanent UN Security Council member states. The U.S., British, and French representatives' rejection of the draft resolution proposed by some states served as a political reprimand. This rejection also exposed some parties' desire to punish Yemen for its unity, faith in democracy, and respect for human rights. Hence the UN Security Council representatives' emphasis on the need to respect Yemeni unity, maintain its constitutional institutions, preserve the democratic course of the Republic of Yemen, and to resolve differences through peaceful means, considering that what is going on in Yemen is a domestic affair. In this context, brother 'Abdallah al-Ashtal, Yemeni permanent UN representative, cautioned that any initiative that does not emphasize Yemeni unity and compliance with constitutional legitimacy is completely rejected and deemed interference in Yemeni internal affairs. Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: This serious strife has made it clear to the world that in the course of the war imposed on Yemen, all attempts of custodianship have been foiled. Those who are concerned for the interests of their peoples and states should realize that Yemen will devote its efforts to comprehensive development now that it has become in possession of all that is needed to protect it. We will bless others' moves to defend their states' sovereignty and development programs. Yemen, which knows the dangers of destruction, is fully aware of the importance of development. Our entire people are confronting the secessionist war. This proves that the entire Yemeni people and their Armed Forces totally believe that defending unity and supporting the constitutional legitimacy are the only way to secure economic and social construction and national development. The will of our one people in the Republic of Yemen and the forces of constitutional legitimacy have triumphed. We are well aware of the facts of history. It has never happened in the history of the Security Council that it supported any secessionist movements or groups. Rather, the Security Council supported Nigeria's efforts when it confronted a secessionist group in the early seventies. It also supported Congo against the separation of one of its regions in the sixties. According to UN officials, it has never happened in the history of the United Nations that it interfered in any country's domestic affairs. Yemeni unity has been achieved by the will of the entire Yemeni people. If there is a small clique attempting to impose its secessionist ideas on the majority of the Yemeni people, the Yemeni people have every right to address their domestic problems in a manner that preserves their unity, security, and stability.
