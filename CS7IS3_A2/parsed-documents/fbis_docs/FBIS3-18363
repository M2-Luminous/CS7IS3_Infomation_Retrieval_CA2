[Gerster] Good morning. [Announcer] Mr. Gerster, the above-mentioned exposure [of the two U.S. KGB spies] caused surprise throughout the world. Do you share that surprise? [Gerster] Not at all. We knew, and of course know, that the KGB is still spying to the same extent, especially in Germany. The strange thing is that it has been split up; three different, and I say this in quote marks, [word indistinct] departments have been formed out of an originally single KGB, which conduct espionage both abroad and at home. Efforts are being made for official contacts; there have, for example, been contacts with the Bundestag Parliamentary Control Commission in order to organize the secret service, shall I say, according to a Western model, that is, democratically and on the basis of a state based on the rule of law. But we know, incidentally, that not only Russia, but other states in East Europe are conducting espionage to the same extent and that, if you like, while the policy of detente has certainly had consequences for the military sphere, it has not for the intelligence services. [Announcer] Would you like to hazard a guess as to the extent of KGB espionage here? [Gerster] That is always a matter for speculation, as you know. If we knew everything we could put an end to this dreadful game. But I can say that as far as we know, there has been absolutely no change in the level [of espionage]. What is surprising is that it is not only old comrades who are, for example, placed in Germany as spies, but we know, for example from the MfS [Ministry for State Security] sphere, that is, the GDR State Security Ministry, that individual employees -- not just three out of five, but a somewhat larger number -- have for example gone over to the Soviet Union and have offered their services to the intelligence services there. That means that the repertoire of people prepared to spy in Russia has become bigger rather than smaller. [Announcer] If the scope of espionage activity has therefore increased, can one then say that the focus of the espionage has switched to other spheres? [Gerster] I know that another East European state, which really is making efforts toward democracy, directs over 50 percent of its efforts specifically at Germany. [Announcer] Which state do you mean? [Gerster] I do not want to name it. The only positive thing from our point of view in this case is that although these efforts are continuing, financial resources are limited. (?As you know) we are making efforts for a type of security partnership with the East European states -- this (?concerns) NATO -- which naturally also has an effect on the EC. I think one should try -- the Germans cannot do this on their own -- to convene a type of conference with the East European states in order to hold talks and make it clear to them that there cannot, on the one hand, be efforts for cooperation with the EC and a security partnership with NATO, while simultaneously virtually continuing subversive actions. I think this really must be made an international issue and that we have every reason, especially as a target of these espionage efforts, [words indistinct]. [Announcer] Can one assume that the targets of espionage have moved more from the military to the economic sphere? [Gerster] One cannot say that. Both spheres are affected, whereby there were always two main pillars in East European espionage, economic espionage on the one hand, and on the other espionage in the political sphere, thus not only in the military, but in the overall political sphere. [Announcer] Let us stay with economic espionage. Is it in fact still worth finding out things through espionage in the West, given that there are now numerous cooperation, training, and further qualification agreements between the East and West? [Gerster] Let me put it this way. Democracy is still very fragile in Russia as well. What the official policies pursued by President Yeltsin and others are really aimed at, namely an opening up and real friendship with the democratic states of the West, has obviously not yet sunk into those who over decades saw us purely and simply as the enemy and are simply (?carrying on). It is probable that with the efforts for a market economy and democracy and survival in increasingly democratic conditions, conditions are so tense there that the spheres of classic old defense mechanisms, the old mistrust of all these have not yet been dismantled. Therefore, I repeat that we have deliberately, as the Parliamentary Control Commission, offered our services. The former KGB held a conference over a year ago, when experts from the democratic parliaments of Germany, England, France, the United States, and other states were (asked?) to Moscow to advise them. What astonishes me is that all these good talks had no results at all. [Announcer] Perhaps they did have the result that the Western states will help modernize the KGB? [Gerster] Definitely not. We are not development aid workers in matters concerning the revamping of the Russian secret service. Rather we are helping --and this is a task for parliamentarians -- to make it clear to people that parliamentary control, that is transparency, is for example, the duty of a secret service, or at least that it is conducted at the very core of parliament in our country. It is necessary, and efforts are made to avoid arbitrary acts and mistakes in the secret services. Thus, it is if anything a lesson in democracy and not a lesson in the technicalities of intelligence activity. [Announcer] You have clearly shown, Mr. Gerster, that the secret services of the Eastern states are still active here in the West. Is it not the other way round too? [Gerster] First, I think the fact that states should (?conduct) information work on world developments is obvious. Second, worldwide, I should say -- the Federal Intelligence Service still exists after all -- but an intelligence service on the basis of a democratic state is not an aggressive institution but an information organization and continues (?to be so). [Announcer] But the KGB spy in the CIA also only wanted information? [Gerster] Well yes, your question is justified. There is a difference. What for example the KGB was well-known for in past years, that it used illegal methods -- you can be sure that that is not possible in a democracy that gathered information legally, made it available it to the government, but [word indistinct].... [Announcer, interrupting] ...but not according to the laws in which the espionage is carried out? [Gerster] Well, all right, but the democratic laws are much more narrow, much more strict, and much more restrictive. Therefore, I would prefer the Federal Intelligence Service to work under the laws of the Federal Republic than under Russian laws, with all due respect. [Announcer] In view of the indignation about the exposure of a KGB spy in the United States, don't you think that this indignation is at least in part hypocritical? [Gerster] I would not say that, because you can be equally certain that we have not placed any agents in presidential offices, in the office of Russian president, nor in the political leadership. Our acquisition of information is partly based on publicly available sources. The Western intelligence agencies have always worked differently to intelligence services in communist states. They should (?do) it on a different basis in the future. To put it in a somewhat slangy way -- the Federal Intelligence Service is as a rule significantly more harmless than the public assumes, and I say that not to absolve myself, but in complete awareness of what I am saying.
