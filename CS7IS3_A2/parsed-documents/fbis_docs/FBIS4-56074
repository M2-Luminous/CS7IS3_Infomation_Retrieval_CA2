No agreement on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina was reached. Journalists were banned from the talks venue, and the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina sides refused to comment. REUTERS reports that the Muslim, Serb, and Croat representatives are ready to resume talks in France or in Geneva within seven to 10 days. [Unidentified correspondent] It is becoming obvious that the secret peace talks were only testing grounds for Bosnia-Herzegovina's warring sides; a preliminary exchange of opinions with the members of the Contact Group who are trying, as they stress, to complete their peace-building task in a professional and efficient way.

They presented good arguments to advocate the principles of the Washington and Vienna Agreements. In the name of a lasting peace Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic announced a possible retreat from the initial negotiating positions of 58 percent for the federation. However, the Serbs do not consider the percentage as the most important element. They are requesting richer and better quality territories. The maps and haggling over the territorial division certainly dominated the talks. However, all combinations are still possible. [passage omitted]
