According to Bagdasaryan, Azerbaijan has not made up its mind concerning the main question about the disengagement of the warring forces. Only after the guns become silent, will it be possible to begin peace talks, bring back the refugees and exchange hostages. Azerbaijan is proposing a simple lull, but the situation is calling for the beginning of a lengthy process which can guarantee the non-resumption of combat activities, Bagdasaryan said. Different variants of stationing peace-keeping forces have been proposed. In April the Azeri leader, President Heydar Aliyev refused to sign the resolution on the sending of CIS troops to the region approved by the CIS summit. At present the Azeri delegation is dragging feet in order not to sign a simple protocol, containing a call on the heads of state and parliaments to from CIS peace-keeping contingent and begin a peaceful dialogue. This is a practical attempt at hiding behind verbiage about Azerbaijan's sovereignty in an effort to avoid any solution to the Karabakh problem, Bagdasaryan said. The Azers are again trying to use these talks in order to play for time, while they are preparing their troops for new offensive, the Armenian parliamentarian said. Political realities are now such that Azerbaijan will have to recognise Nagorno-Karabakh's independence. Policy can no longer be build on quantitative indices of the sort that there are seven million of Azers and only 150 thousand of Karabakh people. World experience shows that this is by far not the most decisive factor, Bagdasaryan said. He stressed his confidence that Azerbaijan would have to recognise Karabakh's independence earlier or later. As concerns talks as a whole, Bagdasaryan said they are necessary because they help CIS parliamentarians to know each other better, clarify their respective positions and make steps towards peace. Meetings of this kind also help strengthen the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly, which is a promising process," the Armenian envoy said.
