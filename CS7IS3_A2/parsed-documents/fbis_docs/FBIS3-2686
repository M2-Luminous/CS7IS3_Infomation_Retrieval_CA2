Observant people have noticed that this year's NPC session had been moved up five days from last year's. The opening date of the annual NPC session has been moved up for several years in a row. According to Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for the NPC Standing Committee's General Office, this reflects the continuous improvement of the people's congress system. During an interview, Zhou Chengkui said: The first session of the eighth NPC was held seven days earlier than the seventh NPC, and the opening date of the current session was advanced five days from that of last year. If possible, the opening date may be moved up progressively in the future. It is understood our country's fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, commencing on 1 January and ending on 31 December. According to our country's legally prescribed procedures, the government implements the state's annual budget only after the NPC has examined and approved it. In the past, if the NPC session was held in March or April, it would be considered early. Under such circumstances, budget plans were implemented long before they were approved. Zhou Chengkui stated: To redress this situation, the NPC Standing Committee decided to move up the NPC session progressively, following a period of deliberations and preparations and against the backdrop of the country's gradual standardization and modernization of its statistical work and other endeavors. The decision was aimed at achieving an ideal date for the session--holding the NPC session in January of each year. He explained: We have to go through a certain process before attaining this goal. One of the reasons is that it is still quite difficult, due to technical and other reasons, to complete the compilation of statistics on the previous year's national economic performance by January of each year. Chengkui added: This problem will be solved in a step-by-step manner after the market economic system has been established, and as the method of compiling statistics becomes increasingly modern. Also, our country's statistical work will become more perfect if the opening date of the NPC session is gradually moved up. These correspondents were advised of the growing institutionalization, standardization, and codification of the NPC system in recent years. This point is corroborated by the formulation and implementation of the rules of procedure for the NPC Standing Committee and for the NPC, by the annual briefings given by relevant State Council departments to the NPC Standing Committee on issues of public concern, and by supervisory efforts in the wake of the implementation of various laws. Constantly moving up the NPC session also symbolizes the improvement and refinement of this system.
