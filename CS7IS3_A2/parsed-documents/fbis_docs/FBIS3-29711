The visit, from March 16 to 19, is at the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who visited Thailand last year. It was intended to follow up on previous agreements with Hanoi and to boost Thai-Vietnamese economic cooperation. Chuan will be the first head of government to visit Vietnam in the wake of the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on Feb 3. The premier will meet Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and pay a courtesy call on the Vietnamese Communist Party Secretary-General Do Muoi. Government officials will have a plenary meeting with their Vietnamese counterparts. Chuan also plans to visit the southern commercial city of Ho Chi Minh, Prasong said. Matters expected to be raised by the visitors include fisheries cooperation and Vietnamese objections to the diversion of water from the Mekong River during the dry season, the central issue which has precluded a framework agreement on the development of the river between Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. [passage omitted] Prasong said he expected memorandum of understanding (MOU) to be signed for an industrial development. Informed sources said the agreement will be between Thailand's Bangprakong Industry Park and Vietnam's State Committee for Co-operation and Investment, to develop industrial estates at Bien Hoa in Dong Nai province east of Ho Chi Minh City. The company was still negotiating over the size of the development and the price of the land, the source said. Chuan's visit will be followed up by Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, who is to attend the third meeting of the Thai-Vietnamese Joint Commission in the second half of the year. Prasong, speaking at the opening of a seminar on trade and investment prospects in Vietnam, urged closer cooperation between the government and the private sector to reinforce the capability of Thai business to compete in Vietnam and other Indochinese markets. He said the setting up of the Joint Commission, agreements on investment protection and promotion, and cooperation between the Board of Investment and Hanoi's State Committee on Co-operation and Investment has resulted in increased bilateral trade and investment. Trade with Vietnam has risen from Bt 3.98 billion in 1992 to Bt4.18 billion in the first 10 months of last year. Up to the end of January, Thai investment in Vietnam was worth U.S. $141.96 million spread over 31 projects--ranking 12th among foreign investors. In 1992, the government gave more than Bt 15 million in assistance to Vietnam for education, agricultural development and vocational training. Planned technical assistance to Vietnam from 1993 to 1995 totals Bt150 million. Prasong said to attract investment Vietnam needs to urgently accelerate tax reform and improve state management of expenditure, education, the legal infrastructure, the banking system and liberalize the labour market. [passage omitted] Thai businessmen in Vietnam yesterday urged Chuan to push for government-to-government agreement on an Indochinese Fund to give Thai businesses a competitive edge. Other suggestions included accelerating efforts to develop a transportation network though sea and land routes linking Thailand and Vietnam through Cambodia, to accelerate trade and tourism.
