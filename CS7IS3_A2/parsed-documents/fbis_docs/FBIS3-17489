Henceforth, under Article 5 of this law, the publication of federal constitutional laws, federal laws, and acts of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly chambers in VEDOMOSTI FEDERALNOGO SOBRANIYA ROSSIYSKOY FEDERATSII [Records of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly] and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be official. The State Duma rapidly adopted a decree on the complex and largely deadlocked issue of a political settlement of differences with the organs of power of Chechnya. [passage omitted] Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation Government minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy, refuted the claim that Russia, despite everything, is feeding and will continue to feed Chechnya. No money was sent there in 1993, nor will any money be sent this year until there is a complete political settlement. There was a very unusual episode at the very beginning of Friday's session. Vyacheslav Marychev, a Liberal Democratic Party of Russia deputy known for his activeness, handed the chairman a red carnation for presentation to the man celebrating his saint's day -- Yegor Gaydar.
