FR940405-0-00052 FR940405-0-00008 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 90 [PR Docket No. 89&hyph;552; DA 94&hyph;276] Use of the 220&hyph;222 Mhz Band by the Private Land Mobile Radio Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Interpretation. SUMMARY: Because certain aspects of the procedures adopted by the FCC for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz license applications were appealed, non-nationwide licensees were granted an extension of 120 days from the final disposition of the appeal to construct their systems and place them in operation. The relevant appeal was settled. Upon motion by affected licensees, the Private Radio Bureau has adopted this Order granting an extension of time through December 2, 1994, for non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensees to construct their systems and place them in operation. This action provides affected licensees with necessary time to account for the unanticipated prompt appellate finality that followed a previous period of uncertainty with respect to equipment purchasing, financing, system construction and management contracts. DATES: Compliance date extended to December 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John J. Borkowski, Rules Branch, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, Private Radio Bureau, (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: March 28, 1994. Released: March 30, 1994. In the Matter of Amendment of Part 90 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for the Use of the 220&hyph;222 MHz Band by the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 89&hyph;552. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. On July 30, 1992, certain aspects of the Commission's procedures for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz license applications were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 1 As a result, we conditioned all grants of 220&hyph;222 MHz licenses upon the outcome of this appeal. We granted each non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensee, regardless of its initial authorization date, an automatic extended period of 120 days from the date of the appeal's final disposition by the courts, to construct and place its licensed facilities in operation. 2 1 See Evans v. Federal Communications Commission, Case No. 92&hyph;1317 (DC Cir. filed July 30, 1992). 2 See public notice, Lottery for 220&hyph;222 MHz Private Radio Land Mobile ``Local'' Channels, DA&hyph;1231, 57 FR 41935, 41936 (September 14, 1992). 2. On March 18, 1994, the pending appellate case upon which we conditioned these license grants was dismissed. 3 This action initiated the 120-day extended construction period granted to each non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensee. 3 Order, Per Curiam, Evans v. Federal Communications Commission, Case No. 92&hyph;1317 (DC Cir. March 18, 1994). 3. On February 15, 1994, the law firm of Keller and Heckman, on behalf of various 220 MHz licensees, requested that the Commission extend the time to construct non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz facilities from 120 days after resolution of Evans v. Federal Communications Commission to 240 days after its resolution. Keller and Heckman based this request on: (1) The unanticipated prompt appellate finality achieved by settlement of this matter; (2) The probable inability of 220&hyph;222 MHz equipment vendors to accommodate, within a 120-day timeframe, the thousands of equipment orders that are likely to be placed with the advent of a settlement; and (3) The likelihood that such an extension will result in the provision of 220&hyph;222 MHz local service to the public more quickly than through the automatic cancellation of existing licenses followed by the selection of new licensees. 4. Keller and Heckman indicated that most 220&hyph;222 MHz non-nationwide licensees ``have been highly reluctant to commit to decisions on equipment purchasing, financing, system construction and management contracts while the air of uncertainty as to license retention created by the Evans case'' 4 continues to prevail. Keller and Heckman stated that the requested extension would allow licensees the requisite time needed to address these matters. 4 Request for Additional Time to Construct 220 MHz Private Land Mobile Radio Systems, filed by Keller and Heckman, February 15, 1994, at 2. 5. Therefore, for good cause shown, it is ordered that the deadline for licensees to construct their non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz facilities and place them in operation is hereby further extended. All licensees of such stations authorized on or before the release date of this Order must construct their facilities and place them in operation on or before December 2, 1994. 5 5 All licensees of non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz stations authorized after the release date of this Order must construct their facilities and place them in operation within eight months of the date of initial license grant.
