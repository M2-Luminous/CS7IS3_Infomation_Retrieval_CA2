Chebeleu said that numerous terms without precise content are being circulated, such as the term autonomy for minorities, and if this term refers to ethnic autonomy, this means quote, dynamite for the state unity of Romania, unquote, and is against European principles. Referring to certain statements by Ioan Alexandru, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] senator, Ambassador Chebeleu said that one cannot talk about a discriminatory attitude adopted by Germany in connection with Romania joining European institutions.
