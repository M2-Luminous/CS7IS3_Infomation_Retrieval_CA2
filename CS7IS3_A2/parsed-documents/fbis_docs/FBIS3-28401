FBIS3-28401 "dreas025_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 South Korea Foreign Minister on Nuclear Issue, Patriots SK0702032994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0311 GMT 7 Feb 94 SK0702032994 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said on Monday that the North Korean nuclear issue would be referred to the UN Security Council if Pyongyang did not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its nuclear facilities by Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board of Governors is to meet. IAEA Director General Hans Blix would tell the Board of Governors meeting the continuity of safeguards at North Korean nuclear facilities is not maintained in that case, Han told in his briefing session on foreign affairs for opposition Democratic Party [DP] leaders, including chairman Yi Ki-taek, on that morning. Should North Korea receive IAEA inspections and resume inter-Korean dialogue for a new round of high-level talks with the United States, Seoul and Washington would promote a thorough and broad dialogue with Pyongyang for complete solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Han said. Commenting on the Patriot missile deployment issue, the foreign minister said negotiations are under way with the United States on whether the antimissile missiles should be deployed in South Korea and when they should be deployed, if need be, in order not to provoke North Korea, saying, "This is a very sensitive point of time in the effort to solve the North Korean nuclear issue." The U.S. Government is positively studying a plan to deploy Patriot batteries in South Korea at the recommendation of U.S. Forces Korea commander Gen. Gary luck, but Seoul has asked Washington to see to it that the U.S. press will be prudent in reporting about the plan in view of the influence on the on-going North Korea-IAEA negotiations and because the plan is still under negotations between Seoul and Washington. Minister Han said negotiations are under way with Tokyo and Beijing on the schedules of President Kim Yong-sam's visits of the two countries in march, adding that his visit to Russia within the year is also being seriously studied. To prepare for the new world trade order under the world trade organization to be established in 1995, Han said, the government will strengthen trade diplomacy and actively participate in the new round of multilateral negotiations on environment and labor.
