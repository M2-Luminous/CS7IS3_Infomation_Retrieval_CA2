The reason: Italy's neofascists. First it was the hymns of praise by MSI [Italian Social Movement] leaders about Mussolini's era that set the alarm bells ringing in South Tirol. Now, neofascist Mirko Tremaglia has finally caused a commotion on the Eisack and Etsch Rivers: He is calling for the annulment of the Osimo treaties, in which Italy and Yugoslavia set down the rights of the Italian minority in Istria and Dalmatia in 1975. In the same breath, Tremaglia is demanding a revision of the existing borders. In South Tirol it is generally accepted that if Italy's borders are uncertain, then South Tirol's autonomy is also uncertain. South Tirol People's Party Chairman Brugger counters with the argument that autonomy is a foregone conclusion. The "Union for South Tirol" has a harsher formulation: End "the time of whining and gestures of protest" -- now it is necessary to also make preparations "for the revision of the unjust border at the Brenner" and the "departure of South Tirol from Italy." Today, Thursday, South Tirol's Governor Durnwalder and Brugger will travel to Vienna for a special summit on South Tirol. One thing is clear: The situation involving South Tirol cannot leave Austria, as a protective power, indifferent. This was confirmed by Foreign Minister Mock in an interview with KURIER: "As the protective power, we are watching the discussion with great attention." Mock warns: "We are proceeding from the assumption that both neighbors are interested in respecting the agreements that have been concluded (South Tirol package -- the editor)!" What is making the situation difficult at the moment is that there is still no new Italian Government -- and thus, there is no partner for the talks. Austria, at least, hopes -- and urges -- continuity in bilateral relations, that is, also for a commitment of the new Italian Government to the existing South Tirol treaties. Mock told KURIER: "Exactly. Hopefully there will be the continuity that you are talking about! I must assume that the new government, too, will observe the current legal provisions." Mock wants to establish contact quickly with the new government in Rome: "It lies in the nature of the matter that neighbors always establish basic contacts quickly, as soon as there is a new government."
