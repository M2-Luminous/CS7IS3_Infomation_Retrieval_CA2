These quarters have stressed the importance of this summit for the peace process, noting what it could offer to achieve a just, comprehensive peace in the region if the U.S. Administration shows understanding of the facts of the conflict in the region. As these quarters believe, it is no longer acceptable for the U.S. position to remain within a theoretical framework. This is especially so, since the U.S. Administration is the party that launched the peace process on the basis of UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace. More than two years have passed since the peace process was launched. Israel, however, has continued to play the same role, namely, refusing to comply with international resolutions and the foundations of the peace process. This resulted in wasting an opportunity deemed by observers as historic when the Madrid conference convened and then resumed in Washington. AL-BA'TH adds: Unlike the Arab parties, Israel went to the Madrid conference and the Washington talks not to commit itself to the foundations of the Madrid conference but to exploit the peace talks to achieve its aims which it has sought for a long time through various means. Therefore, the peace talks have not made progress because of this Israeli attitude. The paper thinks that the recent U.S. move came after the U.S. Administration felt that the entire peace process was in danger, especially since it is now convinced -- this is apparent through official statements -- that partial, separate solutions would never achieve genuine peace. Consequently, AL-BA'TH adds, the U.S. Administration insists always that comprehensive settlement in the region would bring peace, security, and stability to the region and that any peace without Syria and Lebanon is not considered peace. The summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton this month comes against this background. It is presumed, as Arab and foreign quarters point out, that this summit will focus on the need to salvage the peace process which is threatened by Israel's position. These quarters assert, moreover, that it all depends on the U.S. Administration's position, especially since Syria has a very clear position on the peace process and is very much concerned about achieving a just and comprehensive settlement.
