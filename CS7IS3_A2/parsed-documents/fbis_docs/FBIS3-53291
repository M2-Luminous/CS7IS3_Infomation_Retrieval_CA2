If we consider the phenomenon carefully, we cannot attribute it to the economic blockade, which has recently been viewed as a source of all problems, including the soaring prices phenomenon. Most companies and establishments are still using their assets of the raw materials that were stored before the economic blockade, as well as some alternatives, in order to perpetuate the production process. At the same time, we know that the unjust economic blockade has halted the import of raw and supplementary materials. Therefore, the surge in the prices of these establishments' products cannot be attributed to the increase in costs. Aside from increases in the workers' wages, no change occurred in the framework of the cost. Therefore, the level of costs in these establishments is still reasonable because the elements of the cost, except the wages, have not changed to justify the rise in prices by more than three to five times the prices a year ago. If we review these prices, we will find, for example, that the prices of the products of the State Enterprise for Leather Industry have risen by more than five times. A pair of men's shoes that were sold for 50 to 70 dinars in 1992 were sold for 185 to 400 dinars in 1993. This also applies to all the items this state enterprise produces. The same is also true of textile companies and electrical industries. However, the rise in the prices of the mixed sector's products was much more than that of the state sector. The prices of the Light Industries Company's products have increased up to 4,500 to 6,000 dinars. [sentence as published] Similarly, the prices of the products of the Electronics Industries Company, the dyes industry, the alcoholic drinks industry, and other mixed sector establishments have also risen. Scientifically speaking, the rise in these prices can be attributed to the policy of increasing the profits of the project instead of the establishment's production capacity, or that this phenomenon has nothing to do with economic laws, which seek to increase the net income by using the means of production in the best way, working to introduce scientific inventions in the production process, raising the level of production, or reducing the costs to the lowest level possible in order to raise the margin of profit to a reasonable level in harmony with the nature and trends of prices in the market of commodities and industry. This shows that these establishments have abandoned their responsibility, as well as the social duty required from economic and production units, instead of reflecting their eagerness to improve the level of performance. This can be interpreted by a defect in the economic behavior. These establishments behave like the private sector traders, who define their prices in light of foreign currency exchange rates in the parallel market. This behavior has harmed price levels and led to higher inflation rates. Therefore, it can be considered as part of a wrong behavior, which will damage the economy by fixing unrealistic prices that do not reflect the economic situation and production relations. During a meeting with the Council of Ministers, leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him, instructed that the state enterprises depend on the true cost rather than the standard cost, search for opportunities to reduce the costs, and adopt austerity measures to limit spending. The concerned industrial establishment is required to take these instructions seriously and not to adopt such a behavior to define the prices of their industrial products, just as the private sector does. This fever may also affect the fines imposed on citizens violating the instructions of Baghdad municipality and health and traffic rules.
