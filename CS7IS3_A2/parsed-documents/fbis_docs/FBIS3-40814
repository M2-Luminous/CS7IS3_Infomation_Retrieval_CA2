The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, today assured the country that the Government would take action "where called for" in the light of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the securities scam, as earlier promised in the Lok Sabha by "my Finance Minister," Dr. Manmohan Singh, but not before the main Opposition parties had staged a walkout in both Houses of Parliament. The action would be based on a detailed examination of the report, Mr. Rao said speaking briefly in the Lok Sabha after Dr. Singh ended a 45-minute thought-provoking reply to the two-day special debate on the JPC report, in which he said the Government would come to Parliament with a blueprint of action within three months. The Opposition followed a similar pattern in the Rayja Sabha. It was a pity that the entire Opposition, barring the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the Muslim League, had walked out in protest against the Government's decision to let the Finance Minister, rather than the Prime Minister, reply to the debate. It was sad to see Dr. Singh reply to a half-empty chamber. In a sense the debate had centred on him, and he had been praised by all Opposition for owning moral responsibility and offering his resignation. While the discussion was running perfectly smoothly, not long before the reply was due, the Opposition leaders -- including Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mr. Sharad Yadav, Mr. Somnath Chatterjee, Mr. Indrajit Gupta and Mr. Chandra Shekhar -- set up a clamour that they would accept a reply to the debate only from the Prime Minister. They urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, and the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, not to be "bound down by rules," according to which, any Minister can answer for the whole Government in a special discussion under rule 193, and in this case, as Mr. Patil noted, the "nodal" Ministry was, indeed, Finance. The Opposition argued that the special status of the occasion demanded that the Prime Minister himself reply, as a large number of Government Ministries and departments were scrutinised by the JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). Moreover, they said it would not be proper for a Minister who was believed to have tendered his resignation, to reply to the debate. The Finance Minister noted at the beginning of his reply that he was speaking in his capacity as the Finance Minister. He said the JPC had made a deep study of the problem, and that he accepted full "constitutional responsibility" for the scam, even though the process had commenced some five years before he became the Finance Minister. He also said he was answerable to Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the people and would accept any "punishment" Parliament desired to hand down to him. However, the Finance Minister observed that he differed with the appreciation of the JPC that the Finance Ministry or he himself had failed to anticipate the sensational scam, had lacked in "purposeful response" once it broke, failed to manage it adequately, or apply correctives with despatch and punish the guilty. Citing detail after detail, he said he had begun the clean-up and the investigation through various instructions and setting up of high-powered bodies within a month of becoming the Finance Minister, though he had to immediately plunge into the budget-making exercise, and devise strategies "with the blessings of the Prime Minister" to manage the country's very precarious finances, as India was being virtually written off worldwide as a country gone bankrupt. The ruling party in the Rayja Sabha launched a direct attack on the JPC report in the face of vociferous demand from the Opposition for the resignation of all the Ministers against whom adverse comments have been made in the Committee report. Barring the melodrama towards the end that centred around the remarks made by Mr. Ram Jethmalani (JD) (Janata Dal) on the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) and the Prime Minister which led to adjournment of the House and walkout by the Opposition demanding reply from the Prime Minister, proceedings in the Upper House were lack-lustre. The Left members who stayed in the House kept shouting, even as Dr. Singh rounded-off the debate in a brief speech which could not be heard in the din. What began as a veiled criticism of the contents of the report by the Power Minister, Mr. N.K.P. Salve, during the day became a full-fledged attack by his party colleague, Mr. R.K. Dhawan, who spoke towards the far-end and accused the committee of having shown "total lack of respect for rules and regulations." The Opposition members on their part while reiterating their demand for the head of all the Ministers indicted by the committee, took serious exception to the description of the JPC report by the Congress(I) members and Ministers. Mr. Salve was repeatedly interrupted by the Opposition, when he sought to convey his "distress and dislike" over the debate and maintained that the committee report was not entirely "impartial." The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Sikandar Bakht, and Mr. S. Jaipal Reddy (JD) were on their legs immediately after Mr. Salve took the position that the debate was devoid of merit and objectivity and wanted to know if he was speaking in his capacity as a member or a Minister. If it was the later what he said amounted to virtual denigration of the committee report. Undeterred by the interruptions, Mr. Salve dealt at length on what he termed as informities in the contents of the committee report and the constitutional position on issues like collective responsibility and sustainability of the comments in the report against the Finance Minister and his Ministry, Mr. N. Giri Prasad (CPI) (Communist Party of India) contended that argument of systemic failure cannot hold water, as no system worked without individuals who were responsible for its functioning. In his intervention, the Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, asserted that there was no constitutional obligation for Ministers on the basis of reports of parliamentary committees and sought to make a distinction between the outcome of a commission of inquiry and the parliamentary committee. He argued that Mr. K.D. Malaviya and Mr. T.T. Krishnamachary had resigned following indictment by a commission of inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge.
