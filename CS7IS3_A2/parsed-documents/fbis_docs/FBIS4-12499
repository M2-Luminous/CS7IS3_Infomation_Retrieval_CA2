This blockade, the sources added, was causing poverty and hunger in the territories. The sources said that 'Arafat briefed the participants on the reports that he had received from Palestinian officials in Gaza and Hebron.

According to the sources, 'Arafat had taken a number of urgent measures to avert further exacerbation of the crisis and to foil the Israeli attempt to import workers from abroad to replace the Palestinian workers, who are prevented from going to their work in Israel. The sources said that, during his meeting with the ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent member states in Cairo last week, 'Arafat briefed them on the tragic condition of well over two million Palestinians.
