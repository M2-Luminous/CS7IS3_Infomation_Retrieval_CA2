Hopmann from DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG]: "Ariane-5 Upper Stage AESTUS Engine"] [Text] Upper stage motors are not as powerful and impressive as those that propel the lower stages. However, due to their position closer to the payload, they have to offer extremely high efficiency and absolute minimum mass. The AESTUS engine development started with a technological phase in 1986. The go-ahead for the main industrial development programme was given in 1989. The AESTUS engine is being developed by Deutsche Aerospace with support from more than eight industrial companies throughout Europe. The AESTUS engine is the key propulsion element of the Ariane-5 upper stage, which provides thrust and impulse for payload insertion into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), low earth orbit (LEO), and sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). During the mission to GTO it burns nearly 10 tons of the storable propellant combination monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. From the early technological and pre-development activities, the pressure-fed engine (formerly called "L5", then "L7") has grown in thrust, operating time and specific impulse. The latest version, now in its final development stage, produces a thrust of 28 kN [kilonewton] for a nominal duration of 1100 seconds [s] and it operates with a vacuum specific impulse of 3177 Ns/kg (324 s). The increase of thrust from 20 to 28 kN, achieved by an increase in dimensions, caused a severe combustion stability problem during development. Considerable efforts were spent to solve the problem and the engine has now successfully passed all stability tests. All other development targets have been reached and the formal qualification of the engine is planned for early 1994. It has been proven that the design is mature and it has sufficient margin against critical loads or conditions. This was demonstrated by exploring a much wider test domain (in terms of mixture ratio and thrust), compared to the operational domain expected during flight. The engine is therefore considered to be a highly reliable workhorse for Ariane-5, offering also growth capabilities for future versions of the launcher. Since reliability was one of the most important design drivers, well-proven design concepts were used. The only notable exception was the injector, where a novel coaxial multi-element design was introduced with the aim of achieving high combustion efficiency, combustion stability, and adequate thermal conditions for the injector face plate and the combustion chamber inner wall. The photograph shows the layout of the engine that consists of the following components: -- cross-type universal joint -- multi-element coaxial injector -- regeneratively-cooled combustion chamber -- radiation-cooled nozzle extension -- oxidizer and fuel valve assembly -- gimballing actuator struts. The newly developed injector comprises 132 coaxial injection elements. The fuel enters the injector coming from the cooling channels of the chamber. It cools the face plate before feeding each injector and being injected into the chamber. The oxidiser is distributed to the injection elements via a manifold located on the rear of the injector base-plate. The combustion chamber is an integral design, the same as that developed and used by Deutsche Aerospace for the cryogenic engines HM7 and HM60 Vulcain. It consists of a stainless steel inner liner with milled cooling passages and an electrolytically deposited nickel layer for outer closure. The regeneratively-cooled nozzle part extends to an area ratio of 10:1. At the interface to the injector, the combustion chamber is fitted with quarter wave acoustic absorbers. The absorbers are not required for normal engine operation and not even during helium-gas ingestion testing, but bomb testing revealed too small a margin against bomb-triggered combustion instabilities. This margin could be markedly improved by the introduction of these absorbers, tuned to the first and second tangential modes of the chamber. Following are the main design and operation data of the motor: -- Length: 2195 mm -- Nozzle exit diameter: 1263 mm -- Mass: 111 kg -- Thrust (N): 27,870 -- Mass flow: 8.772 kg/s -- Mixture ratio O/F: 2.05 -- Chamber pressure: 10.28 bar -- Propellant feed pressure: 17.8 bar -- Nozzle area ratio (aerodyn.): 83.3 -- Vacuum specific impulse: 3176.8 Ns/kg -- Characteristic velocity: 1684.7 m/s
