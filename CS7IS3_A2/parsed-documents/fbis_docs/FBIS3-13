Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-07MAR94-DPRK-U.S.-ROK-IAEA DPRK Reiterates Stance Against Preconditions for U.S. Talks SUMMARY Pyongyang has made a point of reminding Washington that linking the resumption of bilateral high-level talks to the exchange of special envoys by North and South Korea could jeopardize ongoing international nuclear inspections. The North continues to signal its reluctance to engage the South in any substantive dialogue beyond the bare minimum required for the convening of the DPRK- U.S. talks. END SUMMARY To draw attention to Pyongyang's stance, Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu, head of the North Korean delegation to last summer's high-level talks with the United States, took the unusual step of issuing his own "press statement"(SEE NOTE) on 4 March. Kang's statement claimed that there were no preconditions stipulated in the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement for resumption of bilateral talks. The statement, carried in full by KCNA and Pyongyang radio the same day, also complained that Washington is using the exchange of envoys and IAEA inspections as preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit and the convening of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, set for 21 March in Geneva. (NOTE: A press statement is typically issued in the name of a Foreign Ministry spokesman. This is only the second time Kang has been observed to issue a press statement of his own. Kang issued a press statement last November calling for a "package solution" to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue (Trends of 17 November 1993, pages 15-17)--a step that eventually led to the 25 February agreement.) Focusing on the special envoys issue, Kang claimed in his 4 March statement that the 25 February agreement only mentioned resumption of working-level contacts to discuss the topic and not realization of the exchanges. His statement also implied that any U.S. insistence that the envoy exchange precede resumption of high-level talks could jeopardize IAEA inspections. Reiterating Pyongyang's depiction of Seoul as irrelevant to discussions of the nuclear issue, Kang contended that the South has neither "political wherewithal" nor "authority" to discuss the nuclear issue. Implying that the North will agree to exchange envoys on non-nuclear issues only, Kang claimed that "only when" the South stops the "unjustifiable act" of trying to push its way into the discussion of the nuclear issue and makes a "clear switch" toward seeking national unification can the exchange of special envoys take place. Kang said that "reintroducing unjustifiable preconditions"--conditions that he claimed the United States had tried but failed to include in the 25 February agreement--can been seen only as "an element capable of destroying the full implementation" of the agreement. In a 7 March followup commentary, the party paper Nodong Sinmun similarly cautioned Washington against creating "artificial difficulties" by setting preconditions. The commentary urged a "strict observance" of unspecified "principles" set forth in last June's DPRK-U.S. joint statement (KCNA, 7 March). Inter-Korean Dialogue In line with Pyongyang's posture, North Korean media have characterized the "fourth" inter-Korean working-level meeting on the exchange of presidential envoys, held on 3 March, as having made no progress. The North Korean chief delegate introduced two new demands (Pyongyang TV, 3 March) in addition to the previously raised issues of 1) stopping all "nuclear exercises" and 2) renouncing the "international cooperative system" (Pyongyang TV, 25 October 1993)--that is, seeking cooperation with the United States and Japan to apply pressure on Pyongyang on the nuclear issue, with attendant references to UN-imposed sanctions. The two new conditions are that Seoul: + Call off its effort to bring in Patriot missiles. + Withdraw "remarks" that it will not "shake hands" with the North, an oblique reference to the remarks South Korean President Kim Yong-sam made last June. Also suggesting that the North Korean leadership is not quite ready to engage the South in serious discussions, Pyongyang media have continued their harsh personal attacks on ROK President Kim. The latest attack came in a 4 March KCNA dispatch criticizing the remarks made by Kim to Seoul radio, which, according to KCNA, showed that Kim is a "heinous traitor" and a "dyed-in-the-wool flunkeyist." The only sign so far that Pyongyang does not want to totally foreclose the avenue of dialogue for now is the fact that the North Korean chief delegate at the 3 March meeting refrained from directly naming President Kim in his remarks at the talks, as reported by North Korean media. Background The idea of exchanging presidential special envoys was first advanced by the North last May to deal with "all issues" related to national unification, most likely as a fall back position on the eve of the first round DPRK-U.S. nuclear talks, then slated for 2 June. Subsequently, after much wrangling, three preliminary meetings were held to discuss procedural matters and agenda. However, on the eve of a fourth working-level contact, scheduled for 4 November, the North called off the meeting to protest remarks by the South Korean defense minister, who, Pyongyang claimed, had hinted at the possibility of a preemptive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities (Yonhap, 3 November 1993). Moreover, even while reluctantly agreeing to the latest round of inter-Korean contacts, Pyongyang has still maintained that the nuclear issue must be resolved bilaterally between the DPRK and the United States. Implications Although couched in tough language, Kang's warning against "preconditions" did not rule out the possibility that envoys may be exchanged before 21 March. In fact, Pyongyang's stance may be designed to test Washington's resolve to stand behind Seoul as the latter navigates the waters of inter-Korean dialogue. Therefore, while Pyongyang's hardened stance at the North-South talks may represent posturing for bargaining, its continued personal attacks on ROK President Kim suggests that the North is still reluctant to reach any agreement of substance with the South at present and is proceeding with inter-Korean talks solely to meet requirements for the resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S. talks.
