The first three months saw nearly 150,000 new mobile telephone subscribers, bringing the total figure of national subscribers to 784,500. Meanwhile, wireless paging subscribers increased by more than 852,000, bringing the total number of wireless paging subscribers to more than 6.456 million. Mobile telecommunications appeared in China's mainland but a few years ago. However, the rapid development of the sector has been fairly surprising. In 1993 there were 461,000 new subscribers of mobile telephones, 2.7 times the total figure for previous years, while wireless paging had 3.384 million new subscribers, 1.5 times the total figure for previous years. At present China's wireless paging system has become the third largest in the world after those in the United States and Japan. Experts believe that China's mobile telecommunications business is now enjoying a golden time for development. For several years in succession, China's economy has been steadily developing at a fairly high speed, which poses an urgent demand for speeding up the development of telecommunications business. And the state has also been paying special attention to this field, with some 40 billion yuan put into posts and telecommunications fixed assets last year. This year the planned investment in fixed assets has been raised to 53.6 billion yuan, in a bid to reinforce the capital construction of telecommunications. So far, all Chinese provincial capitals have begun mobile telephone service, and over 300 cities have opened mobile telephone systems. The development of mobile telephones will at last realize the goal of national automatic roaming service. Sources said some provinces, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Liaoning and Shandong, have already provided roaming services within their own territories, while the Zhujiang River delta, including the cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen, has taken the lead in the country in carrying out inter-regional roaming services. At the end of last year, automatic roaming services also opened in the Chang Jiang River delta, with Shanghai city, Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces included. Sources from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said that at present the country is making efforts to construct a national mobile telephone network. By the middle of this year, over 80 percent of coastal cities and towns will be covered by the network; by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), cities above the prefectural level will all open their own mobile telephone services, and at that time the network will cover all of the country's medium-sized cities. The rapid development of mobile telecommunications business also provides a good development opportunity for China's mobile telecommunications industry. Facing the present situation in which 90 percent of the country's mobile telecommunications market has been occupied by Motorola and other foreign companies, related Chinese departments have marked the research and production of advanced mobile telecommunications equipment as a field for key development. Materials show that in the past two years China's mobile telecommunications industry has achieved considerable results. The Hangzhou Telecommunications Equipment Factory has constructed a production line capable of producing 200,000 mobile telephones a year. Last year it produced more than 80,000 mobile telephones, while this year it plans to turn out 105,000. In addition, the Beijing Telecommunications Equipment Factory has just finished a production line, with an annual output capacity of 150,000 digital mobile telephones; some telecommunications enterprises in Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan, Shanghai and some other places have also introduced foreign production lines and will start production in the near future.
