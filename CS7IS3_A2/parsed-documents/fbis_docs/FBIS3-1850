At the jubilant moment for millions of households, I extend, on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, Spring Festival greetings to people of all nationalities, commanders and fighters of Liberation Army units, armed police officers and men, and public security cadres and policemen in Anhui; warm regards to comrades staying fast at their posts during the festival; and deep appreciation to all comrades and friends who have contributed to Anhui's development. The past year was one in which Anhui witnessed the fastest and most efficient growth of its economy since the introduction of reform and opening up. The gross provincial product totaled 94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent. We reaped a bumper agricultural harvest and pushed village and town enterprises to a new stage of development. As a result, the annual per capita peasant income increased 150 yuan to reach 724 yuan. Industry grew at a rapid pace, and high-tech and high value-added products increased by a big margin. Anhui's ranking of industries at and above the township level rose from 14th to 12th in the country. A number of energy, transport, postal and telecommunications, and water conservancy projects were successively completed and put into operation, thereby building up strength for further development of the provincial economy. We were especially gratified with a breakthrough in enterprise reform. The instant success of the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, the Anhui Energy Corporation, and the Meiling Enterprise in issuing and listing their stocks on markets resulted not only in the raising of over 7 billion yuan in funds for construction, but also the accumulation of invaluable experiences for establishing modern enterprises. While the economy was developing rapidly, we also made advances in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and various social undertakings to further consolidate political stability and unity. Scenes of vigorous economic growth were seen everywhere on both sides of the Chang Jiang and along the Huai He. Facts have once again borne testimony to Anhui's conditions for developing faster and more efficiently and to its people's capablility of tiding over any difficulty in their course of advance and of continuously pushing forward the great cause of rejuvenating the province. This year will be very crucial for us in advancing on the crest of victory to deepen reform and accelerate development. In the coming year, we shall comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, focusing on the center of economic construction, pay close attention to three major tasks. First, we should go all out to carry out reform, expedite the establishment of a modern enterprise system, energetically promote reform of the fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems, and open Anhui wider to the outside world so as to further stimulate economic growth with breakthroughs in reform and opening up. Second, we should bring into play the spirit of tenacious struggle; push on in the flush of victory; exert every muscle to maintain the momentum of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and meticulously organize forces to accomplish the current provincial government's goal of "achieving vigorous growth in three years and scale a new height in five years" so as to scale a new height in Anhui's comprehensive strength. Third, we should implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's principle of grasping two links at the same time, intensifying the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and continually consolidating and developing political stability and unity so as to create a favorable environment for reform and construction. The people's interests and happiness are the starting point of our work in all fields. In the course of deepening reform and accelerating development, party committees and governments at all levels should carry forward the fine traditions of forging close ties with the masses, paying attention to work methods, and improving work style so as to harness the enthusiasm of the masses in reform and construction. It is necessary to always bear in mind the immediate interests of the masses, protect their interests, and do everything possible to solve their practical problems, especially the practical problems of poor areas. I am convinced that, guided by the party's basic line and through the common effort by the people throughout Anhui, our cause will be invincible. Looking to our bright future, the people of Anhui shoulder a heavy task. In the coming new year, let us more closely rally around the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, advance along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and score fresh achievements in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Finally may you all have a happy Spring Festival, good health, happiness in family, and good luck!
