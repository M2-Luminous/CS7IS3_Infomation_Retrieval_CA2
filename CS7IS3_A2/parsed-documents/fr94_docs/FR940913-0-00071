FR940913-0-00071 FR940913-0-00027 (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds. (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. (4) For awards that support research, unless HUD provides otherwise in HUD's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies. (f) HUD may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by HUD. HUD shall not permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval. (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from HUD for budget revisions whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2) or (h)(3) of this section apply. (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program. (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in §84.27. (i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB. (j) When HUD makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, HUD may require the recipient to request prior approval from HUD before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported. (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, HUD shall require recipients to notify HUD in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. (l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless HUD indicates a letter of request suffices. (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, HUD shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, HUD shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision. §84.26 Non-Federal audits. (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions,'' as codified in 24 CFR part 45. (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7) and HUD regulations implementing OMB Circular A&hyph;128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments,'' at 24 CFR part 44. (c) Hospitals are covered by the audit provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;133, as codified in 24 CFR part 44. (d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements of HUD or the prime recipient as incorporated into the award document. §84.27 Allowable costs. For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31. §84.28 Period of availability of funds. Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by HUD. Property Standards §84.30 Purpose of property standards. Sections 84.31 through 84.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. HUD shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of §§84.31 through 84.37. §84.31 Insurance coverage.
