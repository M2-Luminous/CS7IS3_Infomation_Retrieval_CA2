FR940506-1-00031 FR940506-1-00011 Current and Proposed Regulations As part of NHTSA's inquiry in this notice, the agency seeks comments on the desirability of actions which would be harmonized with those of Canada. United States Requirements FMVSS No. 303 requires that school buses, regardless of weight, must comply with a moving contoured barrier crash test. In this test, a barrier traveling longitudinally at 48 kilometers per hour impacts the bus at any point and angle. During and after the impact, the fuel pressure drop must not exceed a specified limit. The final rule contains no requirements for heavy vehicles other than school buses with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms. Canada's Existing and Proposed Requirements Currently, Canadian motor vehicle safety standard No. 301.2, ``CNG Fuel System Integrity,'' requires that all vehicles with a GVWR of more than 4536 kilograms be subjected to a 48 kilometers per hour contoured barrier crash test. This is similar to the test NHTSA requires for school buses in FMVSS No. 303. On December 11, 1993, Canada proposed an amendment to its standard. Under the amendment, the current requirement would apply to vehicles with containers mounted lower than 183 centimeters from the ground. If the fuel containers are mounted 183 centimeters or more above the ground, the vehicle would need to meet the requirements of the National Standard of Canada CAN/CGA&hyph;B149.4&hyph;M91 Natural Gas for Vehicles Installation Code, dated January 1991 (copy available in the docket). This is a design standard which specifies in great detail the method for building a CNG vehicle. Request for Comments NHTSA seeks two types of information in this notice. First, the agency seeks information regarding the current and projected population size and vehicle type (transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other heavy vehicle) for CNG vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms. Second, NHTSA seeks information about the potential safety problems of these vehicles. When appropriate, please comment by vehicle type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type of heavy vehicle. CNG Heavy Vehicle Population: Current and Projected 1. The agency requests information on how many CNG transit buses, intercity buses, heavy trucks, and other heavy vehicles of over 4536 kilograms GVWR are in service or are planned to be placed in service in the United States. How many of these vehicles are made by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and how many are aftermarket vehicles that are converted from a vehicle powered by gasoline, diesel, or other fuel? 2. How many entities manufacture heavy CNG vehicles by type, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type of heavy vehicle? How many convert them from other fuels, by type, if appropriate? What specifications are used for converting these vehicles? Do voluntary industry guidelines exist? Please describe and provide the guidelines or citations. 3. How long have heavy CNG vehicles (by type) been used in this country? What are the projections for their future use, in terms of numbers and in type of usage? 4. What are the various locations for mounting CNG containers on heavy vehicles? Which are more common; less common? Why? At what height are the CNG containers mounted? Are they typically protected by shielding or cages? What factors go into deciding where to mount the container on the vehicle? How many CNG containers are typically placed on a heavy vehicle, and how much do the containers weigh? Does the number of containers vary, depending upon the type of vehicle, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type of heavy vehicle? CNG Heavy Vehicle Safety Problems The agency foresees four potential areas for examination with regard to these vehicles: _Performance in Crashes _Venting _Leakage Detection _Refueling Performance in Crashes The agency is interested in obtaining specific information about crashes involving these heavy vehicles. General information about the number of accidents as well as information regarding specific issues such as container detachment would be helpful. 5. Have there been any CNG fuel container or fuel system failures in these types of vehicles? If so, describe the failure, e.g., sequence of events, what failed, and how it failed. If the failure occurred as the result of a crash, was another vehicle involved? Please describe the other vehicle. 6. Was the vehicle a transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or some other type of heavy vehicle? Was it an OEM vehicle or a conversion? Who was the manufacturer of the vehicle? If it was a conversion, who did the conversion? Was the conversion done before or after the vehicle's first consumer purchase? 7. Please identify and describe any situations where a container became detached in a crash situation? Did the container leak? If crashes occurred, were they reported to a policy agency, hazardous materials agency, or other State/local agency? 8. Should the agency specify how the fuel containers should be attached to the vehicles? Should a requirements apply to all vehicles or just for those with containers mounted greater than 183 centimeters above the ground (such as referenced in the Canadian proposal)? Are CNG tanks rigidly mounted or are they mounted so as to be isolated from shock in a crash, permitting some allowable design movement? What is the typical orientation of the CNG tank with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle? Does a CNG tank's mounting orientation and method affect its useful life?
