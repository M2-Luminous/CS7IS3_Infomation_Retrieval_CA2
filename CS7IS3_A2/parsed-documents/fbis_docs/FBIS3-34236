Shaykh Yasin has been in Kefar Yona prison in occupied Palestine since May 1989. The Israeli Military Court sentenced him to life imprisonment plus 15 years. The Hamas representative in Jordan, Muhammad Nazzal, told AL-RA'Y that Hamas received reports from the occupied territories saying that Shaykh Yasin's health is precarious. He denounced Arab and international public opinion for ignoring the cause of Shaykh Yasin and urged human rights organizations and international establishments to pressure Israel to free Shaykh Yasin immediately. The shaykh has spent four years in prison in very bad physical condition. Nazzal said that delays in the trial of Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Rantisi [spokesman of former Palestinian deportees in south Lebanon] have no legal justification, and are aimed at preventing him, and those who returned from Marj al-Zuhur, from playing their political role in confronting the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Nazzal disclosed that the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, Hamas' military wing, and the Fatah Hawks groups coordinate military operations confronting Israeli occupation. He said the martyrdom of Salim Muwafi, a Fatah Hawks commander in Gaza, a few days ago emphasized that the enemy is going ahead in its onslaught to liquidate all mujahidin and strugglers, regardless of their organizational affiliation. He hailed Fatah Hawks groups who announced they will continue armed struggle. Answering a question on delaying the Doctors Union elections in the Gaza Strip, Nazzal said: The delay is supposed to last for a few days as a result of the recent martyrdom of one of Fatah Hawks commanders. A similar delay was recently announced for elections at the Islamic University in Gaza following the martyrdom of 'Imad 'Aqil, one of the 'Izz-al-Din Battalions commanders. Answering a question, Nazzal said Hamas is not against a phased solution that restores any part of the occupied Palestinian land, on the condition that the Zionist entity is not recognized and that no part of the Palestinian land is ceded. He added: The current negotiations to implement Gaza-Jericho agreement do not represent a phased solution as presented by the PLO in the 1970's. Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, Nazzal said the Davos talks proved that the Palestinian side is the only party making concessions, and that delaying the signing of the agreement was simply a maneuver to market the new concessions made by the PLO leadership and to convince the Palestinian and Arab public opinion to accept the agreement as an important political achievement. Nazzal expected more Palestinian concessions during the next PLO- Israeli talks. He said these concessions will tempt Israel to tighten its position on all issues negotiated during the next stage.
