FR940414-0-00081 FR940414-0-00029 One reason offered for this difference between mothership and factory trawler production is the fact that mothership production benefits from having several vessels scouting for concentrations of whiting, as well as fishing. Factory trawler production might be increased if these vessels were able to benefit from some method of scouting for concentrations of fish, so that the factory ship was able to stay on productive grounds. One commenter provided a news article documenting the use of a new hose-transfer technology that might be used by factory trawlers to transfer fish between two or more vessels. The article reported that a 207-foot (63.1 m) trawler off-loaded 2,000 mt of pollock during a 1-week period using this methodology. Although the article did not say if 2,000 mt represented the trawler's catch of pollock for the entire week, this level of production is the same level demonstrated by larger than 200-foot (61.0 m) vessels in the whiting fishery. This potential for factory trawlers to increase their harvest rates in the whiting fishery is the reason that the schedule for larger vessels requires more permits than is suggested by highliner production data, whereas the formula for smaller vessels, with less potential to increase production, closely tracks highline production data. Comment 5. Several commenters believed that, under the NMFS preferred approach, factory trawlers would accumulate the necessary number of permits at a disproportionately low net cost per unit compared to the net cost, for example, to a 70-foot (21.3 m) vessel upgrading to a 90-foot (27.4 m) vessel. Response. It should be noted that the analysis in the EA/RIR/IRFA of the potential cost of permits in support of the proposed rule was extremely speculative, since little information on the profitability of various sectors of the fleet was readily available. The analysis was never intended as a prediction of what prices would be, but only to illustrate what the range of prices might be given certain par values for 60-foot vessels. Since a working model of profitability in the groundfish and whiting fisheries was not available, no effort was directed at projecting what the actual cost of permits would be. In anticipation of a permit combination rule becoming effective, some factory trawler owners have been purchasing permits. A comment received from representatives of a factory trawler indicates that the cost of securing the number of permits required by the NMFS preferred approach was, in fact, in excess of $1.5 million. Although it is not clear what the commenters intended as a yardstick for a comparison of net cost per unit for smaller versus larger vessels, two potential yardsticks are the cost of entering the fishery relative to the amount of fish that can be caught, and the cost of entry relative to the existing capitalization of the fishing vessel. The following table illustrates the relationships between permit cost and production, assuming that permits cost roughly $6,000 per rating point, as asserted in the comments from the American Factory Trawlers Association. In terms of the dollar amount that must be spent per metric ton of catch, it is clear that factory trawlers will pay more than smaller vessels. Based on highline production levels, a 60-foot (18.3 m) vessel would pay one-sixth of what a factory trawler would per metric ton of catch per week. Ninety-foot (27.4 m) and 120-foot (36.6 m) vessels would pay about one-third to one-half of the cost per ton estimated for factory trawlers.
