Addressing the meeting, the foreign minister stressed that the process of self-determination must be completed by granting the right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who are engaged in a relentless struggle against Indian oppression. He said the cruelty that has been adopted to crush the Kashmiri people's struggle is unparalleled in history. The official machinery and institutions in occupied Kashmir have a free hand to commit all sorts of atrocities to suppress the people's aspirations. Torture, the molestation of women, the death of people in detention, robbery, and the burning of people's houses have become routine. These cruel activities are being committed by the more than 500,000 occupation forces deployed in occupied Kashmir. The foreign minister also told the Non-Aligned Movement ministerial meeting that massive attempts are being made to misrepresent the indigenous uprising launched by the people of Kashmir. Allegations are being made about foreign interference and assistance in this regard. He reminded India that the light of freedom has never been extinguished by oppression and terror. He said this misleading and cruel policy is no answer to the situation in occupied Kashmir. The only solution to the Kashmir issue is to implement the UN Security Council resolution.
