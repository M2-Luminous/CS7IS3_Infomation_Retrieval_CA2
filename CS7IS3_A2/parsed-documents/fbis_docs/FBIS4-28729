Hideki Tanaka, a director of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, OECF, which is extending the credit facility to Malaysia, said the loan could be signed between the end of this month and early July. It will be repaid over 25 years with a three percent annual interest. The OECF, a non-profit body under Japan's Finance Ministry, regularly extends long-term loans at a low interest rate to help emerging economies in Southeast Asia and other developing countries. The Japanese fund has so far provided 15 loan packages to Malaysia with more than U.S.$5.1 billion since 1966, mostly for infrastructure projects. Tanaka said the loan for the new Kuala Lumpur international airport followed a personal request by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to his former Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa, in January last year.
