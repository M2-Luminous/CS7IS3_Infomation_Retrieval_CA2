The Armed Forces will no longer devote their time solely to wiping out guerrillas. Now, they will also participate in social activities. According to De Leon, a close look at the situation shows that individual rights must be respected. An example of the Army's new duties is its decision to cooperate with the arrival of 521 refugee families from Mexico. As of 13 May, the Guatemalan Air Force will begin making 18 flights in Araba airplanes to transport the belongings of the refugees, who will be returning to Mayalan, Quiche, where they will attempt to live despite the continuing presence of guerrillas in the area. The return of the refugees, De Leon added, is part of the aforementioned program, the deadline for which is the year 2003. The plan does not include a reduction in the Armed Forces High Command because its goal is to control future military promotions to prevent saturation.
