During the meeting, in light of local conditions, representatives from all parts of the province held earnest discussions on how to implement the province's help-the-poor plan for this year and eliminate backwardness in the poor areas as quickly as possible and offered good suggestions and opinions. Present at the meeting were leading comrades including Yin Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjie Cailang, Mao Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and Liu Guanghe, and Han Yingxuan [provincial CPPCC chairman]. At the meeting, Ying Kesheng put forth concrete measures to organize implementation of the province's help-the-poor plan for this year and made an important speech on how to do a good job of carrying out this year's help-the-poor work. In his speech, Yin Kesheng said: Historic achievements have been made in the economies of both our province's rural and pastoral areas since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was carried out. Nevertheless, hamstrung by historical, geographical, and other elements, 1.19 million peasants in our province still have problems of food and clothing. The 1990's are crucial to our province in pursuing the goal of the second-step strategy. Paying close attention to the work of helping the poor through development is part and parcel of the goal. Thus we should understand and approach the work from the level of the overall situation of the national economy. While encouraging the areas which have relatively good conditions to continue to maintain the momentum of rapid development, we should help the poor areas speed up the pace of their development and construction to boost the province's economic strength, promote common prosperity and progress among all nationalities, and maintain social stability. He pointed out that the work of helping the poor through development is a social systems engineering undertaking. We should correctly handle the relationship between taking stopgap and radical measures and between long-term and immediate interests, be good at grasping the principal contradiction, and concentrate forces on improving basic conditions for production and enhancing the ability of poor areas to develop themselves. [passage omitted] Yin emphasized that implementation of the help-the-poor and development plan is a task which has a strong policy, social, and mass character. We should attach greater importance to the work of helping the poor through development than we did in the past. Party committees and governments at all levels should put the work on the agenda as an important task. Principal party and government leaders should personally take up the job, take the overall situation into account, and make overall plans. The provincial party committee and government decided to introduce a prefectural, city, and county principal administrative leader responsibility system in implementing the province's help-the-poor plan for this year. [passage omitted] Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao presided over the current meeting and set requirements for the transmission and implementation of the spirit of the meeting.
