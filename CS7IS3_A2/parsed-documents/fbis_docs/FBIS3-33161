According to FMLN Deputy Coordinator Marcos Jimenez, the report by independent UN Observer Pedro Nikken is an indication that an evident decline in respect for human life persists in the country. "The report stresses activities by death squads" and calls attention to the fact that details with respect to the investigations into the murder of several FMLN activists including former commanders Francisco Velis, Eleno Castro and Mario Lopez are still not known. According to Jimenez, the government is seeking, at any cost, to have the country's name taken off the list of countries under UN scrutiny. However, Nikken's report has put the Alfredo Cristiani administration on the spot. He added that that is why they are attempting to downplay the content of Nikken's report by saying that he did not come to the country. They also point out that he based his report on affidavits by several local organizations without on- site verification, "which is a shameless lie since it was the government's officials themselves who prevented Nikken from entering the country." On the other hand, FMLN spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano expressed confidence that the International Forum for Culture and Peace, which is scheduled to start tomorrow, will contribute to accelerating the peace process. He added that the event must help overcome delays that are taking place now with respect to issues such as land distribution, the reintegration program, the National Civilian Police (PNC), and the justice system. He also described the arrival of Brian Atwood, representative of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as "a way of prompting the Salvadoran Government not to commit fraud during the March elections." Finally, Medrano referred to a trip to New York by an FMLN delegation that includes Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno, who are expected to meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.
