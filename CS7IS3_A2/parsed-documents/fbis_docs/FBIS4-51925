Saying that North Korea is trying to develop nuclear arms with an aim not at Japan, China or Russia but at South Korea, Kim said, "Our patience has come to a limit. North Korean nuclear development should be thwarted by all means." President Kim made the remarks at a tea party he hosted at Chongwadae [presidential offices] for about 500 steering and standing committee members of the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification. "I hope North Korean authorities will realize that their acceptance of nuclear inspection and return to genuine dialogue for peace will be the only way for the survival of themselves and the Korean nation," Kim said. He said he is willing to talk openheartedly with North Korean authorities on pending inter-Korean issues including the nuclear question if they unconditionally accept international inspection of their nuclear facilities. The Chongwadae reception was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. Among the attending advisory council leaders were council Vice Chairman Kim Myong-yun and Council Secretary General Yu Kyong-hyon.
