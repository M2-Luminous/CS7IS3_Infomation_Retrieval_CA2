The exercise area stretches along the German and Danish coasts. Approximately 20 aircraft are also involved, NATO revealed. Three ships from the Belgian Navy are participating in these maneuvers, a spokesman for the naval chief of staff said on Thursday. The vessels in question are the tripartite mine hunters (CMT) Aster and Lobelia -- the latter belonging to the STANAVFORCHAN, the standing (NATO) Naval Force for the Channel, and the minehunter/minesweeper Dufour.

France, which has not been part of the integrated military structure of NATO since 1967, is participating in the maneuvers within the framework of normal training relations with its allies, the Atlantic Alliance stated in a press release.
