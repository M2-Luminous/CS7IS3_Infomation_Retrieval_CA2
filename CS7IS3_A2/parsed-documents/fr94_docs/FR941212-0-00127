FR941212-0-00127 FR941212-0-00019 ยง536.174 Determination of compensation. (a) A claim may be allowed only for the amount and quantity of personal property considered reasonable or useful for the claimant to have used or possessed under the attendant circumstances, incident to his or her service or employment. In determining the reasonableness or utility of types and quantities of property included in a claim cognizable under this subpart, an approval or settlement authority will give consideration to the claimant's living conditions, family size, social obligations, and need to have more than average quantities, as well as the circumstances attending acquisition or possession of the property and the manner of damage or loss. (b) The maximum amounts allowable for specific types and categories of personal property listed in The Allowance List_Depreciation Guide constitute a determination of amount of quantity deemed reasonable or useful. A maximum allowance per item indicates that the allowance for a single item of the type or category of property involved will not exceed that amount. A maximum allowance per claim indicates that the total allowance for all items of the listed type or category is limited to that amount. Where both a maximum amount per item and per claim are applicable, the total allowance for all items will be limited to the maximum per claim, which will reflect the allowance of not more than the maximum per item for any individual item. To avoid application of these maximum allowances, a soldier or civilian employee may obtain additional protection on shipments by requesting full replacement protection or increased value protection. The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS may waive the maximum in a particular case for good cause shown. (c) Compensation allowable for an item of personal property will not exceed the actual value of the item at the time of its loss, damage, or destruction. Guidance on determining the base figure for actual value, using replacement costs, estimates, or the Table of Adjusted Dollar Value, is provided in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2. Because soldiers are permitted to replace items missing or destroyed during PCS moves from the Overseas Post Exchange Catalog, even when ordering from this catalog is not otherwise permitted, such items may be valued using this catalog. (d) In adjusting a base figure to determine actual value, standard yearly rates of depreciation have been established for the types and categories of items that have generally recognized periods of useful life; standard flat rates of depreciation have been established for certain kinds of items that decrease in value primarily as the result of the fact they are no longer new and unused, but which do not continue to depreciate on a yearly basis since they are not subject to fixed periods of useful life. (See Allowance List_Depreciation Guide.) However, if personal inspection of damaged property indicates that it was in better than average condition prior to damage, a lesser rate of depreciation should be applied. Similarly, if the evidence indicates that an item was in poor condition at time of damage, a higher rate of depreciation is appropriate. Variations from the established rates of depreciation will be fully explained. The following rules are to be observed in computing the depreciation applicable to any item: (1) Normally no depreciation is to be charged against goods during periods of storage. However, this does not mean that deductions cannot be taken for other reasons, such as a reduction in the market value of an item because of changes in style or obsolescence. (2) Do not depreciate an item which is less than six months old (including an item subject to flat rate depreciation) except clothing and other rapidly depreciating articles which may be subject to considerable use in such a short period of time. Calculate yearly depreciation from the date an item is originally acquired to either the date of pickup (for shipment or storage claims), or to the date the property was lost or damaged (for other personnel claims). If the claimant acquired a used item, then the claimant should use either the date the original owner acquired the item and the original purchase price, or the claimant's purchase price and date he or she purchased the item. In accordance with the Allowance List_Depreciation Guide, compute yearly depreciation in 12 month increments (e.g., 6&hyph;17 months equals one year), excluding the month the property was acquired and the month that the property was picked up, lost or damaged. (3) No item will be depreciated by more than 75 percent. (4) No depreciation is charged against genuine antiques, objects of art, and collector's items, except for repair of portions thereof, such as upholstery, which requires periodic replacement or repair. For the purpose of this rule, a ``souvenir'' is not considered a collector's item. (e) Compensation normally allowed for an item damaged beyond economic repair is the actual value at the time of destruction. However, if an item has not been totally destroyed and any part remains useful and has a salvage value, and that part is to be retained by the claimant, the allowance will be the value at time of destruction less the ascertained value of the salvageable part. If the claimant does not wish to retain any salvageable part of a destroyed item, he or she may be allowed the full value at the time of the destruction with no deduction for salvage value, provided the claimant turns in the salvageable part to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office prior to payment of the claim or holds the item for turn-in to the carrier (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;44). If the item is turned in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office, a receipt for the property, DD Form 1348&hyph;1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document), will be included in the file of the paid claim. If the staff or command JA determines that salvageable items are valued at $25.00 or less, he or she may advise the claimant to dispose of them other than by turn-in and this decision will be noted on the chronology sheet. In certain situations it may be necessary for the claims office to assist the claimant to arrange for disposition of the property. (f) If, after payment of a claim, an approving or settlement authority discovers that the payment was erroneous because the claimant misrepresented the quality, quantity, age, condition, or replacement or repair cost of items, or other facts necessary to the adjudication of the claim, the approval or settlement authority may recalculate the amount allowed and arrange for recoupment of the erroneous amount paid. However, this procedure should be used sparingly, with doubts resolved in favor of the claimant. The procedure is independent of any other action taken against the claimant. (g) In determining allowable amounts, cents will be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar on each line item. Drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. Thus, $1.49 becomes $1.00 and $2.50 becomes $3.00. ยง536.175 Cognizable incidental expenses. (a) Expenses incident to repair or replacement. In addition to actual value, the cost of obtaining estimates of repair necessary to substantiate amounts claimed for damaged property may be considered, provided the action of the claimant in contracting for the estimates appears reasonable under the circumstances or was specifically directed by the approval or settlement authority. However, when the cost of an estimate can be applied toward the bill due upon completion of repairs, the cost of the estimate will not be allowed, whether or not the claimant chooses to have the repair done. (b) Replacement of certain documents. The fee charged for replacing certain necessary documents such as marriage licenses, driver's licenses, passports, or birth certificates may be allowed when these documents are lost or destroyed.
