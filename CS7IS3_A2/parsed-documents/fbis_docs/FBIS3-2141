A Chinese Government source has said, "Although China has not made public specifically how it has conducted its diplomacy toward North Korea, China has been working for the solution of North Korea's suspected nuclear development issue." The source is believed to have suggested the role China has played in North Korea's recent acceptance of nuclear checks by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The persisting view in China is that "North Korea has no nuclear weapons, but it intends to use its nuclear card to normalize relations with the United States at a stroke and to use the normalization of relations a means to keep its system in place." In other words, North Korea has so far taken an ambivalent attitude toward the nuclear inspections based on the judgment that if it simply relents on the nuclear inspections, the United States may continue to press it, raising the issue of democratization. Another Chinese Government source pointed out that the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea adopted late last year the realistic policy of placing importance on the development of agriculture, light industry, and trade. Secretary Hwang Chang-yop of North Korea visited China in January and during his stay in China, he got a first-hand look at China's economic reform by touring Guangzhou city and the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone which have a reputation for the economic development. The same Chinese Government source indicated that "changes are seen for reforms in North Korea," citing the visit by the North Korean official to the city and economic zone. China feared that if North Korea takes unexpected actions after being driven into a corner, it send many North Koreans fleeing into China, bringing instability to China's northeastern region where many ethnic Koreans reside and affecting China greatly. Out of this fear, China persistently asserted that the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development be resolved through dialogue. If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions against North Korea and they are imposed, this would be undesirable for China because it would be sandwiched between North Korea and international opinion. China would have been placed in a difficult situation if negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA fail to hammer out an agreement. China knows the United States is highly praising it's role in North Korea's acceptance of nuclear checks by the IAEA. China appears to be aware of the advantage it can gain from a U.S. awareness that the United States needs help from China to resolve major Asian issues.
