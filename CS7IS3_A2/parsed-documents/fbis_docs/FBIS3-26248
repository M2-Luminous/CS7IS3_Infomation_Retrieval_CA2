People would like to see for themselves what the atmosphere was like on the island. Statistics showed that in 1993 alone, around 240,000 people in Taiwan sent in applications to visit Jinmen. Jinmen, the "war front" of yesterday, which had been shrouded in mysterious veils, has turned into a hot spot, which tourists are vying to visit. Jinmen is located in the Xiamen Bay, only 2,310 meters away from mainland China at the nearest point. That being the case, it had long been the outpost in the confrontation between Taiwan and the mainland; in addition to the 40-some-year enforcement of martial law on the island, Jinmen had become an "out-of-bounds area" in the hearts of the people in Taiwan. Jinmen comprises 15 isles of various sizes, with a total area around 17,800 hectares, of which the two largest isles, Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen, account for 85 percent of the total area. According to 1988 statistics, its population was approximately 45,718 (excluding troops stationed on the island); the number of people of Jinmen origin scattered all over the world was estimated to be 140,000. Most inhabitants in Jinmen engage in farming. The root and tradition of their habits in life could be traced back to Fujian's Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and the residential houses on the island were mostly built after the traditional architectural style of southern Fujian. There are 40-some historic sites on the island, along with many places of scenic beauty. The famous lion-shape god [feng shi ye 7685 3740 3639,] a unique traditional sign of Taiwanese of Fujian origin is a peculiar object for human study, and was said to be a patron saint that had power to control storms and dispel evils and monsters, a popular belief; its duplicates can be found almost everywhere on the island. Aside from historic sites, the military installation and sites leftover from the CPC-KMT [Kuomintang] confrontation are full of attraction to tourists. For example, the Guning Museum of War History, and the Qionglin Underground Village. Since martial law was lifted and the island was opened to tourists, Jinmen has undergone drastic changes. The opening up has brought the island swarms of people as well as opportunities for business. Taiwan-Jinmen airline tickets are sold out most of the time, despite several flights back and forth every day. The greatest opportunity for doing business is the tourist industry. According to the press, hotel rooms are in short supply in Jinmen, and all financial groups were vying for stationing on the island to initiate building projects in a big way. Thus, many overseas Chinese or Chinese residing overseas of Jinmen origin, including those from Brunei, the Philippines, and Singapore, as well as foreign businessmen, have come to invest in the island one after another; that has simultaneously brought along development of the catering business, the movie and television industry, as well as the motor-driven toy industry. Some businessman said that whatever there were in Taipei, there would be in Jinmen, too; thus, gambling, drug addiction, and pornographic businesses were on the rise. Consequently, Jinmen, which used to have a simple social amosphere, was under violent attack. Because of foreign investment swarming in, prices of Jinmen's real estates rocketed almost overnight. The indexes published by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior showed that price hikes of Jinmen real estates topped Taiwan; last year, land prices went up by 60 percent over the same period of the previous year. Today, Jinmen's land price is approximately NT $300,000 [New Taiwan dollars] per ping [0988, approximately 36 square feet, a Japanese unit], and its land has become the most sought after in Taiwan. To meet long-range demands, building of various infrastructure projects and tourist installations has accelerated. The Jinmen civil aviation station that costs NT$ 820 million will be completed and delivered to use by the end of 1995; by then there will be 25 airliners coming in or going out everyday; it is hoped that will bring Jinmen more tourists. Besides, the government has decided to build a "national party" in Jinmen, which will add some attraction to Jinmen's scenery. The people's greater concern is whether or not the establishment of transport, trade, and postal relations will first be implemented in Fujian's Xiamen, which is very close to Jinmen; should that be the case, Jinmen's prospects will be brighter still. Just like Taiwan's media put it: The golden gate is open when Jinmen is opening up. How can anyone remain indifferent facing such temptation!
