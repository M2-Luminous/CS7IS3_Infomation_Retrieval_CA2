In an interview with the Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH, published in London, Beirut and other Arab capitals, Yoel Zinger, said: "We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months, but this situation must not drag out further since the agreement risks meeting the same fate as that of Camp David." Zinger is the Israeli foreign ministry's legal advisor who helped formulate the declaration of principles for progressive Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories signed September 13 in Washington. Subsidiary clauses of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt calling for proposed autonomy in the occupied territories have remained a dead letter. Zinger added: "A further delay in implementation (of the autonomy accord) could lead to the collapse of the PLO." He said Israel had wanted to negotiate a peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization because the organization was in danger of disappearing. "We figured it was in nobody's interest for it to disappear and for Israel to remain alone facing several organizations, none of which is able to speak in the name of all the Palestinian people and to impose itself on them," he added. Israel and the PLO have still not reached agreement on control of international crossing points on the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank town of Jericho, the first regions earmarked for autonomy, a senior PLO official said Friday. The disagreement has delayed the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, which had been scheduled for December 13 under the terms of the autonomy accord. Palestinian negotiators have proposed to their Israeli counterparts the resumption Monday in Egypt of talks on implementation of the accord, the PLO's representative in Egypt said Friday. Sayid Kamal told AFP the PLO was waiting for Israel's reply on resuming the negotiations, which began October 13 in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah.
