The PSM refuses in the document to analyze the current state of affairs in Romania, which it terms as "the responsibility of those who took over the power from the Romanian people," "whom they have deceived and confused," but it rather declares its discontent, which however "has not turned into confrontation, blind passion, and street riots," because the PSM does not believe "that a social state of law can be built through violence, be it even explainable, by the tendency to seize (by making noise and use force and terror) the political stage and the power, in the last analysis." "Indignant" about the tendency of some political parties and personalities "to shift the political struggle to the streets," the PSM warns the "right" and "the anarchist forces" about what can result from this: "...We are witnessing in this June 1994 a new attempt at destabilizing the Romanian state's institutions. Some try to browbeat and eliminate from activity, in undemocratic ways, the inconvenient personalities, from parliamentarians to the country's president." The PSM considers this is because "certain parties" "have no patience for democracy," trying instead "to eliminate the political opponents." Rejecting violence, extremism and terror, the PSM declares its "confidence in the democratic values and the respect for the state of law," inviting its members and supporters "not to react violently to any provocation and not to allow the escalation of violence and terror," and addresses this appeal to all fellow countrymen.
