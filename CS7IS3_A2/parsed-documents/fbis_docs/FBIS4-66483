We obtained a high efficiency of 70% by using a 5OO MHz band one-element antenna with _l_/40 element. We also realized a unidirectional radiation pattern and a higher radiation efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna by using a 900 MHz band two-element superdirective antenna with a _l_/20 element and a _l_/11 element spacing. We confirm that the use of superconductors and the present design principle are very effective for realizing of highly efficient small antennas. Introduction Highly efficient small antennas are required for use as environmental monitors, which can detect long wavelength radio waves sensitively. However, the radiation resistance is very low in electrically small antennas, which have elements whose length is shorter than their wavelength. The radiation resistance of superdirective allay antennas, which have element spacings shorter than their wavelength, are also very low. Consequently, the loss resistance is relatively high and the radiation efficiency is very low when these small antennas are made of normal conductors. However, if a superconductor is used to fabricate small antennas, high efficiency can be maintained. Therefore, small antennas made of metal superconductors, such as lead, have been studied.[.sup]1,2[/] Although these antennas exhibited a lower antenna loss than equivalent antennas made of normal conductors, it was difficult to achieve a high absolute gain because they required the use of a cooling system with metal insulators, and this caused a decrease in antenna gain. Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors (HTS), such as YBaCuO (YBCO) and BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO), many superconductive small antennas have been developed[.sup]3-5[/] because they only require simple cooling systems. This paper proposes small antennas made with HTS, which are composed of helical elements and quarter-wave matching circuits and a feed network.[.sup]6-9[/] The properties of these antennas are also described. Antenna Structure Figure 1 (a) and (b) show the equivalent circuits of a one-element (a) and a two-element (b) antenna. I[.sub]n[/][.sup]e[/] (= _x_[.sub]n[/]I[.sub]0[/]exp(j�[.sub]n[/]) where _x_[.sub]n[/], I[.sub]0[/], �[.sub]n[/] are real numbers) and R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/], are, respectively, the excitation currents and input resistance of the n-th element (n = 1, 2) which is self- resonating at a designed frequency. Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]d[/], _a_[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] and L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] are the characteristic impedance, attenuation constant and length of the matching circuit, respectively. Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]d[/], _a_[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] and L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] are attenuation constant and length of delay lines, respectively. Z[.sub]c[/][.sup]f[/] is the characteristic impedance of a feed line. The antenna is composed of a feed network which is composed of a feed line and delay lines, matching circuits and helical elements. Since R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/] values are generally much lower than Z[.sub]c[/][.sup]f[/] values, it is essential to match these impedances. _l_/4 matching circuits are used in these antennas, because they are easily formed using brittle sintered HTS. Self-resonant helical coils are used for the radiators,[.sup]10[/] because only the resistance (real part of the impedance) can be matched with a _l_/4 matching circuit. In order to adjust each I[.sub]n[/][.sup]e[/] to its designed value, Z[.sub]cn[/][.sup]m[/] and L[.sub]n[/][.sup]m[/] are determined while L[.sub]n[/][.sup]m[/] fixed at a quarter of an effective wavelength on a parallel line. Figure 2 shows the antennas made of HTS materials. Antennas A and B are 500 MHz band one-element antennas with elements which are _l_/40 in length and antenna C is a 900 MHz-band two- element end-fire superdirective array antenna with _l_/20 length element and a _l_/11 element spacing. Figure 1. Equivalent Circuits of Antennas Figure 2. Photograph of Antennas 2. One-Element Small Antenna 2.1 Design and Fabrication The helical elements of antennas A and B in Figure 2 were designed to resonate at 500 MHz by using the moment method.[.sup]11[/] The directive gain of the radiators was calculated at 0.5 dBi. Figure 3 shows the loss at a helical element (_z_) as a function of element length (L[.sup]e[/]). When the surface resistance (R[.sub]s[/]) is large, _z_[.sup]e[/] increases rapidly as L[.sup]e[/] decreases. The elements of antennas A and B were made of sintered BSCCO, whose surface resistance was about 0.5 m_O_ at 500 MHz at 77 K.[.sup]12[/] The _z_[.sup]r[/] values are therefore calculated to be about 0.4 dB in these elements. The input resistance of the element is calculated to be 0.37 _O_. Figure 3. Element Loss _z_[.sub]e[/], as a Function of The matching circuit of antenna A was made of two Cu bars and a dielectric sheet (teflon) was placed between them. A parallel meander line made of EuBaCuO thin-films[.sup]13[/] was used for the matching circuit of antenna B in order to reduce the antenna size. The element and the matching circuit of both antennas were joined using silver paste. The loss of the Cu matching circuit of antenna A is not so high because the parallel line has a relatively large cross section.[.sup]7[/] By connecting the parallel line of the matching circuit to the microstripline of the feed network, the microstriplineworks as a balun (converter from balanced mode to unbalanced mode).[.sup]6[/] 2.2 Results and Discussion Figure 4 shows the actual gain of antenna A as a function of frequency. The gain of an equivalent Cu antenna is also shown in this figure for comparison. The actual gain of antenna A was -1.2 dBi at 80 K and 488 MHz and was 7.8 dB and 6.2 dB higher than the actual gain of the equivalent Cu antenna at room temperature (R.T.) and 77 K, respectively. This value corresponds to 70% of the radiation efficiency, and it is also very high compared with those of previously reported superconductive small antennas. The actual gain of antenna B was -4.5 dBi at 80 K and 469 MHz, and this value was 9.6 dB and 5.4 dB higher than that of the equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 70 K, respectively. This enabled us to confirm that these superconductive small antennas are more effective in realizing high-gain than a Cu small antenna. The relatively lower gain in antenna B is attributed to the loss at the joint between the helical element and the matching circuit. We believe that the gain will be improved by improving the joining method. Figure 4. Actual Gain of the Antennas 3. Superdirective Array Antenna 3.1 Design and Fabrication In a two-element array antenna, the excitation current for each element, which leads to results in maximum gain, should be determined by solving the following of differential equations; partialG[.sub]d[/]/partial I[.sub]n[/][.sup]r[/] = 0 (n = 1,2) where G[.sub]d[/] is the directive gain of an antenna. If we assume that the resonant frequency is 900 MHz and the element spacing (d[.sub]e[/]) is 30 mm, relations between excitation currents (I[.sub]1[/], I[.sub]2[/]) of _x_[.sub]1[/] = _x_[.sub]2[/] and �[.sub]2[/] - �[.sub]1[/] = 165.6� are obtained.[.sup]2[/] The self- and mutual-impedances (Z[.sub]mn[/] n, m = 1, 2) of the elements are calculated by the moment method. The input impedances Z[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/] (= R[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/]+jX[.sub]n[/][.sup]in[/]) of the elements are computed by using Z[.sub]nm[/] and I[.sub]m[/]. In this antenna, we can theoretically expect a directive gain of 6.2 dBi, which is 5.3 dB higher than that of a one element antenna, and a front- to-back ratio of 7.9 dB in the radiation pattern. Figure 5 shows the loss at the element of a 900 MHz band two-element array antenna as a function of d[.sub]e[/]. When R[.sup]s[/] is large, _z_[.sup]e[/] increases rapidly as d[.sub]e[/] decreases. As with antennas A and B the elements of antenna C were made of BSCCO. Since the surface resistance of BSCCO at 900 MHz and 80 K is 2 m_O_,[.sup]12[/] the loss was calculated at about 2.5 dB. The input resistance of each element, R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/] and R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/], was calculated at 2.0 _O_ and -1.66 _O_, respectively. The negative value of R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/] indicates that the element draws radiated power from the other element which has a positive R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/]. This is due to the strong mutual coupling between two elements placed closely each other.[.sup]14[/] Therefore, in order to obtain a theoretical antennagain, the power received at the negative R[.sub]2[/][.sup]in[/] element must be fed back to the positive R[.sub]1[/][.sup]in[/] element through the feed network. In order to realize the above feedback mechanism, the feed network must fulfill the following conditions; (1) The difference in line length from the elements to the branch point must be equal to the phase difference between the excitation currents (�[.sub]2[/]-�[.sub]1[/]). (2) The total line length between positive- and negative- R[.sup]in[/] elements via the branch point must also correspond to �[.sub]2[/]-�[.sub]1[/] +/-�. Figure 5. Element Loss _z_[.sup]e[/], as a Function of Consequently, L[.sub]n[/][.sup]d[/] is determined uniquely, and this is a particular feature of the superdirective array antenna.[.sup]9[/] The matching circuit of antenna C was made of sintered BSCCO, and the feed network was made using a conventional printed circuit board (_e_[.sub]r[/] = 10.2). The elements, the matching circuits and the feed network were joined together with silver paste. 3.2 Results and Discussion The actual gain of antenna C was -4.2 dBi at 910 MHz and 80 K. Its gain was 5.4 dB and 4.0 dB higher than that of an equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 77 K, respectively. We therefore confirm that the superconductive small antenna exhibits a higher gain than a Cu antenna. Figure 6 shows the designed and measured radiation pattern of antenna C. Although unexpected radiations, which perhaps emanated from the feed system, were observed around _P_ = 205�, a unidirectional radiation pattern and front-to-back ratio of 6.8 dB were confirmed for the antenna. The fact that the actual gain of antenna C was lower than the designed value seemed to result mainly from ohmic losses in the Cu lines and silver paste joints, and unwanted radiation. The gain should be improved by changing the feed network from normal conductors to superconductors. Figure 6. Designed and Measured Radiation Pattern of Conclusion We proposed a design principle for superconductive small antennas with quarter-wavelength parallel line matching circuits and helical coil elements and/or a feed network. On the basis of this concept, we fabricated a 500 MHz-band one element antenna with a 0.025 _l_ radiator and 900 MHz band two-element end-fire superdirective array antenna with a 0.09 _l_ radiator spacing and 0.05 _l_ radiator length. These antennas exhibited a higher efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna. We confirmed that the superconductor and the present antenna structures can be used to realize highly efficient small antennas. References (1) G.B. Walker and C.R.
