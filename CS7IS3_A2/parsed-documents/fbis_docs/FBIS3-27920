"I expect the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula to be settled in a peaceful way within this year," Yi said in a news conference with the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club held at the Press Center, downtown Seoul. Commenting on the declaration by the Seoul and Pyongyang governments on denuclearization of the peninsula in 1992, Yi said peaceful use of the nuclear energy should not be hindered. "For the same reason, I object to turning the declaration into an international treaty," Yi said. Yi reaffirmed his position on his plan to meet with North Korean President Kim Il-song in Pyongyang. "As soon as the special National Assembly session winds up in early March, I will file an application with the government to visit North Korea," said Yi. "I will discuss with Kim Il-song various pending inter-Korean issues such as the easing of tensions on the peninsula, resumption of talks, economic cooperation, and reunion of separated families," he added. Yi said a recent poll by the DP found 55 percent of the people in favor of his planned visit to Pyongyang, while just 22 percent responded negatively. The opposition leader also urged the administration to show more independent attitude toward the negotiations to solve the North Korean nuclear problem. "The absence of Seoul negotiators in the talks to settle the nuclear issue can be serious obstacle to the national unification," Yi said. "The government should break away from the practice of depending too much on the United States," he said. Yi made clear again that the main opposition party will veto the Uruguay Round trade deal at the Assembly, saying that domestic rice market liberalization is certain to "destroy" the farming community.
