D&hyph;9711 and D&hyph;9712] Proposed Exemption The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to the past cash sale (the Sale) by the Plans of certain promissory notes (the Notes) to Vaquero Farms, Inc. (the Applicant) and Agri-Bis, Inc., a related company, provided that the following conditions were met at the time of the Sale: (1) The sales price of the Notes was not less than their aggregate fair market value on the date of the Sale; (2) the Sale was a one-time transaction for cash; (3) the Plans did not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the Sale; and (4) the Plans' independent fiduciary determined that the transaction was appropriate for and in the best interests of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries. EFFECTIVE DATE: If granted, this proposed exemption would be effective as of May 31, 1994, the date of the Sale. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Applicant operates a farming enterprise in the San Joaquin Valley area of California. Agri-Bis, Inc. is related to the Applicant by common ownership. The Plans are both defined contribution plans. As of September 30, 1992, the Vaquero Farms, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan had 138 participants and total assets of approximately $4,531,364. As of January 31, 1993, the Agri-Bis, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan had 41 participants and total assets of approximately $2,039,764. 2. The Plans acquired their interests in the Notes in June of 1989 when each Plan loaned $250,000 to Triad Pacific 1987 Investors (Triad), a California limited partnership, unrelated to the Applicant. The Notes are secured by second deeds of trust on industrial leased real property located at 192&hyph;252 West Larch Road, Tracey, California (Drew Centre) and 3008 East Hammer Lane, Stockton, California (the Pavilion). The Applicant represents that, prior to investing Plan assets in Triad, the Plans' trustees conducted a thorough investigation of the potential investment, including an examination of the properties and the financial condition of Triad. According to the Applicant, the investment was consistent with the Plans' investment policies. The Applicant represents that the Plans have invested from time to time in other deeds of trust and that they learned of this investment opportunity directly from the principals of Triad. In accordance with the terms of the Notes, the principal amount of the loans became due in June of 1993. The principal amount plus accrued interest from June 1993 remains unpaid. 8 In July of 1993, the borrower, Triad, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. Union Bank, which holds a first deed of trust on the Drew Centre property securing a promissory note in the principal amount of $3,301,132, has filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay seeking to foreclose on its security interest in the Drew Centre property. Appraisals of the Drew Centre property indicate a range of values between $2,750,000 and $3,900,000. Gentra Financial, which holds a first deed of trust on the Pavilion Property securing a promissory note in the amount of $3,800,000 has also sought relief from the automatic stay to enable it to foreclose on its security interest in the Pavilion property. Appraisals of the Pavilion property indicate a range of values between $2,366,000 and $3,125,000. Consequently, the Applicant represents that the Plans are in jeopardy of losing the security for their loans. The Applicant also represents that full repayment of the loans is very unlikely. 8 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the Notes, and all decisions regarding collection on the Notes when due, are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of part 4, subtitle B, title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not herein proposing relief for any violations of part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the Notes.
