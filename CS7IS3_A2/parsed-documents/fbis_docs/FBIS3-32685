The minister added that she believes there is great confusion with respect to that issue which needs to be clarified. There was an initiative that entailed several trips to Europe and North and South America by various government representatives to explain the progress made in Guatemala with respect to human rights and the peace negotiations. According to the minister, these trips, which were mistakenly called a "diplomatic offensive," did not materialize due to several reasons. First of all, the human rights issue will be the object of an in-depth analysis during the 50th Ordinary Session of the UN Human Rights Commission currently taking place in Geneva, which will be attended by an official government delegation. What better way than for the Guatemala delegation to take advantage of that opportunity to discuss the issue along with the other delegations and expand more on what has already been covered by our ambassadors at the respective foreign ministries. Second, the cost of a huge tour such as the one that had been organized represented too high an expense for the Guatemalan Government. In addition, it meant duplicating efforts by our delegation in Geneva as well as our embassies in the different nations. Having taken this into consideration, it was decided to specifically undertake trips aimed at presenting the new peace negotiation framework that resulted from the last meeting in Mexico City. Of course, plans for these new trips are much more modest than the previous ones. In most cases, the "delegation" will be made up of one member of the peace delegation, except in one case where two members of the peace delegation will participate. In every case they will be accompanied by our ambassadors accredited in each capital. As can be seen, the new official tour has been reduced to the strictly necessary, and the cost has also been cut dramatically. Finally, the minister indicated that using the term "offensive" together with the description of "diplomatic" is not the most appropriate since an offensive seeks to attack, or assault. Diplomatic task consist of exactly the opposite: to convince and explain. The two terms do not go well together. Will Not Establish "Priorities" With respect to publications indicating that priority status will be given to diplomatic relations, Foreign Minister Ruiz Vielman stated: "In modern international relations it is not only inappropriate but also very difficult to classify countries. On a bilateral level a country may not be of much importance. However, at a multilateral level that same country can acquire much importance, thus grading could be ill-suited." According to the minister, where Guatemala does establish a priority order is with respect to issues included in the international agenda. The intensity and extent of the current international context imposes an agenda which must be met in an orderly manner in order to concentrate on those issues more relevant to our political, economic, social, and cultural development. Issues such as the Central American integration process and the new regional and sub-regional integration framework; the expansion of markets for our products and commercial negotiations; Guatemala's projection within the multilateral system with the objective of taking advantage of political, economic, and cooperation opportunities that are opening as a result of group or block negotiations; and taking utmost advantage of existent sources of international cooperation; among others constitute priority issues included in the Foreign Ministry work agenda. Human Rights With regard to the State Department's report on the human rights situation in Guatemala in 1993, Minister Ruiz said that in general the government hopes the international community will recognize the advances made in the Guatemalan sociopolitical process, including the human rights issue. She stressed that the Guatemalan Government cannot and will not ignore the problem by expecting the structure of violence that continued for decades to disappear spontaneously overnight. In fact, she added, the Guatemalan Government recognizes that there are still some problems that must be resolved in order to guarantee full respect for the Guatemalan people's human, political, social, economic, and cultural rights. At the same time, however, it feels that the efforts conducted by Guatemalan society as a whole, and particularly by the government headed by President de Leon, to protect those rights should also be recognized. Minister Ruiz finally said: "The Guatemalan situation is the result of a transition process we are currently experiencing, in which the former authoritarian and arbitrary structures are being replaced by new democratic regulations in accordance with the state of law we are building. It is not exclusively a political matter, as it involves social and cultural aspects. In reviewing the situation, we must take into consideration general trends -- which in the case of human rights are positive -- and the political decisions made on the subject. There is no doubt about the final objective of the process. Within the framework of democracy, we must guarantee total respect for the human rights of all Guatemalans, without any discrimination. What we need from the international community is their support to consolidate the new democratic structures we are determined to build.
