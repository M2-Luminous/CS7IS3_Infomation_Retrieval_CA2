FR940607-1-00013 FR940607-1-00003 B. The Market 2000 Report In its Market 2000 Report (``Report''), the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') committed to working with the SROs to streamline the review of proposed rule changes. 12 The Division noted in the Report that SROs have argued that the process for the filing, review, and approval of proposed rule changes is too lengthy and hampers the efforts of the SROs to provide prompt, flexible, and innovative order-entry and trading services to their members and the investing public. 13 The Division agreed that the rule review process should be expedited for routine procedural and administrative modifications to existing order-entry and trading systems, but noted that modifications that would restrict access, burden competition, or modify provisions or procedures designed for the protection of investors should continue to be considered after the applicable notice and comment period under Section 19(b)(2). 14 The Report also indicated that the Division would consider other types of proposed rule changes that could be subject to an expedited review process. 12 SEC, Division of Market Regulation, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments VI&hyph;10 (Jan. 1994). 13 See Letter from Thomas M. O'Donnell, Chairman and Marc E. Lackritz, President, Securities Industry Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 1, 1993); Letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, New York Stock Exchange, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (November 24, 1992). 14 Market 2000 Report at VI&hyph;10. II. Expanding the Scope of Proposed Rule Changes Filed Under Section 19(b)(3)(A) A. Systems Changes Pursuant to authority in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, and consistent with recommendations made in the Market 2000 Report, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 19b&hyph;4 and the instructions to Form 19b&hyph;4 by expanding the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A). In particular, routine procedural and administrative modifications to existing order-entry and trading systems would become eligible for filing under this provision. The Commission believes that proposed modifications to existing systems that are operational in nature are not likely to raise the policy concerns that warrant the full notice and comment procedures of Section 19(b)(2). 15 Accordingly, the Commission proposes to expand the category of rule filings that are eligible for filing under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include systems changes that do not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest, do not impose any significant burden on competition, and do not have the effect of limiting access to or availability of the system. 15 The Commission's Automated Review Policy II (``ARP II'') sets forth the Commission's views on, among other things, the circumstances under which an SRO is expected to notify the Commission of expected changes to its automated systems. As indicated in greater detail therein, the Commission believes that an SRO should provide notification of certain systems changes not only to inform the Commission for purposes of ARP II, but also to help determine whether the systems change would require a filing under Rule 19b&hyph;4. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29185 (May 9, 1991), 56 FR 22490. Under the amendment, a proposed rule change that, for example, would increase marginally the maximum number of shares per order that could be executed through an SRO's small order routing and execution system may be eligible to become effective upon filing. 16 Another example would be a proposed rule change expanding the number of series or classes eligible for options routing and execution systems. 16 In a 1983 letter to the exchanges and the NASD, the staff of the Commission's Division of Market Regulation took the position that rule changes relating to small-order systems should be filed under Section 19(b)(2). See, e.g. , Letter from Richard T. Chase, Assistant Director, SEC, to Frank Wilson, Executive Vice President, NASD (February 4, 1983). If adopted, the proposed amendments in the release will supersede the staff's position to the extent of any conflict. In contrast, a proposed rule change involving a systems change that would affect the surveillance or oversight capabilities of the SRO or other appropriate regulatory authority would not be properly filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). Such a rule change could directly impair the protection of investors and thus should be filed under Section 19(b)(2). Another example of a proposed rule change that would not be eligible for filing under Section 19(b)(3)(A) is one that would make mandatory the use of a particular order-entry or trading system by members. Because such a rule change could impose burdens on competition, it should be filed for consideration under the more comprehensive procedures of Section 19(b)(2). Similarly, it would be inappropriate to permit a proposed rule change to become effective immediately if it could have the effect of limiting the access to or availability of the system to members or investors.
