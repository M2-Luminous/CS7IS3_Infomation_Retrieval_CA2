Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition party, told reporters that the government should commit itself to work on bringing the sluggish economy back on track and thus now is not the time to reshuffle the cabinet. The LDP has insisted on immediately pushing ahead with economic stimulus measures since last year but the Hosokawa administration has no idea for shoring up the economy nor interest in doing so, Kono said. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee, also criticized the ruling coalition, telling reporters the government has lost its function due to a discord between Hosokawa, and his spokesman and Chief of Staff Masayoshi Takemura. Ozato urged Hosokawa to bring an immediate end to the political turmoil, saying the Diet cannot set up the timetable for deliberations of the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, which the cabinet will submit to the Diet on Friday. Ruling coalition parties have remained divided over Hosokawa's scheme to make changes to his nearly seven-month-old cabinet, expected for Thursday. The primary target of the reshuffle is apparently to Tamekura, the chief cabinet secretary, who has been reportedly at odds with Hosokawa since late December.
