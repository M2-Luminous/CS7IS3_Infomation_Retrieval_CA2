God and history could testify that the Professor was not the one who started the war. Unlike his predecessor, Lyuben Berov was also the target of the other institutions. However, a real war has been conducted in the last week only on one front -- the presidential front. Bulgarian, and probably many non-Bulgarian, factors claim a part in the big game. The reconnaissance view of the battlefield produces the following picture: On one side there is the cabinet, which relies on insecure and even conditional parliamentary support. On the other there is the figure of the supreme commander in chief -- a rather lonely figure, unless one also notes his advisers and controversial military office. Only conventional means are used -- the one gives interviews, the other responds through statements. Behind-the- scenes maneuvers are not revealed to the public at large. The presidential salvo began with the conclusion that Berov's cabinet must go because it threatens civic peace. Despite his four by-passes the prime minister countered in a direct manner -- he accused Dr. Zhelev of violating his constitutional prerogatives and interfering in places he has no business. The Presidency did not react to this blow. It lowered its profile and apparently awaits support from outside. The outcome of the games that are taking place, is unpredictable, especially when one realizes that one side is motivated by interest, the other -- by honor.
