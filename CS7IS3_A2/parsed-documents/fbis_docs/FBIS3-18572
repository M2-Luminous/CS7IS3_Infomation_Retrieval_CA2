FBIS3-18572 "drweu043_i_94011" FBIS-WEU-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 FRANCE * New Staffers for Leaders, Firms Reported 94P20424B 94P20424B Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Several articles in the French press have noted new arrivals in the staffs of politicians and large companies. New Faces in Le Pen's Staff According to the 12 February Paris weekly LE POINT, the extreme rightist National Front's (FN) lack of an executive bureau is compensated by leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's close circle of aides. In addition to "old comrade" Dominique Chaboche, Carl Lang and Bruno Megret are still secretary general and general delegate respectively. However, two new "consummate politicians" have joined the circle. University professor Bruno Gollinisch, 44, is the better known of the two. A speaker of Japanese, Malayan and Indonesian, he is FN vice president for international affairs. A cultured man, he climbed up the FN ladder in 10 years, and "astutely mixes vituperation and political sense." Jean-Pierre Reveau is a long-time Le Pen friend who "holds the FN purse strings." While the new arrivals indicate that a "combat front" is being formed with a view to the presidential elections, they also denote the concern to achieve internal equilibrium, the article contends. "Independent" Gollinisch and Reveau were selected to counterbalance the increasing powers of Megret, many of whose partisans entered the party's central committee following the last FN congress which was characterized by "clan rivalries" denounced by Le Pen. Privatized Phone-Poulenc's Staff The privatization of the Rhone-Poulenc company last November brought no changes in the firm's leadership, according to the 5 February LE POINT. Polytechnic graduate Jean-Rene Fourtou, 54, remains president, with Jean-Marc Bruel, 57, as vice president in charge of quality and environmental issues. Fifty-five-year old Philippe Desmarescaux, director general, is responsible for basic chemistry, research and development, as well as for the group's activities in the United States. More important still is Igor Landau, 49, director general in charge of the health sector, which now represents 40 percent of the company's business. Next to the above group are four "key" officials: Jean-Pierre Trifoulet, 42, a graduate of the prestigious National School of Administration (ENA), who has been promoted rapidly; Brazilian engineer Edson Musa, 55, in charge of the important South America branch; new arrival Robert Cawthorn, 58, an Englishman responsible for Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer (RPR), the U.S. affiliate; and Michel de Rosen, 42, "the real RPR boss," formerly director of Minister of Industrial Development Alain Madelin's cabinet. Balladur's `Galaxy' Writing in the 16 February Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, Jean-Fancois Robert lists the "galaxy" of officials appointed by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to ensure a smooth transition to the new state of economic affairs, as well as the "faithfulness" of the leaders of large groups and companies. Jacques Friedmann, 61, ENA graduate, former aide to Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, has been appointed president of the UAP insurance group that will soon be privatized. Endowed with "common sense" and very influential, Friedmann has also been put in charge of the Chinese market, Robert remarks. ENA graduate Philippe Jaffre, 48, was adviser to Minister of Finance Rene Monory in 1979, then director of the Stern bank, and finally director of the National Agricultural Fund in 1988. Jaffre is now president of the soon-to-be privatized Elf-Aquitaine, which occupies a major place in government policy. Polytechnic and ENA graduate Michel Pebereau, 52, a Treasury man, is seen by Robert as an "astute strategist" and "resolute free-market advocate." A Balladur adviser during the first cohabitation, Pebereau was put at the helm of the Credit Commercial of France on the eve of its privatization. He was so successful that he was also made head of the National Bank of Paris, "the banker of all French companies." Polytechnic graduate Pierre Suard, 59, a scientist with ties to successive cabinets, is a "redoubtable strategist and negotiator," Robert comments. Formerly Alcatel-Alsthom director, he is now preparing to take over control of the Framatome company, nationalized by the Socialists. ENA graduate Marc Vienot, 65, a faithful Balladur follower, spent the major part of his career at the Societe Generale bank. Since the bank owns shares in numerous privatized or soon-to-be privatized groups, Vienot's role is seen as "strategic," Robert concludes.
