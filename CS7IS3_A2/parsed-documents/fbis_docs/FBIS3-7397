Han goes to Beijing on Sunday to join President Kim Yong-sam, who is continuing his state tour of Japan and China, the foreign minister embarks on a separate trip to Washington, D.C., on March 29 and will shuttle back and forth between the United Nations until April 2 to negotiate the contents of the Security Council resolution on North Korea. While in the U.S. capital, Han is expected to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher and possibly Defense Secretary William Perry. At the United Nations, he will confer with Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee. The foreign minister stops off in Tokyo on his way home from April 2-4 for talks with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The Security Council is ready to adopt a resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue sometime next week, when it will likely demand immediate inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Han has timed his visit to New York to coordinate with Security Council members on how the United Nations should deal with the nuclear problem. In Washington, the foreign minister will need to discuss the fate of the South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit," specifically whether and when to hold it this year. South Korea and the United States, although they have recently taken a hard-line stance outwardly, are expected to discuss possible ways to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.
