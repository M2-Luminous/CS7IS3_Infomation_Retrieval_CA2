The protocol signed last September in Massandra provides for this, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax in comments on the statement made by Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Boris Tarasyuk, at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday [19 January]. As Interfax already reported, Tarasyuk quoted high-ranking Russian military officials as saying that nuclear weapons can be removed from Ukraine within a year. But it is technically impossible to carry out this withdrawal so quickly, he said. Besides, Tarasyuk stressed, this would conflict with the understanding reached between the Russian, Ukrainian and American presidents on the need to withdraw the weapons and pay compensation for them simultaneously. In connection with this, the diplomat pointed out that to remove all weapons within a year is out of the question. At the time, when the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met in Massandra Russian experts declared that Russia has sufficient technical opportunities for taking nuclear arms out of Ukraine within two years, he noted. "Our attitude to this issue remains unchanged," he said. With reference to the issue of compensation, the diplomat pointed out that the documents relating to the meeting between the Russian, Ukrainian and American presidents in Moscow state that the removal of nuclear weapons must begin at once. Solution to the issue of compensation to Ukraine will be delayed until this May, when experts from the three countries will meet to discuss criteria for assessing the value of the weapons in question. "The principle of simultaneousness was not mentioned," the diplomat said. According to him, the stand taken by Ukraine's parliament, which will discuss this issue in the near future, may also turn into a problem in the materialization of the Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on nuclear arms. The diplomat also disagrees with Tarasyuk's opinion to the effect that Russia allowed too many nuclear warheads to be concentrated at the places of their storage in Ukraine. According to Tarasyuk, this led to the current situation which is an accident waiting to happen. In this connection the Russian diplomat pointed out that "Kiev seems to have forgotten that it took the nuclear weapons under its own control administratively, and prevented Russian specialists from coming near it for a long time. No wonder the consequences are what they are," the Russian Foreign Ministry official stressed. A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, confirmed that Moscow will grant Ukraine heat-producing elements for the needs of nuclear power plants in compensation for the nuclear warheads withdrawn from there. Speaking at Thursday's briefing in Moscow, he added that America's purchase of part of the uranium obtained as a result of dismantling nuclear arms will be conducive to resolving financial problems emerging in this connection. The process of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament has become irreversible. This inspires Russia and the world community as a whole with optimism, Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov, said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow. According to him, the circumstance that "new people, who want to work constructively and who understand the situation in the right way," have joined Ukraine's Defense Ministry also gives rise to optimism. He meant the recently appointed defense minister, Vitaliy Radetskyy, in the first place, the ambassador said. "This subjective factor will undoubtedly be conducive to resolving objective problems in the nuclear disarmament area," he said. With reference to the Crimean problem in Russian-Ukrainian relations, Smolyakov pointed out that "the issues connected with the structure of the Ukrainian state are Ukraine's internal affair." "We may have personal attachments and even nostalgic sentiments toward Crimea, but in our policy we must proceed from realities," the ambassador noted. According to him, "the country's leadership has already begun to understand that Russia's policy towards the former Soviet republics should be given foremost importance, even though there are several unresolved problems, primarily those connected with financing Russian diplomatic missions in CIS countries."
