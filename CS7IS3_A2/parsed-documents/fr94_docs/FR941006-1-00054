FR941006-1-00054 FR941006-1-00010 The remedial action at the site began in September 1990 with limited mobilization of the Site for surveying purposes. On-site decontamination began on November 16, 1990 and the first shipment of radioactive wastes left the Site on July 11, 1991. The RCC building was decontaminated and dismantled. A portion of an adjoining building, leased by RCC, was fully decontaminated and restored. Dismantling, excavation, and restoration activities were essentially completed by January 1993. Removal of all wastes from the site and revegetation was completed in August 1993. A limited excavation of soils surrounding a sewer line adjacent to the RCC property was conducted during July 1994. Approximately 812 tons of radioactive soil and debris and 92 cubic feet of radium-contaminated hazardous wastes were transported to the Envirocare of Utah, Inc. facility in Clive, Utah for disposal. Approximately 862 tons of uncontaminated masonry and concrete building debris were transported to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, New York for disposal. Other wastes, including approximately 45 tons of elemental lead and 20 tons of structural steel, were transported to the Scientific Ecology Group (SEG), Inc. facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for decontamination and recycling to the nuclear industry. Approximately 2.5 Ci of tritium watch faces were transported to the Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. facility in Barnwell, South Carolina for disposal. Approximately 36.7 kilograms of radium-contaminated elemental mercury were transported to the University of Tennessee for decontamination, followed by ultimate disposal of the treated residuals at the Chem-Nuclear facility in Barnwell, South Carolina and recycling of the decontaminated elemental mercury. Approximately 1.03 millicuries, associated with a radium calibration source, was transported to Rutgers University for use in radon-generation research. Confirmatory sampling showing the site has been decontaminated below the required levels, that contaminated soils have been excavated and disposed of off-site, and that the site has been backfilled with clean soil, provide further assurance that the site no longer poses any threats to human health or the environment. EPA, with concurrence of the State of New York, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the Radium Chemical Company site have been completed, and that no further cleanup is necessary.
