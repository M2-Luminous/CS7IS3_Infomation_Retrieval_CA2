A press release issued by the State Council Securities Committee (SCSC) here today says that China's stock market is still in its infancy, therefore its development should be a step-by-step process and pursued on an experimental basis. To ensure the quality of listing companies, from now on enterprises should accept a six-month-long coaching by relevant departments before they begin public stock offerings. The coaching aims to help enterprises build up a mechanism in line with a share- holding company, according to the press release. The coaching period will be extend to twelve months in 1996, before and after an enterprise issues stocks. With the introduction of the coaching system, stock issue plans of most enterprises will have to be postponed until next year. The stock issuing quotas local governments have received for 1994 will be effective in 1995. This year, the stock issuing will be linked with bank deposits and issue prices will be controlled, the press release says. Meanwhile, the government will enhance supervision of share- holding companies and stock trading. A guideline for enterprise management transformation will be worked out and the stock trading system will be further improved to prevent market manipulation and insider-trading. Violators including securities companies and individuals will be punished according to law. Institutional investors with long-term investment schemes will be the backbone of the future stock market. Therefore open investment funds will be set up when the time is proper, the press release says. This year, the government will increase B share issues and no domestic enterprise should go public on the overseas market without SCSC approval or become a listed company on the overseas market through buying into a listed shell company, the press release says.
