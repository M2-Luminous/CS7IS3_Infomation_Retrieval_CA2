Bela Kadar, Hungary's minister of international economic relations, noted that Japan recently offered 1 billion yen to support environmental programs in the Eastern European region. Kadar, who is promoting Hungary's transition from a command economy to a free market structure, visited Japan to attend a conference on Japan-U.S. aid to former Soviet satellite countries. Kadar said at a press meeting in Tokyo that Eastern European countries are small and their economies are heavily dependent on a stable global economy. "The relationship between Japan and the U.S. is very important from such a viewpoint." He said that former Soviet bloc countries "must clean up the environment, otherwise they cannot hope to attract foreign investors," Kadar said.
