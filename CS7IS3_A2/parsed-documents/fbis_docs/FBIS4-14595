The Croats and the Serbs who are densely concentrated in the Krajina enclave on the territory of the Republic of Croatia, concluded a cease-fire agreement. Russia played a crucial role in achieving this agreement. Vitaliy Churkin, its special representative in the talks on the former Yugoslavia, gave an exclusive interview for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. [Gryzunov] What further action will you take to resolve the Yugoslav crisis? [Churkin] First, our joint actions with the Americans are a precedent which will have far-reaching importance. It is experience which we can use to resolve other conflicts. As regards the former Yugoslavia, two main areas of work have now been mapped out for us. They are further steps to normalize Serb-Croat relations, specifically in areas protected by UN units. Possibly in two weeks' time we will be able to organize a new round of talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb between the Croats and the Serbs from Krajina on economic questions, and then we will move on to the most difficult part of the talks -- Krajina's political status. We intend to take advantage of the accelerating pace of peacemaking efforts in order to complete the settlement of the Bosnian conflict. We and our U.S. partners have a clear idea of what to do next. [Gryzunov] It is known that some Duma deputies are prepared to obstruct the Foreign Ministry in connection with your approach to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. How will you react? [Churkin] From my viewpoint our participation in the program is something that speaks for itself. The reaction of a section of the Duma did, however, come as quite a surprise to me. In this context we have already started to explain our positions and approaches. Our reaction is that we will defend our viewpoint. We have to dot all the i's and cross all the t's. Therefore, as for myself, when I get back to Moscow I intend to participate most vigorously in the upcoming debate on this question prior to 21 April, when it is planned that Russia should officially join the "Partnership for Peace" program.
