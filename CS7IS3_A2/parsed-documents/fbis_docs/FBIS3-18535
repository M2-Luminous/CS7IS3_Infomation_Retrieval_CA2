The foreign minister told us that the Lusaka agreement is technically ready, but it has not been signed yet because there is no political will: [Begin recording] [Durao Barroso] From a technical point of view, the documents are at a rather advanced stage. I met moments ago with a representative of the negotiating team who confirmed that news. The fundamental problem is whether there is the will on either side for a true national reconciliation agreement to be signed. [Correspondent Carlos Pacheco] But does this [the will] exist or not? [Barroso] So far it has not existed. [Pacheco] And, according to what you have just said, what will be the logical outcome of the Lusaka negotiations? [Barroso] Well, a logical outcome would be a positive conclusion, but that will obviously be subject to a political rectification, at the highest level, from both sides. I cannot foresee it at the moment. [Pacheco] Do the conditions exist for that to happen? [Barroso] At the same time as there has been progress at the Lusaka talks, the fact is that the situation has been worsening on the ground. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso talking to our correspondent.
