Just how was this achieved? [Shpek] By a restrictive credit policy on the part of the National Bank and the government. [UPresA] Do you mean the nonpayment of wages? [Shpek] No, that is another factor entirely. Even those credits that went to the producers were transferred to Special Account 726, where they served the purpose of moving goods through the system; but they could not be instantly transferred to dispersal accounts and paid out as wages. The decrease in the inflation rate is merely one of the factors attesting to the state of our economy. We achieved it at a very dear price--by a decline in production. Moreover, the decline in production was influenced not only by the National Bank's restrictive policy, but also by the reduction in demand for goods in the domestic market. First and foremost, this refers to a decline in the population's purchasing power and a reduction in the demand from enterprises. But I am profoundly convinced that unless we disconnect the state's finances from those of enterprises, we will not be able to overcome our economic crisis. You must know and understand that nowadays--for some reason--we are saying the following: "Let the National Bank emit more money!" But now let us thoroughly analyze the state of affairs in those enterprises that are presently operating under the conditions of freedom from the ministry's controls. One enterprise has turned out a product and set a price on it, taking inflation into account, and it wants to pay its people good wages. This enterprise "A" has delivered its products to another enterprise "B," but the latter has no money to pay for them, and the debts between them increase. And this too is a modest-sized emission center. But enterprises are really property owned by the state, and--if not today, then tomorrow--the state will bear responsibility for them. [UPresA] Are you alluding to bankruptcy? [Shpek] Unfortunately, yes. But bankruptcy is not the end of the world; it is simply a matter of changing owners. If we disconnect the finances of the state and those of enterprises, then even under state ownership (a joint-stock company wherein the controlling bloc of shares is possessed by the state), the leading officials will think carefully about what expenditures can be undertaken. And if the enterprise in question should burn down, it could still settle its accounts by means of the mortgage deposit or by that portion of the property that could still be sold. [UPresA] On 4 May, a government directive was issued on the matter of preparing reforms in the tax system. What steps have already been taken in this sector? [Shpek] A discussion is now taking place with regard to cutting the excise tax. Our tax policy must be such that something flows into the budget, or else no revenues would be formed for expenditures. But it must not strangle the producer. Why is the excise tax being looked at hard for possible cuts? Because the level of production in the alcoholic-beverage industry fell by 63 percent during the first quarter. A group of experts is working on a new concept for our tax policy. Certainly the value-added tax will also be reviewed. In general, we must determine and designate just what this value added shall be. We must introduce taxes on land, on fixed capital, and on the population's income. But we do not yet have a system for tracking the population's income. And certainly wages are not a complete measure of income. Nor should we consider that the state simply wants to take things away from people. It is possible that if people's incomes were sufficient, then we would not have to give them reduced rates for electric power, free textbooks, and so on. [UPresA] But how is this tax review to be done in a practical sense? Because, of course, the revenues and expenditures have already been approved; and the budget as a whole has been approved without a deficit. The same VAT [value-added tax] that you mentioned is the budget's largest revenue-producing item.... [Shpek] I have worked very hard to improve myself, but there are still two things that I cannot comprehend--two mysteries which are wrapped in an enigma. They are the mystery of the Immaculate Conception and a budget without a deficit. [UPresA] But why, then, was it accepted and approved this time? [Shpek] That is already another matter. The problem lies not in the high inflation rate per se, but rather in the ability to live under the conditions of a high inflation rate. People have to calculate their earnings ahead of time, and enterprises must learn how to take inflation into account. The same thing is true at the state level. The situation certainly would not have been so difficult if the prices on gas had been changed as soon as they were changed in Russia. If the prices on coal in October 1993 had been changed by a factor of 2.3, then--beginning on 1 January 1994--they would have risen by a factor of only 5.7. [UPresA] Why is it that certain signs of reform are beginning to appear at precisely this time? Is this a kind of tribute to the political situation wherein the government may--possibly--be changed or even replaced by the new parliament? [Shpek] No, this is not the result of the pressure of circumstances. It is simply that the government has returned to a former proposal made by the Ministry of the Economy. We introduced this proposal and such lessons when the draft of the 1994 Plan was already being worked out. But these ideas were rejected at that time. Practical life, however, has demonstrated the necessity of taking such steps. They will be taken not because somebody wants to look good, but rather because this is what the economy demands. [UPresA] Thank you.
