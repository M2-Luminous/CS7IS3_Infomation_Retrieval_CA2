Seven months ago the Constitution imposed a duty on me, which I swore to honor. That is why I am here today to present a state of the nation address as well as a report on the Executive Branch's performance during the period that I was responsible for directing the nation. This feeling of satisfaction overwhelms me. I feel it just as if I were an ordinary citizen. In a few days time I will return to being an average citizen and the same type of person I tried not to stray away from during these past months when I became aware that I would be part of the institutional succession mechanism. In saying this, in no way am I trying to diminish the position's importance or my personal responsibility. However, I seek to highlight how Venezuela was able to confront a crisis of historical dimensions and was able to defeat it by implementing, through an exceptional effort, mechanisms that ensured that governmental changes would take place in a peaceful and orderly manner, such as in societies with a more mature democracies. My administration developed as a result of that effort and from that endorsement. In addition, normal democratic elections were possible as a result of that effort. Also as a result of that same effort and endorsement, my government was able to fully carry out the duties imposed by the nation. In a few days it will be my honor to place the presidential sash across the chest of Dr. Rafael Caldera, an illustrious Venezuelan, an expert in guiding the Republic, and a man unquestionably anointed by the people's vote. His experience and his popular anointment make me feel at peace in handing over the mandate. The Republic was not lost by my hands, and I pass over the command certain that Dr. Rafael Caldera will say the same when his mandate concludes. The origin of my mandate, which differs from those of presidents who succeeded one another since 1959, gives this ceremony a nature that goes beyond simple institutional routine. Amid dramatic circumstances and dangerous general confusion, the Legislative Branch chose one of its own -- me -- to honor and gave him the historic responsibility of taking over the Executive Branch for the remainder of the constitutional period that started in February 1989. Today I have come before the congressmen elected for the 1994-99 five-year period, and this appearance symbolizes the ability of Venezuelan democracy to face a crisis and to build its future. This is why I will not just thank those who as representatives of the nation and functioning in the midst of the most serious institutional conflict our democracy has every faced, placed their trust in a man who had never requested or sought to occupy -- under very special circumstances -- the presidency. This is a thing of the past. It could be seen as a personal expression of gratitude. I have to add, because this deals with the future, that I am certain, and I hope the country is too, that with the installation of the new parliament and the forthcoming presidential inauguration we will be taking a giant step toward the consolidation of Venezuela's institutions. This is not a more or less official expression of optimism or a rhetorical statement. I know that in very important sectors of the nation there still exist the huge crisis factors that produced my brief government period. My government came to power under circumstances that obstructed its work from the very beginning. The start of an administration would have to be difficult if it did not have the two keystones that give strength to governments in democratic countries: the indisputable strength of an election victory and the backing that party support provides for daily influence of public opinion. Not only this, my administration emerged in a context capable of making not only the government, but also the state, appear weak. Other factors were to appear during this brief and unique presidential period. These factors were against the traditional appearance of presidential authority. On the one hand, the image of the Executive Branch had changed because state governors are now being elected directly; and on the other, the privatization of the big public enterprises had taken from the president a traditional source of power. At the same time, there were social demands that could not be met quickly because a treasury deficit created difficulties and problems could not be resolved or commitments could not be fulfilled as quickly and as easily as before. In addition there was the unrest that prevailed in the country following the February 1992 events and as a result of the institutional crisis of June 1993. In addition, there was the new economic situation, the daily deterioration of the family budget, and the state of hopelessness in the middle class. During the past few months, all this resulted in continuous observations about the frailty of the new government, the small probabilities of the government lasting until the November elections, and the paralyzing and anguishing expectation about what could happen at any moment. The continuous consultations we held with all the sectors of the national community and in all regions showed us, better than polls, the reasons for absenteeism or electoral indifference among a significant group of Venezuelans. It appeared that democracy was going to succumb. New military rebellions were feared, immediate strikes in important sectors were expected. After a succession of partial strikes a date was set for a general strike in the public sector. This, in effect, would have spurred unpredictable consequences for the December elections. Incidentally, I would like to clear up something now. Those union demands did not respond to goals derived from the people's needs. They were, as I said at that time, fair aspirations but not feasible due to the serious fiscal crisis and the growing Treasury deficit. In addition, the country was appalled by the terrorist threats that were perceived as a product of diverse conspiracies. I would be lying if I said that my government, even since its beginning, lacked total institutional or national support. I was able to count on the initial support of the Parliament, the support of the nation's Armed Forces, and the support of the Catholic Church. These stimulated our determination to progress on the road to transition because we perceived that our goal to listen to demands and to hear positions from all the nation's sectors and regions were more than heard, they received satisfactory solutions. The government I led was initiated with demands from political sectors and the written press to make significant changes. Most of these demands were in reference to scrapping an economic program that the Congress had recently approved through a series of legislative laws. Since the beginning I warned that I was not a miracle worker, that I was a public servant. I understood at that time that my government's main objectives were, as they could not be otherwise, to reestablish public peace by putting an emphasis on dialogue instead of repression, to persist in negotiations to resolve and restructure labor demands, to rehabilitate -- to the extent possible -- public finances to prevent a halt in the payrolls before December and thereby assure administrative continuity, and to revive faith in the elections. I believe that any judgment passed on the brief, but intense administration that I have headed, should be based on the explicit objectives that I was given. It was too short a term to carry out significant programs in state organization, but was a term committed to respond to the demands and risks of the national emergency. Democratic will prevailed in the end and in the 1993 electoral scenario the public presence of all the existing Venezuelan political organizations of the nineties surfaced. The final acceptance of the election results meant the end of the most serious stage of the crisis that shook the nation. This has allowed us to put an end to doubts and tensions, thereby opening the road to a new chapter in our history. These statements should not be taken as an assertion that now that the elections are over we live in the best possible world. This would be an attempt to hide the concern resulting from election abstention registered in official statistics. This is of particular concern when it involves the younger Venezuelan generation. Both the willingness expressed by those who cast their votes and the willingness not to vote, given their equal force, make up a puzzling and difficult situation in our history. The puzzling situation we are experiencing is that the possible solutions entail important changes in the very system adopted by our democracy to alleviate backwardness and injustice. This is because more than 30 years have gone by since an experience without precedent in Venezuelan history was initiated. This took place at a time when there was a small population, a manageable fiscal situation, absence of large social demands, and political participation in a stage of clearly defined dimensions. That situation disappeared and gave way to another reality whose development is traumatic and unpredictable. As with any beginning, this new period we are facing is characterized by the urgent demands of the new Venezuelan society, and, therefore, a redistribution of power is required. No dictatorship would have endured the kind of crises that our democracy has endured in the past three years. I do not want you to think that what I will now say is the product of some sort of professional or intellectual distortion stemming from my passion for history that prompts me to yield to the joy of making comparisons. I have had the privilege of experiencing two major crises in our democratic system, and in both of them the circumstances placed me in the very eye of the hurricane. I was a protagonist and a witness at the same time, as a public man and as interpreter of history: The first time, I served as secretary general of the Presidency of the Republic beginning in 1959, and the second time I served as president of the Republic. This has allowed me to monitor closely and experience not only the events, but also to see their hidden sides. This has allowed me to recall -- and I am recalling this before you -- that we are not experiencing an unknown situation and that during the first five years of the democratic period -- in the early 1960's -- the country was rocked by a deep crisis as a result of national changes and world developments -- as is the case with the current crisis -- that caused serious political conflicts. In those years, there were numerous military insurgencies, terrorist actions, and guerrilla activity fostered by the enthusiasm generated Fidel Castro's triumph in Cuba and by a fiscal and economic crisis that forced the government to adopt special measures. Despite the seriousness of the events of that five-year period, they were met by a national community that had not long ago come out of a decade of dictatorship to which it did not wish to return. That is why this national community thought it had found a cure for all of its evils in that new political period. Behind that backdrop there was determination to persist in democracy and liberty, and this was reflected in the establishment of a political pact by which the most powerful political parties, despite their differences and without disclaiming that disputes existed among them, managed to unite to face conflicts that situations of this sort always provoke, but at that time they appeared to be so new and unprecedented. That collective will and that political pact brought three decades of stability to the democratic system and the changes in our society and the opening of the political system -- with all of their faults and inconsistencies -- have been achieved through institutional means. That pact is virtually nonexistent today, and we do not yet have another one to replace it. The country has changed significantly in all areas. These significant transformations could have affected its political life in the recent elections. Dr. Rafael Caldera enjoyed the support of a group outside the traditional majority parties, and at Congress there is now a balance of four and not only two coordinated groups. The democratic model mentioned in the Constitution and the pact that strengthened it have become limited, while civilian awareness and the people's participation in the continuous exercise of democracy have matured. The people no longer comprise a more or less passive body that is only evident at election time. Rather, the population now is the direct promoter of public activity, as well as a not very reverential critic. This is why we cannot postpone decentralization, the development of the electoral system, promotion of greater democratization of parties and unions, drastic reduction in government size, and fostering complete honesty in administrative and judicial procedures. This profound change coincides, and not by chance, with a weakening of the protectionist, profit-oriented [rentista], and inward-growing model based on petroleum and of a spendthrift state that ended up pouring on that complex process of transformations the fuel of inflation, deterioration of services, and insecurity. Though these may be growing pains, which when handled in an enlightened fashion may lead us to higher stages of development and higher levels of life, it has not been easy to make people understand the need to establish an austere system -- not a patronage system -- based instead on productive work. The excessive custodianship of the state and the unproductivity hidden by massive official aid have been ruinous practices that have structurally weakened the treasury and tend to give the deficit a chronic nature. The worrisome events of February 1989, as well as those that took place in February and November 1992, are manifestations that, although unusual, brought to light before the December elections the major changes many of us had foreseen -- seen through the naked eye, without pessimistic considerations. Those threats that seemed a thing of the past in our political life may prove beneficial to democracy, with all the violence in which they took place. If we succeed in understanding them, they add pressing reasons for the need for a national consensus to change. The process of decentralization. That process of in-depth political change that has been taking place in the country has been fundamentally manifested in the direct election of governors and mayors since 1989. That political event -- no doubt the most important in our democratic history since the introduction of universal and direct suffrage to elect our representatives in 1947 -- falling within the framework of the state reform proposals I was honored to promote in the Presidential Commission for State Reform in late 1988, has set the stage for a new era, one of an democratic but also decentralized and participative state. The decentralization policy of my administration stems from my conviction that thanks to this process, the experienced political change has occurred in a democratic manner. The real modifications that have taken place in the political state will begin to be felt in the constitutional period that is beginning. Aware of the irreversible presence of this consensus for institutional transformation, I imprinted on the decentralization process during the months of my mandate all the momentum possible as the democratic tool of the inevitable political evolution. I appointed a state minister for decentralization to guide this process on behalf of the government, to propose the necessary political and government decisions, and to establish new grounds for the intergovernmental relations the new state required, where the government of the Republic is not merely the national government but is a government together with the state and municipal governments, as part of a public, single, and overall public authority that is no longer vertical, but constitutionally distributed in a horizontal manner in the territory of the Republic. The decentralization charter of 1989. During my months in office, this law was implemented and complemented through regulations I issued through the Council of Ministers. The bases were established for the process of transferring national jurisdiction and services to states and municipalities, and mechanisms were regulated in a smooth manner to advance the necessary intergovernmental relations between the national, state, and municipal authority bodies. The creation of the Territorial Government Council, National Mayors' Council, and the Council of Government for metropolitan Caracas stemmed from there. By the same token, agreements were signed with five states transferring public health services. We signed another agreement on care for children and senior citizens. In addition, the national and state organizations signed many agreements to relieve clogging of services. Urgent fiscal action. The implementation of deficit budgets in the past few years reached a critical point in the second half of 1993, coinciding with my government. Doubts were raised concerning the possibility of adequately repaying domestic and foreign obligations, including the payment of the public administration's payroll and year-end special remunerations. Several solutions to the fiscal problem were carefully studied within the short time available. In view of the impossibility of significantly cutting expenses, the government resorted to establishing taxes on the nonoil sector. This was feasible, considering the low fiscal pressure on this sector. Consequently, and by way of congressional authorization, I issued decree-laws at ministerial council meetings, which established value-added taxes [VAT] and taxes on corporation assets. Other decrees enforced the new Banking Law, the Fiscal Stamp Law, and the Judicial Tariff Law. One of the VAT's characteristics, among others, is its immediate and easy collection. Its destiny now depends on what this sovereign Congress may decide. The tax on enterprises' assets is, more than anything else, a means for preventing income tax evasion. Meanwhile, the taxes stipulated by laws to reform the Fiscal Stamps Law and Judicial Tariff Law were updated and fine-tuned. Efficiently and on a short-term basis, the new taxes not only provided resources to meet urgent fiscal needs, but they also decisively contributed to the placement of securities issued in 1992 and 1993 -- securities which had seen little acceptance. Late in 1993, it became possible to place those securities because investors realized the Venezuelan Government would be in a better position to pay its obligations. On a mid-term basis, and in addition to helping correct the fiscal deficit, this placement can ease the refinancing of the debt by resulting in better fiscal control, an essential condition to meet this objective. In the area of expenditures, numerous allocations were declared nonfeasible. This made it possible to finance greater priority needs. These additional resources were used to complete the financing of the electoral process and the Republic Plan, meet the state universities' requests, create a single compensation bonus, and raise salaries according to collective contracts. The public budget already runs in the millions, while fiscal revenue sources have not yet been diversified. Expenditures exceeded fiscal revenues during 1992 and 1993. The corresponding deficit materialized in payment orders worth more than 180 billion bolivares. The tremendous nature of the fiscal crisis and the shortness of my term made it impossible to tackle this problem fully. The budget approved for 1994 is based on estimated general revenues that proved unrealistic as soon as the weakness of the international oil market determined a drop in both sales volume and the price of our oil. To top it off, a large portion of the special revenues anticipated for the complementary financing of this budget also proved unrealistic. All of this makes us expect another worrisome fiscal deficit. The new leaders of the nation must urgently find in-depth solutions and new and dependable sources of income, while, at the same time, finding areas where public expenditures can be reduced and other budget credit requirements are met. These leaders must carry out an dauntless fiscal reorganization based on modern tax schemes and resource-utilization plans which might correct the downturn that has taken place in the recent past. The Task Accomplished I want to emphasize the task accomplished during the short and conflicting duration of the administration I presided over by those who accompanied me in the government tasks. In the work done in different sectors, they did not show any interest other than serving Venezuela. They knew they could not count on the support of any parties, and they were aware of the great responsibility of the government they formed. Public order was maintained and relations with all political sectors were maintained within an atmosphere of understanding, respect, and broad-mindedness. We fulfilled our international commitment and increased our leading presence in the Latin American economic integration process. We reached fundamental accords in the agricultural and auto manufacturing sectors. In terms of the health sector, we worked enthusiastically, and this translated into standards that took into account the growth of demand, the definitive application of national law on this matter, and the demands for decentralization. Concerning the areas of education, social work, and labor relations, we responded to demands with programs, notwithstanding the growing limitation of fiscal resources. The extensive report accompanying my message and the notes and reports of the ministers deal with these government administration aspects. The detailed presidential report is illustrated by numerous statistical figures that explain and complement the statements on this message on the state of the country. Venezuelan Reflections The fact that I can address you from the highest office in the Republic is a situation that cannot repeat itself. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to make some final reflections on the future of Venezuela, the questions involving Venezuela's future, and the ways to solve problems I have learned throughout my participation in public life, which I realized during my short stay at the presidency. These reflections are aimed at contributing in a modest manner to examine the decisions that you, as representatives of a country needing the truth and solution, must make in these dramatic years. Our contemporary history has centered on the state. During 70 years of this century and until recently, the center of disputes in society was the proximity of the state, given its role as great distributor of income. All social sectors approached this rich state, capable of enriching profusely, to enjoy its riches either legitimately or illegitimately. That state, which was the basis for the habits of the Venezuelan people, no longer exists. We have a state that is deeply in debt -- a debt for which oil revenues are not enough -- with multiple obligations that cannot be met in terms of services and social security by resorting to old ways and resources. Petroleum, the source of so many supplies, is today also the source of our many constraints. Oil revenues are insufficient for society to live off of them, and in the future it is not more promising than it has been in the past 10 years. We built a state that considered erroneously -- as can be appreciated now -- that the flow of oil revenues was constant, eternal, and unstoppable. When oil revenues decline and debt obligations become evident, the state enters a situation of insolvency, without being able to face its commitments. Today the state owes workers, contractors, and social institutions responsible for guaranteeing a minimum level of quality of life for Venezuelans in terms of health, education, housing, and transportation. Venezuelan society has not yet understood this reality. Representatives of all national sectors continue to come to Miraflores Palace to demand compliance with real or supposed commitments. This is the cause for the deterioration of the governments. The fact of who is leading the country is not as important. When the hand is extended to the state and it does not give a prompt and satisfactory response, a sensation that the state is failing to meet its responsibilities sinks in. The truth of the matter is that the state can no longer do things the old way. Never again. It is the duty of Venezuelan society, now as never before in its recent history, to set forth its own alternatives and meet its own needs through mechanism of its own. This does not mean the state will relinquish the role it must play in a society like ours. However, for this to happen, society itself must provide the resources that oil provided in the past. There is no alternative. We must go -- and we are doing this now -- from a society that lives off its earnings to a productive society that can pay taxes and sustain the means that enable the state to fulfill its social functions. As we never tire of saying, the majority of Venezuelans do not understand or agree with this evident truth. The same ones who talk about state needs that are more reduced and operational and less interventionist, are the first ones to extend their hands to obtain the state's protection and resources the minute they face a problem or difficulty. In another respect, the reforms package has limited the state's intervention capacity. Private entities and institutions were handed activities and powers that not long ago were the purview of the public sector. This is a signal of progress, but often, counter to what is being said, the state tries to intervene in activities that it left to the private sector. These contradictions are present in Venezuelan society, and they are the cause of many of the demands made on our depleted state. The foreign debt burden is real. Between the foreign debt, the internal debt, the floating debt, and the unregistered debt, the pressure that exists on the Treasury makes it impossible to implement many projects and meet many expectations. Fiscal accounting has turned into a kind of fiscal sleight of hand in Venezuela. Meanwhile, corrective measures -- many of them painful -- meet the resistance of deeply rooted traditions as well as vested interests. As long as there are no leaders with a clear awareness that their guidance must enlighten all Venezuelans on the new conditions, and as long as lawmakers do not accept that they must sacrifice the promises they made to correct the course, any effort to obtain fiscal resources will run up against the view that it will be misspent or provide raw material to corruption. This predicament is extremely perilous. It is not true that the leaders are corrupt or insensitive. The truth is, however, that the leaders do not speak clearly to the people of Venezuela. The failure to do that turns them into the first victims of the people's rage, because decisions are made without clarity. When they become difficult, leaders seek to distance themselves from them so as not to lose popularity. That is not the way to build a permanent leadership in a modern and strife-torn society. Minor victories can only barely be achieved, and they vanish when despair grows. Public services were the first casualty of state insolvency. The deterioration of public services dates back many years, since fiscal difficulties were first manifested in this field. Many of our schools and health centers are run-down. Our network of roads and highways lacks proper maintenance. Our transportation system is vast but ineffective. During the bonanza time, adequate maintenance was not provided because everything could be replaced by new projects or more money. We were unable to foster an awareness of maintenance. We lacked the mental clarity which would have allowed us to regard maintenance as a way to preserve the country's assets for lean times. Many projects are crumbling before our eyes .... [pauses] Many projects used to crumble before our eyes because we expected to replace them with others, when we should have learned to maintain them instead. This is a cultural reality of the utmost importance. Social segments behave that way because they do not maintain what they have in their own personal lives but seek to replace them with new and costlier products. Anyone who throws away a personal possession just because it has some minor damage cannot have a clear awareness of how to maintain public goods. People demand that the state eliminate the fiscal deficit, but often those who propose this desirable goal are the same ones who do not hesitate, even under the difficult situation we are experiencing, to pressure the state to increase its spending to resolve a problem. Those who on the one hand criticize increases in spending yet reject the government's actions to obtain more resources are the same people who on the other hand repeatedly demand the enforcement of actions that generate further spending. [applause] At the same time, we are facing just demands for pay increases, better social security, and programs to protect the most vulnerable segments of society. These demands lay permanent siege to the public resources, and the state can no longer face it. Administrative problems. Compounding all these conditions is another dramatic one: Public administration is practically useless. It was an adequate structure for managing a country of 10 million people with a budget that barely exceeded 10 billion bolivares almost 20 years ago. That same apparatus tried to manage a nation of 20 million people with a budget of over 1.2 trillion bolivares. That change of scale has turned public administration into a monster barely able to meet its obligations. The presidency of the Republic, regarded by the collective imagination as the center of power and favors, is a precarious management office upon which an unbending social pressure is exerted. We have a presidency that uses 19th century methods, but we need one that meets the needs of the 21st century. The president no longer has the power he once held. Society has become more complex. There has been progress in decentralization. New factors of social power have emerged. Citizens have their own means of administering themselves. Economic activity is taking a private course. The traditional government dues are disappearing. The people, however, view the presidency and the president as the deciding factor in all the country's benefits and ills. If this view of the president's actions does not change, it will be difficult for the head of state to be, beyond brief periods of hope, the representative who Venezuelans feel is always committed to their destiny. He will always have to do less than he promised, and the promises he keeps will always be thought of as limited, petty, and sometimes as undesirable. Under these circumstances, the president is a prisoner, but most of all he is a prisoner of himself if he hopes to carry out the things of which he dreamed and if he is regarded as a wizard who can resolve through magic [applause] everything that accounting does not allow him to do. We cannot be pessimistic about Venezuela if we intend to do what must be done, but we must abandon all hope if an erroneous concept about a leader's role prevents us from courageously planning and doing what must be done. The only way to defeat the national belief that only a dictatorship allows the adoption of severe measures to reorganize the country is to prove that democracy is capable of doing it. There is no other option. Democracy cannot be a covert dictatorship, yet democracy cannot renounce changes that are determined by our times, even when these changes are difficult and costly. Lasting leaderships are those that build things even when it may cost them a short-lived, evasive popularity, not those that seek to please. Trying to please without assuming the inherent responsibilities of leadership is the best way to destroy the people's faith in democracy because in the end citizens forget demagogic actions and only remember their personal experience in a disaster. However, the need for a serious rather than demagogic leadership cannot cast aside, hide, or deny that the crux of the Venezuelan crisis is the social issue. The idea that economic growth in and of itself creates social welfare is not true. Economic growth is possible, but a concentration of wealth can also result in the growth of poverty within a society. The idea that all the state's efforts should be directed at maintaining economic variables at a specific rhythm of growth without meeting the people's basic needs is suicide for a democratic political regime, and it is also suicide for the economy and society. The social problem is much more critical and urgent because the state's resources have been severely diminished. The social issue cannot be exclusively handled by the state based on its fiscal resources. Society as a whole must assume its responsibility toward less fortunate sectors. That means the business sector must be aware that its contribution toward solving the situation of poverty in the country is essential and unpostponable, because social pauperism renders personal wealth precarious. It also means that labor unions and organizations must understand that a substantial portion of public resources must be destined for social programs and not so much to fulfill labor demands. That means, above all, that an organized civilian society must provide proof of its solidarity by sponsoring mechanisms that allow us to face more appropriately the catastrophic conditions created by poverty. To forget the poor is a form of forgetting democracy and economic progress in a regime of liberty and democracy. [applause] A national agreement is essential to solving Venezuela's problems. This has not been a chance proposal. Instead, it is based on our conviction that only a broad agreement will allow us to overcome Venezuelan society's structural problems. Let us forget the idea that a man or a party will be capable of carrying out a project of that size or of facing the gigantic challenges of a modern Venezuela. Only an agreement based on various opinions around a nucleus of power will be able to achieve this. This is a mandatory provision, and above all it necessitates the willingness to recognize the fact that retaliation or the annihilation of an adversary will only lead to the collapse of the Republic. We have faced bitter times in Venezuela. There were elite leaders who did not feel the country shake under their feet in 1858. Leaders of that time vented their cruelty on one another and abandoned the idea of an agreement. This ignited the fuse and civil war broke out. The same thing happened in 1947 and 1948. Each one believed he was right in his own way and the result was a ferocious 10-year dictatorship. We have time to learn from those examples, but we do not have too much time -- the country cannot wait too long. This year must be the year of a national agreement to guarantee the survival of democracy and its social achievements. First, an agreement must signify the acceptance that all groups which make up our society can and deserve to participate. The groundwork for an agreement is undermined when someone tries to exclude someone else. [applause] The pretension of judging who can or cannot participate leads to a chain of exclusions that pulverizes any possibility of achieving an agreement. Second, the agreement must have an unequivocal and sound democratic basis. We cannot accept the cynical idea expressed by a German thinker, who said democracy was accepted to achieve power, but once power was achieved, it was a matter that only pertained to the group that achieved it and it did not imply a commitment. That position is political suicide if not voluntary manslaughter. [applause] Third, the national agreement cannot be reached through an endless chain of social demands that would render it futile. No one can believe all his demands will be part of an agreement because it would be rendered null if everyone's behavior were similar. We are dealing with basic issues, and the national emergency demands that we take these and no others into consideration. State reforms must be the core of the agreement. These reforms have not started...[pauses] these reforms have started and they have resulted in essential achievements for society, but pending tasks are so important that they are unpostponable. The constitutional reforms are a key element of this process. These do not involve all the changes that may be sought in this area, only those which manage to create a platform for the irreversible modernization of the state and the nation. President-elect Dr. Rafael Caldera has placed special emphasis on this issue and the State Commission for Reforms can be an efficient conduit for drafting proposals. Reforms of the central administration and the presidency of the Republic represent essential elements for a strategic settlement like the one that has been proposed. It is necessary to turn the government structure, above all its center, into an efficient instrument to fulfill the immense tasks that the Venezuelan state currently faces. The presidency of the Republic must be a privileged target of this transformation so the head of state can have the appropriate instruments to formulate, carry out, evaluate, and control the implementation of the policy adopted by the government for each specific sector. Decentralization is another issue that demands a serious dedication to the tasks resulting from a national agreement. This process is changing the situation in Venezuela, but despite all the efforts made since the election of governors and mayors, it is still misunderstood by many national leaders as well as by many regional leaders. This is a dangerous misunderstanding, and its neglect may lead to serious dangers for the Republic. Citizen senators, citizen deputies, these are some of the issues that may become the groundwork for a long-term national agreement without which Venezuela's future is in danger. The idea is not to cause alarm, only to tell the country the truth at this hour, this conflictive hour, this dramatic hour -- because therein lies the solution. [applause]
