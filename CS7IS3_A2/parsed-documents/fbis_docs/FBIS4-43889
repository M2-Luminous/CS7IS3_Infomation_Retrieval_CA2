On the election of a new EU executive chief, to replace resigning president Jacques Delors, Italy will ask that a special summit be called in September because a unanimous decision "is impossible today" and forcing a decision at the Greek summit may cause rifts within the Union. Germany and France have endorsed Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene but Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi seems undecided between Dehaene and Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Two other candidates are also in the running for the Commission presidency. The two top items on the agenda at Corfu June 24 and 25 are the signing of a cooperation accord with Russia and the signing of membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway, which would join the Union in January 1995 if the governments of all 12 member states ratify the treaties in time.
