"I challenge anyone to prove that any former interior minister -- not only myself -- allocated a single lira outside institutional purposes," the president declared Sunday [29 May] in the library of the Oropa [northwest Italy] sanctuary. This was the first time that Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had directly broached the Sisde case, the scandal in which the secret service's greedy treasurers have tried to implicate the chief of state. Scalfaro did not say that he never saw any money change hands; what he said was that he spent it all for the sake of the state, challenging anyone to prove the contrary. Now some people are applauding him for having spoken out so clearly, while others would like him to answer for what he said, demanding that he reveal exactly how the vast secret funds were spent. The first to put this question to him was Gianfranco Fini, AN [National Alliance] leader. However, yesterday Fini backtracked, saying that he is not demanding Scalfaro's resignation nor that he give evidence on how he spent the money: "It is not he who must say how he spent it," he said, without, however, adding who should do so. As the MSI [Italian Social Movement] made this qualification, AN members issued peremptory demands to the president. Late yesterday morning Gustavo Selva, the new chairman of the lower house Constitutional Affairs Committee, stated his own opinion: "The chief of state's remarks cannot be called into question.... Nevertheless the president's evidence should be verified, since Parliament is entitled to know exactly for what institutional purposes Sisde's secret funds were spent." Two hours later former Sisde Director Luigi Ramponi, now an AN senator, renewed the demand: "It is necessary to prove now that the funds were used for institutional purposes...." The watchword was: Scalfaro must explain. It was an extraordinarily consistent one, with even the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] making the same demand: We want a financial statement. The spokesman was Franco Bassanini, the constitutionalist, who judged Fini's response "reasonable." "It is perfectly possible that interior ministers used Sisde funds, albeit legitimately. Perhaps those funds were allocated to perform plastic surgery on some criminal who turned state's evidence and to enable him to engage in some activity to make a living. But Scalfaro must provide an explanation." What the PDS deputy disliked most was the reference to ministers already implicated in the scandal: "The most embarrassing thing is that what applies to Scalfaro may also apply to his predecessors. This means, then, that this documentation has not been destroyed and that it therefore exists, or at least that it did exist." This being so, according to Bassanini, there is only one way to examine whether the funds were administered properly: "To grant an independent authority the opportunity to check on the destination of the funds." Very well, quipped Pierantonio Graziani of the the PPI [Italian Popular Party], but how can Scalfaro reveal it if the expenditure was confidential? "Since these were confidential funds used for equally confidential institutional purposes, should Scalfaro -- in order to maintain this confidentiality -- whisper the truth in Fini's and Bassanini's ear?" But the rude shock to the president's friends came with the statement from Raffaele Della Valle. Having conceded that "for the present" there is no "Scalfaro problem," Della Valle added Forza Italia's weight to the demands for explanations from the president: "The president's word cannot be called into question, but I do not believe that anyone is exempt from the obligation to provide, in the proper forums, fuller explanations of what he says."
