The official described the audience as private. Li, who is officially on a holiday tour of the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, met Wednesday morning with Thai House speaker Marut Bunnak. His tour has triggered protests from China, which refers to his travels as "vacation diplomacy". Beijing has said that governments would see their friendly relations with China suffer if they hosted the Taiwan leader.
