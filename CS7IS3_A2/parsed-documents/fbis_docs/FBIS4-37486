['Urayqat] Thank you. [Al-Jundi] Concerning the Palestinian detainees that Israel pledged to release in accordance with the Cairo agreement, what is the latest news? ['Urayqat] The Cairo agreement clearly states that during the five weeks following the signing of the agreement the Israeli Government would release 5,000 detainees. Some of these detainees, the political detainees, were supposed to be freed with no strings attached and allowed to go to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza. Others were to be handed over to the Palestinian Authority until their sentences ended. In our understanding, the latter detainees are those held on criminal charges. However, currently the Israeli Government is releasing political detainees and dumping them at the checkpoints around Jericho, practically forcing us to keep them in Jericho and preventing them from leaving. The Israelis freed 280 detainees this way and plan to do the same with another 1,000. This procedure contravenes the fourth Geneva Convention, which states that the authorities who release a prisoner are responsible for his safe transport to his home town. It also contravenes the Cairo agreement and places the Palestinian Authority in a very delicate position; it knows that the Jericho area cannot absorb such great numbers because it lacks the necessary infrastructure. [Al-Jundi] Dr. 'Urayqat, do you think that Israel, through such measures, means to disrupt the work of the Palestinian National Authority? ['Urayqat] There is another matter. For the past eight days, Israeli authorities have prevented tourists from coming to Jericho. Jericho, as you may know, is a tourist area that normally receives about 1,000 tourists per day. Tourism provides the main income for most people, workers as well as hotel and restaurant owners. For the past eight days, Israel has prevented tourists from coming to Jericho, claiming that it is unsafe. In doing so, Israel is fully aware of the devastation it is causing to a major economic activity in this area. Furthermore, Palestinians face harassment at Israeli checkpoints. The Israeli Government is still thinking of itself as an occupier. It has not, for one moment, tried to think of itself as a peace-maker or a neighbor. It hastens to seal off Gaza and Jericho as soon as any incident occurs. In my opinion, such acts mean that the agreement is not being given a chance and the Israeli Government alone is to blame. Israel has left us this area in economic shambles. Israel, which has occupied this area for the past 27 years, must be aware of the burning need to create a reliable infrastructure in it. We have begun to build this infrastructure with our own resources, but these resources, and the Israeli Government knows this, are negligible. Israel knows that during the past month we have begun operating more than 30 departments. If Israel continues to pursue its current policies, this area will be left with a bleak future. If Rabin's aim is to undermine the current effort, he, in my opinion, is about to succeed. [Al-Jundi] Has a specific date been set for the arrival of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to the self-rule areas? ['Urayqat] This issue has nothing to do with the arrival of President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. It is related to requirements that must be met so he may travel to the self-rule area. In other words, the donor countries have not yet implemented any of the projects they promised. The people judge peace, and trust it according to the tangible changes they see on the ground. They do not care for clauses, figures, or words. The countries that agreed to implement projects have not done so. The Palestinians have done all that they were required, on all levels. We exerted great efforts to activate all departments, and preparations are under way to establish other essential departments. However, the issue is that before president Abu-'Ammar arrives, basic requirements must be available that up to now have been nonexistent. After 27 years of occupation the infrastructure is destroyed. The Jericho hospital in 1967 was much better than it is now. The same goes for the irrigation system, water, electricity, roads, and all other utilities. We maintain that 2,600 projects were approved for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The donor nations agreed to implement these projects at their own expense and the necessary funds were specified. The question posed now is why these projects are not being implemented. I believe that the Palestinian National Authority, no matter what its capabilities, will begin its work 27 years late; that is, the natural development in this area stopped 27 years ago. No matter how hard or fast we work, for years we will lag behind. In other words, the longer the donor countries take to implement these projects, the more problems we will face. Therefore, these projects must be implemented, so the Palestinian National Authority may do its duty. [Al-Jundi] The Palestinian effort is the main factor in development along with the foreign aid? ['Urayqat] Certainly. All I want to say is that we are extremely poor people, particularly in Gaza, Jericho, and the rest of the West Bank. So we cannot deliver with our own resources. We have succeeded in activating 30 departments where we process documents and papers. We have processed more than 1,000 documents in less than three weeks; but we need resources to work out new systems and establish other departments. We have done this with our own resources. The sons of our people contributed time and effort to this. What we reached in Paris was an agreement approving payment of salaries from now until August. This is good, but what I mean is that the requirements of the infrastructure and securing these requirements, are necessary to turn the wheel of the Palestinian economy. We need essential infrastructure projects to turn the wheel of the economy. We need resources to create jobs, to encourage private investments, and to create an integrated economic atmosphere so that the wheel of the economy may turn. As I said, no matter how fast or hard we work we will be lagging behind for many years. [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat. ['Urayqat] Thank you.
