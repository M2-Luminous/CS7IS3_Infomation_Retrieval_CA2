Reporting on the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Karadzic's terrorists and Fikret Abdic's paramilitaries have continued to attack the free Bihac territory overnight and this morning. The chetniks have been using all their artillery and tanks against the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, (Vrsak), and the Bihac part of the front, and they have also occasionally directed their guns at the Bosanska Krupa front. They attempted several infantry breakthroughs, but these were repulsed by our defenders." He says that "in the meantime, the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy attacked the outskirts of Cazin with considerable help from the chetniks of the Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. The members of the 5th Corps responded to the attacks and recaptured some villages that Abdic's paramilitaries had temporarily occupied." Emir Aldakovic reports from Bugojno that "all night the town shook to the explosions of heavy shells fired from the chetnik positions in Kupres and Donji Vakuf. Unable to do anything serious on the front line after the major successes of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, when over 40 chetniks were killed in just a few days, the chetniks are returning to their tested formula of shelling residential areas from a safe distance. The shelling of Bugojno and the killing of civilians is aimed at encouraging the chetniks at least a little, as total chaos -- according to reliable information -- has overtaken their ranks. Aware of the failure of their destructive policy and that it is only a matter of time before the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army comes knocking on the door of Donji Vakuf, or Srbobran as they call it, the Serb extremists have been trying their best -- of course with the help of unlimited supplies of liquor -- to raise their low morale." Enes Ratusic reports from Mostar from the Bosnia-Herzegovina 4th Corps Press Center that "the last 24 hours have been marked by sporadic violations of the cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council." As for the southern part of the Mostar commune, the reports says that "the Serb aggressor fired antiaircraft machine guns and guns at Obradovici."
