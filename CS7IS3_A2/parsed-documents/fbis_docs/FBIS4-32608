The convoy was delayed eight hours because, as the released Serbs from Zenica said, the Muslim soldiers redirected the vehicles from the main road to travel through the Lasva river canyon where the Serbian civilians were maltreated and robbed. Following a short breather in Ilijas, as SRNA news agency has reported, the Serbian civilians around 2200 set off in vehicles of Canadian UNPROFOR battalion towards a reception centre in Sokolac.
