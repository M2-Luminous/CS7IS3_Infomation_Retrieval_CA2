FBIS4-521 "drafr070_c_94060" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Government Condemns Activities Government Condemns Activities MB1204160494 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1505 GMT 12 Apr 94 MB1204160494 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [From the "Newswrap" program] [Text] The government has strongly condemned the involvement of South Africans in the Angolan civil war. Foreign Minister Pik Botha told Lillian Straubach that the situation could endanger the country's international relations. [Begin recording] [Botha] The government is in principle against the recruitment of South Africans for participation in war or conflict in other countries. There is no way that the citizens of a country will not be associated with that country, and very often with the government. That means that, without the government having had the opportunity to decide what is in its interests, in the country's interests, citizens are recruited, and those citizens then participate in a conflict within another country, between parties in that country, which is that country's problem, and it naturally endangers relations. [Straubach] Now is the government doing anything about this? Can the government do anything about the situation? [Botha] Yes, we issued, regularly, statements. I remember quite a number of statements last year, and even the year before, when we were accused of either, you know, acquiescing in secret flights, supplying UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Ango?a] with equipment and fuel. I remmember what a lot of headaches we had to endure as a result of suspicion that we were continuing to supply UNITA with arms and equipment, fuel and ammunition. The matter was raised, at one stage, by the Angolan representative to the United Nations, and I had to do a lot of explaining, and my department called together all the private sector aircraft companies in this country, and instructed them and requested them not to engage in any activity of that natu?e. [Straubach] Now this bunch seems to be supporting the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]. [Botha] Yes. We are even-handed. We are against participation by South African citizens, or we are against the use of South African territory for launching any activity in any of the states surrounding us or, for that mattter, any other state in the world with whom we have relations.
