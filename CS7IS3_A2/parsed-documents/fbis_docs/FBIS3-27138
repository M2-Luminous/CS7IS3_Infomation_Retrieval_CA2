"China welcomes the relaxation, to some extent, of the situation in Sarajevo," a foreign ministry spokesman said. A NATO ultimatum set for 0000 GMT Monday requiring Bosnian Muslim and Serb forces to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or face air strikes expired, with UN officials saying no immediate military action would be taken. China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has repeatedly opposed the use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, calling for a resolution of the situation through peaceful negotiation. "We welcome all efforts by the international community that are conducive to relaxing the present tense situation in Bosnia and creating a favourable atmosphere for peaceful negotiations there," the spokesman said. "We hope that the parties concerned will make continued efforts to promote this process," he added.
