Brkic: "German Mark--1.5 Dinars"] [Text] The Yugoslav dinar continued to lose its value yesterday. BORBA has learned from reliable dealers' circles that the value of one German mark was between 1.42 and 1.5 dinars in gray hard-currency transactions between banks, and banks and companies. The erosion of the national currency has already been going on for 10 days. According to the decision by Dragoslav Avramovic, the National Bank president, the National Bank tried to intervene on the money and securities market by selling state-owned securities the day before yesterday [7 March]. The central monetary authority thus tried to prevent the further growth of the commercial banks' liquidity since it established that the money surplus in bank accounts was enabling the banks to pay the difference between the real and the official exchange rate. Although the response of the banks to buying state-owned securities was good, the devaluation of the dinar was not halted. It is considered that the national bank intervention has not borne fruit because the cause of devaluation was ill-defined. The appearance of the difference between the real and the official exchange rate is not a result of the high liquidity of banks, but of the mistrust that companies have in the program of monetary reconstruction and the economic recovery of the country. Representatives of the Federal, Serbian, and Montenegrin Governments met with [Federal Prime Minister] Kontic the day before yesterday and decided to try to take all possible economic steps to stop the devaluation of the national currency. Mistrust in the economy is growing from day to day, however, which can be seen from the exchange rate of the dinar against German mark over the last 10 days. It has constantly been falling--from 1.10 to 1.50 dinars for a German mark. Some businessmen and banks are pessimistic and predict that the state and the national bank could apply an administrative measure. If this happens, the prognoses are not favorable. The commodity markets have already responded to the gray zone in hard-currency transactions. People who went to the market during the weekend noticed that the prices of agricultural products had risen. Apart from agricultural products, the prices of some other products, such as cement, iron, and other construction materials as well as ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy products had risen by 30 to 40 percent.
