He is the author of more than 100 scientific works and inventions. In February 1993, V.D. Pilyugin delivered a report on the problems of ecology in the Russian Federation Armed Forces at the NATO SSAS [not found] Committee in Brussels. In the Soviet Union, Ministry of Defense ranges occupied 30 million hectares and 42 million hectares were allocated for various military facilities. Furthermore, in the process of daily activities and the conduct of military exercises, the Armed Forces operate on areas that significantly exceed these limits. At the present time, a substantial portion of this territory remains within the jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Some ranges are located outside the borders of the Russian Federation, primarily on the territory of Kazakhstan. Military activity in peacetime is one of the types of housekeeping-economic activities that is associated with a heightened risk of unfavorable impacts on the environment and man. This activity proceeds from the priority of the state's military security and therefore ecological violations are fundamentally permitted in some cases. The Armed Forces are a source of negative impact on the environment, based upon the specific nature of their activities, saturation with complex weapons systems and military equipment, and the employment of energy-intensive technologies in everyday life. Military facilities discharge harmful substances into the air during launches of various types of missiles, flights of aircraft and housekeeping activities (boilers, kitchens, etc.) Furthermore, the Armed Forces are saturated with motor vehicle transportation and, in the meantime, we have calculated that they cause approximately 70% of all harmful discharges into the atmosphere. So, during a 24-hour period, a carburetor engine emits as much carbon gases as a man during his entire lifetime. During the daily activities of the troops, reservoirs and soil become polluted and a significant portion of the pollution occurs due to uncontrolled wastes and poor collection of everyday wastes. There are a significant number of nuclear reactors in the Armed Forces, especially in the Navy. Radioactive contamination of the environment occurs during the operation of reactors, when maintenance work is conducted on them, and when they are removed from operation. Leaks and spills of various highly toxic substances, primarily missile engine fuel, are a source of pollution. The electromagnetic radiation of powerful radio and radar sites and other sources of radiation inflict enormous damage to the environment. The extent of that damage to the environment has still not been completely determined. So, the daily activities of troops inflict ecological damage to the environment. However, civilian departments, and their numerous enterprises that are not equipped with the required cleaning equipment for various reasons, frequently conduct dumping and emit harmful substances and in many cases these departments are attempting to accuse the Armed Forces of the harm that has been caused to the environment. Right now Russia has especially had to encounter this phenomenon when troops are being withdrawn from other states. The governments of these states are demanding enormous compensation from Russia for the damage caused to the environment and there frequently is no evidence that the damage was caused by our troops. At the same time, I need to point out that the Armed Forces have the scientific-technical, material and production potential that is capable of making a substantial contribution to ecological security, including for the creation of ecological monitoring. The Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate, which is called upon to precisely determine the environmental situation in the Armed Forces and ways to improve it, was created in the Russian Ministry of Defense in August 1992. Environmental protection structures previously existed in the Armed Forces. The inspectorate for Protection of the Environment was created eight years ago under the Rear Services of the Armed Forces and inspectorates and inspectors were introduced into the Armed Forces services, military districts and fleets. However, their activities were practically reduced to monitoring functions. In accordance with the Statute approved by the RF Minister of Defense in February of this year, the Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate was tasked with overall management and monitoring of environmental activity in the Russian Armed Forces and also with the organization and coordination of work for the creation and employment in the Armed Forces of special (medical, veterinary, chemical and technical) systems to protect the troops from the impact of unfavorable environmental factors during the course of everyday troop activities and in emergency situations. An RF Council of Ministers Chairman Directive founded the Ministry of Defense Ecological Center, that was created by the Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate in May 1993, to form and develop Armed Forces ecological support systems. The following are the Ecology Directorate's primary missions: formation and development of the RF Armed Forces ecological support system; management and monitoring of the activity of the ecological organs of the Armed Forces services, branches of troops, military districts, fleets, and RF Ministry of Defense directorates; implementation of cooperation with state environmental protection organs; formation of a scientific-technical policy and organization of the conduct of research and development on the problems of military ecology; and, organization of a system of ecological training and education in the army and navy. The Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate is a central organ of the RF Ministry of Defense military directorate and is subordinate to the chief of the RF Armed Forces General Staff. The Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate developed the RF Armed Forces Ecological Support Concept, in which a system of views, primary directions and practical missions in this sphere is reflected, to ensure a comprehensive and weighty approach to the reduction of the negative impact of military activity on the environment. The Concept, which has been approved by the RF Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff, proposes the mandatory accounting of economic aspects in all elements of the RF Armed Forces structural development system. An objective assessment of the ecological situation in the army and navy and the discovery of areas of heightened ecological tension is one of the Directorate's priority missions. Right now we are continuing the ecological passport system [pasportizatsiya] of military facilities and territories and we are conducting the formation of an ecological measures plan and a research and development program for 1994. As of today, the passport system has been conducted at approximately 20% of military units. Work has begun on the creation of an Armed Forces automated ecological monitoring system which will become one of the elements of the Russian Federal Ecomonitoring System. An RF Presidential Directive has approved the procedures for inventorying locations and extraction facilities, transportation, and the collection and burial of radioactive substances and wastes that have been developed in the Directorate. An organizational diagram and the procedures for conducting this work in the Armed Forces have been defined. We are preparing proposals on the formation of ecological organs and subunits ("green helmets") based upon existing Armed Forces structures and services, military districts and fleets. The ecological organs and subunits will be tasked with the resolution of practical missions for protecting and restoring the environment at ground and naval forces deployment and combat training areas. In the process, we plan to utilize the experience of work of nonorganic detachments for the elimination of the consequences of the Russian troop stay in Germany and the Baltic republics, and also similar subunits that have been created in the armies of the United States and Western Europe. A great deal of attention will be devoted to the organization of expanded ecological training of officers at military educational institutions and the development of ecological training and education in the troops. In its activity, the Directorate is proceeding from the fact that putting in order and normalizing the ecological situation in the Armed Forces is first of all a matter for the Armed Forces themselves. In order to achieve that, we need: a) A team of people that will be specially involved with the ecology in the army and navy. To do this, we have created the Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate and the Ecological Center and we are beginning to form a system of ecological organs in military districts, armies, fleets, etc. Furthermore, we are creating special ecological subunits which will conduct recultivation and other restoration work on territories allotted to the Ministry of Defense. It's possible that these subunits will be created outside Armed Forces strength standards or by reducing the army and navy, possibly -- on the principles of alternative service; b) within the framework of all state ecological programs, such as "Russia's Ecological Security", "Conversion -- Ecology", and others, the appropriate portion of the resources must provide for the needs of the Armed Forces. During the formation of various ecological funds, including funds from the employment of tax sanctions, a definite portion of the resources must be transferred to the Ministry of Defense to conduct environmental protection measures. A separate article to conduct environmental protection activity must be provided for within the framework of the defense budget; and, c) A system of ecological training and education in the Armed Forces. In recent years, the RF Ministry of Defense has done quite a bit of work to provide public services and amenities at military garrisons and to transform polluted areas into troop deployment areas. For example, dozens of complexes for the complete biological treatment of sewage with a total output (capacity) of more than 20,000 cubic meters per day were built in the areas adjacent to the Scandinavian countries, that is, toward the Baltic Sea, on the Kola Peninsula, in Kareliya and Arkhangelsk Oblast which had a positive impact on the state of surface and ground waters in this region. I need to note that environmental protection work was carried out more intensively on the territory of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. So, water treatment facilities were built at a number of garrisons there. In Baltic and Northern Fleet garrisons, the total capacity of water treatment plants has been increased by more than 5,000 cubic meters per day in recent years. Reequipping surface combatants and ships with separators to clean water containing oil and also systems for their collection has been completed in these fleets. We are conducting the systematic installation of a new type of waste oil collection systems to clean petroleum products and floating garbage from water areas. There are boom barriers in constant readiness in each fleet. They plan to build additional coastal sites to clean up water that contains oil. In recent years, special attention has been devoted to improving public services and amenities of fleets of motor vehicles and other military vehicles and to equipping them with washracks with circulating water supply systems with gasoline-grease recovery devices. Work is being continuously conducted to ensure ecological safety during the operation of petroleum-oil-lubricants [POL] depots and facilities, and motor vehicle and construction equipment refueling and servicing locations. The above listed environmental protection measures are mainly being carried out through the efforts of the troops themselves without the involvement of specialized construction organizations. The availability of auxiliary support services in the troops is a specific feature of the everyday activities of our Armed Forces. As a result, problems arise with the maintenance of sanitary procedures on the territory of these services. Existing boiler facilities that were built in the troops according to typical designs are far from perfect from the point of view of ecology. As a rule, cleaning harmful combustion products from smoke gases is inadequate. Cleaning gases is mainly conducted in dust extractors and only solid particles are removed from these gases. The resolution of this problem will require significant material resources, effort, and time and will largely depend on the heat-engineering equipment that is being employed and developed. In the RF Armed Forces, attention is also being devoted to the protection, reproduction and rational utilization of forest resources. The volumes and areas for cutting down forests for the needs of the army and navy are being continuously reduced. In Kareliya, Murmansk and Arkhangelsk oblasts alone, the volume of logging has been reduced by one million cubic meters per year, that is, by more than half, since 1975. Forest restoration work is being mandatorily conducted on all cut down areas and the planting of valuable breeds of timber is being conducted. So, in 1992, tree planting was conducted on approximately 3,500 hectares in this region. In 1990, we terminated drift floating of timber that was being conducted in Arkhangelsk Oblast because it had a negative impact on the state of the rivers. Under the new sociopolitical conditions and under the fundamental restructuring of the entire state structure, including in the army, the resolution of urgent ecological problems of military activity is unthinkable without a unified State Scientific-Technical Program which would determine the primary directions and research tasks, the procedures and time periods for accomplishing work, the composition of the executors, the volumes and sources of financing, coordination and the exchange of experience in international cooperation, training and education of cadres. The conduct and implementation of ecological programs in Europe, and in the entire world, will require the united efforts of all countries, including former potential enemies, which in turn will permit us to accelerate the overall process of the transition to international relations from confrontation and an indifferent attitude toward mutual cooperation. In our opinion, we need to begin international cooperation with: 1. Coordination of the norms and standards on all aspects of ecological problems; 2. Organization of an international warning and notification system and elimination of the aftereffects of major accidents and catastrophes at ecologically dangerous facilities that are accompanied by ecological consequences on regional, national or cross-border scales; and. 3. With cooperation in scientific-technical policy.
