Rabin instructed Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq to contact Nabil Sha'th in Cairo and ask that 'Arafat clarify the remarks he made in Johannesburg several days ago. 'Arafat had said that he does not intend to honor the agreement, following the example of Prophet Muhammad in the agreement he made with the Quiraish Tribe. 'Arafat's remarks were aired on Qol Yisra'el yesterday and caused great anger at the prime minister's bureau. [passage omitted] Coming out of yesterday's cabinet session, Israeli ministers expressed concern over the situation in the Palestinian self-administration. Minister Amnon Rubinstein expressed the hope that the PLO leader will find the time to deal with the important issues and will stop his globe-trotting in order to deal with the self-rule. Minister Yosi Sarid spoke in the Palestinians' behalf, saying that one cannot expect them to seize control of the security situation in the Gaza Strip, especially in view of the fact that Israel did not manage to control the events there in its 27 years of rule. [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 23 May carries a report on page 2 by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay, adding: "Israel has decided to freeze the next stage of the peace talks with the Palestinians until the situation in the Gaza Strip stabilizes and until there is proof that the Palestinians are able to handle security matters in the areas under their control. This was reported by senior political sources in Jerusalem last night." The report adds, however, that government officials "are impressed by the Palestinian commanders' seriousness and by what appears to be an attempt on their part to deal with the centers of terror."] After the session, cabinet ministers added that Prime Minister Rabin's remark that the murder of Israelis in the territories is the result of the Israeli occupation is a very extreme utterance and has never been said before by any Israeli prime minister. In other words, the ministers were amazed by the remark and said they would never even consider making such a sweeping statement. Minister Shim'on Shetrit said that the Israelis who are still being hurt by Palestinians are neither the victims of peace nor the victims of Israel's rule over a foreign nation; rather, they are the victims of the PLO's and 'Arafat's failure to fulfill their commitments and the agreement they had signed.
