FR940830-1-00060 FR940830-1-00010 2. Listing and LDR Treatment Standards for F037 and F038 As indicated earlier, sludge from the Surge Pond meets the definition of F037 and F038 nonwastewaters. The listing of these waste codes was promulgated on November 2, 1990 (55 FR 46354) and amended on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 21955). LDR treatment standards for these wastes were finalized on August 18, 1992 (Phase I LDR Rule). The final treatment standards for nonwastewaters set total concentration limits for 14 hazardous organic constituents based on the performance of combustion or solvent extraction, TCLP leachate concentration limits for nickel and chromium based on stabilization, and a total cyanide standard based on combustion. However, a two-year national capacity variance was granted for F037/F038 wastes generated from the cleanout of surface impoundments, on the basis of a determination that existing capacity at bulk solid incineration systems was insufficient to treat these wastes. This capacity variance expired on June 30, 1994. Before this date, these wastes could be land disposed in a subtitle C facility without meeting the LDR treatment standards. EPA also determined that impoundments receiving F037/F038 wastes during the national capacity variance would continue to have four years from the promulgation of the F037/F038 listing date to retrofit the impoundments to meet the minimum technology requirements (MTRs), or to close them (59 FR 37220&hyph;37221). After June 30, 1994, the wastes must meet either the LDR treatment standards or alternative standards established by a treatability variance prior to land disposal, be granted a case-by-case capacity extension, or be disposed of in a unit from which there is no migration. 3. Citgo's Management Decisions Citgo conducted a feasibility study in early 1993 (after promulgation of the LDRs for F037/F038) to compare and evaluate their options for closing the Surge Pond. The closure alternatives considered were a ``no action'' alternative, traditional RCRA clean closure, traditional RCRA in-situ closure as a landfill, closure by removal followed by risk assessment (risk based closure), and delay of closure. Citgo chose to pursue closure by removal followed by risk assessment (see Citgo's variance petition for the basis of their decision). This alternative entailed treatment and disposal of a tremendous quantity of F037/F038 nonwastewater that was to be removed from the pond. The treatment technologies considered in this feasibility study included: In-situ and ex-situ stabilization In-situ and ex-situ bioremediation In-situ steam stripping Ex-situ thermal desorption Ex-situ incineration In-situ and ex-situ air sparging Ex-situ dewatering
