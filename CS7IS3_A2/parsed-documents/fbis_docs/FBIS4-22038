He was speaking to reporters in the plane on his way back from Syria where he met with al-Asad to discuss security issues. Mentese said that he has also asked for the return of the chief of the PKK terrorist organization, Abdullah Ocalan. During the three-hour meeting, al-Asad brought up the subject of water, to which Mentese said that there was no need to worry on this issue. He said that he has stressed time and time again that the terrorist chief is organizing ethnic groups in Turkey by ordering them either from Syria or Lebanon, but al-Asad neither confirmed nor rejected this. `At the leaders' level, Turkey has asked for the return of the PKK terrorist chief and the members of the terrorist organization,' he said. Mentese said Greece is among those backing the PKK and it was determined that that country is making efforts to hinder Turkish tourism and this is an inhuman behavior. `It does not fit friendly or neighborly relations,' he added.
