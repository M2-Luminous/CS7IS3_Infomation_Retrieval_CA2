After their meeting, Mr. Papoulias described the talks as successful and expressed the hope that the crisis will be overcome. He further noted that his meeting with Mr. Milosevic was very useful and announced that the European Union's [EU] plan for the settlement of the Bosnian crisis remains the nucleus of talks. Responding to a question if Greece would change its stance and become involved in the Balkan crisis if Turkey became involved in the crisis, Mr. Papoulias said: Greece's position remains that the Balkan peoples should not be involved in this crisis. However, if this principle is violated then a new state of affairs is created and our country should make new decisions in accordance with its own interests as well as the region's interests. The foreign minister also added that in our capacity as EU presidency, we should convince, as he put it, others on the examination and decision, in principle, on lifting the trade embargo against Yugoslavia. If the lifting of the embargo will contribute toward a peaceful process then these questions must certainly be addressed. Mr. Papoulias further noted that he discussed with Slobodan Milosevic the situation in Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and the intervention in the Balkan crisis by forces that are not related to the region. Mr. Papoulias made it clear that the moves by other, non-Balkan countries for a peaceful solution of the problem are welcome, without this meaning involvement in the problem. Mr. Papoulias is now attending a working luncheon being hosted in his honor by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The two-day visit to Russia, which Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias was to begin today, has been postponed because of his Russian counterpart's departure for Israel.
