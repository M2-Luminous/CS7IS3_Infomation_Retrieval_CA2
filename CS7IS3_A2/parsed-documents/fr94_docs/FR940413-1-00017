The purpose of this subpart is to set forth HUD's policy regarding the sale of subsidized and unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. §290.201 Sale of Subsidized HUD-Held Mortgages. HUD's policy for selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: (a) HUD will sell current mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance on a competitive basis to FHA-approved mortgagees; or (b) HUD will sell current mortgages on a negotiated basis to State or local governments, or a group of investors which includes an agency of a State or local government if: (1) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or agency of same to act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage, and ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program; and (2) The sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government, while maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program. (c) HUD will sell current mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance if HUD can offer protections equivalent to an insured sale. (d) HUD will sell delinquent mortgages only if as part of the sales transaction those mortgages are restructured and either FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent protections are provided. §290.202 Sale of Unsubsidized HUD-Held Mortgages. HUD's policy for selling unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: (a) HUD will sell current unsubsidized mortgages with or without FHA mortgage insurance. (b) HUD will sell delinquent unsubsidized mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance. (c) HUD will not sell delinquent mortgages if it believes that foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but would do so if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage.
