The two parties pledged to work together to foil all policies and programs promoting capitulation, particularly since these policies are hostile to the the Arab nation's and the Islamic people's right to independence, to a decent life, and to struggle to defeat the aggression that targets the nation's existence and honor. The two parties also asserted the need to unify all national, pan-Arab, and Islamic forces and mobilize all the resources of the masses of our nation in the Arab and Islamic arenas to oppose all forms of capitulation and normalization. They decided to form a joint committee to devise a mechanism of action, care for the affairs of citizens, and work to safeguard national unity and enhance cohesion between the sons of the homeland.
