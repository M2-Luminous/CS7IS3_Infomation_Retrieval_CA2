Gurdian M.] [Text] With great concern we have seen in the agricultural loan tables published by the BND [National Development Bank] that the projected disbursements for the 1994-95 season are insufficient. I say with great concern, for the amounts listed for each item really lack any logic and agricultural meaning. Let us take a closer look at this. For sesame, for example, the amount to be financed will be 477 cordobas per manzana (according to the table published). Based on my personal evaluation, the actual production cost will be no less than 1,200 cordobas per manzana (I am, of course, speaking merely of operating costs). This leaves a balance of 723 cordobas per manzana which the grower will have to make up; I do not know where the grower will get that money from. The bank, in this case, will only be providing 39 percent of the costs that will have to be financed. Then, of course, only 39 percent of the seed's potential is going to be produced. That is, if all goes well. It is much more likely that production will be less than that percentage. This is especially disturbing as those amounts are less than last year's, despite the 20 percent devaluation and the constant slippages we are experiencing at the present time. The same thing is happening with coffee, sorghum, rice, corn, etc. This will inevitably mean that the grower will not be able to pay off his debts to the financial system. Naturally the producer, because of all the above, will not be able to repay his past unpaid loans that have been restructured or deferred. And, what amounts to the same thing, the high interest rates, the dollarized credits, and the inadequate amount of these loans, will all combine to generate a major liquidity crisis that will cause great distress to Nicaragua's heavily indebted producers. I have the impression that attempts are being made to finance more areas while reducing the total amounts to be financed for all crops. This is truly cause for much concern. That is why things are going badly in Nicaragua, very badly. We have declines in productivity and increases in production costs, due primarily to insufficient credit. I will venture to say that the agricultural technology tables that the bank uses to calculate its financing are far removed from reality, and from what is actually needed to produce a good crop. And there is something even more serious: the limited funds they have planned to disburse will be subject to availability. This means that they will approve loans whose actual disbursement is not guaranteed. The available bank funds will be subject to the funds it has recovered, realizing in advance that those recoveries are going to be low, precisely because past credit was insufficient to reach points of equilibrium in production. In other words, when the producer comes in to apply for a loan disbursement to meet some urgent and essential need, it is possible that payment will not be made because at that moment the bank does not have funds available, thus causing irreparable damage to the harvest. Recently in ADAL [Association of Leon Cotton Growers] and ANPROSOR [National Association of Sorghum Producers] we conducted agricultural experiments designed, among other things, to measure the relation between input and productivity. It is quite interesting that we found that the best harvests, and consequently, the best earnings, were produced by applying agricultural technology tables that are different from the ones used by the bank. In these experiments, the correct amounts were applied in order to produce good crops. It was possible to determine that with adequate fertilization levels, greater than those estimated, with that alone, sorghum production could be increased by 20 quintals per manzana. Obviously, the production cost of each quintal of sorghum then becomes cheaper. It was proved that the marginal cost of using more fertilizer was a very worthwhile investment: it gives us the opportunity to sell at low local prices or to export, generating sufficient earnings for us to pay off our bank loans and be left with a profit. After those experiments, which were repeated many times over on farms in different areas, using appropriate statistical analyses and good experimental designs, we were able to conclude that the best deal the bank can make is to finance production costs correctly and in sufficient amounts. And by a better deal for the bank, I mean that its portfolio of loan payments in arrears, of refinancing, deferred payments, or loan restructurings will be reduced to tolerable levels, like those in a country with a normal economy. It seems reasonable, then, that if we want to create a real economic renewal and to improve our people's standard of living, we should use the valid scientific results that are being generated in Nicaragua in order to adjust the necessary financing correctly. Let us not deceive ourselves. At the present time, the agricultural credit system is making mistakes that bring about unpredictable consequences in political, social, and economic matters.
