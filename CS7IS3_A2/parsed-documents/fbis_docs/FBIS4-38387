The Ukrainian head of state said this at the end of his one-day visit to Chernobyl AES [nuclear power station] and to the power workers' town of Slavutich. "The leaders of the Crimean Republic say they want to be a bridge between Ukraine and Russia, but in fact they are laying a `mine' under this bridge," the president said. Leonid Kravchuk believes that there are forces that are doing this consciously, and there are also those who are laying this `mine' because they can see no civilized way to resolve the problem" [no open quotation marks as received]. "They have an arsenal of rallies and slogans," he added. At the same time, the president voiced the hope that "common sense will prevail among those who are disregarding the laws and Constitution of Ukraine and the universally acknowledged principles of the world community." The president thinks "no one has the right to cross over the `red' line in pursuit of ambitions. If anyone goes this far, we will take decisive and consistent action, but within the framework of the Constitution. There is no other way." There is only one way: To resolve all problems peacefully in accordance with the law, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized. He also issued a warning to those who strive to achieve their own parochial interests. The president stressed: There are enough forces in Ukraine to neutralize those who "resort to unlawful actions." He stressed at the same time that he will not permit any infringement of the principles of goodneighborly relations with Russia.
