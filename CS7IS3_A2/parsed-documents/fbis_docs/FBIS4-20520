Biotechnology is also to receive another G45 million in subsidies from ICES [expansion not given] funding to improve the knowledge infrastructure. After three years of negotiations, three ministries, six universities, NWO and NIABA [Netherlands Industrial and Agricultural Biotechnology Association] have agreed to set up and subsidize ABON [Association of Biotechnology Research Schools in the Netherlands]. During the NBC5 [Fifth Netherlands Biotechnology Congress], ABON will present an overview of current and future activities. The association can count on strong government subsidies. The five research schools participating in ABON will receive subsidies of G22 million over five years: G10 million from the Economic Affairs Ministry, five million guilders from the Education and Science Ministry, five million guilders from the NWO and two million guilders from the Agriculture Ministry. The subsidies will be matched by the participating universities. The total amount of 44 million guilders will create around 65 full-time research jobs in universities, in DLO [Agricultural Research Department] and TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research]. The investment plan follows the main lines of the project areas suggested by the NIABA, namely: "structure function relations," "research of plant resistance," "metabolic pathway engineering" and "integrated bioprocess development." The four areas have been elaborated into a number of themes which are both scientifically challenging and interesting for the industry. Each area will have one or two research schools managing the projects. In turn, each school has appointed a professor to "lead" the projects. In order to ensure that industry has input into the activities, ABON will have a "Scientific and Industrial Advisory Council" which will issue binding advice. Cooperation The ABON unites five biotechnology research schools: -- BioCentrum Amsterdam; -- Biotechnological Sciences Delft Leiden (BSDL); -- Experimentele Plantwetenschappen (EPW, of Wageningen); -- Voeding, Levensmiddelen, Agrobiotechnologie en Gezondheid (VLAG, of Wageningen); -- Groningen Biomolecular and Biotechnology Institute (GBB). The BioCentrum Amsterdam will concentrate on fundamental and applied research. The connecting theme will be the growth and development of living organisms including yeast and bacteria. The BSDL will deal with three areas: industrial plant biotechnology, environmental biotechnology and industrial biotechnology. GBB will concentrate on the atomic structure and function of biomacromolecules. EPW will gather knowledge on four themes: the development of plants and differentiation; disease and resistance to disease; metabolism and energy location in plants; plant biotechnology. VLAG will cover the entire agricultural area and more specifically three core themes: nutrition and health; food technology and food; food resources and agro-biotechnology. Knowledge Infrastructure In addition to the ABON, there is more good news for biotechnology. Last week the cabinet approved two major biotechnology projects to strengthen the knowledge infrastructure: biotechnological soil purification will get G25 million, while biotechnology's material infrastructure can expect G20 million. Soil Purification Universities (including Groningen), large technological institutes, engineering consultants and companies will participate in the first project covering biotechnological soil purification. TNO, Grondmechanica Delft and Heidemij have developed a program for cleaning up polluted business land on site, called NOBIS [Netherlands research program for biotechnological on-site cleaning]. The goal is to develop the biotechnological clean-up of polluted soil using micro-organisms to break down the pollution. Material Infrastructure The second biotechnology project in ICES is called MIBITON. The cabinet wants it to strengthen the material infrastructure of biotechnology research in the Netherlands. MIBITON is a positive reaction by the cabinet to a proposal from ABON and NIABA. These two bodies have drawn up a joint investment program for the coming five years which includes a one-time boost from the government, the G20 million mentioned above. This amount will be supplemented with industrial resources worth around G12.5 million in the form of the revolving fund for industrial investments. In order to effectively monitor these investments, NIABA and ABON will set up the PPSB foundation [public-private biotechnology cooperation] in close consultation with the government.
