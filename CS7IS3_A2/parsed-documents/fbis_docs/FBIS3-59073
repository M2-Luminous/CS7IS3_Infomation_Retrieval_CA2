They are into drugs and arms, but also into hotels, spas, tourism, finance, etc. The Anti-Mafia Commission mapped out Cosa Nostra's activities outside of Sicily and has discovered that.... Maybe it does not yet hold true for London, where according to a fictional investigation published in the SUNDAY TIMES the remnants of the Mafia's top leadership now reside, but it certainly does hold true in Cinisello Balsamo. For Cosa Nostra this town in the hinterland of Milan could just as well be located in the outskirts of Palermo, a piece of Mafia territory that thus far has only been identified with Sicily. Very soon, the old rule that a boss loses his control outside of Sicily could no longer apply. This was one of the more interesting discoveries made by the Anti-Mafia Commission, which all last year traveled the length and breadth of Italy trying to understand to what extent Mafia corruption had infected the country. Their conclusion, which is contained in the report just completed by PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] Senator Carlo Smuraglia, is the following: There is no region that is exempt from the contagion. New targets for Mafia investments include: the very tranquil Val d'Aosta, where the Nirta clan from Calabria is in control of the region's criminal activities; the impenetrable Sardinia, where the Mafia--according to a credible informer like Gaspare Mutolo--engages in real estate speculation along the eastern coast and is trying to get its hands on the tourist industry almost everywhere; and even the less important Basilicata region, which became attractive to the criminal groups after the construction of the FIAT plant in Melfi and the agricultural development of Metaponto because of the economic setup that made it possible to manipulate public works subcontracts and those in charge. Not even the Molise region is immune. It is used as a transit zone for the drug traffic between Puglia and Calabria. The Mafia's traditional economic activities are still drugs, arms, and public works contracts. These are followed by extorsion, usury, and investments in businesses (the Mafia buys hotels in Versilia; casinos in Liguria; and spas in Tuscany). It is flexible in adapting to local ircumstances, and disguises itself so well that it manages to get its own representatives elected to local administrations. Will we soon be seeing municipal councils dissolved in Lombardy because they were infiltrated by the Mafia, like the councils were in Calabria, Campania, and Sicily? Infiltration is so widespread that territorial conflicts arise between the various organizations and are referred to the Mafia courts in the areas of origin--Palermo, Reggio Calabria, or Naples. But arbitrators are also sent out in the field to make peace. Senator Smuraglia's report offers the Milan Car Park as a dramatic example of the new Mafia strategy. It was investigated by the Florence District Attorney's Office without anyone questioning its jurisdiction in the matter. Individuals such as Giacomo Riina, uncle of the boss of bosses in Cosa Nostra, and Nitto Santapaola, who is connected with the Corleone family, were involved with the car park, which in fact was not only an important part of the Mafia activities of Cosa Nostra in Lombardy, Tuscany, and Emilia Romagna but of the 'ndrangheta as well. The members of the Anti-Mafia Commission say that one of the most obvious ways that corruption is spread is through the institution of legal exile, which removes dangerous Mafia members from their region of origin. Although there was a recent decision to abolish these measures, there are still 1,079 of these individuals scattered throughout Lombardy, Tuscany, Piedmont, Basilicata, and Abruzzo. And the so-called Brenta Mafia in Venetia suffices to illustrate the potential for contagion. Here in Venetia, between Padua and Venice, total control of the territory has been organized on the basis of an ironclad alliance between the first relocated Mafiosi--who built a local hierarchy divided into gangs--and the local criminals. According to the Commission, the signs of corruption are unmistakable and common to all nine regions studied: Abruzzo, Basilicata, Emilia Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Val d'Aosta, Sardinia, and Tuscany (Latium was excluded only because it is the object of a separate investigation by DC [Christian Democratic Party] Senator Paolo Cabras). Arms and drug trafficking are on the rise all over, as are the number of financial companies and, above all, the sale of businesses--hotels, shops, and companies are changing owners at an astonishing rate--which often involves secret ownership. Then there are other regions where the Commission's work was based on written information and documents, like in Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Umbria, the Marches, and Molise. Here as well, we find shocking surprises, like discovering that Friuli has become the center for the illegal traffic of arms, drugs, and even nuclear material. It has been mostly the Camorra that has corrupted Molise and the Marches, especially between Pesaro and Urbino, where the Mafiosi buy up companies as fast as they can. In Perugia, which is in Umbria, it buys real estate instead. Is there a regional pattern to the Mafia's activities? Only partially, because there are larger geographical combinations. For example, in the north there is heavier arms traffic, as shown by a list of the latest kidnapings in Lombardy. In Val d'Ossola in Piedmont, laboratories have been equipped to adapt arms coming from Switzerland to the requirements of the Mafiosi, who prefer automatic weapons. Venetia, on the other hand, directs the traffic from the East. The Colombians have a special preference for Liguria for landing their shipments of cocaine (265 kilograms were confiscated last April). Milan remains the capital of money laundering. Sardinia, the coast of Abruzzi, and especially Tuscany are chosen for their tourist trade. Mafiosi have bought hotels like the Kursaal in Montecatini, luxury shops in Florence, and beach establishments in Versilia where a string of fires was set by arsonists. To the commissioners, the president of a business association denied the criminal nature of the fires out of fear that the area's good name would be damaged. They are afraid of the same thing in Abruzzo, which holds the record for limited financial companies whose directors minimized any causes for concern to the commissioners. Senator Smuraglia notes in his report that the same thing has happened in the past in Puglia, and we know how that turned out--Puglia ended up ranking fourth in Mafia corruption. Public opinion in Tuscany is perceptive, but that does not make Prosecutor Pier Luigi Vigna's testimony any less agonizing: 800 investigated for Mafia connections and the Mafia's tentacles are everywhere. In Lucca, there is the Musumeci mob from Calabria; in Pistoia, a group connected to the Catania mob from Pulvirenti; and the Camorra rules in Valdarno or Figline. Also disturbing are the ties between the Mafia and the Masonic Lodge, which is very strong in the region. Symptomatic of the general tendency to underestimate the danger of the Mafia was the failure of the law that made it mandatory for banks to report suspicious transactions. As of August 1993, there had only been 230 such reports, and only nine of them came from the financial quarter of Milan.
