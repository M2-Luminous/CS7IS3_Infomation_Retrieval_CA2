NICS first commenced operation in 1984, and thereafter had both the types and volume of information it handled steadily increased and its functions expanded to keep pace. However, operability problems and the need to equip the system with the latest technologies resulted in its complete reconstruction, and NICS finally commenced full-scale operation in April of this year. In addition to making full use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the revised NICS features an integrated database and unified operations. 1. System Configuration 1.1 Hardware Configuration Figure 1 shows NICS' hardware configuration. A mainframe computer here at the Center serves as the host computer, and can be accessed online via telecommunications lines from terminals installed at nuclear power plants and the main offices of Japanese power companies. Figure 1. NICS' Hardware Configuration This host computer system is jointly utilized by users outside the Center, but the system's magnetic disk storage equipment, for reasons of security as well as maintenance and management, are dedicated devices. In addition to electronic workstations (EWS), NICS terminal devices include printers for printing out textual data and facsimile machines for reproducing graphs and other image data. The telecommunications lines linking these terminal devices to the host computer comprise ordinary 2400 bps telephone lines as well as 9600 bps Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines (packet-switched telecommunications lines making up net 64 of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) Information Network System (INS)). As of July 1993, there were a total of 26 NICS terminal devices installed at nuclear power plants and the main offices of all electric power companies in Japan. 1.2 Database Configuration and Information Retrieval Systems Figure 2 shows the configuration of the NICS database. As seen in the figure, the NICS database is comprised of information retrieval systems and an analysis/evaluation system. These retrieval systems extract information from the database using terms and keywords designed for that purpose. Generally speaking, the information retrieved via these systems is unprocessed data stored in the database in the same format that it was input. The analysis/evaluation system makes use of operation/equipment/malfunction data to search for processed data such as equipment/parts malfunction ratios, etc. In this article, we will discuss the two new NICS database retrieval systems put into operation in April 1993, G-NICS and ANIKA. Figure 2. NICS Database Configuration Figure 3 shows the contents of the NICS database targeted by these retrieval systems. The NICS database integrates eight kinds of databases containing information on such things as malfunctions at nuclear power plants inside and outside of Japan. The following are brief summaries of these various types of databases. Figure 3. Contents of NICS Database Domestic Information: Four of the databases contained in the integrated NICS database contain domestic nuclear power-related information such as malfunction and other such trouble information reported by the government, domestic nuclear power facilities information and press releases put out by the various electric power companies. Overseas Information: The four remaining databases integrated into the NICS database contain original language reports and summarized flash reports, plus translated versions of information from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO). The Center has a well-established system for collecting domestic information. Each of the power companies send information on malfunctions or other trouble, plus operational and maintenance data to the Center on a regular basis, as well as each time an incident of some sort occurs. When it comes to overseas information, the Center gathers that data from the INPO information network system via international telecommunications lines. And since the Center is also a member of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), it collects information from that organization as well. Data input into the NICS integrated database is generally done by hand, but English-language files received from INPO are directly registered in the database via data collection terminals. 1.3 Information Advanced Application Functions (G-NICS) The G-NICS retrieval system uses ordinary retrieval methods to extract data via ``='', ``AND'' and ``OR'' operations. G-NICS' special characteristics are its ability, based on the integrated nature of the database, to unify screen operations and to make cross-section use of the various databases contained therein, and the fact that it possesses advanced diagram and table preparation functions. The mouse is the primary means of carrying out G-NICS retrieval operations, with keyboard input being held to the absolute minimum. And to relieve the burden on the host computer, G-NICS employs distributed processing functions that divide up some of the processing workload among terminals. (1) Retrieval Functions G-NICS is capable of carrying out both ``keyword searches'' to retrieve data using keywords, and ``global searches'' to retrieve desired character strings from descriptive texts. And it is also equipped with a ``cross-section search'' function that makes it possible to search for information in more than one database at a time. For example, the cross-section search function can be used to retrieve the translated version of an overseas file from one database and the original data on which that translated version was based from another database via the same retrieval operation. Figure 4 provides examples of a keyword search formula and data output. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Figure 4.

This information can be output in either full text format or in the form of selected items only. (3) Classified Total Function G-NICS can use keywords to prepare classified total tables based on vital data such as domestic malfunction/trouble reports and translated versions of information received from overseas. Then, based on this classified total table, this retrieval system can prepare graphs and/or look at the original information contained in the table. (4) Predefined Document Function G-NICS uses previously calculated classified totals to compile documents on domestic malfunction/trouble information, and can display these as-is on the terminal screens, display the information in graph form or output it to a printer for print out. 1.4 New Technology Application Retrieval Functions (ANIKA) The ANIKA retrieval system makes full use of AI technology to simplify retrieval operations so that users can input instructions in natural language. The user simply uses the keyboard to input his inquiries in everyday conversational-type phrases, and ANIKA decodes these phrases, automatically prepares the required search formulas and extracts the desired data from the database. Therefore, the ANIKA retrieval system puts AI technology to work primarily in preparing the intended search formulas based on analyses of the structure and semantics of the conversational phrases input by users. This means that anyone with a little knowledge of nuclear terminology can readily use ANIKA to retrieve data from the NICS integrated database. And to give the ANIKA retrieval system a ``personality'' to fit the image of an outstanding information management librarian, the developers of ANIKA gave considerable thought to the psychological aspects of human-database interaction and equipped the system with very ``soft'' and ``friendly'' greeting and response statements designed to impart a sense of ``charm'' to the otherwise dry, dull task of database retrieval. ANIKA is equipped with search and original data output functions, and is targeted at four of the eight NICS databases discussed earlier, to include those containing domestic malfunction/trouble information and translated versions of overseas information. And ANIKA can both display retrieved data on terminal screens as well as output it to facsimile machines. Figure 5 provides an example of an ANIKA retrieval operation. Figure 5. Example of ANIKA Retrieval Operation Right now, the NICS database system is using G-NICS as its primary retrieval system, with ANIKA playing a supporting role, so to speak. However, as ANIKA's sentence structure analysis capabilities improve and its vocabulary increases, it is expected to become even easier to use in future. 2. Assignment of Keywords The types of NICS data most often used by the electric power companies are domestic malfunction/trouble information and translated versions of overseas information. When it comes to translating information received from abroad, the Center screens all those English-language files received from INPO and has full translations done of those files deemed important. The Center has also formed a review committee that discusses this information, and, based on those discussions, assigns keywords to dozens of data elements. Assigning keywords to information like this greatly increases the value added of the original data, and, in addition to enhancing retrieval accuracy, also enables the system to carry out various types of classified total operations. As for that information that is not assigned keywords by the review committee, the system either assigns to the various data keywords identifiable with each particular data element's attributes, or automatically extracts and transcribes keywords from descriptive items contained in the original information. 3. State of Operation/Utilization The Center was founded as an information center for the electric power business, and therefore access to the NICS database is limited to electric power companies only. The hours of operation for the NICS database are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 midnight on weekdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on weekends. Operation is normally only halted on holidays, and the one day each month set aside for database registration. However, the NICS system is equipped with emergency start-up capabilities to deal with emergencies that occur on down days, and an emergency contact system is in place. As for the recent state of utilization, G-NICS is being used by all terminals combined an average of 130 or so times per month, while ANIKA is being utilized to retrieve NICS data between 20-60 times a month. Conclusions Twenty some years have already passed since the first nuclear power plant commenced commercial operations here in Japan, and the volume and types of information related to the operation, troubles and maintenance of these plants has grown to enormous proportions. It is extremely important that we put this experiential data to effective use now and in the future to help ensure safe, reliable operation of nuclear power plants and the conduct of regular inspections with an eye toward economizing. NICS has been supporting the operation of Japan's nuclear power plants by accumulating data and using computers to make high-level use of that data for almost 10 years now, and we believe that our efforts have contributed in some small way to preventing the reoccurrence of accidents and troubles of a similar nature. Everyday we strive to extract nuclear power generation data more rapidly and accurately, and to incorporate the latest technological advances into NICS, and if this article has managed to communicate even a fraction of that effort to the reader, then we will be very pleased. In closing, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. N. Konishi (presently with the Japan Nuclear Fuel Co.) and Mr. K. Sato (presently with the TechnoService Co.) for their guidance in the development of these retrieval systems.
