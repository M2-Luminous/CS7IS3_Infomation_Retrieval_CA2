[passage omitted] France has defended the idea of a social clause; in other words, commercial agreements should be made conditional on industrializing countries respecting a certain number of social rules to avoid social dumping. France has not received a great deal of support. Britain in particular does not want to hear of any such thing. [Alphandery] Oh yes, we did get support. You know we are putting forward arguments to prevent unfair competition. [passage omitted] We found support. The Italians accepted these ideas, so did the Canadians. We made a trial run, I would say, and we shall repeat the same plea in Marrakesh in the framework of the GATT agreement. I hope the case will go in the right direction -- at the very least, human rights should be respected in international economic affairs. [passage omitted] [Leclerc] A decisive factor for the domestic economy would be a lowering of interest rates. For the moment, since the Bank of France became independent, there has been practically no lowering -- (?0.6) percent. Aren't you a little disappointed? Couldn't more have been done? [Alphandery] No. You know, you have to put all this in perspective. Interest rates have gone down a great deal in France in the past year. They have gone down by about 40 percent for short-term rates. [Leclerc] But they're not going down any more? [Alphandery] No, no. They are continuing to go down. They went down -- the daily rates have gone down twice. So the downward movement has not been interrupted. So that's the first point. Then you mustn't forget that we have to take into account a stable monetary environment in Europe. What is very important if there is to be a lowering of rates, is that currencies and parities should be relatively stable in the European environment. Given this context I am quite hopeful that there will be new margins for maneuver in Europe as a whole in the next few months to bring down rates. Of course the Bank of France is independent. It is the bank that makes the decisions. I myself am quite optimistic about its abilities to continue to bring down interest rates tomorrow, or in the next few months. [passage omitted]
