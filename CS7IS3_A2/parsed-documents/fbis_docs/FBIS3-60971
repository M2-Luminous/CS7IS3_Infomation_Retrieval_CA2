A powerful shock wave blew out a wall at the city's well-known "Marcopizzi" Italian shoe store, incinerating the display stands. The entrance hall at next door's "Petrogradskaya" subway station was also affected. It was only by good fortune that nobody was injured during this "firework display." Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The search for the bombers has not yet yielded any results.
