I believe that through this conference a new situation in which the rural areas will become fairly well-off will emerge as soon as possible and good achievements will be made. I am going to put forward several opinions: 1. With many tasks to perform, the rural areas should persistently consider the overall situation in line with the target of being fairly well-off. I have three reasons for saying so: First, realizing the comfortably-off target by the end of this century is the second-step strategic goal of China's modernization as defined by the party Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas, a point to start with and end the work of the party and the government in the 1990's, and a fundamental task that we must do our best to fulfill. The majority of the province live in the rural areas. Therefore, the province should focus the realization of the comfortably-off target on the rural areas. Only when the rural areas accelerate the pace of becoming fairly well-off and make the peasants become fairly well-off as scheduled will there be prospects and guarantees for making the province as a whole become fairly well-off. Second, making the rural areas become comfortably-off is an integrated system with targets. This system not only is persistently dominated by economic targets, but also considers all aspects relating to social development. In reality, it involves rural work with economic construction as a key link. Grasping the work of making the rural areas become fairly well-off means grasping the "outline" of the rural work and the "halter" of the overall rural work. Third, the fundamental purpose of making the rural areas become fairly well-off is to make the broad masses of the peasants improve their living standard. This is directly related to the personal interests of the peasants and fully embodies the strong expectations of the peasants. Only when we firmly grasp the fulfillment of the target of making the rural areas become fairly well-off will we be able to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the peasants and to concentrate energy on developing productive forces. Therefore, the failure in the work of making the rural areas become fairly well-off in the 1990's is the failure to grasp the essence of the rural work. The rural areas will not be able to comprehensively make economic and social development if this target cannot be fulfilled. The party committees and governments at various levels must approach from this high plane to understand this issue and persistently focus the rural work on making the rural areas become fairly well-off. We must acknowledge that over the past few years, the majority of the local party committees and governments in the province have clear ideas and have done their work solidly and effectively in the aspect of focusing the rural work on making the rural areas become fairly well-off. However, some local party committees and governments still have no clear or firm ideas. Some even are seriously in the state of fearing difficulties and some are even ideologically satisfied at having sufficient food and clothing. The party and government leading bodies at various levels, particularly the party committees and governments at the county and township levels, should conscientiously review and examine their work, further seek unity of thinking, define the relationship between the work of making the rural areas become fairly well-off and the work in other spheres, further clearly define the work of the party committees and governments at various levels in the rural areas, further prominently define their work priorities, and have their energy further be concentrated and their measures become more forceful. We should also mobilize the broad masses of the peasants' enthusiasm and creativeness, make them actually become the main forces to promote the rural areas step toward the target of being fairly well-off. We should organize all departments and all trades and professions to better support, serve, and participate in the work of making the rural areas become fairly well-off; actually pool the joint efforts to promote the rural areas to step toward the target of being fairly well-off; and strive to create a brand new situation in making the rural areas become fairly well-off. 2. Making the rural areas well-off is a huge project in which we must make breakthroughs in key areas and carry them out in an all-around manner. The project of making the rural areas well-off will involve all aspects and involve much work. The crucial issue involved now is to accelerate economic development. Economic development is the precondition and basis on which we can rely to realize the objective of making the rural areas well-off. Without a rapid economic development, an increase in rural people's income, and enhancement of rural financial resources, enriching the material and spiritual life and developing the social welfare undertakings will be out of the question. Therefore, in the course of making the rural areas well-off, we must accelerate economic development and regard it as a matter of prime importance. The key to accelerating economic development is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, persist in regarding reform as a motivation and conscientiously grasp three major tasks well. First, we should make strenuous efforts to develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming. On one hand, we should attend to the production of basic agricultural products, including grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, in line with the demands of the domestic and foreign markets, readjust the agricultural structure, make full use of local agricultural resources, actively develop export-oriented products, such as melons, vegetables, fruits, medicinal herbs, and livestock, and aquatic products with fine quality and good efficiency, and, on the premise of guaranteeing a stable increase in the production of farm and sideline products, accelerate the optimization of agricultural structure, do a good job in the precision and intensive processing of farm and sideline products, realistically change the traditional farming of low efficiency into the "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" modern farming, and the small-scale farming with an unitary structure into large-scale farming with a comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery. In this way, we can steadily increase the income of the broad masses of peasants and lay a solid foundation for peasants to become well-off. Second, we should actively develop township enterprises. As far as the overall rural economy is concerned, to realize the objective of becoming well-off and to have conditions for marching towards prosperity, in a final analysis, we must vigorously develop township enterprises, actively promote the process of industrialization in the rural areas, and urge a batch of rural labor forces to engage in nonagricultural industry. The experiences of 20 counties advanced in marching towards the goal of prosperity across the province, which we summed up and popularized last year, and the experiences which we have exchanged during this conference have fully explained this. Therefore, while making efforts to grasp the "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming, we must concentrate greater energy on grasping the development of township enterprises. All cities, prefectures, counties, and townships should uphold the principle of persisting in promoting various ownerships and systems, and giving simultaneous attention to development and improvement, attend to input, development, and opening up, and strive to carry out a number of new projects every year, to establish a number of new enterprises and put them into operation, to enable a number of old enterprises to turn themselves into joint ventures or cooperative enterprises through grafting or transformation, to enter a batch of products in the international market, and to make a number of rural manpower engage in secondary and tertiary industries in an effort to make the rate and quality of Hebei's township enterprises attain or surpass the national average as quickly as possible. Third, we should do a good job in family planning work. It will be difficult to realize the objective of becoming well-off if we only pay attention to economic development and neglect the effective control of population growth. We should base ourselves on realizing the overall economic balance and simultaneously increasing the per capita share of things and the per capita income, and, in addition to pushing the economy forward, resolutely lower the natural population growth rate. We should always firmly grasp family planning work, unceasingly raise it to a new level, and guarantee the realization of the population control target. Only by simultaneously attending to production and family planning can we have guarantee for making the rural areas well-off. Becoming fairly well-off involves not only the improvement of the people's material lives but also the enhancement of the people's spiritual lives and the overall social development. So, the realization of the target of becoming fairly well-off comprehensively reflects the overall improvement of the national strength, the population quality, and the living standards. Therefore, in the course of making the rural areas become fairly well-off, we must conscientiously implement the principle of grasping with two hands and being sure that both hands are tough. At present, the rural areas in the province, both economically good areas and backward areas, have many problems in the aspects of popularizing and improving scientific and cultural knowledge, strengthening and improving the ideological and educational work, comprehensively improving social order, purifying the social practice, improving the appearances of villages, and developing various social welfare undertakings. On the premise of persistently taking the economic construction as a key link, the party committees and governments at various levels should make a unified arrangement for making the rural areas become fairly well-off, comprehensively make development, conscientiously solve the problems one after another, and ceaselessly satisfy the broad masses of the peasants' increasing higher demands for material and cultural lives. 3. To accelerate the pace of making the rural areas become fairly well-off, we must strive to have the localities where conditions permit take the lead in becoming fairly well-off. The development of things is always uneven. It is impossible for all the rural areas to become fairly well-off at the same time. At the time of comprehensively promoting the rural areas to become fairly well-off, we should first have the localities with conditions accelerate the pace of development and take the lead in making a breakthrough. By so doing will we be able to gain experiences to better guide the work of the whole, bring into play the experimental and leading roles of the advanced models to rapidly promote the progress of other localities, and further form a vivid situation that the rural areas that become rich ahead of others help promote the work of the others and finally seek common wealth. To this end, in the course of promoting the rural areas to become fairly well-off, the party committees and governments at various levels should assume the responsibility for the work of the same levels and first have a number of counties, townships, and villages with good conditions become fairly well-off ahead of others. The province as well as all relevant cities and prefectures should first grasp the work that the counties (cities) of the first and second groups that should become fairly well-off by 1997 as defined in the "outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan for making the rural areas become fairly well-off" which was discussed and revised at this conference. These counties (cities) have not only good natural conditions and geographic positions but also considerably good economic foundations. Only when they base themselves on the existing advantages to make consistent efforts will they certainly become fairly well-off and be able to realize the target ahead of schedule. So, they should fully understand their positions and roles in making the province as a whole become fairly well-off, enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency, strive to make bigger strides for development, and ensure the fulfillment of the target of becoming fairly well-off on or ahead of schedule. The counties of the third and fourth groups that will not be able to realize the target of becoming fairly well-off by 1997 should define, according to the requirements of the 2000 plan, their economic development targets and per capita income levels that they should attain. Simultaneously, all cities, prefectures, and counties should proceed from actual conditions and annually organize groups of townships (towns) and villages to become rich ahead of others. We may determine that through the efforts in the next four years, about 50 percent of the counties (cities) and a large number of townships and villages in the province will be the first in becoming fairly well-off by 1997 and gigantic changes will take place in the appearances of the rural areas. Of course, at the time of grasping the work of the localities with conditions to become fairly well-off ahead of others, we must not ignore the work of the localities that do not have conditions temporarily. We should guide and encourage them to emancipate the mind, have firm confidence, overcome difficulties, work arduously, emulate and catch up with the advanced, make unremitting efforts to improve themselves, and have the localities with good conditions make bigger progress and the localities with poor conditions be unwilling to lag behind. By so doing will there be a situation that the vast rural areas in the province promote one another to step toward the target of becoming fairly well-off in an orderly and step-by-step manner. 4. The foundation for rural areas to achieve a fairly comfortable life lies in the village level, and, therefore, great efforts should be made to build a good party branch and select a good leader. Relying merely on peasant households, it is impossible for rural areas to achieve a fairly comfortable life. We should also give full play to the role of the organizations of a community. Villages are fairly stable communities in rural areas where unified operation and peasant households' independent operation are combined. Many things that peasant households cannot manage individually in their march toward a fairly comfortable life should be managed by villages. As villages are the most fundamental level to lead peasants to a fairly comfortable life, peasants will find it acceptable and compatible with their common economic interests to take villages as a unit in the endeavor to achieve a fairly comfortable life. This makes it easier to rally the forces of peasants and is also conducive to developing the role of the collective economy. Villages are also the lowest organizations to implement rural work, and only when they truly take action, can the endeavor of achieving a fairly comfortable life become concrete work. Therefore, to lead rural area to a fairly comfortable life more rapidly, we should place our work focus on villages, and county and township party committees and governments should exert efforts to build villages well, which are the foundation. To do so, the key is to build a good party branch and select a good leader. As has been proven by the experiences of many villages advanced in achieving a fairly comfortable life, a good leader with correct ideology and work styles who are capable of using the brain to work out ideas and exercising leadership and are willing to work hard will create a good party branch, find out a feasible road to affluence, and lead the entire village to a fairly comfortable life. Judging from Hebei's actual conditions in rural areas, however, many villages have yet to build such good party branches and select such good leaders. We should give particular attention to this issue. All party committees, especially those at the county and township levels, should regard it as the most important measure for achieving a fairly comfortable life to improve village-level party branches and select leaders well. At present, they should first rectify the party branches that are stagnant or half stagnant in doing work and successfully improve the backward leading bodies. They should adopt various measures to discover, select, and send some outstanding party members to work in backward villages. The mechanism of elimination through competition should be applied to the selection of village cadres, especially secretaries of party branches. Party branches which are stagnant in doing work, have many problems, and are incapable of leading peasants to a fairly comfortable life should be reshuffled in a timely manner. Town and township party committees have direct responsibility for the building of village party branches, and they should be held accountable first when party branches are not successfully built. 5. With a fairly comfortable life as the goal, we should apply the mechanism of incentives to county-, township-, and village-level cadres. Party committees and governments at the county and township levels are the key to whether rural areas can achieve a fairly comfortable life. The provincial party committee has decided and begun to formulate the methods to appraise county-level cadres and the mechanisms to encourage and restrain them in order to fully mobilize county-level leading bodies and leading cadres to work hard and compete for achieving a fairly comfortable life and to better perform their responsibilities. The organization department and the agriculture and industry department of the provincial party committee again invited comrades in charge from some cities, prefectures, and counties to discuss them at this conference. After being revised and screened by the standing committee of the provincial party committee, the methods and mechanisms will be issued for implementation. I will again emphasize two points here. First, we should keep the present leading bodies basically stable. Most of Hebei's county party committees and governments were reshuffled last year. Their five-year tenure is exactly the crucial period for achieving the fairly comfortable life. County party and government leading bodies should take it for granted to become ones to lead the masses to a fairly comfortable life. Before realizing the goal of becoming well-off in line with the "outlines," in principle, we will not transfer any county secretaries, county heads, or other important members of the leading bodies. People with mediocre work and limited ability to form a joint force and affect the realization of the objective of making the rural areas well-off must be promptly readjusted. They must not be transferred to a post of the same level, and must be demoted. Second, we must link the achievements of leading bodies in making the rural areas well-off with the immediate interests of cadres. In addition to giving relative political treatment to those who make prominent achievements in making the rural areas well-off within the set time limit, we should also give them necessary material awards. Those who basically fulfill the work target may be retained for continued use; and those who fail to fulfill the target must be demoted. The township level is also very important. Over the past years, some counties and cities in Hebei have formulated some encouraging measures for cadres and explored some effective methods. Though these measures and methods are different, they have all given prominence to the evaluation of the fulfillment of work tasks, awarding the good, and punishing the lazy, and played a very good role in encouraging and stimulating the people. All localities should further enrich and improve these methods in line with the demand of making the rural areas well-off, and strive to popularize them to all areas. Places without a township-level financial department must build one this year. Counties and cities without this kind of evaluation method should learn the successful experiences of the advanced counties and cities, step up efforts to formulate methods, and put them into practice. The rural work department of the provincial party committee should assume responsibility and supervise the implementation of this work. The township and town party committees and governments may use the principles and spirit of the county and township levels for reference, study, and decide on their own how to establish the mechanism of encouragement and restraint for villages. In short, through the establishment of effective mechanism of encouragement and restraint at all levels, we should make the leading bodies and cadres of the county and township levels form a strong motivation that "they must work hard and must not do sloppy work," and realistically concentrate the energy on thinking of, working for, and marching towards prosperity. 6. We should strengthen organizational guidance over the work of making the rural areas well-off, and let the broad masses of grass-roots cadres and people to have a goal and working enthusiasm. Making the rural areas well-off is a process of tangible practice. Leaders at all levels should successfully carry out all sorts of organizational leadership work with an enterprising spirit and a sense of responsibility. First, they must attend to the flexible methods on becoming well-off of counties, townships, and villages. The plans of counties and townships must be submitted to the people's congresses of a corresponding level for discussion and approval; villages should discuss their plans with villagers and let each and every household understand them. Second, they should regard accelerating the pace of making the rural areas well-off as their aim, act in line with market demands, organize and develop items and projects that help to make peasants rich in line with local conditions, and actively develop the commodity economy. Third, they should conduct timely investigation and evaluation, exchange experience, and promote this work. Fourth, they should strengthen public opinions and propaganda on becoming well-off, and form an atmosphere in which all rural households think of becoming well-off. Comrades, counting from now to 2000, we have about six or seven years for making the rural areas well-off. The tasks facing us are very arduous. Comrades of all cities, prefectures, and counties should have a sense of urgency, exert strenuous efforts to accelerate all tasks on making the rural areas well-off, and strive to create a new situation in this aspect within a short period of time. This is not only the ardent hope of the provincial party committee and government but is also the urgent wish of the broad masses of rural cadres. I believe all of you will give a forceful answer to this with actual deeds.
