At last, the reaction for which we had been awaiting for months! It took the unbearable images of the dead and wounded lying on the white snow of Sarajevo to crack the monument of hypocrisy and cowardice which concealed the murder of a nation in the midst of heedless Europe. Of course, there had to be a few UN Tartuffes [hypocrites] questioning who was ultimately responsible for the massacres! As if we had not known for two years exactly who has been shelling Sarajevo and murdering women and children! Future historians will wonder how -- after the end of the Cold War -- so many powerful nations and their diplomats could let 200,000 people be slaughtered and 2 million refugees be deported by thinly disguised killers whom they respectfully welcomed in Geneva for farcical and shameful conferences. All it took was -- thanks to France's persistence -- a long overdue warning issued by NATO, and what was deemed impossible materialized: a cease-fire agreement complete with the Serbs vowing to withdraw their cannons. Is this a last-ditch maneuver or a newfound wisdom born of fear? Without allowing ourselves to be fooled once more, we now must maintain the pressure and the threat of action in case of deception. Seldom has a 10-day ultimatum been so important. Of course, one must not be content with a vague cease-fire agreement in Sarajevo, which can always be canceled. The West must demand that fighting stop everywhere in Bosnia, so that real negotiations can resume and Serb armed gangs are made to leave regions they should not be in. There can be no question of the aggressors obtaining in peace what they could not grab through war and bloodshed. But can peoples who have suffered so much violence be made to agree to peaceful coexistence? If -- should the ultimatum be rejected -- air strikes become necessary, the allies must know how far they are ready to go. They must agree on this from the outset, as we must no longer say things we do not intend to put into practice. Right now, two lessons can be drawn from this atrocious and interminable carnage. First, the United Nations does not have the wherewithal to plan and manage peacekeeping missions, as shown by its actions in Somalia and Bosnia. The United Nations -- which lacks means and experience as well as a competent military staff, money, and a real chain of command -- cannot even enforce its own resolutions! Which country will want to contribute its soldiers if the outcome is certain to be a failure? Humanitarian action must no longer hinder the restoration of peace. Faced with the lessened interest for Europe demonstrated by the Americans as well as Russia's new hardline stance, and in the perspective of future "Yugoslavias," Europe must urgently create a purely European defense structure. By embracing for the first time the concept of a European defense identity, NATO's latest summit in Brussels provided Europe with a historic opportunity. Can Europe seize it? If it does not, the worst will surely come! In front of expiring Bosnia -- just like yesterday before Munich -- Europe must choose between dishonor and courage. Its whole fate hinges on this alternative. Otherwise, what would be the point of holding, in three months' time, a European election which over half of the French population will boycott? More than the Serbs' vague commitment, NATO's resolve is a historic turning point for security in Europe.
