At the 21 December ministerial meeting between Norway and the EU in Brussels, agreement was reached that Norway may maintain the level of its standards on health, safety, and the environment in those areas where Norway has stricter rules than the EU. Health, safety, and environmental issues are of importance for many different areas of society. I want to stress that the technical review prior to the negotiations showed there were very few cases of differences between Norwegian regulations and EU regulations, and a very limited number of areas in which it took time to find satisfactory solutions. In addition, these are often technically difficult areas where people should ideally have a good prior knowledge to be able to evaluate the results. The negotiations have not covered standards for emissions from industrial installations, the purification of waste by local authorities, health and safety in the workplace, and so on. Here the EU has minimum standards, but member nations are free to introduce their own stricter standards. There can be no doubt that the EU is on the right road when it comes to health, safety, and the environment, even though things move a little sluggishly at times. The chances that within the course of a few years the EU will come up to our standards in those areas where it is currently lagging behind are great. Nor should we forget that in a few fields the EU is actually ahead of us. For example, the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement means that we have to tighten up our standards or introduce new regulations covering the sulfur content of oil and rules covering major industrial accidents and emergencies. Norway has been given confirmation that Norwegian rules covering asbestos and some other hazardous materials do not conflict with the EU's regulations, and that we may as a result retain Norwegian regulations. This also applies to the labeling of organic solvents, safety information documentation for chemical substances and preparations, concentration limits for hazardous preparations -- 5 percent in Norway as against 25 percent in the EU -- PVB [polyvinyl butyral] and PCT (hazardous chemicals). The most difficult areas in the negotiations have been areas relating to chemicals where the difference between EU and Norwegian legislation is greatest because of different approaches. The differences have chiefly been linked to: -- the system of classifying and labeling carcinogenic substances, -- the system of classifying and labeling allergenic substances, -- methods of testing the amounts of allergenic substances contained in preparations, and -- Norwegian regulations covering the heavy metal content of batteries. In the negotiations Norway won a transitional period of four years. In this transitional period, there will be comprehensive cooperation with the aim of arriving at satisfactory solutions. The objective is to arrive at common EU rules which satisfy Norway's demands. Environmental issues are high on the EU's agenda. As a consequence of Swedish, Finnish, Austrian, and Norwegian membership, environmental issues will be given an even higher priority. If the EU has not come up to Norwegian standards in the transitional period, Norway is expecting that the transitional period can be extended. Norway is involved in determining the premises for the work in the transitional period. Work will be continuous throughout the period. If the work is not completed by the end of the transitional period, it would therefore be natural to extend the transitional period until a satisfactory result has been achieved. If it proves impossible to achieve a satisfactory result, the EU's regulations allow member countries to uphold their high standards as long as real health, safety, and environmental considerations form the basis for upholding and further developing these standards. However, the condition is that there can be no suggestion that health, safety, and environmental considerations are being used as as a smokescreen for a country's desire to protect its own industry. Norwegian demands in this field are based on specialist and scientific evaluations and are therefore clearly justified for health, safety, and environmental reasons. I am wholly confident that on this foundation Norway will be able to uphold its regulations in the health, safety, and environmental fields even after membership of the EU.
