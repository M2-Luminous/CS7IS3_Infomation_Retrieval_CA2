FR940621-2-00120 FR940621-2-00075 Guidance on environmental auditing and state-of-the-art environmental management practices is available from many sources. As a starting point, EPA refers potential pilot participants to the following sources: •The EPA Environmental Auditing Policy Statement ( Federal Register , July 9, 1986) which includes a discussion of elements of an effective auditing program; •The ``Draft Corporate Sentencing Guidelines for Environmental Violations,'' ( BNA Environment Reporter, 11/26/93), which includes a discussion of ``Minimum Factors for Demonstrating a Commitment to Environmental Compliance'' in Part D. Voluntary standards on environmental management systems and environmental auditing may also provide guidance to facilities interested in preparing pilot project proposals. EPA is participating in work groups organized by the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF International). The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is coordinating U.S. participation in ISO Technical Committee 207 (TC&hyph;207) on environmental management systems (EMS). Contacts for these organizations are listed at the end of this notice. Similarly, EPA is aware that initiatives such as the Global Environmental Management Initiative (GEMI), the Responsible Care Program, and the CERES Principles have been developed in the private sector and by non-governmental groups. These and other private sector efforts may be useful for facilities interested in submitting pilot proposals, and facilities are encouraged to develop proposals with industry and trade association involvement and support. C. Disclosure of Audit Results EPA is currently reevaluating its environmental auditing policy, and will take an empirical approach so that any decision to either reinforce or change existing policy is informed by fact. The ELP pilot projects may generate useful data on auditing methodology and measures, and may serve as a vehicle for experimenting with policy-driven incentives. EPA is particularly interested in examining how disclosure of audit results could improve the public's confidence in and acceptance of industry's self-monitoring efforts, and how disclosure could help facilitate the flow of information to the personnel responsible for implementing audit recommendations. Facilities applying to the ELP must demonstrate a willingness to disclose in some manner the results of their audits. EPA recognizes the controversial nature of this issue, and for that reason wants to explore the potential benefits and perceived risks of disclosure in the context of the pilot projects. As part of their proposals, therefore, facilities should suggest the type and extent of information they would be willing to disclose, the mechanisms they would use to disclose the information, the parties to whom they would disclose the information, and finally, any conditions they would seek from regulators in order to make the disclosure. Proposed incentives should be limited to items that can be offered by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance under existing law using administrative authority or policies that lie clearly within OECA's jurisdiction. Proposals to change statutory deadlines, amend environmental standards, or that require actions by other agencies are not appropriate for this program. D. Pollution Prevention Activities EPA's new Office of Compliance is organized principally around economic sectors, in order to support integrated approaches to compliance that promote pollution prevention as a means of meeting environmental requirements and realizing environmental improvements. Facilities must describe their existing or proposed comprehensive, multimedia pollution prevention program that is integrated into their overall operations. In describing this program, facilities should include descriptions of their pollution prevention planning process, their State pollution prevention plan (if required, see ``Other Required Documentation'' below), their systems for implementing pollution prevention projects, how resources are allocated to pollution prevention, and how they measure pollution prevention progress. At a minimum, facilities should include the two-year projection of waste generation required by the Pollution Prevention Act and their RCRA waste minimization certification (see ``Other Required Documentation'' below). E. Setting an Example Facilities must show that they are currently using, or would be willing to use, their auditing, pollution prevention, and/or other environmental management programs as models or benchmarks for other facilities within their company or industry, or for their customers, suppliers, and contractors. EPA recognizes that there may be many mechanisms for doing this, and that confidentiality issues may limit the amount of information and technology facilities are able to share. Given these conditions, facilities must propose how they would help others learn from their experiences and the type and extent of information they would be willing to share. F. Performance Measures Good environmental management systems set performance objectives, and measure and report on progress toward those goals. While EPA recognizes that there are many possible measures of environmental performance, at the pilot project stage the Office of Compliance is primarily interested in developing methodology that can demonstrate and measure compliance success and pollution prevention results, as complements to the traditional enforcement measures of actions and penalties. Therefore, facilities must propose quantitative and/or qualitative measures that will track the compliance improvements and pollution prevention results that would accrue from their participation in a pilot project. Facilities must also include brief descriptions of additional performance objectives that they are striving to meet, and of the systems they use to track and monitor progress toward these goals. Any future, full-scale leadership program will attempt to incorporate overall measures of environmental management performance, in addition to measures of compliance and pollution prevention. G. Employee and Community Involvement Sensitivity and responsiveness to employee and community concerns is a key component of environmental leadership. In proposals for the ELP, facilities must demonstrate that their employees and their communities are involved in developing and implementing their environmental management programs, and should suggest mechanisms (for example, employee interviews, interviews with local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPCs), etc.) which can be used to verify this involvement.
