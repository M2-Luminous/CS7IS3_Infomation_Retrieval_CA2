FR940118-0-00042 FR940118-0-00012 Tuesday January 18, 1994 Part IV Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons 28 CFR Parts 301, 540, and 543 Inmate Accident Compensation, Incoming Publications and Inmate Legal Activities; Final Rule and Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 11␣/␣Tuesday, January 18, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Bureau of Prisons 28 CFR Part 301 RIN 1120&hyph;AA05 Inmate Accident Compensation AGENCY: Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Bureau of Prisons, DOJ. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is extending coverage under Inmate Accident Compensation to inmates participating in approved work assignments for other Federal agencies. Because inmates participating in such assignments may be housed in a community corrections center, it is necessary to add procedures appropriate for the treatment and reporting of injuries and for processing claims which may arise from such assignments. This amendment also clarifies the applicability of lost-time wages, clarifies the effects of subsequent incarceration, clarifies the definition of ``release'', clarifies payment procedures for medical treatment, and corrects a typographical error in the citation of a court case. This amendment is intended to allow for the continued efficient operation of inmate work assignments. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC room 754, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons published in the Federal Register on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39096) a proposed rule on Inmate Accident Compensation clarifying its applicability to approved inmate work assignments for other federal agencies. The proposed amendment also clarified that lost-time wages shall be available only for inmates based at Bureau of Prisons institutions (see new §301.201) and that the amount of a payment for medical treatment is limited to reasonable expenses incurred, such as those amounts authorized under the applicable fee schedule established for the Department of Health and Human Services Medicare program (see §301.317). This amendment also revised the definition of ``release'' in §301.102 to include reference to pretrial inmates. The proposed amendment also clarified §301.316 by rewording its provisions regarding subsequent incarceration of a compensation recipient. There is no change in the intent of this section. Finally, the proposed amendment corrected a typographical error in the citation of the court case U.S. v. Demko which appears in §301.319. The Bureau of Prisons received no comment to its proposed rule, and the amendment is accordingly being issued as a final rule.
