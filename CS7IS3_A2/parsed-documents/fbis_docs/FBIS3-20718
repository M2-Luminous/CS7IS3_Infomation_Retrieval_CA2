The letter starts with the following words: "Since 25 January of this year, Serbian-Montenegrin police have been making mass arrests of Muslims in the area of Sandzak and particularly in the Prijepolje, Rozaje, and Bijelo Polje communes. In most cases they are arresting the very top leaders of the of the Party of Democratic Action. This series of arrests started in Urozaje when a group of well-armed members of Montenegro MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] arrived in six Land Rovers, surrounded the house of the secretary for Montenegro, Mr. Rasim Sahman, and took him to some unknown location." The letter further states that "despite all our attempts to learn the reasons for these arrests, the police authorities have not given us any explanation. In the aftermath of these events the tense situation in Sandzak has acquired dramatic proportions. By means of these and other similar actions, Serbian and Montenegrin authorities hope to intimidate the Muslim population and create pressure that would accelerate the process of their migration from Sandzak. The direct attack on the political representatives of Sandzak Muslims is designed to repress any form of political expression by these people."
