Arima said he would continue Oda's policy of internationalization and outside evaluation. ``I'd like to create a Riken open wide to universities,'' said Arima. Arima rated highly the internationalism of RIKEN which includes 200 foreign researchers. ``While pursuing internationalization, I'd also like to put energy into continuing the tradition of Drs. Shin'ichiro Asanaga and Hantaro Nagaoka through exchange with universities.'' After Arima left the presidency of the University of Tokyo in March 1993, he returned to teaching as a professor at Hosei University. Even after becoming RIKEN's director general, during the school year he'll return to campus on Mondays to teach. A report instigated by outgoing director Oda on the outside evaluation of RIKEN by Nobel prize winners and others was recently completed. It will be ``homework'' for Arima. ``I've been fortunate enough to have Professor Oda make a plan for improving the University of Tokyo's science faculty. I will take Professor Oda's `homework' very seriously,'' promised Arima.
