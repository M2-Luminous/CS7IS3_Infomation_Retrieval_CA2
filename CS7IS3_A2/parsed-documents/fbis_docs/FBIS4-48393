The report says the former director of the Spanish Civil Defense [Guarda Civil], accused of corruption and evasion of justice, personally promoted and participated in an arms sale operation to Angola between the end of 1992 and beginning of 1993. The report also says Angolan leaders were involved in this alleged arms traffic. The Council of Ministers' Secretariat of the Republic of Angola categorically rejects the manner in which the report has been circulated, since relations between Angola and Spain have always been at the level of sovereign states, based on the existing cooperative relations. The communique says at no time has the Angolan Government established relations with Spanish private entities or individuals. The Council of Ministers' Secretariat can only conclude that the report is simply aimed at making an abusive link between an individual on the run from justice and a legitimate government that has nothing to do with the internal affairs of other countries, no matter how good the relations between them.
