He said the presence of John Garang and Riak Machar would give impetus to the negotiations. Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr. al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would help in resolving the southern problem. Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London Forum under Baroness Cox. He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role, especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel leaders attending the talks for the first time. [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 0430 GMT on 20 March adds: "His excellency appealed to the Kenyan Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the current peace efforts did not fail and that the solution should be purely an African one. His excellency said that the members of the alliance who had arrived in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the government delegation did not object to their presence provided they did so as part of the delegation of the rebel movement. ["Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of a foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the negotiations should succeed."]
