FR940606-1-00023 FR940606-1-00008 As described above for primer and topcoat application operations, the EPA is requesting comments concerning the appropriateness of using pressure drop to make compliance determinations and what action should be taken when the pressure drop moves outside of the specified limits. 4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation The proposed standards for the chemical milling maskant application operation would be the same for all new and existing affected sources and applies only to those operations utilizing a Type II chemical milling etchant. The proposed standards would limit organic HAP emissions to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 160 grams of organic HAP per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied, and limit the VOC emissions to an equivalent VOC content level of 160 grams of VOC per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water and exempt solvents) as applied. Alternatively, as for primer and topcoat application operations, control devices that achieve an overall control efficiency of at least 81 percent and control all emissions (except for incidental emissions) may be used. Compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be allowed using one or both of the following means: (1) Use chemical milling maskants that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC content levels or (2) use any combination of chemical milling maskants such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC content levels of these chemical milling maskants used in the chemical milling maskant operation comply with the organic HAP and VOC content levels. Averaging uncontrolled chemical milling maskants with controlled chemical milling maskants, however, is prohibited under the proposed rule. Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant chemical milling maskants and on a daily basis for chemical milling maskants complying by averaging. Compliance for control devices other than carbon adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating parameter or parameters, such as temperature for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed standard, compliance with the 81 percent overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling material balance period. The length of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure specified in proposed Method 309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling period is 30 days. 5. Handling and Storage of Waste The proposed standards for handling and storage of waste would be the same for all new and existing facilities. The proposed rule would require that the handling and transfer of HAP-containing waste to or from containers, tanks, vats, vessels, or piping systems be conducted in such a manner that minimizes spills. In addition, all HAP-containing waste would be stored in closed containers. C. Compliance Dates The proposed rule would require all existing sources to comply no later than three years after the effective date of the standards. In addition, the proposed rule adopts the compliance dates specified in ยง63.6(b) and ยง63.6(c) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. 3 3 Ibid. D. Compliance Extensions During development of the aerospace national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP), the EPA received comments from the regulated community regarding the process that would be used to comply with the rule and certain difficulties that were anticipated, particularly with the facilities' selection and approval of product substitutions for coatings and hand-wipe cleaning solvents. Because of the large number of product substitutions that may have to undergo testing and qualification at each facility, some facilities may need to request a compliance extension. Section 63.6(i) of 40 CFR part 63 provides the requirements for requesting an extension of compliance with a relevant standard established under part 63. 4 Specifically, ยง63.6(i)(4) allows the issuance of a permit granting an extension of up to one year to comply with the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. Section 63.6(i)(4)(i)(B) requires requests for compliance extensions to be submitted no later than 12 months before the affected source's compliance date. 4 Ibid. The EPA is seeking comment on the significance of the potential difficulties of complying with the proposed aerospace NESHAP in the allotted 3 years (or 4 years if the one-year extension described above is applied for and approved). In addition, the EPA is seeking comment regarding how these difficulties can be addressed within the confines of the statutory requirements of sections 112(d) and 112(i) of the Act. Specifically, the EPA is seeking comment on what types of activities, such as technical assistance, can be provided to assist sources attempting to come into compliance with the aerospace NESHAP. E. Compliance Testing and Monitoring In addition to the specific testing and monitoring requirements specified below for each affected source, the proposed rule adopts the testing requirements specified in ยง63.7 of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. 5 5 Ibid.
