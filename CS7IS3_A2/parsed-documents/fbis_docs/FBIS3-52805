[In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0944 GMT on 10 January adds the following: "Israel and the PLO returned to the negotiating table at this Red Sea resort on Monday with chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th confidently predicting an accord within three weeks. ["`I don't think it will take any more than two-three weeks,' Sha'th told reporters as he went into the talks seeking to iron out differences over the implementation of the September 13 autonomy agreement. ["`We have to finish as soon as possible and we are ready. If there is goodwill from both sides, and I believe there is, it will be done. ["`Today the purpose of the discussion will be a general review of where we are and a plan to finish in three weeks.' ["Sha'th offered reporters an image of how much work remained saying if the agreement represents 100 pages only two pages still had to be completed. ["But he added: `The most difficult issue is willingness to finish.' ["Sha'th accused Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid of violating the agreement when he stated Sunday that he expected the talks to last two months. ["`It is said when publicly you say it will take two months, it is violating the agreement,' Sha'th charged. ["Israel delegation spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska said: `I think Mr. Sha'th's estimations are too optimistic and the negotiations should last longer because a lot of problems remain.' ["The two delegations held a brief plenary session at the Hilton Hotel and then Sha'th and Shahaq went into a meeting alone."]
