G.: "The DREE Wants To Favor Strategic Analysis"] [Text] After having been criticized by companies, the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE), under the leadership of its new director, Jean-Pierre Landau, intends to intensify its warning role by multiplying its strategic analysis of information furnished by foreign posts. Brand new as the head of DREE in July 1993, Landau had already decided on his priorities: the development of large macroeconomic analyses while favoring forecast and assessments of each country. Nearly seven months after taking over his duties, three of which were devoted to GATT, Landau has kept his word if one can judge by the rare confidences of bureaucrats, many of whom have reverted to the former pratice of refusing comment. Foreign posts have received orders to "massively" increase the information they gather, whether macroeconomic or microeconomic -- "We have been inundated with requests from Paris," an adviser explained -- for top officials to digest in the Finance Minister. The idea is to make of DREE "an action tool, of reflection, of warning and forecasting analyses." We have been assigned a mission, another adviser affirms, "to capture all international signals in order that they can be then translated into strategic analyses." In sum, the DREE would become an immense watch and warning network. This reorientation begs a certain number of questions on the future of the directorate, currently under the supervision of two ministries: The questions are fed by the recurrent rumor that the DREE will merge with Treasury. The plan seems all the more plausible this time since many experts, one of which is the director of the DREE, believes that there is no difference between currency, trade, and investment; between the national and international economy; and that France's foreign interactions goes well beyond the trade balance. Moreover, in a context of restricted budgets and layoffs and while the need for a greater professionalism is clearly evident, the search for synergies would justify such an approach. For certain, this could even take place as soon as 1995. Some believe that this is the mission which Jean-Pierre Landau had set for himself when he was nominated. In this event, what would become of the other mission of the DREE, namely the support it gives to companies? In the near term, such support is not threatened, no more so than is the billing office for ad hoc services rendered to exporters. In the medium term, however, this role could be assumed by the parastatal support organizations for foreign trade (CFCE, Council of European Trade Federations; CFME [expansion unknown]; ACTlM [expansion unknown]). Among employers, the Desgeorges report (not yet published) foretells the privatization of this function. Ouestions and Innovations Parallel to these strategic questions, some innovations in the management of personnel, and more precisely in career tracks, augment the conversations in the corridors of the DREE. Competition for assignments as foreign post commercial counselors is open: As a rule, slots for these jobs will have the largest pool of candidates in the future. The network will be reinvigorated: Reinforcing the inspector general's office will allow it to inspect not only all the posts in three years but also to counsel them more effectively. This policy is going to lead to renewing, in the long term, 10 percent to 15 percent of the work force in these expanding careers. Top management in the central administration will also be shaken up. Merit promotion initiated by the former director, Jacques Desponts, will continue and be reinforced. Better still, it is no longer obligatory to have been bureau chief to become deputy director. A small cultural revolution.
