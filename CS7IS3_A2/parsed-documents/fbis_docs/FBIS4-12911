Israel has agreed that 300 Palestinian policemen, mainly on the command level, immediately enter the region to overlap with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers while the Palestinians study the region and receive the buildings and equipment. The PLO had asked that 1,000 policemen be immediately given full powers on the ground. When Israel refused, the PLO decided that the Palestinian police force enter Gaza and Jericho only after the agreement is signed. [passage omitted] Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not intend to visit the Middle East next month and will not visit 'Arafat in his new Jericho headquarters, contrary to reports which appeared in Arab newspapers and were quoted in Israel. This transpires from messages which have arrived from Moscow over the last few days. According to these messages Yeltsin is extremely occupied by internal Russian issues, and will not be able to tour the Middle East in the near future. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday called on the Middle East countries to cooperate in the economic sphere in order to raise their citizens' standard of living. Visiting Istanbul, Peres said: "We must develop regional economy in order to equalize the standards of living." Peres said Israel is willing to vacate territories it conquered from Arab countries despite strong opposition to this move in Israel. "Israel must return territories to Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians. We want to help our neighbors achieve prosperity. Israel cannot remain an island of prosperity in a poverty-ridden area," Peres said.
