Foreign Aid Minister Alf Svensson (Christian Democratic Coalition) tells TT [Press Wire Service] that the decision to bring it home at the end of the year remains in effect. Defense Minister Anders Bjorck also wants to bring the field hospital home. ``If the decision is no, we will protest,'' says Lars Leijonborg of the Liberal Party. ``This is a matter that must be coordinated; it is not appropriate for Svensson himself to send a no to New York,'' in Leijonborg's opinion. He adds that the matter has not arrived at the cabinet's coordination office. He says that he has the full support of the Liberal Party, including the cabinet members, in demanding that the Swedish equipment and, preferably, the personnel as well should remain. According to the foreign aid minister, the decision to bring the field hospital home is firm. ``If some party brings up the matter in the government we will have a reason to reexamine this. But so far Leijonborg has only asked a question and Bengt Westerberg (Liberal leader and social affairs minister) has asked for foundation material,'' says Svensson. The foreign aid minister thinks that the tens of millions of kronor which the field hospital in Mogadishu costs would be put to better use by reinforcing equipment at other hospitals in the region for the same amount. Leijonborg says that there is also another aspect to the question: ``UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is trying to get the United States to fulfill its commitment in Somalia. So Sweden should not try to avoid it.''
