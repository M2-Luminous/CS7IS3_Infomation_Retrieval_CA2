The fact itself that 4,000 to 5,000 business people will arrive here to participate in the annual meeting of the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] is of a great importance both for the city and for Russia. Seminars and events organized by different countries, and other contacts should promote mutual understanding and business opportunities. I hope that after this week in St. Petersburg, the bank will gain the very strong support of all its members", said EBRD chairman Jacques de Larosiere on the eve of the meeting in an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview.
