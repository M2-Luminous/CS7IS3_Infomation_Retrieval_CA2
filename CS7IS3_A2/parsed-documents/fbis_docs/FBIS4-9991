Ramirez Boettner made it clear that he personally will be unable to receive the Cuban foreign minister because it coincides with a scheduled visit to Morocco (Africa) where he will sign a final document on the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "It is not that we will not receive him. It is just that it coincides with my visit to Morocco. Therefore, Vice Foreign Minister Cabello Sarubbi will be in charge of taking care of him." Robaina, who is now in Montevideo, said: "The purpose of my visit to South American countries is to explain Cuba's current situation to the presidents and announce the opening of our markets to foreign capital, which will not be limited," in an effort to overcome the island's delicate economic situation. The Cuban foreign minister held three official activities in Uruguay on 4 April. Robaina met 30 minutes with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, paid tribute to Uruguayan hero Jose Gervasio Artigas, who was exiled to and died in our country, and met congressmen from the three Uruguayan political parties (Blanco, Colorado, and Broad Front). Foreign Minister Robaina's duties include reviewing a way in which Cuba might settle a $33 million debt to Uruguay. This point will be discussed when he meets Central Bank President Enrique Braga. Cuban ambassador Manuel Aguilera de la Paz, who began his duties on 18 March, told journalists: "We are not in a position to pay at this time, but we are actually willing to find new ways of contributing to finding a solution to begin paying this debt." The Cuban foreign minister said the invitation to invest in his country has been prompted by the new economic measures promoted by Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime. Robaina emphasized: "We have no limitations on the reception of capital. No one has been excluded." He added that tourism, oil, nickel, citrus, and agriculture in general are the most attractive areas for foreign investment.
