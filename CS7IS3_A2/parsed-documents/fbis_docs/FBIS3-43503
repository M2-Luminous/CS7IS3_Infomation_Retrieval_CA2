More than 500 Togolese who settled at Folikope, (Kakakope), and (Aziatakukope) near Pillar Six on the Ghana-Togo border last year have deserted their homes following alleged widespread shelling of their villages. The fleeing Togolese, including women and children, are all being put up temporarily at the Roman Catholic primary school. The Ketu district secretary, Dr. Andrew Amuzukpeglo, has met with the leaders of the new refugee groups and has promised them shelter at a refugee camp at Kliko, which had accommodates more than 12,000 Togolese refugees. Meanwhile, the fleeing Togolese say Ghanaians are the main target of persecution under a house-to-house search being conducted by Togolese soldiers in Lome. The reports speak of Togolese soldiers demanding Togolese identity cards from each household. In another development, Lome radio today announced the reopening of Togo's border with Benin and Burkina Faso, with that of Ghana still closed.
