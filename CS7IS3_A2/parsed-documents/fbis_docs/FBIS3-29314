At the meeting the LDP top advisers exchanged views on the breakdown of the framework talks at the recent Japan-U.S. summit. Referring to Prime Minister Hosokawa's comment that "both Japan and the United States have now entered a mature, adult relationship," one top adviser after another criticized the prime minister, saying: "How can he say Japan and the United States have entered a mature relationship." The LDP leadership plans to question the prime minister in the Diet about the conduct of his diplomacy. Top LDP advisers asked at the meeting about setting criteria for choosing candidates to run on party tickets in the next elections. In response, Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said the LDP leadership would give priority to incumbent Dietmen in choosing candidates. He said: "We intend to let incumbent Dietmen continue their political activities."
