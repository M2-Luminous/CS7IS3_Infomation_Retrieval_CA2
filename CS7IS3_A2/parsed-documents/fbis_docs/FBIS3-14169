In his replies to these questions, the interior minister talked about the phenomenon of violence and sabotage and said that 90 percent of these acts have now become criminal acts, and that those behind them want things to stay as they were. He mentioned in this respect the threats sent to the inland revenue authorities. Regarding the number of individuals in the armed groups, Selim Saadi said that the hardcore of these groups consists of a few hundred people and that 95 percent of their members are known to the security services. He added that the others are carrying out operations under threats -- as was established by the investigation into the arson attack against the Electronic Industries complex in Telagh. This investigation led in fact to the arrest of about 60 people, including a number of workers from the plant. In reply to a question on the release of some detainees from security centers in the south, the interior minister said that those people were not implicated in serious security cases. He added that Abdelkader Boukhamkham and Ali Djeddi [members of the Islamic Salvation Front] were only released after they had served most of their jail sentences. Concerning the political aspect of the crisis, Selim Saadi said that President Liamine Zeroual has defined on several occasions the framework in which the dialogue must be held, with the political and social partners who respect the national values and the constitutional system.
