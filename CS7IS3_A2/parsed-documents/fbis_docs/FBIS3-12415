Good evening, and many happy returns. Now that the House of Representatives has begun to exercise its responsibilities; and as your brother, who has had the honor of serving with the sons of this country for more than 40 years, I found that I have to meet my brothers to talk about some of our concerns and affairs. We want to talk in a fraternal way within this family to which we all belong out of our concern to carry out our duties in a satisfactory way. I hope that we all seek God's satisfaction and ask Him to guide us and grant us success. When we prepared for this meeting in this blessed month and on this night, we did not imagine that it would take place in the wake of one of the ugliest crimes witnessed by the world. This crime was perpetrated yesterday morning in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque when a large number of our kinsfolk, brothers, and beloved ones were martyred and others more were wounded. Those who died on Friday morning in the Ibrahimi Mosque in this blessed month will go to heaven with the chaste righteous martyrs. Everyone hopes he will become a martyr for the sake of God. Only God knows when a person will die. We were, still are, and will continue to support our kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron, Jerusalem, and in every part of the occupied Arab territory. I cannot express in words the endurance of the kinsfolk there under occupation. They are an example for people in terms of their patience, steadfastness, and adherence to their land and rights. I also reiterate that we will continue to do the impossible to have them regain all their rights on their national soil. We have no other objective or goal other than a clear conscience and the satisfaction of Almighty God. We have done all we can in the face of this tragedy in terms of what we can offer and our available capabilities. We sympathize with every mother and father who lost a martyr, with every brother who lost his brother, with every human being in Hebron, with those injured, and with our kinsfolk. Once again I say--and this is not the first time, though one always hopes it is the last--that we do not have any objective and we do not harbor ambitions other than to see the kinsfolk masters of their land. Faced with what has happened, we are going to do our best to push the responsible quarters in Israel to expose their real faces. Will they shoulder their responsibilities toward what happened and take measures that would at least show that all efforts made toward peace were or were not right? The story did not begin with this massacre and heinous crime. Before this crime there was the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque, the aggression against the sacred shrines, including the Ibrahimi Mosque, and the aggression against the Christian holy places. You remember that we have been calling for religious jurisdiction, and that sovereignty on all sacred places is for Almighty God. As for the Islamic holy places, we try to gather around us the support of all brothers in the Islamic world to guarantee that what happened will not recur in the future. What has taken place is enough to prove that these people do not shoulder their responsibilities and cannot be asked to assume responsibility for the holy places of those who believe in God. The issue then requires that we think about a new satisfactory situation in which the Islamic world will shoulder, with us, its responsibilities. There were talks about interfaith dialogue with regard to the holy places. Sovereignty is for Almighty God. Each side will then take care of its holy places regardless of the political situation or the possible and impossible solutions. We will continue to call for all this and work toward materializing this call on the ground. We hope the time will come when believers in God will compete for worshipping, fearing, and respecting God in the holy places. With regard to the measures that should be taken at this stage, we think and work, in addition to all that you were acquainted with, to adopt a stand that will have positive effects. Before and after everything, we think of our kinsfolk, brothers, and beloved ones. I heard some people saying that we should withdraw from the negotiations and others saying that we have no right to discuss such matters under these circumstances. (?This is) correct. I am talking to you as a person in whom, I believe, you have confidence, and through you I am addressing the entire Jordanian community. I am talking to you as a person who has confidence and who also trusts you all. I hope that all my brothers will give us the opportunity as well as the support through awareness, honesty, sincerity, and determination to work to enable us to remain steadfast in the face of the continuous and difficult pressures coming from all directions. My wish is for us to enjoy a measure of awareness, and to have the resolve and determination to always take manly stands, as we did in the past, to demonstrate that we are unwilling to bow to anybody other than Almighty God. We could face difficulties and pressures. This has been our story from the outset. I would like to see all psychologically prepared when such an eventuality materializes. This is important if everybody is to extend his share of support, and if we, along with you, God willing, are to stand with our heads held high, and if the outcome is to be to our liking. In their conduct toward us, some in this world always have in mind the Israeli public opinion, the public opinion here or there, as if we do not have a public opinion. We would like to tell them that we do have a public opinion, that we have a lively and enlightened people, and that we have the resolve and ability to hold out, stand fast, move forward, and shoulder responsibilities jointly and unequivocally with regard to all issues and topics. We have the ability to control our emotions by exercising our mental faculties. We are able to chart the outlines of our future policies, and to walk our path in complete unison, demonstrating joint understanding and cooperation. We might differ on some interpretations or views. However, when joint interests, which are of greater importance than all issues, are at stake, we remain cohesive under all circumstances and conditions. Nonetheless, and to be frank, I will not hesitate to take a certain step in response to the public opinion if such a step is found to be appropriate. I believe that I am aware of the sentiments of the good people from whom I emerged and to whom I belong. All that I ask of you is for you to be with your homeland and with this march, always and ever. I will be frank with you, and tell you about all that needs to be communicated outside the confines of official agencies. Of course you, in the House of Representatives, have the right to acquaint yourselves with everything and to participate in drawing up the path for the present and future. The issue of withdrawing or not withdrawing is something we decide on the basis of our convictions, and also within the framework of cooperation and coordination with our brothers in the Arab world. If we continue, there will be a price and a benefit which we hope will be for our kinsfolk and brothers in the occupied territories in the first place. If we withdraw for consultation, or if we withdraw for good, this should be in the interest of our cause and our generations both at present and in the future. But to be absorbed in details and to spread this talk beyond the House of Representatives, I think will not serve our interest at this stage. As for the House and its performance so far, and the impression I received when this House was elected--which is the second parliament since our resumption of democratic life in this country--and through long experience, in fact my feeling is that through your election the citizens and voters reflected the ambitions, hopes, and awareness they have. The citizen wants you to work, to work more, and to give the maximum you can in a reasonable, enlightened, and honest manner. My hope has been, is still, and will continue to be that you will continue and try to make up for the past. Much time passed in terms of achievements that could have been made, in terms of the stage and how delicate and difficult it is, in terms of laws that need rectification and adoption, in terms of work, and in terms of issues that need to be presented and discussed. I urged the government, urged the House -- represented by its speaker and the brothers when I met them -- and urged the brothers in the Senate to maintain coordination so that matters will be tackled efficiently and with responsibility. Ultimately, people will judge us in light of our achievements. As a brother, rather than from the position of a person with responsibilities, I would like to appeal to you all to rise above minor issues and personal conflicts. I also appeal to you not to waste time on issues that would tarnish your image, our image, Jordan's image, or the march. Let us stand well with each other and let us work in the interest of the country. Each one of us, particularly you, should work toward laying the foundations for new parliamentary traditions and norms so that the bases will be stronger than before and so that the coming generations will continue to walk on a clear path. Even practically, I do not believe that the situation is sound. In every House session, the whole cabinet should be present. If the cabinet spends two days with the House and one day with the Senate, and if it holds its meetings in two days, how many days will be left for the cabinet to tackle the citizens' issues? I believe that if the concerned ministers attend the House session this will be sufficient. Of course, in important issues the entire cabinet must be there. Through dialogue, you can discuss the situation so that you can invest our potentials, resources, and time in a better way. The official media are not carrying out their role. We want our brothers to move in this regard. The media are considered state media, but they are lost and absent in most cases. Either the media should be a state media that advocate the state policy or we should find another formula. I will not specify, but there are laws that are of great importance. Once again, when these laws are presented to you they are presented because there is a conviction that they are feasible and beneficial to the citizen and needy citizen, and they are presented to organize this country and the relations of its people, and so that its resources are not wasted or exhausted. These laws would be beneficial for our people, family, and march regardless of whether they were proposed by this or that world quarter . There are other issues that you will discuss and on which you will make the appropriate decision. I believe we should not be too hasty in some fields so that we will not suffer a setback. Do we follow the right measures when we plan for the future in Amman or elsewhere? Do we start with the ideal thing that should be realized one day and make sure not to make mistakes to avoid negative results, God forbid? I had in mind, and I proposed to my brothers that there should be coordination, contacts, explanation, and discussion concerning any draft law and all stages through which it passes so that the outcome and result will be the ideal that we and everyone of us seeks in this country. I believe that so far this mechanism is not available in a satisfactory and comfortable manner. I pray for Almighty God's help so that this will be the natural situation in the future. What is painful to me more than anything else is to use my right and return some laws, as happened several times, out of my concern for the homeland and the people. I do not want to exercise this right so spare me, yourselves, the Senate, all brothers, and the homeland this effort through cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of power, and through studying everything with due attention until eventually the desired situation is reached. I do not believe that any of us is outbidding others, or likes to be called a person engaged in oneupmanship. The country is ours, and what is at stake is the destiny of future generations. Hence, God willing, each of us will be engaged day and night in some sort of soul-searching. Each of us must do all he can to achieve our objectives and goals. The circumstances are tough, and the suffering is continuing. Pressures on us continue from all directions. However, we must confront them with discipline, patience, resolve, and determination. Even our reactions to what we are experiencing, and to our past experiences must be studied and calculated to yield a positive outcome. People can express their feelings in lots of ways. However, we must underscore the positive aspect in this. A question is posed on whether a strike, for example, with due respect to the views of brothers in this regard, would promote, even in the least, the cause of our kinfolk and brothers in the occupied territories, and in Hebron in particular at present. If, God forbid, we inflame people's sentiments and a guest of ours, regardless of where he came from on this globe, is encroached on, would such a thing bring us honor, given that these people are our guests? Should we degrade ourselves, God forbid, to the level reached by the enemies, who are behaving unreasonably and unacceptably, when nothing escapes the attention of the world community, or should we think of alternatives? Why should we bring life in Amman, other cities, or villages to a standstill for a single day? This would prevent people from selling their goods, or leading a normal life. If we were to set aside part of that day's earnings and donate it humbly to our brethren, would this not be a better move? It would be preferable, brothers, if each of us thinks day and night of all he can do to ensure the availability of resources that could promote the interests of both the homeland and the march. We have been living under difficult circumstances over the past four years. Instead of switching on all lights, we could switch on some of them; and instead driving too many cars, we could share a car with a brother or friend. The objective is to save some energy. If we save a few things here and there, we could have something that would help us face any possibility. One of the issues that was discussed for a long time was the issue of medical care, food, medicine. We have been looking into this subject over the past years. What happens in others parts of the world could also happen here. Consequently, we should issue instructions and attempt to unify and organize departments to enable them deal with this situation. It is known that some industrial countries are not concerned about exporting goods that are below the standards used in the industrial countries themselves. This needs our concern and control. We are not the first, nor will we be the last country to make mistakes. If these mistakes are detected and rectified, and if the responsible side is the party which discovered this situation and adopted a stand -- as happened here -- then this is good. However, let us look at the broader picture. How many people know that according to international reports we have no less than 7,000 drug addicts? We remain silent on these matters either out of shame or because we are incapable of dealing with it. We must begin to tackle this problem correctly whether through firm measures regarding trafficking or traffickers or through setting up specialized centers to treat and cure addicts. But to remain shy and silent, I believe this is a mistake we commit against ourselves and our children--many of whom went abroad for study and returned with these or other problems. We are in need of industry, development, and everything. There is a subject I have repeatedly raised with our brothers, including the deputies from the al-Fuhays area, and they are trying. Do you not see the billowing smoke which contains cement dust. [reference here is to the cement factories in al-Fuhays] My granddaughter and all my sons from 'Abdallah to this little Jumanah, suffer from asthma. For years, we have been saying that someone should study this situation. There are human beings around this site. This does not mean that I am pushing you to decide something now, but it is time to think about our people. May be because I am concerned and I personally suffered, otherwise my voice would have been lower than the others, but this is something illogical. Our water and treatment of it, and ensuring that poisons from the factories do not reach the dams and contaminate the water there. Should I or you be the one to raise these issues? Should I or you be the one to tackle it in a calm and objective discussion? Likewise, there are many other issues that I think we have to handle? But to concentrate on trivial things is not good for any of my brothers or for the homeland. Wasting time--and it seems lately we have been wasting much time, God help us--should stop. If you have another opinion, then we should seek the judgment of the people. God willing, they will be the judge of whether we are doing what we should in the best possible manner. Our country is good and generous. It is a rock in the face of enemies. Our country is full of good things. What pains me most is to see continuous attempts to harm and undermine all its achievements. Nobody mentions good accomplishments. However, we rummage around for things to brand as mistakes. If what is found to be a mistake is really significant, that would be most welcome. Nonetheless, it seems that we are headed for frustration to frustrate both ourselves and people. Why is this? This must not be the case. Let is recall the starting point, when we chose to revive democratic and parliamentary traditions and when circumstances made this revival possible. I would like to say that our decision in this regard was not the outcome of popular pressure from any party whatsoever. Rather, this revival of democratic and parliamentary traditions was the outcome of a decision we made and a wish we had. We want democracy to be a trust to bequeath to our future generations so they may carry, safeguard, and protect it. We wanted this country to be an example and model to others. Many people are making allegations in this regard. This must not be the case. We should not remain silent over this. In the past, similar allegations were made. The late Abu-'Adnan [Bahjat] al-Talhuni [former Senate member] was with me at this Court when the Army Command was Arabized. Then, we were approached only after the people had realized that the accomplishment had been made, and that those whose departure was ordered had already left the country. However, afterward, we heard of heroes who drew up schemes and carried out certain feats in this regard. Abu-Shakir [Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir] is aware of this. Nobody approached us then. There have been numerous recurrences of this. We embrace democracy within our hearts and souls. We want it to succeed. We want to set an example and a model of shura to others. We want Arab individuals to live and realize that they are of value, that they are human beings, just like other human beings. We want this march to achieve its purposes and objectives. We are bound to succeed. So, help us all so we may succeed. In other words, let us all cooperate to render the march a success. As for the issues pertaining to inter-Arab meetings, inter-Arab cooperation, and the demands for holding an Arab summit, I would like to say that we have always been at the forefront of those demanding such a summit, and we will continue to be so. I have never considered any difference with any brother here or in any other place a personal matter that will leave any trace. We might have differences of interpretation sometimes. I never took the insults which even reached plotting to kill as personal. Even the insults, vilifications, and digging up the past I never took as personal. This is because a man in this position and with such responsibilities must be above all these things. I sincerely and honestly mean what I am saying. This is our situation, our life, and our path. We must not continue to speak about the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army. I reiterate what many people have reiterated: Had it not been for the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army we would not have the opportunity to live such a life. The Intelligence is not against the citizens of this country; it is to protect the country against deep-rooted and strong organizations that have huge potentials in the most serious positions in the Arab homeland. We as well as the Army -- our officers and soldiers who are protecting long fronts against dangers and challenges to maintain the security of the country and who are deployed throughout the world -- praise be to God, are appreciated and respected by people. Instead of deploying foreign forces here and there in our Arab territory, we are assuming this role to prevent evil among people in Europe and elsewhere with a high degree of efficiency, capability, and honesty. Our youths are in Yemen now in an attempt to consolidate the pillars of the accord on which all the sons of Yemen were unanimous. We had the honor to welcome them here in Amman, Amman of the Arabs, the capital of accord and reconciliation. Our youths from the Armed Forces are there in Yemen to help implement the accord and pledge document and to tackle a matter inflicted on our kinsfolk and brothers. Our duty as Arabs is to resolve our problems and to support each other under difficult circumstances and in the face of challenges. People, this homeland deserves more. May God grant us success and guide us on the right path. I have great hope in you. Almighty God will guide our march and grant us success. Greetings to you all. God's peace. mercy, and blessings be upon you.
