ACTION: Final rule, request for comments. SUMMARY: On February 15, 1994, the Department of Transportation published final alcohol testing rules, including a requirement that evidential breath testing devices be used to conduct alcohol tests. The Department also published a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether blood testing should be used in very limited circumstances (i.e., for reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests, where evidential breath testing was not available). After reviewing the comments, the Department has decided not to authorize blood testing as proposed. The Department's operating administrations are amending their alcohol testing rules to require employers to submit to the Department reports of reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests that could not be conducted because breath testing was unavailable. DATES: The amendments to the FAA, RSPA, FRA, FHWA, and FTA alcohol testing regulations are effective January 1, 1995. Comments concerning the reporting requirement added to the five operating administration alcohol testing regulations should be received by January 17, 1995. Late filed comments will be considered to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Docket Clerk, Docket No. 49384, Room 4107, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street, S.W., Washington D.C., 20590. This is a consolidated docket that will accept comments on the amendments to all five operating administration rules involved. Commenters wishing to have their comments acknowledged should send a stamped, self-addressed postcard with their comments. The Docket Clerk will date stamp the card and return it to the commenter. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Ashby, Acting Director, Department of Transportation Office of Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance, 400 7th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C., 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;3784).
