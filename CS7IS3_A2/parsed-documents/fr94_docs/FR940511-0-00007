FR940511-0-00007 FR940511-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;10] Amendment to Class D Airspace; Aurora, CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Aurora, Buckley ANG Base Airport, Colorado, Class D airspace. It amends the Class D airspace effective hours to conform with the control tower's hours of operation at the Buckley ANG Base, Colorado. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``air traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment would bring publications up to date. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 VTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;10, 1601 Lind Avenue S.W., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to amend the Buckley ANG Base Class D airspace to incorporate ``part-time'' information into the rule (59 FR 13663; March 23, 1994). The information would provide pilots with notice that the Class D airspace would not be effective during certain periods of the day. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``air traffic area,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 8, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates are in North American Datum 83. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends Class D airspace at the Buckley ANG Base, Aurora, Colorado, by adding information regarding the times the Class D airspace is effective. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
