Within the PRI 1994-2000 Electoral Platform, the economic chapter proposes strengthening an "economy of certitude" by establishing the groundwork to expand production activities with price stability. This is the starting point to "launch an economic development strategy that efficiently and quickly meets society's demands for welfare and justice, based on responsible policies which do not threaten the essential balance of the economy." Thus, it rejects a populist concept of the state and states that, within the processes for economic change and trade opportunities, "the state cannot renege its responsibilities" and it must maintain a framework of macroeconomic stability and guarantee opportunities for the free development of creativity and social initiative. The state must encourage savings and investments, broaden regional infrastructure, support the modernization of small- and medium-sized enterprises, sponsor the training of manpower, pledge strict compliance with labor laws, and guarantee favorable conditions to strengthen salaries. It terms as not postponable the economy's reactivation to sponsor the prompt creation of more and better jobs, to take advantage of stronger finances to meet social needs, and to guarantee better conditions for stability in the economy. The platform proposes a redefinition of the foundations for relations between federations, states, and municipalities for a better distribution of resources; improving the allocation of public funds; and increasing internal savings, "because a healthy growth must not excessively depend on external savings." The platform also proposes defending the purchasing capability of salaries; improving the quality of public education for work; increasing consultation with the country's regions for an equitable development; sponsoring new plans for fiscal coordination among federations and states; and encouraging an active policy of investments in communication and transportation infrastructure. PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] The PRD's economic platform mainly seeks to achieve an economic growth with equity and to create a new social pact that helps improve the population's standard of living. To achieve the first goal, the PRD bases its position on three issues: A development policy that is answerable to the nation; a productive reorganization of the economy by sector, region, and environment -- starting with an overall renewal of agrarian and livestock activities; and the creation of a legal and institutional system which guarantees the validity of economic rights and equal opportunities for Mexicans. To achieve the aforementioned goals, the party emphasizes the development of productive national and foreign investments, and the discouragement of speculative investments, by adapting internal interest rates to internationally competitive rates. The PRD also suggests a revision of the tax system to achieve an equitable implementation of taxes. Thus, it would reduce indirect taxes and public service fees, and it would abolish the two-percent tax on assets. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will propose during the televised debate the ideas of gradually eliminating the oil revenues tax; increasing social expenses; sponsoring a recovery and expansion of the internal market and production enterprises; seeking a definite renegotiation of the foreign debt; and regulating economic relations abroad. In the foreign economy sector, the PRD proposes a renegotiation of the Free Trade Agreement which includes the issue of manpower mobility, the exclusion of basic grains from the agreement, the revision of rules of origin which affect the automobile and spare parts industry, and a balance in the level of subsidies to agrarian and livestock products, among others. The PRD suggests revoking the unconstitutional reforms to Article 27 and the exercise of the Mexican nation's full authority on its oil resources. Referring to the new social pact, [the PRD] seeks to reform the Federal Labor Law and abolish Section B of Article 123, among other measures. The PRD proposes the reinstatement of a minimum salary, with an emphasis on the increase in employment and productivity, and it suggests that the National Congress determine the basis for this. In its political platform, the National Action Party [PAN] proposes to reduce poverty, strive for balanced regional development, create jobs, protect the freedom to create unions, abrogate the taxes-on-assets law, stimulate industrial development, break up the railroad enterprise, speed up the financial opening, back up exports, legally protect foreign investment, establish an agricultural and livestock model for the 21st century, and encourage the private sector's participation in all areas of the economy. PAN proposes constitutional changes to restore the economy with the people in mind, changes like amending Article 25 to establish clearly the state's subsidiary role. The party pledges to reduce the serious poverty of some 14 million Mexicans through social education programs such as responsible parenthood, hygiene, nutrition, fighting alcohol and drug addiction, care of mothers and children, and allocating monetary resources for the general development of Indian communities. Also, the party proposes to abolish Paragraph B of Article 123 of the Constitution so all workers can share the same rights; eliminate unnecessary fiscal burdens, such as taxes on assets and payrolls; increase contributions for SAR [Retirement Savings System]. PAN proposes to recognize the government workers' right to form associations and join more than one union; restore women's labor rights to be hired and paid their salaries without discrimination. The party proposes to launch a countrywide industrial and commercial development program of property and services where very small-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises would be given priority attention. Finally, PAN proposes to open the railroads to local and foreign investment, separating them from the public sector, and increasing the private sector's participation in infrastructure.
