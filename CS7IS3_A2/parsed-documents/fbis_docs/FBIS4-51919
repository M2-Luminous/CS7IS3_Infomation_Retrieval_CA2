FBIS4-51919 "dreas086_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea U.S.-ROK 2 May Air `War Exercise' Denounced U.S.-ROK 2 May Air `War Exercise' Denounced SK0405011094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 3 May 94 SK0405011094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 3 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. imperialists conducted on 2 May, along with the puppets, a provocative aerial war exercise aimed at launching an aggression on the North by introducing fighter planes into South Korea from U.S. Pacific area bases. Prior to this frantic war exercise, F-15 fighter-bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault bombers, E-3 early warning planes, which had taken off from overseas bases, had been deployed for mobile operations in the bases of the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea. This war exercise was frantically conducted in the air over Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Koesan areas under the command of E-3 early warning planes--which are called aerial flight command post. Put into this exercise on a large scale were aircraft, which had flown into from overseas bases, and the fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, reconnaissance planes belonging to the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea and to the puppet Air Force. This gunpowder-reeking war exercise was aimed at studying the actual conditions of the command of E-3 early warning planes over the aircraft of various types and at increasing the capability of launching a surprise strike of aggression on the North for an actual war. On the same day, the P-3 anti-submarine planes, which took off from a Japanese base, carried out espionage activities over the areas along the coast of the northern part of the Republic and the seas while moving around the east and the west for a long time. At the same time, they ran amok in an exercise of launching strikes against submarines with various mines, torpedoes, and depth charges. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in conducting helicopter operations and firing firearms exercises in the areas near the DMZ in front of our nose. On 2 May, about 20 armed helicopters and transport helicopters, which went into action over the areas near the DMZ in the areas of Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon, South Korea's Kangwon Province, ran wild in the exercises of launching missile strikes and ground support, and airborne operations in low-altitude and very low-altitude flights. On the same day, the puppet Army tank group, which was deployed for mobile operations in the areas of (Kumsari), Paju County, fired about 30 rounds of tank gun fires at the bank of the Imjin River. The large-caliber artillery groups, which held firing positions in areas of Hapsuri and Majolli, Yonchon County; (Kupori), Paju County; and Naedaeri and Tongmangli, Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea, displayed their war frenzy by firing about 80 rounds of shots at areas near the DMZ of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. Also on the same day, the puppet Army armed rascals, who held combat positions in areas of Yulili and Naepori, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County in South Korea's Kangwon Province; Sinjongli, Inje County; and Songgongni, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, fired at random several hundred rounds of large-caliber machine gun fires while launching an attack in the direction of the MDL. This reckless maneuver of playing with fire fully displayed the war-loving nature of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets as warmongers.
