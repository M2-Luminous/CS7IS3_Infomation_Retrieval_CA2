Just hours after the victims were buried several Christian political leaders turned on the government, demanding that it fulfil its responsibilities by identifying and punishing the bombers. Many agreed the government was wrong to focus its attention on ambitious projects to rebuild Lebanon's war-shattered infrastructure when it should first strengthen security and address social issues. The head of the Maronite Church, Monsignor Nasrallah Sfayr, set the tone at a funeral service Monday in Our Lady of Deliverance Church, where 55 worshippers were also wounded during Lent Mass on Sunday. "All the Lebanese have the right to a life of freedom without fear, frustration and inequality," Sfayr said, urging the government to rectify its mistakes. "Saying that such things happen in other countries is not enough for us. Elsewhere the culprits are found and punished, but here they are not identified because of negligence or incompetence," he added. Karim Paqraduni, Secretary General of the right-wing Christian Phalange Party, echoed Sfayr, speaking to AFP on Tuesday. "There is no political will to arrest those responsible for this revolting crime," he said. Paqraduni escaped a December bomb attack on his party's headquarters during a weekly leadership meeting because he was abroad at the time. Three people were killed and 100 wounded, and the bomber is still at large. The church bomb "played into the hands of extremists on all sides," Paqraduni said. "The bomb clearly underlined a political desire to destabilise the situation in Lebanon, terrorise Christians and push them to react, in a bid to create a civil war situation in Lebanon," Paqraduni said. "The government's political inefficiency allowed this to happen," he added. For 'Isa Ghurayb, chief editor of the French-language L'ORIENT-LE JOUR, the "horror" which plagued Lebanon during its 1975-1990 civil war had returned to haunt the Lebanese. Ghurayb, whose newspaper is owned by Culture Minister Michel Iddih, said the church bombing was the latest in a series of unpunished attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon. "These repeated acts of aggression worry the Christians, mainly the Maronites, because they coincide with an unprecedented political imbalance in Lebanon ... (where) a growing number of Christian feel they have become alienated. "Nothing is being done to remedy this disastrous feeling. There are just hollow calls to close ranks around the government," he said. Samir Ja'ja', head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces militia, accused the government of failing the Lebanese people, who "have realised that the security the authorities promised to restore is still a mirage." The sense of frustration arose after the 1989 al-Ta'if inter-parliamentary accord, which effectively ended the war in Lebanon, with the Christians agreeing to give Muslims a greater share in running the country. It was exacerbated as the government failed to keep a pledge to introduce sweeping social and economic reforms, which led most Christians to boycott the 1992 legislative elections, protesting that they were imposed by Syria. No demographic survey has been carried out in Lebanon since 1932, but the Christians maintain they represent 50 percent of the three-million-strong population, even though hundreds of thousands fled the country during the war. The Muslims say they outnumber the Christians by two to one, but the Maronites are the largest single Christian community.
