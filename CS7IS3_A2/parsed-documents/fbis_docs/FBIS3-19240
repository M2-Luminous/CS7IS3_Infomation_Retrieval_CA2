The agreement was signed by the Indian High Commissioner, Dr. L.M. Singhvi, and the British foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, in the presence of the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British counterpart, Mr. John Major in London. Our official correspondent, P.J.S. Trehan reports that Britain is the first country with which India signs such an agreement. The 10-year agreement aims at creating conditions conducive for investment in each other's country and is designed to increase investors confidence. Three other Memoranda of Understanding -- MOU -- have also been signed. The MOU's were signed between the private companies of both the countries in power generation, telecommunications, and electrical transformers. During his talks with Mr. John Major yesterday, Mr. Rao said that India is very much interested in the resumption of the political process in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fear of the gun instigated from across the border is continuing in the valley. Mr. Rao recalled that the ground work for starting a political process in the state has already been initiated. Mr. Major, on his part, laid stress on the desirability of a dialogue between India and Pakistan. In his reply, Mr. Rao said New Delhi is always in favor of such a dialogue. On Mr. Major's inquiry about the confidence- building measures with Pakistan, Mr. Rao drew his attention to the six concrete proposals put forth by India in January last. The two prime minister endorsed the continuation of the Indo-British Partnership Intiative -- IBPI. Presenting the initiative to the two prime ministers, the cochairman, Dr. J.J. Irani of India and Mr. Robert Evans of Britain described the initiative as a great success. Addressing the Indian community at the Guild Hall last evening, Mr. Narasimha Rao said if the external factor is removed from Jammu and Kashmir, normalcy can be restored, the political process started, and economic activity revived in a very short time. He regretted that the valley has been a victim of proxy war from across the border. He said we live in a world in which mastery over technique of disinformation creates the possibility of more massive disinformation. It should, therefore, not come as a surprise to us that made victims of terrorism organized and financed from across the border, should, sometime, find ourselves subjected to unwarranted criticism, Mr. Rao added. [sentence as heard] He said it is strange that the world should worry about the human rights of the terrorists who, massacre innocent people or use religious places for political ends, and not of those who are being forced out of their homes, attacked, and terrorized. Mr. Rao expressed surprise that a country on the verge of being declared a terrorist state should lustily proclaim that it would not have discussions with India until the human rights record improved. Mr. Rao reiterated that India stands for peace all over the world. Our democracy remains not only intact, but also a vibrant and proven force overcoming all kinds of disasters and manmade tragedies. On the third day of his visit, Mr. Narasimha Rao will call on Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace this morning. He will also hold talks with the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs, Mr. Douglas Hurd. The Commonwealth secretary general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, is also scheduled to call on the prime minister.
