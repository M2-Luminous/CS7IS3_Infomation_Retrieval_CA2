However, political sources close to the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] leadership stressed that "the party refuses to participate in such a government." They expressed their confidence that all the other parties would not join a government that includes the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] and excludes the party, because "it would be a partitionist government by all standards." This comes in the context of reports that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih wishes to end the present coalition by excluding the YSP, relying on the parliamentary majority the GPC and YRG enjoy in the House of Representatives. Especially as former South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad turned down a YSP offer to head a new government in place of the present government headed by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. An opposition sources share the view of a high-ranking YSP official that "anyone can form a secessionist government if he wants to." But the main current issue is to safeguard unity.
