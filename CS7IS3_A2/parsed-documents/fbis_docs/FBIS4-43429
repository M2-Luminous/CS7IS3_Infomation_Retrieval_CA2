However, Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has already defined the main lines of Belgium's position: There is no question of sending Belgian troops to Rwanda again. Belgium is hated by the Hutu extremists and the 10 Belgian paratroopers killed in April have not been forgotten. Nevertheless, Belgium could supply France with military and logistical aid. Our country is thoroughly familiar with the infrastructure of Rwanda.
