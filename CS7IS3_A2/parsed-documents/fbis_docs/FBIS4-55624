Their powers were practically nil. But the seven presidents meeting in the provincial town of Litomysl may have achieved more than anyone could have expected. The meeting brought Austria, Germany and Slovenia into the Central European fold, a step toward regional integration that went beyond the traditional--and unpopular--Visegrad Four countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart said that this strengthens the Central European case for European unity by demonstrating the countries' ability to cooperate. He said the meeting was an important signal to Western Europe that the countries are ready to work with each other and with the West. "Of course," Pithart said, "it matters to Europe whether a lone rider shows up or whether it's a group that is prepared to solve even those problems that seem unsolvable." In a 90-minute televised debate, the presidents discussed regional cooperation, alluding to Russia, the Balkans and integration to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. Most of the debate, however, was devoted to mutual declarations of friendship, cooperation and goodwill. While Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and others have criticized Visegrad on the grounds that it classifies a group of countries as a whole rather than recognizing their individuality and differing rates of progress, the Litomysl meeting showed the Visegrad Four's ability to work together without forcing them into a single category. Though concrete results were insubstantial, supporters of the meeting said this did not matter because the presidents' aims were broad and long-term. "From experience, I know how important and underrated personal meetings are," said Pithart. "The more meetings there are, the better relations can be and the more problems can be avoided in the future. Obviously, that applies even if people aren't affected straightaway." The predominance of ceremony and symbolism, however, did not keep the presidents away from more topical issues. For instance, Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that Western Europe had made critical errors in not understanding that the Yugoslav Federation was bound to fall apart. Additionally, all the leaders vehemently rejected Russian attempts to exert influence over Central Europe, even through the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace. "Russia does not want to be a partner and does not understand what partnership is," said Polish President Lech Walesa, the most outspoken of the group. Richard von Weizsacker said that while the West wanted to cooperate with--rather than provoke--Russia, it would not do so on terms dictated by Moscow. Czech President Vaclav Havel stressed the importance of categorically rejecting any claim that "Russia has a special right to advise us on what we may and may not do." The televised debate was moderated by French political scientist and historian Jacques Rupnik, who accidentally overlooked Slovak President Michal Kovac in the first round of questions. Klaus, who along with Czech parliamentary Chairman Milan Uhde, declined an invitation to dine with the presidents April 15--an invitation they had previously accepted--said that the meeting broke down barriers between East and West and rectified the impression often given by the media that there is little understanding among some of the countries involved. On a local level, the meeting was perhaps the biggest event to hit the 10,000-inhabitant town of Litomysl since the birth of its favorite son, composer Bedrich Smetana. Portraits and biographies of the presidents hung in store windows--Havel's was in a bookshop, Kovac's at a travel agency--and thousands of supporters clamored to see them. "It's a huge honor that this is happening in our town," said Jan Schejbal, who works at the Zlata hvezda hotel, where Havel spent the second night of his stay. "Seeing top-level politics before our eyes makes us feel that we're a part of them, too. It brings us up to a higher level, and it makes us forget our own problems." The presidents of the seven countries are to meet again in Hungary next year and in Poland in 1996.
