Automobiles remain a major contributor to Japan's large trade surplus, and have been made an issue in the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks. As such, Kumagai praised the Japanese and U.S. industries' efforts to create cooperative relations on their own. But this agreement on beefed-up cooperation, while bringing Ford executives into Mazda operations, promises little in the areas of production and sales. Consequently, some MITI officials think: "Mazda, which is in a business slump, maybe wanted to show its workers and the public that the company is now regaining stability with the support of Ford." Domestic automobiles are now in oversupply as a result of flagging domestic demand and the prolonged appreciation of the yen. MITI (a senior official) thinks: "Domestic makers ought to take drastic measures such as production cutbacks or reorganization," and hopes the Ford-Mazda cooperation will be an opportunity for domestic makers to go further toward restructuring.
