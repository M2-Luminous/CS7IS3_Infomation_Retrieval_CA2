Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCPCC), made the remark at an on-going national conference on ideological and media work in Beijing. He urged those working on the ideological and media front to serve the overall needs of "seizing opportunities, deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting economic development and maintaining social stability". He said that ideological and media work should give correct guidance and have a clear-cut stand supporting reform. Ideological workers must have a good understanding of the party's range of policies and make full, correct and timely reports on economic development as a whole, he said. The vice-premier pointed out that the principle of "telling the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into full play, and achieving actual gains" should be carried out to promote a sustained, fast and sound economic development. It is a bounden duty for the ideological and media workers to maintain social stability and to give the broad masses a clear explanation of the party's policies in the course of reform, he said. Zhu fully affirmed the great achievements made by the ideological and media workers in the reform and economic development over the past decade, and he also briefed the conference participants on the national economic development in 1993. Speaking of the current favorable climate of reform and opening to the outside world, he said that the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has struck root in the hearts of the people after a decade of reform. And the party and the government have accumulated a wealth of experience, he said, adding that China's economic development has been encouraging since the publication of Deng Xiaoping's important speech in 1992. He said that some problems that occurred on the way forward have been solved by taking a range of macro-economic control measures. The framework of a socialist market economic structure worked out by the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CCPCC has laid a solid ideological foundation for implementing the current reform policies, Zhu said. Zhu emphasized that the current rare historical opportunities should be seized firmly and valued highly "to do what we wanted to do in the past, but could not do." When talking about the reform program for this year, Zhu said, "the preparatory work is adequate and we are quite ready to overcome the difficulties before us." The vice-premier quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying "the whole party and the whole nation must be told that it is a hard task" and "there are no perfect policies or methods." He noted that the main risk, currently, does not lie in the reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in fixed assets, which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to build on the investment. The agricultural problem remains outstanding, he pointed out, adding that some people are keen on creating a larger scale or faster speed or high consumption. "They are not interested in the economic returns, practicing of economy, making profits, and taking care of the well-being of the broad masses," he said. He stressed that this situation must be changed. The vice-premier said that great efforts should be made this year to cut down on the scale of fixed asset investment and to continue the development of the rural economy. He stressed that party committees and governments at all levels must pay still more attention to the reform and the leading cadres must stand in the forefront of carrying out the reform program in the new year.
