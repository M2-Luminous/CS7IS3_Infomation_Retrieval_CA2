FR941116-2-00103 FR941116-2-00078 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice 2115] Laredo Northwest International Bridge (Bridge IV), Laredo, TX: Issuance of Presidential Permit SUMMARY: The Department of State is announcing the issuance of a Presidential Permit for the Laredo Northwest International Bridge (Bridge IV) project sponsored by the City of Laredo, Texas. The permit was issued on October 7, 1994, pursuant to the International Bridge Act of 1972, (33 U.S.C. 535 et seq. ) and E.O. 11423, 33 FR 11741 (1968) as amended by E.O. 12847, 58 FR 96 (1993). ADDRESSES: Copies of the Presidential Permit may be obtained from Stephen R. Gibson, Office of Mexican Affairs, room 4258, Department of State, Washington, D.C. 20502 (Telephone 202&hyph;647&hyph;8529). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of the application by the City of Laredo, Texas for a permit to build a new bridge, with access road, to be constructed across the Rio Grande river between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 1991, at 56 FR 50148. The bridge will carry pedestrian and commercial vehicular traffic, and is intended to relieve the traffic burden on existing bridges and the downtown area. As a condition for the Presidential Permit, the City of Laredo has agreed to route all commercial traffic to this new bridge or to the Colombia Bridge, which is between the City of Laredo and the State of Nuevo Leon. Further, the City has agreed that all hazardous materials will be directed to Colombia where the U.S. Customs Service has a hazardous materials containment facility. The new bridge is needed because the two existing international bridges between downtown Laredo and Nuevo Laredo cannot accomodate additional traffic without further safety and environmental degradation. The application for the Presidential Permit was reviewed and approved by over two dozen federal, state, and local agencies. The final application and environmental assessment were reviewed and approved or accepted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, General Services Administration, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Highway Administration, Food and Drug Administration, International Boundary and Water Commission_U.S. Section, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of State, and the appropriate Texas State agencies_the Parks and Wildlife Department, the Department of Transportation, and the Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Dated: November 3, 1994. Stephen R. Gibson, Coordinator, U.S.-Mexico Border Affairs, Office of Mexican Affairs.
