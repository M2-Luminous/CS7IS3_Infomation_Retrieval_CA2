FR940927-1-00018 FR940927-1-00007 Oklahoma proposes to recodify its rules according to the standards set forth by the Oklahoma State Legislature and the Office of Administrative Code. The proposed recodification revises the Oklahoma rules from series 816 for surface coal mining operations and series 817 for underground coal mining operations to series 460 with underlying chapters and subchapters specifying the various surface and underground coal mining provisions. In addition, Oklahoma proposes to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at §§780.25 and 784.16, reclamation plan for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments; §780.37, road systems; §784.20, subsidence control plans; §784.24, transportation facilities; section 800.40, requirement to release performance bonds; §§816.46 and 817.46, hydrologic balance and siltation structures; §816.116, revegetation success standards; §816.121, subsidence control; §823.12, prime farmland soil removal; §823.13, prime farmland soil stockpiling; and §823.14, prime farmland soil replacement. More specifically, Oklahoma proposes the following revisions. It proposes to revise §§780.25 and 784.16, regarding the reclamation plan requirements for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments, by deleting language allowing professional geologists and qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans and detailed designs. In addition, Oklahoma proposes in both provisions to replace the phrase ``regulatory authority' with the term ``Department.'' Oklahoma proposes to revise §780.37, regarding road systems, by deleting language allowing qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans and drawings for primary roads. Oklahoma proposes to revise §784.20, regarding subsidence control plans, by removing the phrase ``to the extent required under State law'' from the requirement that a permit application include a subsidence control plan containing a description of the measures to be taken to mitigate or remedy any subsidence-related material to, or diminution in value or reasonable foreseeable use of structures or facilities. Oklahoma proposes to revise §784.24, regarding transportation facilities, by deleting language allowing qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans and drawings for primary roads. Oklahoma proposes to revise §800.40, regarding the requirement to release performance bonds, by providing that the Department may arrange with the permittee to allow access to the permit area upon request by any person with an interest in bond release, for the purpose of gathering information relevant to the proceeding. Oklahoma proposes to revise §§816.46 and 817.46, regarding the hydrologic balance requirements for siltation structures, by (1) striking a cross-reference to provisions that grant authority to qualified, registered professional land surveyors to certify plans and detailed designs for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments; and (2) adding language to require that the qualified, registered professional engineer or land surveyor certifying the construction of siltation structures shall have experience in pond construction. Oklahoma proposes to revise §816.116, regarding revegetation success standards, to require that prior to approving selective husbandry practices, the Department must obtain the approval of the Director of the Office of Surface Mining that such practices are normal husbandry practices. Oklahoma proposes to revise §816.121, regarding subsidence control, by deleting the phrase ``to the extent required under applicable provisions of State law'' from the requirement to correct material damage resulting from subsidence. Oklahoma proposes to revise §823.12, regarding soil stockpiling requirements for prime farmland, to include the E horizon in the description of topsoil for prime farmland. In addition, Oklahoma proposes to delete the phrase ``an equal or'' from the requirement that a final soil have a greater productive capacity than that which existed prior to mining.
