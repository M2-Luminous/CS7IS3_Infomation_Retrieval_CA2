I am sorry that we have to interrupt you, but we are going to the IEC headquarters at Midrand, Gallagher Estate. [Kriegler] ... valid ballot paper, however, when it became apparent yesterday already that there were certain voting districts where the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers had not arrived in time, we had to deal with the situation as best we could, and I want to read to you the instruction that was given. Voters wishing to cast their votes for the IFP, where no stickers were provided for the ballot papers, have been marking their preference in writing on the ballots. The IEC will deal with such ballots in due course, in terms of Section 47 of the Electoral Act which deals inter alia with voting irregularities. This section empowers the commission to make such determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting of irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Two, the commission has decided that it will print additional ballot papers locally as they are required. This process has already begun and so forth. Now what that means is the following: In respect of yesterday's special votes those special votes will be separately kept at the voting station. Spoilt papers, spoilt as a result of the non- affixing of a sticker, will be included in that bundle. Those ballot papers will be counted in the sense that we will have a full tally, counting station by counting station, as to how many ballots were spoilt for this reason. Likewise, in respect of the lesser number of voting stations where stickers were not available today a similar procedure will be applied, and I should add, and I think this should make Chief Minister Buthelezi's heart a little happier, in respect of foreign votes, where people have written in the IFP a similar procedure will be followed. Then we cannot, in terms of the Electoral Act, count those ballots, that is technically count them, but when ultimately we weigh up the total number of ballot papers in respect of which this shortcoming manifests itself, and the areas in which the shortcomings were prevalent, the IEC will be empowered in terms of the section that I have mentioned, Section 47, to take those technically spoilt ballot papers into account nevertheless. Whether that means that they will be taken at full count value or at a lesser value, I cannot tell you. That will depend upon the circumstances as we find them towards Saturday or Sunday this week, and in the second instance it will also depend upon the spread and the distribution of such spoilt ballots. I don't think I can make the point clearer than that and I hope it is now fully understood. [Unidentified official] First to Kaiser, then to that lady, as I have said. I have noted your hands. [Kaiser] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser from THE STAR. Now you told us yesterday that you had been in contact with Chief Minister Buthelezi virtually, in your words, on an hourly basis and that you have also spoken to the ANC's Cyril Ramaphosa and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer and they had raised complaints with you. You had also spoken to the Democratic Party. Have these parties been in contact with you today as well and have they also raised other complaints with you, which in your words, would seek to assail the integrity of the election? [Kriegler] Well, can I deal with the two barrels of the question separately? In the operations room or in a room adjacent to the National Operations Center of the IEC, in the building where I am sitting, there is a permanent representative body of the political parties with whom we are in continuous contact. They have the information that comes into the operations center at their disposal and I spent several hours with them during the tense period this morning. During the rest of the morning other representatives of the IEC are there. I have seen or spoken to, on the telephone today -- I would think probably half a dozen political leaders -- and generally, the communications have been concerns or complaints, if you wish, with regard to particular voting stations, particular features at particular voting stations, and that's the very purpose of having this continuous consultation. The complaints are noted. They will be taken into account in the eventual evaluation as to whether the elections were substantially free and fair, and of course, on the more immediate scale they are addressed as a matter of urgency by our operations center and our special emergency task force. [Official] I will now go over to the lady then I will come on this side on my right hand side. [Correspondent Marion Wilkinson] I'm Marion Wilkinson from THE AUSTRALIAN newspaper. Judge, just going back to the question of potential interference in the distribution of the ballot papers. You said that you had called in the Commissioner of Police. Could you tell us: Was there any specific evidence that prompted you to bring in the commissioner and was there any evidence of a criminal matter involved? [Kriegler] There was no evidence of any kind indicating a possible crime, save that one of the inferences that could be drawn from the shortage of ballot papers on such a widespread scale, was obviously that somebody had tampered with the supplies and that is why we, in consultation with the parties, decided: call in the most expert investigative branch in the country, namely the police, and ask them to pursue the matter. There was no clue, no specific pointer to criminality at all, let alone any particular kind. [sentence as heard] It was just one of the possible inferences to be drawn from the totality of the facts. [Official The gentleman here, second row. [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] Yes, I'm Sonny Raboch of Radio Nigeria. The events that....[pauses] In view of the number of ballot papers being printed now, is there likelihood that by tomorrow voting will not have stopped and looking at the situation where the IEC might say: Voting should continue on Friday. Will that be public holiday? [laughter] To what extent will the need to carry on voting affect the due process of electioneering here? [Kriegler] Well, you asked me two questions and the first is based on a premise with which I do not agree. I do not agree that there is any necessity to consider Friday as an additional voting day. The evidence as it stands at the moment indicates that the overwhelming majority of voters presented themselves at the voting stations today, and it is a question of supplying the ballot papers in sufficient numbers and speeding up the process sufficiently and stretching the hours sufficiently to accommodate them. With regard to the possible prejudice to the freeness and fairness of the election, the only feature that I can see is that possibly, electoral officers and presiding officers and other agencies of the IEC may become very tired but that's just the price we've got to pay for wanting to be part of this glorious experiment in democracy. [Official] The gentleman there. [Correspondent Enoch Sexwale] I'm Enoch Sexwale of NEW NATION. Judge, you've been saying all along that all was okay, you're ready for elections, and now we have this problem of the Inkatha sticker. Surely it's going to raise dust. It's amazing that in Katlehong where I now come from there are no ballot papers as yet. Can you be more specific? What went wrong? [Kriegler] Let's get a couple of things clear. I have made it abundantly clear from day one that this is a very, very difficult exercise. This election is unique in world history in that we are trying to conduct elections for an unknown number of people with an unknown distribution, any of whom can arrive at any voting station of their choice. We were certainly not so stupid as to think that that wasn't a very, very difficult exercise. Moreover, we had to provide infinitely more voting stations than this country has ever contemplated before and we had to do it largely with part-time, short-term employees. We never promised anybody a rose garden. I said from day one we will give you an adequate, respectable, election, not a 12 cylinder, super-charged election, you may remember my saying that. That still is the position. We have achieved an over 80 percent success rate as of today. I am satisfied with that although I readily accept and acknowledge that the millions of people who have not yet been able to vote may have a very, very different view on the matter. With regard to Katlehong your information is not up to date. They are voting in Katlehong right now. [Official] The lady at the top there, then I'll come down. I've noted your hands. [Correspondent Mel Jones] Judge Kriegler, it's Mel Jones from CBS News. In the districts where there were problems with the sticker for Inkatha, what was told to the voters in those districts, firstly. And secondly, is there any indication of how widespread this problem actually is? [Kriegler] I cannot tell you as I sit here what was told to the voters in any particular voting station. The presiding officers have instructions in a case such as that to record what their announcement was and how that announcement was carried through. That will have to be checked once the ballot papers and the reports from the voting stations come in. With regard to the distribution or breadth of voting stations in respect of which the stickers were still a problem today I cannot be specific. I have not got all of that reporting at my fingertips at the moment. What I can say is that is significantly less than yesterday. But of course, still more than it should have been. There should have been none. [Official] The gentleman over there. I've noted your hands. [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us what position Chief Buthelezi has taken on the sticker question? Has he threatened to pull out of the election? [Kriegler] He may well have done so. I have heard no such communication, and I may say that if the chief minister were to phone me or to speak to me, I would I am sure be able to satisfy him that the procedure upon which we have decided will not prejudice the IFP. [Official] The lady down here. [Unidentified correspondent] REUTERS News Agency. Judge, can you tell us approximately how many people have voted up to now? [Kriegler] No, I'm sorry I can't. [Official] The lady from SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] [Correspondent Karen Mugglestone-Melville] I'd like to know where is the position of the IFP on this ballot paper? Is it still at the bottom, or is it alphabetical order? [Kriegler] No, no. It is at the foot as it will be on the correct ballot papers bearing the affixed sticker. [Unidentified announcer] Gentleman at the top. [Correspondent Mike Suzman] Mike Suzman, FINANCIAL TIMES. You were saying earlier those ballot that don't have the Inkatha sticker properly fixed or written in will be put aside at polling stations and counted separately and then you will decide at a later stage how to tally those into the final count. Do you have any even rough estimates at this stage as to how many ballot papers that decision will affect? [Kriegler] I have no idea at the moment. I think what I can say with considerable confidence based on the last two days of troubleshooting is that it is likely to be considerably less than first alarm on the part of political parties would have one to believe. But the actual figures we haven't got at the moment and will not have until probably some time on Saturday. [Official] Question? [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you. Judge Kriegler I'm not quite sure whether you touched on this issue, but the likelihood that of technically invalid papers is this not going to invite cries of unfairness? Have you consulted with the leader of the IFP, Dr. Buthelezi, on this issue and what are his views? The fact that these technically invalid papers can be counted at less than full value, is that not an invitation to cries of unfairness? [Kriegler] Yes, and on the other hand it depends who cries the unfairness, because the ballot paper which has IFP written in it at the foot draws one particular party to the attention of the voter, and in terms of the act that paper is technically invalid. Similarly, in respect of foreign voting, where we have accepted for the purposes of the Section 47 consideration, ballot papers with IFP written in actually can be said to favor the IFP. We are not trying to squeeze anybody. We are not trying to benefit anybody. We are trying to run in difficult circumstances the freest and fairest election possible. [Correspondent] Has Dr. Buthelezi been consulted on this? What are his views? [Kriegler] No. He has not been consulted and there has been no reason to consult him. If there is an objection from the Inkatha Freedom Party that objection, in the terms in which it is put, will be fully investigated and if necessary will be canvassed with the IFP. But I suggest that we wait and see what actually transpires eventually. [Official] I will take one more question, ladies and gentlemen. The lady on the left. [Unidentfied correspondent] I would like to know how many cases are still outstanding in the electoral courts at the moment? [Kriegler] No ma'am, I need notice of that question. Quite frankly, I haven't got it at my fingertips. I think that you could get that information from our press office quite easily. [Offical] Ladies and gentlemen, I will give the gentleman there, because he has been trying, and the gentleman here has had two opportunities already. [sentence as heard] [Correspondent Stephen Laufer] Thank you very much. Stephen Laufer from the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler I wonder whether we can just come back to this business of the write-in for one more minute, and stretch your patience a bit. Why is it not possible to say immediately if there is an IFP write-in with an X against it it is counted as a valid vote? Is this a quantity thing? If there are a hundred thousand of these then you will start counting, if there are only twenty thousand they'll be regarded as spoiled papers? What is going to be the basis of your decision? [Kriegler] Quite clearly it isn't only a quantity thing? It's a distribution thing. It's a percentage thing. It is a general pattern thing. One will have to look at the thing from various angles, statistically, analytically, and eventually in common sense to see what does it add up to? Does it mean that in a particular voting district where the IFP got five percent of the votes which were not technically spoiled we should regard those that were filled in with the IFP which add up to five percent, as well? Do we take that as five percent? Do we look at what happened in the district next door? Do we look at what happened in the subregion generally? It is not a purely mathematical exercise. In terms of Section 47 of the act we've got to weigh a large number of circumstances. It may well be that very large numbers come in. As you say a hundred thousand, although I must say that would astound me. The likelihood is that it will be a very much lesser number than that. [Official] I would like to express our thanks to Judge Kriegler and to all of you. Our next update is planned for 7 o'clock this evening. [Kriegler] Thank you.
