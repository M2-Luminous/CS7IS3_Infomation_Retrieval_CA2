Li made his remarks at the closing session of a national education conference. On behalf of the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, Li called on the whole party and the people to contribute to the flourishing of China's educational sector. He said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and Premier Li Peng's keynote report to the conference contain the major strategy, policies and measures for the development of China's education, which show the party Central Committee and the State Council's determination to fight for and expectations for the progress of education. China, with a large population and as an economically underdeveloped country, conducts the world's largest-scale education program, the vice-premier said. Its investment in education cannot meet actual demands. "That will be a long-term contradiction," he said. Li said that China must start from its actual conditions and explore suitable ways to develop its education in a more effective way. The conference reaffirmed the objective that by the end of this century, China should realize universal nine-year compulsory education and elimination of illiteracy among the young and middle-aged. The vice-premier noted that the objective agrees with China's reality and he is confident at realizing the goal. He said that the work set by the objective constitutes the basis for improvement of the quality of the Chinese nation and one of the foundations of socialist modernization. He said that economic development in the 1990s will lay a better foundation for the development of education. At present, there are about 36 million illiterates among the young and middle-aged population in China. In recent years, about five million of illiterates have annually shaken off illiteracy. Li said that at this rate, it is possible that the illiterate population will disappear by the end of this century. He noted that difficulties in popularizing nine-year compulsory education lie in the rural areas, especially poverty-stricken regions. He called for efforts to cultivate qualified teachers and run normal schools well. He stressed special aid for the education of ethnic minority people. Li also said that China must promote vocational and adult education so as to provide opportunities for most young people to receive technical and professional training and to improve their cultural and professional capabilities. On the reform of the system of higher education, Li said that the universities administered by ministries and central departments should expand their services and increase majors. He called on adopting diversified forms in the management of universities, rational readjustment of the structure of the universities and raising of economic and social results. He also talked about ethnic education, increases in education funds and improvement of teachers' treatment. Today's conference was presided over by Ding Guangen, member of the party's Politburo.
