This frantic war exercise was conducted in the skies over Pochon, Kimchon, and Yongwol. Various squadrons from the U.S. bases in the Pacific and approximately 380 fighter bombers, assault planes, and observation planes of the U.S. and puppet Air Forces were mobilized massively. An E-3 early warning plane which flew from the Okinawa base, prowled about in the skies over Taejon, Umsong, Chechon, and Kunwi, and comprehensively commanded the squadrons which were mobilized in this provocative exercise for a war of northward invasion. This power-reeking war exercise was a game of fire aimed at examining the feasibility of an early warning plane's unified command over squadrons composed of different types of aircraft. On the same day, the South Korean puppets brought hundreds of heavily armed bandits to Mihyon-ri, Yanggu County, Kangwon Province of South Korea and deployed armored personnel carrier groups to Sojin-ri, Kosong County. On the same day, tens of armed helicopters flew to Mt.

Also, formations of C-130 transports flew to the skies over Pochon and Yonchon and massively dropped commandos of the puppet armed forces. These commandos frantically conducted an exercise aimed at launching surprise strikes against major targets on the Northern half of the Republic and inspired an atmosphere of war.
