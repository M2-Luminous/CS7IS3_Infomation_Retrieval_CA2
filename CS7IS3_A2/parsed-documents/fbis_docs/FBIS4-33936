Argentina's balance of trade for the first four months of 1994 produced a deficit of $2.4 billion, 380 percent greater than the deficit in the same period last year, according to Indec, the Institute of Statistics and Census. The figures published yesterday show that April's deficit was $556 million, which is slightly less than the deficits of $714 million, $525 million, and $609 million in January, February, and March respectively. Meanwhile, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said yesterday that the deficit wasn't worrisome, as one has to consider the `vigorous investments being carried out and the growth that this brings.' Cavallo said, however, that the deficit `will give rise to a lot of pressure from many sectors to restrict imports,' although he made it clear that the government would not go back on its liberalization policies. On the positive side, the Indec statistics also show that activity levels are growing, the investment rate is up, the consumption rate is down, and the national savings rate is increasing. The figures also show that the export of manufactured goods is increasing.

Between January and December 1991 a trade balance surplus of 3.7024 billion pesos was achieved; for the April to December 1991 period the surplus was 2.655 billion pesos. The trade balance deficit for 1992 was 2.8735 billion pesos; in 1993 3.6658 billion pesos; and 1.1133 billion pesos during the first two months of 1994. (Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 6) Inflation in May was 0.3 percent, bringing the annual rate for the year ending May 31 to 3.4 percent, the Indec census bureau said yesterday. Inflation last month was due mainly to the 4.5 percent rise in electricity and gas prices, which had a strong influence on the final figure. Prices have risen 0.8 percent so far in 1994. According to the same statistics, wholesale prices in May went up by 0.6 percent, while construction costs were up by 0.3 percent. As to retail prices, housing costs increased by 1.6 percent while health costs were up 0.8 percent, a rise caused mainly by the 1 percent rise in the cost of medicines. The price of housing equipment was up 0.6 percent, clothing was up by 0.5 percent, education 0.3 percent, and general goods and communications rose by 0.1 percent. The cost of food and beverages, which are usually a large part of a family's expenditure, were unchanged from the previous month, although the prices of some products went up: oranges up 10.6 percent, bananas up 4.2 percent, fresh cheese up 3.8 percent, and eggs up 3.4 percent. These were offset by a drop of 0.5 percent in meat prices. After 38 months of convertibility, prices have gone up generally by 54.2 percent.
