After they were sworn in, both officers ruled out controls on foreign exchange. They also said they intend to evaluate the assistance given to banks as well as the proposals made by Gustavo Roosen, special commissioner for financial reforms. FOGADE Director Norys Aguirre stressed her institution's duty to restore confidence in the financial system, and she said that currently the state is the greatest FOGADE contributor. She referred to strategies by the leadership of FOGADE by announcing reforms to the law that created this fund. [Begin Aguirre recording] Basically there are two strategies. One is the short-term strategy, and this is the immediate solution to the current banking crisis. The long-term strategy deals with reforms, and if these are needed I will be the first person to propose them, as I have done up to now, through Congress to the government, in due course. I am not afraid to make changes. If a complete FOGADE reorganization is needed, this will be done. [end recording] For his part, Tesalio Cadenas admitted that the General Bank Superintendency had faults that failed to prevent greater control--in other words, stricter control--of the Venezuelan financial system.
