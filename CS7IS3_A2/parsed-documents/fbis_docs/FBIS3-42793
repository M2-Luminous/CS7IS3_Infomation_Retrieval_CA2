This problem is bothering mainly Germany and Japan, which are eager to join the Security Council. It is above all a matter of prestige for them: These leading industrial powers, which have an immense economic and military potential, set the tone for the G-7, and have the status of leaders in Europe and Asia, are restricted politically because they do not have permanent membership on the Security Council. The solution to the problem is important to the FRG also because now Bonn cannot directly affect the policy of the international community, above all regarding the Bosnian conflict, which has flared up right at Germany's side. There is still the opinion that neither Germany nor Japan can be allowed on the UN Security Council, recalling the atrocities committed by these countries' armies during World War II. As for Japan, many of its neighbors in the region are torn by conflicts about its joining the "Big Five." Thus, for example, South Korea thinks that China's representation on the Security Council is clearly inadequate for such an immense continent as Asia. Therefore allowing the country of the Rising Sun onto the Security Council would be a benefit for Asians. On the other hand, this official position from Seoul is countered by the opinion of a considerable portion of South Korean society: In no case should Japan be allowed to solve problems related to world security. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already written, before Morihiro Hosokawa's speech at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York the South Koreans held a demonstration protesting Japan's admission to the Security Council. One of the demands was compensation and apologies to the victims of aggression on the Korean peninsula during World War II. Hosokawa made an apology. Germany too softened its position and began to court the world community for a leadership chair: Its second petition was worded much less ambitiously than the first one. True, the head of the foreign political department of the FRG, Klaus Kinkel, stipulated at the UN General assembly that it was not yet completely clear whether Germany would be able to play a more active role by assigning its troops for UN peacemaking operations. This question could become a stumbling block for Bonn. Because U.S. President Bill Clinton placed emphasis precisely on the more active participation of possible Security Council candidates in the peacemaking operations themselves and also in the financing of these and also UN structures. Although in response to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali the White House actually officially announced its support for the idea of the entry of the FRG and Japan into the Security Council. But it seems that the Americans need most of all to shift part of their burden onto the shoulders of Tokyo and Bonn. Having lost several dozen of their soldiers in Somalia and millions of dollars in the former Yugoslavia, and having the largest quota for payments into the UN budget, the United States, naturally, wants someone to share its burden. China's position is somewhat more restrained: In principle Beijing has nothing against accepting new members, but not in the foreseeable future. Great Britain, England, [as published] and Russia are of the same opinion. As a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, as of today Moscow sees its basic task as maintaining the effectiveness and efficiency which the UN Security Council has achieved in recent years. It is thought on Smolensk Street that any steps to expand it should be taken in stages. So this question will be decided, as the Russian diplomat stated, "not today or even tomorrow." To decide it, naturally, will take a consensus of the Big Five. Moreover, the report of the work group will not be submitted for consideration to the 49th session of the UN General Assembly until September.
