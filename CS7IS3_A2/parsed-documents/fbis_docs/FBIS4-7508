It is a credit to the French general that, in less than a week since he took up the command over UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], he came to visit Belgrade, minding the praiseworthy international procedures. As he nicely put it, he is a general assigned to deal with partners, rather than with enemies, a general who does not aspire to accomplish a personal victory, but rather to give support to his partners so they can find a peace settlement. Hardly any of the former UNPROFOR commanders has ever given such a precise definition of the essence and role of UN peace missions. Fatal Mistake No sooner did UNPROFOR start to recover, under the political leadership of the wise Akashi, who has a refined sense for most diverse currents, winds, changes of moon, high-tides, and low-tides in the Balkans, when the decision came from New York that Turkish blue helmets are to be sent to Bosnia. That is certainly not the first time that the international organization and community has complicated the already complicated-enough Balkan situation, and make the goal of its own mission even more difficult to achieve. That many of the 54 UN Security Council resolutions are absolutely unfeasible on the ground was stressed, more or less openly, by all the former military and political officials of the UN mission in Bosnia, because of which many of them consciously put an end to their careers. The mistakes made by the international community were subsequently assessed by many former foreign ministers, UN officials, and co-chairmen of the conferences on former Yugoslavia. The deployment of Turkish troops in the Balkans is one of those moves that confirm the theory about the intentions of making the conflict even more complicated at the moment when certain signs of its forthcoming conclusion have appeared. There are many reasons for believing that the deployment of Turkish UN troops in Bosnia is a great mistake. Five centuries of Turkish government left many traces all over the Balkans, and many people believe they are an indirect cause of the ongoing conflict. It seems that since the disintegration in former Yugoslavia began, the Balkan countries encumbered with a Turkish heritage have never been so unanimous as they are now, that the arrival of Turkish troops might cause the blaze of the conflict to spread to the entire region. The reactions of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have been almost identically severe, calling this decision a complete nonsense, a fatal mistake, and even the surrender of the United Nations to Turkish strategy. How undoable is the knot intertwining history and the present could best be seen in Athens, where the news from New York came in on a Greek national holiday. The celebration of the historic date of the Greek uprising against the Turkish dictatorship, and the decision that was made in New York on the Turkish reappearance in the Balkans, are a clear illustration of the two opposite ways of reasoning, two ways of thinking. It is not clear why the United Nations has given up the principle that it itself established as a basic guideline for its peace missions throughout the world. Notwithstanding the explanation that the Turkish troops will be wearing blue berets, by which the latest decision is being justified, the decision still violates the UN rule prescribing that the troops of neighboring countries, or countries that are historically discredited in a conflicting region are not to be sent for peace missions. It Will Be Difficult to Close the Door The participation of Russian troops in the UN peace mission is hardly comparable with the participation of Turkish troops. Russia, since recently called by the international news agencies "the traditional orthodox ally of Serbia and Greece," is neither a neighboring country, nor discredited in the Balkans as an occupying force. For that reason the Russian battalion has been participating in UNPROFOR from the very beginning, while their presence in the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] has never elicited any protests or criticisms on the part of the international public. Once the door is opened, it will be difficult to close it for other questionable guests: Italians, Austrians, Germans, Hungarians... and to keep them away from the yard where the historic curse allows too little tolerance, even for its inhabitants. It is now difficult to guess why and how Akashi and Butrus Butrus-Ghali have given up the prescribed rules. The insufficient number of peacekeeping troops for the hazardous operation in Bosnia is stated as one of the most decisive reasons. Why was then the good idea of deploying the Turkish troops in some other, more distant sites of UN operations, thereby leaving space for the deployment of some more neutral troops, abandoned so easily? What is the reason for stepping back on the path that leads to a dead end precisely at the moment when, for the first time, the international factors have discerned some light at the end of the tunnel? Encouraged by the favorable winds blowing from the East River, the Turkish Government has offered three times as much troops. Most probably, the number of troops will amount to 2,700, in contrast to the initially endorsed 1,000 troops. Ankara will spare neither men, nor means to reappear in the Balkans in as impressive numbers as possible. Does not the fact that all other nations are quite reluctant to commit their troops to the Bosnian adventure, while Turkey is so eager to take the risk, provoke suspicion and doubts? It does, and even the most extreme suspicions, such as that expressed by a Greek minister, who compared the deployment of Turkish peace keeping troops with a wolf used for guarding sheep. All in vain, since nobody is paying attention to the morals of so many Bosnian fables, stories, poems, proverbs, and above all riddles dating back from Turkish times.
