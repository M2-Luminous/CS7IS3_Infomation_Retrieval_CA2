Under the Constitution, "every citizen of the Russian Federation, if his convictions in the matter of faith contradict with military service.... has the right to substitute it with an alternative civil service." (Article 59, Item 3). In the meantime there is still no law on alternative service (as, naturally, there is no alternative service itself), and any youth of draft age may turn to the president and demand that his constitutional rights be observed, and demand the right not to serve at all because "objectors" protected by the Constitution are not called up today for alternative service. If things continue this way, the number of those wanting to capitalize on the "flawed" legislation may snowball by the time of the autumn draft. The State Duma committees on public organizations and defense have prepared two alternative drafts on alternative service. The man in charge of the first one, Vitaliy Savitskiy, chairman of the subcommittee on religious organizations and cochairman of the Russian Christian Democratic Union, said on his arrival in St. Peterburg that an agreement has been reached with Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov to merge both drafts -- the result would be passed on to the Duma for consideration. But how does one combine them when they differ in their approach right from the start? For example, the draft Mr. Savitskiy is in charge of and which was developed by a group led by Anatoliy Pchelintsev, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, and Vladimir Rikhovskiy, director of the Christian Juridical Center, is remarkable for a much more liberal approach. It is doubtful that the "defense people" will easily agree with the articles of their "rivals'" draft, but Mr. Savitskiy looks to the future with optimism: The Defense Committee, whose draft he thinks looks "rather raw," is simply up the creek. A further non-passage of the law may simply result in a disruption of the autumn draft on quite legal grounds, let us note. All this makes the Defense Committee work together with the authors of the first draft if only it nears the main goal -- the passing of the law as soon as possible. If the new committees really manage to produce a joint draft, it is not ruled out that the law on alternative service would be passed by the Duma rather quickly. Those in the Defense Committee realize that procrastination is fraught with a disruption of the new draft for an army which is thinning out as it is, whereas the committee on relations with religious organizations hopes that, in addition to everything else, the new law would humanize the army. "With its passage the army chiefs would have to try and see that the horrors of military service do not make draftees seek alternative service," the subcommittee head, Mr. Savitskiy, thinks. "Conditions of army service should not be worse that working in hospitals, and then the only ones who would try to get into the ranks of alternative servicemen would be those who cannot take up arms for their convictions."
