Ataman told a weekly press conference that the UN secretary general had authorized the alliance to carry out air strikes not only to protect Gorazde, but Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Bihac and Sarajevo. "Even though it's late, we regard this initiative as a positive and useful step," Ataman said. Ataman pointed out that UN Resolutions 824 and 836 had empowered the UN secretary general to make such a demand. "An urgent initiative to be taken by NATO in line with this call is necessary to protect the organization's respectability, effectiveness and deterrence," he concluded.
