Kolpakov, President of International Metallurgist Union] [Text] On 24 July 92, the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice registered the charter of the International Metallurgist Union, and this date became the official birthday of the new public association. During several months preceding this event, the group of sponsors and the coordination council made a great effort in learning the metallurgists' opinions about the expediency of merging into a union and its likely tasks, status, and functions. These efforts culminated in the founding congress held on March 27,1992 in Lipetsk which unanimously adopted the resolution to set up the union and discussed its charter and management bodies. The adoption of this resolution was prompted by the actual situation characterized by the negative consequences of disrupted economic links and the breakup of a single metallurgical complex into components. The output volumes of the principal types of production throughout metallurgical enterprises of CIS countries in 1992 decreased by 17-24%. This drop in production continued in 1992 and in relation to 1991 at Russian Federation enterprises amounted to 12.5% for steel and 15% for rolled products. The situation in ferrous metallurgy in Ukraine and Kazakhstan is no better. In nonferrous metallurgy in the former USSR republics, the drop in production in 1991 amounted to 7.7% for primary aluminum and 30.6% for secondary aluminum, 24.4% for refined copper, 14.4% for nickel, 24.\1% for zinc, and 19% for rolled nonferrous metals. The unavoidable metal product price rise (by 26.5 times during the first nine months of 1992) proceeded in a jump-like fashion without correlation with production costs, which aggravates the gap between the financial position of the enterprises even further and forces many of them to limit wage increases, cut back production staff, and lose skilled personnel. The long-range metallurgy development plans produced earlier with a balanced coordination among the subindustries and at a territorial level lost their real basis when the former union republics became sovereign. The metallurgists understand that it would be unreasonable simply to discard them and forget. A joint search for new nontraditional decisions is necessary. The database support for the enterprises in the fields of production, science and engineering, and economic situation in the industry and at the enterprises is continuously shrinking, which is fraught with unpredictable consequences even for the most well-meaning initiatives of individual enterprises to expand their production. At any moment, they may find themselves without supplies of the necessary ferroalloys, billets, and refractory and other materials. At the founding congress which gathered representatives from many enterprises, scientific research institutes, and metallurgical organizations from all regions and a number of CIS countries, an unambiguous admission was made that their separation is a serious obstacle on the road to overcoming the crisis and further developing the industry. We need a unification vehicle which would not repeat former command administrative links but would be consistent with today's principles of independent economic activity under the conditions of market relations. The historical experience and today's foreign practices attest that such associations are possible and are already successfully functioning and justifying the hopes of their founders and members. The Society of German Metallurgists founded in 1860 is one of the oldest in the world. According to its charter, its objectives are assisting in the technical, scientific-technical, and engineering efforts in the field of pig iron, steel, and associated material production. Using its own resources, this society is carrying out a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering research, ensures legal protection of their findings, assists young workers in increasing their skill levels, and carries out expert (arbitration) activity in its sphere. Because of its practical activities, the society has acquired a good reputation, its opinion is taken into account by the government in adopting resolutions pertaining to German metallurgy, and its influence in the structures of the European community is noticeable. The rapid development of the industry, power generation, and mining in the second half of the 19th Century in Russia necessitated the development of societies with a professional orientation. Russian technical and physical-chemical societies were formed and several years later--the Russian Metallurgical Society and a number of others. Large regional associations of engineering and technical personnel sprang up. The societies did not limit themselves to educational and information dissemination activity but carried out extensive organizational work and defended the interests of the society members in various spheres. They took coordinated positions, e.g., in the issues of providing industrial credits and securing government orders for domestic enterprises, the development outlook of the iron ore and bituminous coal base in the new industrial regions of the country, involvement of foreign capital and protection from foreign competition, and improvement in the working conditions in the mining and metallurgical industry and the status of workers and their insurance. The activity of the Russian Metallurgical Society is directly related to the names of such prominent metallurgists as Chernov, Kurako, Grum-Grzhimaylo, and Pavlov who exerted significant influence on the development of the metallurgical production science and practices. The authority of the newly developed International Metallurgist Union includes enterprises and organizations in the metallurgical industry in CIS countries; collective (enterprises and organization) and individual members from these as well as other foreign countries may join it. This is a public organization which unites on a voluntary basis engineers, scientists, experts, production managers, and social work organizers in the metallurgical and mining industries. In its activity, the union is guided by Russian Federation legislation and international legal standards and the legislation of the states which house union departments, as well as its own charter. The union provides representation and protects the interests and rights of its members before the authorities and assists in effectively utilizing the most recent achievements of science and engineering in order to increase the ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy production quality and competitiveness. Union functions include drafting and submitting to government bodies proposals on issues of metallurgical and mining industry development strategy, international division of labor which is based on carrying out the necessary research, expert examinations, and assessments of domestic and world trends. Another important form of activity is supplying union members with scientific and engineering and other types of information, conducting exhibits, seminars, and symposia, and helping to improve business skills. The principal governing bodies--the union council and auditing committee--were elected at the founding congress. The Council of the International Metallurgist Union began its practical activity immediately after its election by the congress. In the initial phase, the sponsoring group consisting of the council members was forced to carry out extensive work on formalizing in an established order the charter documents and registering the charter at the Justice Ministry. For greater promptness, a council presidium consisting of 17 members and six standing committees were set up from among council members at the first meeting; the standing committees deal with the structural and economical reorganization; modernization development strategy and engineering progress; social problems; finance and economics; juridical and legal affairs; and relations with mass media. One more committee--on foreign economic relations--was recently set up. The structure of the union and its regional organizations is still being formed while negotiations on cooperation with other public organizations, foreign representatives, and companies are underway. Relationships with the organizations which form the metal products market, i.e., trading houses, brokerage associations, and the Roskontrakt Russian contracting authority are being established. Proposals to set up specialized banks for servicing the market for metals and raw materials for their production are in a preparatory stage. Today, we have reached the stage in the union operation where it is necessary to concentrate the intellectual potential of the scientists and experts on generating proposals to bring metallurgy from the critical condition and find ways and forms of their realization through management bodies. I would like to outline several problems on which the International Metallurgist Union (MSM) is currently working and which, in our opinion, are especially urgent. The problem of shipments under intrabranch cooperation is very acute. For many decades, the metallurgical industry has developed under the conditions of rigid economic relations and has formed a single technological and economic complex. Many enterprises are rather narrowly specialized, so the exchange of metal products among the regions has been carried out on a scale measured in tens of millions of tons, most of which was made up by billets for subsequent conversion into rolled products, pipes, and hardware. Today, these cooperation links are disrupted. The emerging metals market does not yet have the necessary structures and attributes and does not create favorable conditions for trading relations. On the contrary, bereft of reasonable controls allowing for the objective factors through a differentiated taxation system, customs duties, and quotas, our market has opened up a broad avenue for large-scale export of conversion metal to noncontiguous foreign countries and made it unprofitable to ship it to enterprises inside Russia and to CIS countries. The International Metallurgist Union is promoting an initiative to correct this situation. We need a new approach which would ensure that the enterprises have incentives to ship billets to conversion plants first and foremost. The first problem is directly related to the second--the metallurgical enterprises' incentive to improve the quality of end products and expand its production for shipment to the world market. Today, trading involves primarily metal with a low degree of readiness: pig iron, scrap metal, and blanks. Yet even quality types of production are often sold at prices 30% below those in the world market. One of the reason is the fact that this production lacks quality certificates issued by specialized companies, as is the case with foreign practices. In recent years, work on developing certification centers in Russia was undertaken by the ``Sapem-sertifikat'' Joint Stock company, one of those founders is the International Metallurgist Union. In October 1992, Russia's State Standard Board gave ``Sapem-sertifikat'' the authority and entrusted it with the functions of the central body of the certification system for a group of similar goods among which metal products play a prominent part. Cooperation in this field with known foreign companies has already begun. The union intends to expand these efforts in the framework of the functions stipulated by the charter aimed at improving the metal products export efficiency by adopting a number of governmental resolutions dealing with allocation of quotas, export, re-export and licensing rules, etc. Supplying metallurgy with secondary raw material has always posed a complex problem here. Today, the situation became simply catastrophic. The enterprises and individual persons are no longer interested in turning in scrap metal while large quantities of scrap metal already procured are exported, primarily its most valuable and scarcest types. Scrap purchasing and processing enterprises were left without the resources necessary for reproducing fixed capital and guaranteeing current operations. A real danger has developed that secondary metal enterprises may pass to the hands of private persons who will increase scrap exports. Today, dramatic measures are necessary for effectively utilizing this very valuable type of raw material which, in essence, is a part of the national treasury. In our opinion, a special resolution must be made in this regard at a governmental or presidential level, and we are actively pursuing these goals. Special commissions have been set up for examining the situation and drafting proposals. Metallurgy in CIS countries is in need of serious modernization. The strategy which was developed earlier for this purpose is largely unacceptable today due to a change in the role of the state, forms of property, and economic activity of enterprises. The International Metallurgist Union intends to discharge its state obligations of comprehensively assisting metallurgy modernization in Russia and other CIS countries. Mindful of how stressed state budgets are, we think that it is possible to find new approaches to financing this metallurgy modernization by combining it with certain state support. We are talking about setting up an off-budget technological development and modernization fund whose draft proposal has been prepared and approved by the International Metallurgist Union council. Our metallurgy has been developing largely on the basis of scientific developments from domestic scientific research institutes whose scientific output is highly regarded throughout the world. Due to the lack of state financial support, the metallurgical science has found itself today in an extremely difficult situation. We think that it is possible to extricate ourselves from it by setting up national scientific ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy centers on the basis of existing scientific research institutes. The International Metallurgist Union may take the initiative to develop large industry-wide metallurgy modernization programs with the participation of these centers. The off-budget R&D fund may become the financial basis of these efforts; it is expedient to form this fund through withholdings from the cost of metallurgical production. An industry-wide specialized commercial bank which would provide specific and beneficial credits for measures aimed at modernizing enterprises and developing capacities for manufacturing competitive products should be set up. Obviously, it is expedient to obtain long-term interest-free credits, e.g., from Russia's Central Bank or the government for shortening the initial period necessary to develop the financial basis for metallurgical modernization. In discharging its function of legal protection for its members, the International Metallurgist Union will also continue to give them legal support in resolving internal points of contention. To this end, an International Metallurgist Union arbitration tribunal has been set up which, on beneficial terms and in a short time span, will consider all cases submitted to it. It is important that while possessing professional skills in the field of metallurgy, the arbitration tribunal is called upon to find ways to reconcile the parties and reduce the claimant outlays related to the consideration of their cases. Needless to say, several months of the International Metallurgist Union activity is a relatively short time for preparing and especially implementing serious measures. The union is in its formative stages, and new members are still joining it. We are not indifferent to the future membership makeup of the organization. We are trying to ensure that it is replenished with authoritative and skilled experts and production leaders characterized by the pride in their work and responsible attitude to the future of the industry. During the past months, many leaders and prominent experts from metallurgy enterprises in CIS countries, scientific research institute staff, employees of concerns, Roschermet Corporation, the stock market, trading houses, and certain state departments and trade unions have become union members. We are hoping that the union will continue to expand further by admitting engineering, technical, and scientific personnel in the metallurgical and mining industries who are committed to their profession and will form the intellectual potential of the organization; realization of this potential will help solve complicated issues of bringing metallurgy out of the critical state and ensuring its future balanced developed. Approximately 50 enterprises in organizations from six CIS countries which include large integrated iron and steel works, specialized plants, scientific production associations, institutes, and associations have already joined the International Metallurgist Union as collective members. Requests have been received about membership terms from several companies from noncontiguous foreign countries. It is important to ensure that this process continues. Speaking about expanding our membership, we must clearly proceed from the principle that the union needs enterprises and organizations as the basis for its functioning while collective members need the union as the organization capable of affecting the resolution of contradictions arising due to the new realities of life. It is necessary to emphasize that the newly developed metallurgist union does not claim to supplant the functions of existing management structures, including metallurgy committees. Our primary intention is to assist all union members in various states in establishing close contacts on the basis of common and mutual interests. Whenever possible, we will undertake to solve the problems which are unusual to the new structures but have preserved or acquired urgency. The guiding principle of interaction with the authorities is mutual respect and assistance and the ability to complement each other. Not the ambitions but cooperation in the name of normal viability and development of industries, enterprises and organizations must become the cornerstone of this activity.
