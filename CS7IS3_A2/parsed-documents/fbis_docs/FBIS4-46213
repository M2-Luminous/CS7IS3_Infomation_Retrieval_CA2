Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, former deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces and member of the Dialogue Commission, by unidentified reporter on 19 May; from the "KL Radio News" newscast -- recorded] [Excerpts] Reporter: Good morning General, we would like to hear your opinion on the attack on the security guards of FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] Deputy Nidia Diaz [nom de guerre of Maria Concepcion Valladares de Sosa]. Vargas: [passage omitted] The fact that this is the second attack on this same person, specifically this same security guard, is strange. I believe this should be thoroughly investigated and that the weight of the law should fall upon those who are responsible, so that the exemplary punishment can dissuade others from acting the same way within Salvadoran society. Reporter: Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the political connotations that this attack could have. As member of the Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the Chapultepec Agreements how do you view these actions against a party like the FMLN which recently entered the country's political life? Vargas: As I said.... [pauses] although I did not say it directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the attack was against the same person, the same security guard who was attacked the first time. As you said, this incident warrants a thorough investigation, as it could have other connotations. Attacks that could occur at a given time which could be directly or indirectly related to political groups should be rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all political parties. [passage omitted] This case should be given more attention because there could be factors that are not political, which if not properly investigated can have repercussions in the political field, which of course would be totally undesirable.
