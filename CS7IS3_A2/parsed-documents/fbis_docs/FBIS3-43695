Nigeria's chief of defence staff, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, signed the agreement on behalf of the head of state, General Sani Abacha, while Captain S.K. Cumba, the Sierra Leonean under-secretary of state for defence, signed for his country. Abubakar said the accord was in line with Nigeria's policy of making Africa the centre-piece of its foreign policy as well as with the objectives of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Organisation of African Unity. "Equally, it will foster the attainment of mutual collective security system for the defence of the West African sub-region, in particular, and the continent of Africa in general," he said. Cumba said his country requested the military assistance as part of its efforts to battle rebels in its eastern border areas. Nigeria sent troops to Sierra Leone last year to help the government battle a rebel offensive.
