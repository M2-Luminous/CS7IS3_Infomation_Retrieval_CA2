Together with his three companions, he was forced to spent the night at the airport as the Slovene immigration officials would not allow him entry. In light of the experiences of his latest visit, Zhirinovskiy is supposedly persona non grata in our country. Zhirinovskiy lodged a protest with the immigration organs, while the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana has not reacted so far. The Slovene border officials would not allow members of the press to come in contact with Zhirinovskiy. He is supposed to return to Moscow at 1355 today on a regular flight of the Russian carrier Aeroflot. [passage omitted]
