Venkatachalam] [Text] India's policy of developing nuclear energy for purely peaceful purposes remains without any change. When the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, in his address at the All-India Congress Committee [AICC] session a few days ago ruled out India unilaterally giving up the nuclear option, he was only restating the existing policy. The reiteration of the policy, however, is important because of pressures coming from two contrary directions. On the one hand, the weapon-possessing members of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], particularly the United States, want India to join the NPT, renouncing the right to make the nuclear weapons forever. Their conception of a strange club in which the haves and have-nots ever remain separate is, of course, not acceptable to India. The NPT is due to come up for review next year. If and when the review takes place, India's attempt will be to make the treaty a nondiscriminatory instrument to promote global nuclear disarmament. The other source of pressure on our nuclear policy is from developments in the neighborhood. Pakistan has not made a secret of its efforts to acquire the nuclear weapon. In fact, this development is made use of by the United States as an argument to persuade India into giving up its option to use nuclear energy for defense purposes. By coincidence, about the time of the AICC session came also the news of China having carried out another nuclear test. The NPT does not come in the way of the five weapon haves, who are permanent members of the UN Security Council, from adding to their nuclear arsenals. It is not surprising that the disturbing international environment should persuade even sections within the country to demand a change of the policy of purely peaceful use of nuclear energy. The prime minister's statement indicated that the government will not give in to such demands. The prime minister underlined the fact that the country has been having a consistent policy on the nuclear issue. The first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and defense minister, Mr. V.K. Krishnamenon, had clearly stated this policy at a Congress session in 1953, much before India carried out the implosion experiments. This policy remains valid. The prime minister made it clear that the government would watch the trends and developments on global disarmament in exercising its options. He said, quote: We have the choice of making or not making the bomb. I do not want to leave that option. Unquote. In this connection, it should be noted that the nuclear situation today is complex. While some countries are in possession of the nuclear bomb, some others are in the process of acquiring it. But a large number of countries do not have any nuclear capability at all. The developing global trend has to be watched. To those who advocate the manufacture of the nuclear weapon, Mr. Rao aptly replied that if we make the bomb and the world tomorrow decides in favor of total disarmament, then what will we do? The thrust of India's international policy is to promote disarmament and outlaw the use of nuclear weapons by all nations. India had put forward concrete suggestions for nuclear disarmament at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1988. The stage-by-stage disarmament proposal presented to the UN by Rajiv Gandhi called for the conclusion of a new global treaty, eliminating all nuclear weapons by the year 2010 to replace the NPT. Even by the end of the first stage in 1994, much more was expected of the nuclear weapon powers in the sphere of disarmament than what has been achieved so far. Mr. Narasimha Rao had followed it up with the demand for urgent measures to spread nuclear nonproliferation at the Security Council summit held in 1992. The conference of Nonaligned foreign ministers at their meeting in Cairo recently, acting on a proposal made by India, called for a special session of the UN General Assembly for a comprehensive assessment on the progress toward disarmament. The directions of India's policies are clear. We are for peace and we cannot accept nuclear subservience.
