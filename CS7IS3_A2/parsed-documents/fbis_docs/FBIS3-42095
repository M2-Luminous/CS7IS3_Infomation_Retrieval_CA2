Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq, told reporters after talks with senior Iraqi officials that "there are definitely different assessments" concerning the surveillance programme. "There are still some question marks, and we have been working on them with some, but not complete, success during these talks," Ekeus said before leaving for Kuwait. Ekeus, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, held talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq 'Aziz, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf and General 'Amir Muhammad Rashid, head of the military industrialization organization. In a joint statement, Ekeus and Aziz said both sides "expressed their readiness to expedite the process of establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of goodwill." They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to report to the UN Security Council "that, in their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Ekeus said he tried to emphasise in his talks with Iraqi leaders the "political ambiance" surrounding the clause. He was referring to the position of certain UN Security Council members, notably the United States, which oppose any lifting of the oil embargo until Baghdad recognises the sovereignty of Kuwait and improves its policy toward the Moslem Shiite and Kurdish minorities in Iraq. Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary Riyad al-Qaysi, who spoke at a news conference with Ekeus Sunday, said Iraq had "implemented all that is required" under the clause. However, last week U.S. President Bill Clinton said Iraq still had a long way to go toward compliance with the Gulf war ceasefire conditions, despite Baghdad's acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 715 in November, which called for long-term weapons monitoring. The joint statement issued by Ekeus and 'Aziz said the "intense phase" of UN inspections would continue, and Iraq had "indicated that it would welcome all such inspection teams and facilitate their tasks." The two sides discussed technical matters in a "professional and business-like manner," the statement said, and their talks "yielded positive results." They agreed to hold a further round of talks in the first half of March to maintain the momentum in the disarmament process. In the hope of obtaining an end to the embargo, Baghdad is cooperating with efforts to dismantle programmes for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, which are banned under the UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. On Friday, IAEA officials said they would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated fuel next week and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites. The joint statement said Iraq and the United Nations had "built on the significant progress" made since last July, when the two sides discussed the possibility of lifting the oil embargo. Iraq meanwhile reiterated its rejection of a plan to sell some of its oil under UN control. Under UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, Iraq is allowed to sell up to 1.6 billion dollars' worth of oil for six months under international supervision. The proceeds must be used to buy food and medical supplies, fund UN activities in Iraq, and pay war damages.
