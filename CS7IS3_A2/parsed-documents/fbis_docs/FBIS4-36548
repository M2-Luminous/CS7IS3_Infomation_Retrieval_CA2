This came in a message from 'Amr Musa to Christopher on this resolution. Musa clarified that the objectives of this conference are to immediately apply the cease-fire and to put an end to all military activities under the supervision of the peace-keeping forces. In addition, the other objectives are to turn Bosnia-Herzegovina into a safe-haven and guarantee that the regional borders and sovereignty are not harmed. MENA has learned that Musa sent a similar message to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, about the extensive efforts Egyptian diplomacy is exerting to support the Bosnian cause.
