A police spokesman, Colonel Raymond Dowd, said the police met a delegation under the chairmanship of the Western Cape ANC Chairman Dr. Allan Boesak this afternoon to discuss the incident. Col. Dowd said that the actions of the Internal Stabiity Unit should not be condemned before the outcome of the investigation was known. Earlier Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel called in the help of the UN Observer Mission in South Africa in an attempt to protect the credibility of the police. Mr. Kriel said that he had asked the mission to make UN observers available on a 24-hour basis, to accompany the police on any law enforcement duties involving entering the premises of any political party or organization. The ANC has termed the raid on its Cape Town offices brutal and has called for the resignation of Mr. Kriel. The ANC demanded answers as to why the raid had taken place and what disciplinary steps would be taken against policemen responsible for alleged insults.
