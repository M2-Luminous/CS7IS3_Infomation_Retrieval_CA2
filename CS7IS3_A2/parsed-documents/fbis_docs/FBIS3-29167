The premier relayed his desire to meet on Tuesday afternoon with LDP President Kono through Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Mori told a news conference. But Kono and Mori rejected the offer for an informal one-on-one session because they agreed this is not the time for such a meeting, Mori said. The LDP secretary general cited as a reason for the party's refusal to comply with the request the start on Wednesday of Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 ending March 31. "It may affect the morale of our party ranks if the two meet and talk secretively together on the eve of Diet debate at its plenary sessions," Mori said. He said he conveyed to Takemura that the LDP may agree on a Kono-Hosokawa summit once the extra budget, intended to boost the languishing Japanese economy, clears the Diet. Hosokawa and Kono met on February 2 along with their respective associates to exchange views mainly on the slumping economy and strained economic relations with the United States.
