Thus, the fundamental law of the Crimean Republic from 6 May 1992 was restored on the territory of the peninsula. In this way, the deputies ignored an appeal by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, asking them not to take such a dangerous step aimed at encroaching upon Ukraine's territorial integrity. (?As early as yesterday), Crimean President Meshkov asked the deputies to temporarily suspend the debate on this issue. Deputies, however, did not listen. Arguments in favor of restoring the constitution in its previous form were voiced at the session, mainly referring to the Crimean people's [word indistinct] and will expressed during a presidential poll. It was emphasized that a return to the previous constitution does not mean Crimea's secession from Ukraine. Article (?11) of the constitution from 6 May 1992 states that the Crimean Republic is a part of Ukraine, and that its relations with Ukraine are based on agreements and treaties. The law of the Crimean Republic on restoring the constitutional foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood was adopted without including it on the agenda; 69 out of 83 deputies present at the session voted for adopting it. The session also appointed a delegation for talks with the Ukrainian Supreme Council.
