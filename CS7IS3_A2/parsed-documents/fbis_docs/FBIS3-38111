He followed the crisis and reshuffle from Doha, Islamabad, Lahore and Damascus by telephoning President Busquin and his advisers every day. They also sent him a daily press review. He gave us an interview before his departure from Damascus. [Hislaire] Are you satisfied by the reshuffle? [Urbain] Yes, in so far as I am still combining responsibility for Foreign Trade and European Affairs at the federal level. Combining the two ministries has definite advantages, because Belgium embodies Europe for most of the countries I visited. That is also why I met the amir of Qatar and the president of Pakistan. And if his son had not died accidentally a few days earlier, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad would have received me also. [Hislaire] Could such a role be carried out by a foreign trade minister representing Wallonia or Flanders? [Urbain] I do not think so. Someone said to me that he knew Belgium well because it is next to France. People can locate our country, but they cannot locate our regions yet. A federal foreign trade minister is indispensable for the macroeconomic approach to bilateral trade, in order to provide support to export companies. [Hislaire] Were you disappointed not to be asked to succeed Come as deputy prime minister? [Urbain] No. I am not disappointed at all because I asked for nothing. The reshuffle unites experience with the fresh energy that others are contributing. It is neither provisional nor transitional, although the three "Guys" are not definitively excluded from participating in government later. [Hislaire] And the crisis within your party? [Urbain] That is an excessive assessment. There has been no split within the national committee of the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party]. It is true that there is a malaise in public opinion, which would like to know what is true or false in the accusations made both by the investigating magistrate and by the rumors or witnesses. I share this feeling. The truth must emerge as quickly as possible in a totally transparent way. The guilty -- if there are any -- must be prosecuted without indulgence. Beyond the Agusta affair -- it would be wrong to forget this -- lies the death of a man, Andr Cools.
