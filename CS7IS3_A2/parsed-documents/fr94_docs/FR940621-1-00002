FR940621-1-00002 FR940621-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 93&hyph;122&hyph;1] Animal Export Inspection Facilities AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' regulations by establishing additional standards for export inspection facilities. This action would ensure that all export inspection facilities have running water and water drainage systems, storage areas, and telephone. This action would also require facilities where horses are inspected to have walkways in front of stalls and ceiling height adequate for horses. We are also proposing to require that animals intended for export be inspected within 24 hours of embarkation and to make a minor language change to the regulations for the sake of clarity. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;122&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Najam Faizi, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 762, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8383. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations state, among other things, that all animals, except animals being exported to Canada or Mexico, must be exported through designated ports of embarkation. To receive designation as a port of embarkation, a port must have export inspection facilities available for the inspection, holding, feeding, and watering of animals prior to exportation to ensure that the animals meet certain requirements specified in the regulations. To receive approval as an export inspection facility, the regulations provide that a facility must meet the specified standards in ยง91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspection implements, cleaning and disinfection, feed and water, access, testing and treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and office and rest room facilities.
