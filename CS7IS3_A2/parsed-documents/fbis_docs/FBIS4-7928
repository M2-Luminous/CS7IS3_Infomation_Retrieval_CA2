She said that Klaus' visit to Moscow on April 4-5 clearly showed that the premier had to "strongly reassess his initial stands," although outwardly Klaus acted in Moscow sovereignly and with self- confidence and even with the attitude of a Western and successfully developing country which could teach its less advanced neighbor how economic reform should be carried out. What is essential, however, is that Klaus has came to realize at last that Czech Republic's economy cannot do without the Russian markets which it had light-heartedly abandoned, and without Russian raw materials, she said. The communists therefore perceived Klaus' Moscow talks not so much as a triumph of the Czech economy but rather as Klaus' and his government's victory over themselves, she added. To present Klaus' Moscow talks to the public as a move towards a successful completion of an agreement on the repayment of Russian debts towards the Czech Republic is merely a concealing maneuver, Zezulkova said, adding that the KSCM was apprehensive about the Russian repayments of the debt being used to "fill the holes" in the Czech state budget. KSCM economic expert Jiri Dolejs said that not only Russians should be blamed for Czech claims towards Russia in the two countries' post-November 1989 trade. He said this was also caused by the Czech Republic's deliberate cutting off all its former trade ties and by a new division of Europe. The new division of Europe is not merely the invention of Russian ultra nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Dolejs said.
