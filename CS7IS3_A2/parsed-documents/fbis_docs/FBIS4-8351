Why is the leadership of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] -- a party that wants to present itself as a careful center party -- demanding a radical step like a complete and almost immediate stop of the privatization process? [Surjan] This proposal is nothing else but to encourage some thoughtfulness. We are not particularly happy if a state enterprise is sold at a price that is four times higher than the declared price, like in the case of the Budapest Kozert because, in this case, the real value can be even ten times higher than the original price. The KDNP views on privatization are different from those of the other two coalition partners, but this in itself should not lead to the breaking of our friendship. The symbolic break of a few weeks in signing contracts between the last day of the current Parliament and the first day of the new Parliament can also be interpreted as a gesture to the Hungarian parliamentary life. However, I hope that no one will see the KDNP as a party that denies the need for privatization. [passage omitted] [Reti] When it became clear that, contrary to its bigger coalition partner, the KDNP is basing its campaign on criticism, rather than mainly on the embellishment of the past four years, you often declared that you accept as much from the past as your share in the coalition. What is the acceptable one-seventh of the coalition of Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]-Smallholders' Party- KDNP? [Surjan] One could also put this question even more nastily, namely whether we accept everything that is good and nothing that is bad. If the activity of this coalition is ever analyzed objectively, and not in the heat of the election campaign, the balance will clearly be positive. Take, for example, the poverty issue. The poorest 20 percent of Hungarian society has advanced as much as the richest 10 percent since 1988. The percentage of welfare expenses related to the GNP increased from 14 percent to 18 percent. Obviously, we had to withdraw these funds from production, and if we want a lasting development in the next four years, we will have to rethink the welfare distribution as well. [passage omitted] [Reti] According to opinion polls that you do not value too highly, the KDNP was at the top in the fall of 1993. At that time the party "signed up" big names like former finance minister Ferenc Rabar, industry minister Janos Latorcai, and state secretary Pal Becker. Your party's popularity has been dropping since then. Have you, perhaps, started the campaign too early? [Surjan] I would not like to send the "message" to opinion pollsters that I do not appreciate them, but it is a fact that they regarded us at around 2 percent in the previous elections. If the KDNP again gets three times as much as the "predicted" 4-8 percent, we will be in quite a good position. As for the early campaign, we had quite a good publicity in the fall of 1993; then, when our ways parted with the MDF, the KDNP began receiving less publicity in the media. Television reports on the party and me were not aired, and important events in the party were not reported, or were reported insufficiently. All this is reflected in the opinion polls. [passage omitted] [Reti] However, the KDNP has a good chance to overcome the changes. None of the parliamentary parties rejects the KDNP as a possible partner. As for your economic program -- a "not hasty" privatization and a "social sensitivity" -- it mostly resembles that of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. However, so far, KDNP leaders have only answered with disdain to the MSZP approaches and mentioned their "quilted jacket" past. [Surjan] I can only rejoice at any common elements in any party's program, because this increases the chances of implementing these programs. However, the quilted jacket is a symbol, a symbol of the organization that continues to live in the MSZP and thus, it is a continuation of the Hungarian Communists' Party [MKP] and the Hungarian Workers' Party [MDP], but has not apologized for their crimes. At the same time, the MSZP is one of the most complex parties: It includes the national-populist Tabajdi, Annus, and Szuros, who played a positive role in the past too, but I do not know how they will be able to cooperate with the Hajdu-group; nor do I know how the liberal wing close to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will cooperate with the Sandor Nagy-group. In principle, a social democratic party is capable of partnership with both liberal and socialist parties. Therefore, this is not a principled rejection. But, the way many people questioned our real Christian democratic line until I was elected deputy chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union, the same way we can also say that the MSZP, which has only an observer status in the Socialist International, has not yet received a similar international legitimacy. [Reti] Would you accept the position of prime minister in a government coalition in which a current opposition party has more votes than the KDNP? [Surjan] Yes I would, but with certain conditions, namely to refrain from having to make unprincipled compromises for power. The new coalition must be functional with 55-60 percent of the votes. [Reti] After some detours, the KDNP has again included the direct election of the president of the republic into its program. Who is your candidate? [Surjan] The authority of the president of the republic is well formulated in Hungary today, and we do not want to broaden his authority. It is too early to nominate a candidate, but it is sure that the position requires a different person if he has to be accepted by the whole country through an election campaign, instead of only being elected by Parliament.
