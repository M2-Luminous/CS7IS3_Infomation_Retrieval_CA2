There was an immediate denial from French Cooperation Minister Roussin and from the Foreign Ministry. The Belgian journalist who reported this is with us live from Brussels: Good afternoon, Colette Braeckmann, can you confirm what you wrote in your paper this morning, in other words that, although you are using the conditional tense, you have good reason to believe, according to your information, that it was indeed two French soldiers who carried out this dual assassination? [Braeckmann] Yes, a source which I consider to be a credible one, which comes from Kigali and which groups together other pieces of news in my possession, establishes that it was two Europeans, two French nationals, who fired the missile which shot down President Habyarimana's plane. What I do not know is within what framework they may have acted. [Announcer] Here you are saying two Europeans, but in your paper it said two French soldiers. Was it two Europeans, or two French soldiers? [Braeckmann] Two French soldiers, but I do not know within what framework they may have acted. [passage omitted] [Announcer] As you can imagine, this is a serious accusation which is categorically denied in France. How did they act? According to the accounts you have heard, they fired a missile didn't they? [Braeckmann] Yes, according to all the eyewitness accounts, two rockets were fired, shooting down the Rwandan president's plane. The precision of this rocket fire was such that all the sources assure me that the Rwandan military did not have the necessary technical training to carry out this kind of operation with such success. [Announcer] How can one be sure that not a single Rwandan soldier could use such weapons? [Braeckmann] The source comes from...[Braeckmann pauses] military cooperation assistants and experts in the Rwandan army have given assurances that it is virtually out of the question for a member of the Rwandan Armed Forces to have been able to carry out this kind of operation and that specialists of another country must have been called on to do it. [Announcer] It is perhaps a delicate matter for you as a journalist, but I must ask nevertheless: Are these sources which are all in agreement with one another, to which you refer, really serious sources, in your opinion? [Braeckmann] They are serious, and I cannot say more about the source, which comes from Kigali, because as you know the situation is dangerous out there and people's lives are not worth much.
