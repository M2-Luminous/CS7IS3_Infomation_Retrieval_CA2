This posturing takes the form both of a proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the freezing of amnesty granted to certain categories of criminals by former President F.W. de Klerk. NO SYMPATHY This newspaper has little sympathy for those who committed heinous crimes with political motive. Murder is murder, and it does not take on a more acceptable hue because it is political. However if amnesty is to be provided this must be done on an even-handed basis. To do otherwise creates the wholly justified perception that the Government is prepared only to protect those murderers and criminals with which it was once associated, and with which it continues to be associated. The amnesties were stopped, reportedly, because those indemnified need to confess all their sins first. However, let it be borne in mind that many indemnified ANC leaders have not yet confessed their sins, and are unlikely to ever do so. SELF RIGHTEOUS The ANC labours under the mistaken impression that its murderers are morally superior to those associated with the former Government. It is this kind of bizarre thinking which prompts the ANC, smugly convinced of its self-righteousness, to proclaim the need for a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission." DANGEROUS This kind of delusion is dangerous for a party, which has amongst its ministers a kidnapper, an alleged diamond smuggler, persons implicated in bomb blasts, and a foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, who is on public record as supporting the burning to death of other human beings. The term "Truth and Reconciliation Commission" is itself something of an Orwellian invention, the kind of spurious semantic facade which so appeals to those on the left. For the same reason the new Government has decided to call the Ministry of Police, as it is called in most other countries, the Ministry of Safety and Security. For its part, the proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a grand name for what is no more than a political inquisition. SPURIOUS We all know that this has little to do with reconciliation. And though it would be interesting to know which ANC leaders ordered Robert McBride's grisly murders, the commission is unlikely to be this even-handed in its investigations. The Justice Minister has already stated there should be no moral comparison between ANC murder and brutality, and that of the former government. According to this logic Robert McBride's mutilation and murder of innocents is not evil because it was done for a good cause. Acts are not inherently evil because evil is primarily identifiable with the choice of one's cause. MORAL RELATIVISM This moral relativism is itself evil, and leads to evil. It is this logic which says that the Nazi Holocaust was despicable, whilst the Stalinist Holocaust was merely unfortunate. Indeed the latter event should be swept under the carpet and studiously ignored because the Soviet concentration camps were created in the name of humanity. TWO COMMISSIONS? If we are to have inquisitions let us put both the NP [National Party] and the ANC in the dock. Better that two such commissions are established both with similar resources and with a similar will to uncover evil, one for each organisation. Then later we can compare the tally sheets and decide which side was worse, relatively speaking. Instead we are likely to end up with just another propaganda forum, which even if it displays half the selectivity of the Goldstone Commission, will generate more heat than light about the nature of political evil in South Africa. So, in the best Orwellian tradition we are likely to have a Truth and Reconciliation Commission which offsets reconciliation. The Truth Commission says Dullah Omar, will complete its work in eighteen months to two years. Let us hope it does so more quickly. Because then the central state can get on, more seriously than before, with its stated goal of reconciliation and nation-building.
