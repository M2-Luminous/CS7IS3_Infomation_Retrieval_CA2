Rather, the sources said, Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, told police investigators that he simply tried to "threaten" the 56-year-old former premier who was at the Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward to attend a party. But an investigation has revealed that Nozoe, who was arrested immediately after he fired at the ceiling, had checked into the hotel under a false name about five hours before the incident, according to the police sources. Nozoe had told police after his arrest that he fired a gunshot because of Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's wartime aggression and of Hosokawa's economic program. On Tuesday, police searched the hotel and the Shinjuku office of the right-wing group "Shokonjuku," to which Nozoe had once belonged.
