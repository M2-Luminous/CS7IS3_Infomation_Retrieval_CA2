Answering questions at the World Economic Forum conference in Cape Town he said the commitment of the government of the next five years to consensus would ensure that it was "not likely for us to do anything that will antagonise investors". A poll last year had also shown that business leaders had confidence in South Africa's future. The government had no hesitation in saying the country today had no free market economy. More than 80 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange belonged to five conglomerates. The government was the "only people who are going to make the market work in the historic sense of the word".
