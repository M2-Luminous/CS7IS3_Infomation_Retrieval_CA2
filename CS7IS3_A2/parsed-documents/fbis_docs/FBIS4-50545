In his keynote speech at the international conference "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business," the Chinese vice premier told the 800-strong audience: "market mechanism has taken a leading position in the national economic activities" and China is now ready to better integrate its economy into the world economy as a whole." "Market regulates 84 percent of the country's industrial activities, leaving 16 percent of the industrial goods subject to planned production and allocation," Li elaborated. Of all agricultural product sales by farmers in China, mandatory plan covers only 12.5 percent, while of the total retail sales, only 5.9 percent is priced by the government, he added. China's economic system has undergone significant changes, Li said, adding that a multi-form ownership pattern including state ownership, collective ownership, private ownership, individual ownership, foreign investors' ownership and common stock ownership, which are developing simultaneously with the state ownership as the mainstay, has taken shape in the country. "Market mechanism has been playing an ever increasing role in allocating resources and providing growing impetus to the domestic economic development," he said. Li Lanqing arrived here Wednesday night to attend the international conference jointly organized by the Asia Society, Dow Jones and Company, Inc., and the Institute of Policy Studies of Singapore. He will also co-chair the inaugural joint steering council meeting on the Suzhou industrial township project on Friday.
