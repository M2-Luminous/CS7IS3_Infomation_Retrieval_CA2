The price of the U.S. currency, which was 100 pesos until this weekend, ranged between 300 and 500 pesos on the black market today, according to foreign tourists visiting Havana's downtown area and the old sector. The official exchange rate is one peso for one dollar. A reliable anonymous source told DPA that "people today were frantically purchasing dollars in the streets of Havana." Apparently speculation began after parliament, which met in a two-day special session, authorized a package of measures to reduce the fiscal deficit and the excess of circulating money. The package includes increases in prices and tariffs on various products and services, the implementation of a tax system, and a possible change in the type of Cuban currency. This was compounded by the official announcement of an all-out struggle against black market hoarders and speculators, popularly known as "macetas." These "macetas" face confiscation of their assets if they cannot explain the source of their fortunes. President Fidel Castro personally announced at the conclusion of today's parliamentary session the imminent approval, this week, of a decree-law on this issue.
