The association consists of a dozen departments and enterprises in the fields of agriculture, meteorology, geography and industry. It aims to promote efficiency in natural disaster reduction and prevention. Henan is a major grain and cotton producer, but natural disasters such as drought, flood, plant disease, and pests have hampered the growth of agricultural production. In 1986 over 5.33 million ha of farmland, about 80 percent of the total, was hit by a serious drought, causing a loss of two billion kg of grain. In 1992 its cotton crop was hit by bollworms, causing a loss of 1.386 billion yuan (about 154 million U.S. dollars). In order to seek more effective ways of reducing disasters, local scientists and other experts have carried out a series of major research projects in the field.
