The broadcasting of the daily Iranian programme was terminated in early March by Azerbaijan Television (AzTV) due to "an electrical energy deficit". The head of the Executive Committee of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, Haji Vagif, condemned this act calling it "a treachery against the people". In today's news daily "ISLAM DUNYASI" (Islamic World), Haji Vagif, accused national television of serving the interests of Zionism.
