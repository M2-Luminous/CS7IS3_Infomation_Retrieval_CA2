Weizman arrived in Turkey earlier today for a four-day official visit, the highest-level visit by Israel to Turkey so far. Speaking at the official welcoming ceremony at the presidential palace of Cankaya, President Demirel said that the visit of Weizman coincided with the emergence of hopes for peace in the Middle East and "we want this gate of peace to be opened thoroughly and our country will do whatever it can to this end." Demirel said that the two countries had great opportunities to cooperate on trade, contracting services, tourism and technological exchange and that all levels of contacts will be held between Turkey and the Israeli delegation. "Our relations with Israel continue uninterruptedly since 1948. Recently these have been accelerated," Demirel said. "Our efforts are aimed at laying the foundations of a Middle East which, all the energy and money spent for militarization will be spent for development," Demirel added. On his part, Weizman said his country was doing more than it can for peace. He recalled that his country was holding talks with Palestine for peace and "I hope that we begin talking for peace with Syria, with President al-Asad." He recalled that his first visit abroad as president has been to Turkey and "I regard this visit also as a great step because of the changes taking place in our region." He went on to say that both countries were desiring to establish a peaceful order in the region and "relations between Turkey and Israel could be a catalyst for peaceful relations in our region." After the tete-a-tete meeting between Weizman and Demirel, delegations of the two countries began official talks.
