Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the failure of a main rotor blade assembly or a main rotor hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS from the last inspection, remove each blade assembly from the helicopter and accomplish the following: (1) Inspect the attachment lugs of the main rotor (M/R) blade root fittings (root fittings) and the M/R lead-lag links (links) for cracks and the lug bushings (bushings) for looseness. Conduct the inspections in accordance with paragraph (b) of Part I of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company Service Information Notice HN&hyph;211.4, DN&hyph;51.6, EN&hyph;42.4, FN&hyph;31.4 (SIN), dated January 27, 1993. (2) Visually inspect for cracks_ (i) The root fittings around the blade attachment lugs, and (ii) The M/R blade doubler and blade skin adjacent to the root fittings. (3) Mark the root fittings and bushings with slippage marks in accordance with paragraph (e) of Part I of the SIN, dated January 27, 1993, if the slippage marks are degraded or missing. (4) Replace any M/R blades or links found to be cracked or to have loose bushings with airworthy parts before further flight. (b) Within 25 hours' TIS after compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS from the last inspection, accomplish the following without removing the M/R blade: (1) Visually inspect the root fittings and links for cracks or loose bushings in accordance with Part II of the SIN, dated January 27, 1993. (2) Replace any M/R blades or links found to be cracked or to have loose bushings with airworthy parts before further flight. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
