Speaking at Rustenburg during his election campaign visit to the Western Transvaal, President de Klerk said the East Rand was faced, not only with a security problem, but with a socioeconomic issue. The solution had to make provision for a socioeconomic upliftment program. He said consultations were still being held with the ANC [African National Congress] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the multiparty plan. President de Klerk said he was not worried about Mr. Nelson Mandela's personal attacks on him because they were not based on fact, but that it did concern him that somebody of Mr. Mandela's status acted so irresponsibly. He said Mr. Mandela was making personal attacks on him instead of condemning the activities of the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand. President de Klerk said the election was not centered on freedom, because South Africans were already free, but that it suited the opposition to talk about freedom as they did not have a real message for the future. He said right-wingers had no justification for threats of war. The CP [Conservative Party] had lost two referendums and two elections and would have to accept the majority decision.
