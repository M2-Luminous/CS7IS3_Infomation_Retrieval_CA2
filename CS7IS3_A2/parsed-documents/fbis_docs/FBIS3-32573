Saul Landau, specialist at the Political Studies Center in Washington, said it would be a mistake to interpret this decision as a U.S. Government change in policy toward Cuba. Washington authorizes trips to Cuba for only certain categories of travelers: reporters, researchers, scholars, government officials, and U.S. citizens of Cuban origin with relatives in Cuba, or guests whose expenses are paid by the Cuban authorities. News dispatches last week indicated that the White House is studying a Department of State proposal to broaden the scope of travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens. Saul Landau today stated that the proposal to expand the categories of American visitors to Cuba must not be viewed as a positive indicator regarding the United States' general policies toward Cuba. The measure might be a sign of flexibility regarding restriction of the rights of Americans. However, this is not indicative of a lowering of the guard against Cuba. The Department of State proposal is based on an amendment bill drafted last year by California Democratic Representative Howard Berman, opposing the travel ban. State Department specialists drafted the new proposal, which is now being studied by the National Security Council for government approval.
