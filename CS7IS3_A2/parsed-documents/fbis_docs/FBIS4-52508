FBIS4-52508 "dreas091_a_94035" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Testimony: Hosokawa Carried Out Stock Deal Testimony: Hosokawa Carried Out Stock Deal OW1105041494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0331 GMT 11 May 94 OW1105041494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant testified before a Diet budget committee Wednesday [11 May] that a dubious stock transaction was carried out by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, not his late father-in-law as claimed by Hosokawa. At a session of the House of Councillors Budget Committee, securities consultant Shuzo Fujiki, 60, said he served as an intermediary in a transaction to purchase 300 shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 for Hosokawa through his former secretary Masatoshi Miyama and company president Yusei Kuwahata, acquaintance of both Fujiki and Hosokawa. Fujiki, as witness, said the Hosokawa side conveyed hopes to participate in tenders on NTT shares because (Hosokawa) could provide collateral for funds to purchase the shares. Fujiki also said Hosokawa used the name of his father-in-law in the transaction. On March 30, Fujiki told reporters that Hosokawa himself carried out the questionable stock deal involving hundreds of millions of yen, contrary to Hosokawa's insistence that the stock transaction was solely conducted by his father-in-law. The 418 million yen loan he arranged was extended with Hosokawa's condominium in central Tokyo as collateral, Fujiki said. Hosokawa said he purchased the condominium with 100 million yen he borrowed form Sagawa Kyubin Co., a major scandal-tainted trucking firm in 1982. Disputes over the stock deal and the 100 million yen loan caused a long delay of Diet deliberations on the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, and was partly responsible for Hosokawa's decision to resign as premier on April 25.
