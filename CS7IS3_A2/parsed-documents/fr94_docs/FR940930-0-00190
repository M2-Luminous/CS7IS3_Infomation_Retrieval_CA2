(2) For model years 1996 and 1997, manufacturers may exclude heavy light-duty trucks from the reporting required by this section. (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each vehicle manufacturer must sell clean-fuel vehicles in California in an amount equal to the required annual sales volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (2) The required annual clean fuel vehicle sales volume for a given manufacturer is expressed in the following equation rounded to the nearest whole number. E:GRAPHICSER30SE94.001 Where: RMS=a manufacturer's required sales in a given model year. MS=a manufacturer's total LDV and light LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). =a manufacturer's total LDV and LDT sales in California two model years earlier than year in question (for MY 1998 and later RMS calculations). TS=total LDV and light LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question (for MY 1996 and 1997 RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will not be included. =total LDV and LDT sales in California of all manufacturers two model years earlier than the year in question (for MY 1998 and later RMS calculations). Sales of manufacturers which meet the criteria of (d) of this paragraph will not be included. TCPPS=Pilot program annual CFV sales requirement (either 150,000 or 300,000) for the model year in question. (i) A manufacturer's share of required annual sales for model years 1996 and 1997 will be based on LDV and light LDT sales only. Once the heavy LDT standards are effective beginning with model year 1998, a manufacturer's required sales share will be based on all LDV and LDT sales.
