Burns heads a U.S. economic delegation, which arrived in Kiev a few days ago for talks with Ukrainian officials on how to apply $350 million in aid. On Thursday, Burns met Ukrainian Parliament Chairman Ivan Plyushch. The speaker informed the American guest about the current situation in the former Soviet Republic. He described the visit by such a representative delegation as another step towards further development of mutually beneficial partnership between the two countries. The United States can contribute considerably to solution of problems currently facing Ukraine, Plyushch stressed. Burns said the present visit had been mostly focused on exchange of opinions about economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine. This issue was tackled during meetings with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and government ministers. According to the U.S. official, President Clinton believes the two countries entered a new stage of bilateral relations. The previous stage concentrated on dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet Union. At present, the emphasis is laid on closer and more extensive economic ties. "To the United States, Ukraine is seen as one of the most important countries in Europe," Burns said. He insisted the former Soviet republic speed up economic reform if it wanted more aid in future. "The Ukrainian Government and parliament and the society at large want to achieve economic reform. But we believe the progress has Gorbachev to go further. Much greater progress has to be made," Burns told a news conference. The U.S. delegation head called on ministers to move more quickly in implementing an ambitious privatization programme and creating a better climate for trade. "The United States would like to lead an international effort to provide help to Ukraine with its economic reform programme," he pointed out. The combined sum pledged by the U.S. to the newly-independent state puts Ukraine behind only Israel, Egypt, and Russia in terms of U.S. foreign aid. Among other projects, the United States will print privatization certificates to be issued to all Ukrainian citizens in July and set up an enterprise fund to give loans to small businesses.
