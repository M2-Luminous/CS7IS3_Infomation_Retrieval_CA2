Prodi, who presented Delors with an IRI study on the communications infrastructures envisaged in the European Commission President's White Paper on boosting European Union [EU] growth and employment, said that the upcoming Comit privatisation would respect rules of "transparency" and safeguard shareholders' rights. In its last IRI balance sheet, approved today in Milan, Comit reported a 1.7 percent rise in 1993 net profits to 268.2 billion lire and a 65 percent leap in its operating result to 1.510 trillion lire. It announced an unchanged dividend of 200 lire per ordinary share and 230 lire per savings share still in circulation at the end of the conversion period, February 11. Prodi also had talks with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert on the recent European steel accord, reiterating the strategic importance of Ilva plants to be privatised and saying he had "no worries" on Dalmine's coming tubes joint venture with Mannesmann and Vallourec despite EU clouds apparently brewing. On the freeing-up of Italy's mobile phone market with the second, "European" licensee, Prodi stressed the importance of competition, "even if it costs dear." Illustrating the main points of IRI's communications network study -- the first in Europe to issue a concrete response to Delors's vision -- Prodi proudly pointed to its provision for what Premier Ciampi recently called the missing piece -- high-speed links between north and south and not just the east and west of Europe. The study had also highlighted the need for any link between West and East Europe to pass through the Po Valley, he said. European Institutional Affairs Commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi and Public Works Minister Francesco Merloni pointed to the "coordinated approach" shown for the first time in IRI's Trans-European Network (TEN) blueprint, and its crucial importance for speeding European integration. Prodi highlighted the "watershed" change represented by the almost wholly private funding of the scheme, via the proposed EU bonds.
