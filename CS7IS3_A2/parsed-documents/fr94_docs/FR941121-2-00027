In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a minor license for the existing, unlicensed Fort Dodge Mill Dam Hydroelectric Project, located on the Des Moines River, Webster County, Iowa, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the existing project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
