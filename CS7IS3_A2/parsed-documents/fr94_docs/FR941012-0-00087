FR941012-0-00087 FR941012-0-00011 In paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule, OSHA makes clear that the standard applies to all types of logging operations, regardless of the end use of the wood. Logging operations, as defined in paragraph (c) of the final rule, include, but are not limited to, marking, felling, bucking, limbing, debarking, chipping, yarding, loading, unloading, storing, transporting machines and equipment from one site to another, and other operations associated with felling and moving trees and logs from the stump to the point of delivery. Many commenters supported the application of the standard to all types of logging and all logging operations (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;48, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65). One commenter said OSHA should exclude felling operations from the logging standard and cover only the movement of felled trees from the stump to the mill (Ex. 17). This commenter said that felling activity is not the most hazardous part of logging operations. OSHA believes the record does not support the commenters' recommendation. The record clearly shows that felling activities are the most hazardous activities of the logging operation. According to the WIR survey, more than one-half of all reported injuries involved various felling activities (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that if the standard did not include hazards associated with felling the trees, that the majority of employees in the logging industry would still be exposed to significant risk of injury and death. Therefore, in the final OSHA has retained coverage of tree felling operations. Another commenter raised the issue about whether establishments that hire independent contractors to perform various logging activities are considered employers covered by this standard (Ex. 5&hyph;23). The courts have held in various OSHA cases that when the contractor exercises control over the means and methods by which the independent contractor performs the work, that the contractor is regarded as an employer for purposes of this rule. Loomis Cabinet Co. v. Martin, 15 F.3d 1086 (9th Cir. 1994). See also Castillo v. Gibbons, 704 F.2d 181, 188&hyph;93 (5th Cir. 1993). For example, establishments that provide independent contractors with machines, such as yarders or forklift trucks, to perform the job are exercising control over the means by which the job is performed. At paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, the Agency has excluded from coverage the construction or use of cable yarding systems. Cable yarding, as defined in the final standard, is the movement of felled trees or logs from the area where they are felled to the landing on a system composed of a cable suspended from spars and/or towers. The definition further states that the trees or logs may be either dragged across the ground by the cable or carried while suspended from the cable. One of the end towers is located in the area where the trees or logs are attached to the cable yarding system and the other end is at the landing. Cable yarding systems are used primarily when the terrain is extremely rugged and the felled trees and logs are otherwise inaccessible. Important elements of the safe use of a cable yarding system include the selection and use of climbing devices to install the system, preparation of head and tail spars and intermediate trees or towers, component sizing, system rigging and system usage. There are generally three types of cable yarding systems, namely, high lead, skyline and slackline. In a high lead system, the mainline is threaded through the mainline block (pulley) that is attached near the top of the spar to obtain a lift of the logs being yarded. A skyline system is one in which the line (cable) is hung between two or more supports on which a carriage or block travels. A slackline system is a form of skyline system where the skyline is spooled on a drum so that the line can be raised or lowered. In all three systems, the spars are usually held in part and restrained against movement by the use of guylines that are anchored to the ground or another tree. Trees and logs may be moved by a cable yarding system by dragging them along the ground or while they are suspended from the system.
