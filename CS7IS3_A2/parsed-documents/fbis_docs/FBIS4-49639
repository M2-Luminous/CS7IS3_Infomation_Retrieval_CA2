As Mr. Patten disappeared from sight, after a hectic week of high-profile activity, Mr. Lu accused him of only wanting to put on a political show, rather than sincerely engaging in talks, according to newly appointed District Affairs Adviser Leung Kwong-cheung, who attended a two-hour meeting with the visiting mainland official. Mr. Lu insisted he would only meet the Governor if it was likely to be fruitful. "How could I meet Mr. Patten, he performs a show but I don't. His attitude towards the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] is not only unfriendly but amounts to a boycott of us," the visiting mainland official was quoted as saying at a meeting with the district advisers. "As secretary-general of the PWC, if I enter the room by the red carpet, then walk out along the red carpet, without making any progress, this would only disappoint the six million people in Hong Kong." Mr. Lu also attacked the Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation for allegedly snubbing the PWC by failing to send its chairman Kevin Hyde to a meeting with the economic sub-group yesterday. The KCRC sent a consultant as its representative instead, and Mr. Lu said this was further evidence of the British side's lack of sincerity. "Many of the PWC mainland members are department heads (in the Chinese Government). Is our meeting with the KCRC chairman downgrading his status?" Mr. Lu was reported as saying. Secretary of Transport Haider Barma last night denied the Government had played any role in the KCRC's decision. "As far as I know, we did not have any role in this case. It (the decision) is entirely up to the KCRC, the board is independent from the Government. I only learned of their meeting and cancellation of the appointment from the newspapers," Mr. Barma said. After a meeting with the specialist group on infrastructure of the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, head of the PWC economic sub-group Gao Shang-quan expressed his disappointment at the absence of Mr. Hyde. He said: "We, with four ministerial level officials, came to this meeting with tremendous sincerity and ambitions because this question (railway transportation) has to be solved very urgently." According to sub-group member Tam Yiu-Chung, yesterday's meeting was originally arranged as a discussion with the KCRC only. But the PWC re-scheduled it to meet the infrastructure experts after receiving a negative reply from the KCRC. A newly built Beijing-Kowloon railway will come into service in late 1995, and China wants to discuss with the KCRC the connection of the proposed railway to the western New Territories. "If the question cannot be solved, it will cause economic loss to Hong Kong. And of course, it will cause economic loss to China also," Mr. Gao said. Mr. Lu had earlier yesterday sought to ease the anxiety of civil servants by assuring them their future would not be affected by the Sino-British row. Representatives from seven civil servant associations held almost three hours of talks with Mr. Lu and members of the PWC political subgroup.
