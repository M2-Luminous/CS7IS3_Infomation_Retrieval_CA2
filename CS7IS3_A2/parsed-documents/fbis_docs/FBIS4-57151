The clashes left three injured and more than 30 others arrested. On 11 May, a long day of protest started in the early morning hours, specifically at the Francisco Fajardo School located in U.V. Siete de Caricuoa. The day of protest left three students injured, as well as 30 arrested by metropolitan police agents. At the Francisco Fajardo School on Caricuoa, three students were wounded. One of these students--Marvin Uzcategui--was shot in the stomach; Juan Carlos Vivas, a 15-year-old student, was shot in the ribs; and Guillermo Useche got a shot in the arm. According to witnesses, the shots were fired by Metropolitan Police deployed along the main streets of the area known as U.V. Siete de Caricuoa, who opened fire on the protesters. Nevertheless, General Orlando Henandez Villega, the commander of the Metropolitan Police, categorically denied these reports. [Begin Hernandez recording] I want to reiterate what I said previously. The Metropolitan Police are not using firearms to quell the demonstrations. Clear proof of this is that, if firearms had been used at Francisco Fajardo School, there would have been wounded students. Instead, the wounded included a five-year-old who was not demonstrating, as well as a 15-year-old from a neighborhood next to the school. Apparently, there were clashes with criminals or shots were fired in the area, resulting in these people being wounded. [end recording] Despite General Orlando Hernandez Guillen's version of what happened, it was unofficially learned that, according to officers of the Technical Judicial Police's Homicide Division, police officers opened fire with .38 caliber weapons on students protesting the hike in student bus fares. Violent demonstrations also were reported at other schools, such as Fermin Toro in El Silencio; Luis Espelozin; Miguel Antonio Carela on Sucre Ave.; and Luis Blanco in Propatria, where two police officers were wounded. Also, in the wake of disturbances at the Jose Felix Ribas School, which is located on the main road in Dos Caminos, a store was looted. There also were disturbances reported at the Luis Caballero Mejia Politechnical Institute in La Yaguara, at the Central University of Venezuela, the Instituto Pedagogico of Paraiso, and the Campo Rico Technical School in El Marquez. Officers from the Metropolitan Police and the National Guard's Urban Security Brigade continue to be deployed throughout the city in an attempt to control all of these outbreaks of violence.
