Indeed, such a contract was signed in full compliance with the existing rules and agreed with the Russian State Committee for Property. A Japan firm will be engaged in dismantling Russian submarines, and they will be delivered to the buyer in a condition fit only for metal scrap, informed sources from the Russian Navy told ITAR-TASS today. Thus, there are no grounds for the allegations that Russian submarines after necessary repairs can be put into service by subdivisions of the North Korean Navy.
