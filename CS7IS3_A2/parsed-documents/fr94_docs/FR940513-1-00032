FR940513-1-00032 FR940513-1-00009 Proposed Section 451.5 Proposed §451.5 deals with where and when to apply. Proposed paragraph (a) permits the filing of an application only in response to an annual notice in the Federal Register . Issuance of that notice should closely follow enactment of appropriations. Proposed paragraph (b) concerns the initial application. It provides that such an application may be filed in the first fiscal year following that in which electricity eligible for incentive payments is first generated, and that subsequent applications may be filed in the fiscal years following those in which electricity eligible for incentive payments is generated. Proposed Section 451.6 Consistent with the requirements of section 1212, proposed §451.6 provides that the Department may only make incentive payments for a 10-fiscal year period to any particular qualified renewable facility. Proposed Section 451.7 Proposed §451.7 describes metering requirements which the Department thinks are desirable to promote the accuracy and veracity of applications for incentive payments. In all cases, the number of kilowatt-hours generated and sold is to be metered. If non-qualifying renewable or non-renewable energy sources as well as qualifying renewable energy sources are used, proposed §451.7 would not require electrical metering of sources where such is not possible or practical. In such cases, the kilowatt hours attributable to the qualified renewable energy source must usually be calculated from fractions of heat input, or other energy input, from the several sources. Such inputs must be metered, measured, or otherwise quantified from the respective raw energy streams using commonly accepted (and identified) procedures and conversion methodologies. Proposed Section 451.8 Proposed §451.8 sets forth application content requirements. Most of the requirements are self-explanatory. However, several of them deserve some discussion to focus them for public comment. Proposed paragraph (f) would require: ``That components and equipment, representing at least 50 percent of the capital cost of the qualified renewable energy facility, were substantially manufactured in a State.'' This provision is consistent with the purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is modeled on a provision of section 6 of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989, as amended by title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. 42 U.S.C. §12005(b)(1)(B). Like section 6, it would not exclude entities merely on the basis of foreign ownership. It would promote domestic jobs and production without discriminating against foreign entities that invest in production facilities in the United States. Proposed paragraphs (g) and (h) would require independently audited and certified statements of the monthly and annual electric energy generated and sold. The content of the certification should be similar to the type of certification supplied by an accounting firm in a company's annual report to shareholders. Paragraph (h) also describes the calculation necessary when the metered number of kilowatt-hours represents electric energy generated from renewable and non-renewable or excluded-renewable energy sources. The proposed requirement for an independently audited and certified statement will minimize the chance of erroneous claims and the need for DOE audits. Consistent with applicable regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 5 CFR 1320.6(f), proposed paragraph (k) would require a statement agreeing to retain records for a period of three years to provide for prompt access to, or copies of, such records in response to a written request by DOE. DOE is still considering whether the retention period should be the entire ten year period during which incentive payments may be collected. DOE did not propose a longer retention period because the proposed audit and certification requirements would make fraud or mistake unlikely. Proposed Section 451.9 Proposed §451.9 describes DOE's procedures for processing applications for incentive payments including the statutory formula for initially calculating the amount due and the adjustment for inflation. DOE is proposing a procedure to deal with the possibility that there could be a shortage of appropriations to make the full incentive payments. The President's annual budget request and Congressional action on that request will precede receipt of the applications in every year. It is therefore unlikely that Congress will appropriate precisely the amount necessary to make the full incentive payments. In the event that the amount appropriated is less than the amount required to make full payments to all qualified applicants, the proposed procedure involves priority first (and, if necessary, pro rata payments) to all owners or operators of solar, wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass facilities, and priority second (and, if necessary, pro rata payments) to owners or operators of all other qualified facilities. This procedure favors emerging technologies which are similarly favored by the tax credit provisions of sections 1914 and 1916. These technologies are close to or in early commercialization stages where the incentive payments can help speed the commercialization process. If payments are reduced as a result of a shortage of appropriations, the kilowatt-hours attributable to the shortfall will accrue for payment in succeeding years to the extent that Congress appropriates funds sufficient to allow payment for these accruals together with other eligible electricity production.
