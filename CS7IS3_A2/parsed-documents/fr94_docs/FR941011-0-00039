FR941011-0-00039 FR941011-0-00011 (3) Special rules _(i) In general. This paragraph (e)(3) provides the rules for terminating general asset account treatment upon certain dispositions. While the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section are optional rules, the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section are mandatory rules. A taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) income tax return for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(3)(iii) through (v) of this section, see paragraph (i) of this section for identifying the unadjusted depreciable basis of a disposed asset. (ii) Disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account _(A) Optional termination of a general asset account. Upon the disposition of all of the assets, or the last asset, in a general asset account, a taxpayer may apply this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to recover the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account (rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply). Under this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the general asset account terminates and the amount of gain or loss for the general asset account is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of the disposition. The recognition and character of the gain or loss are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 (or section 1250) is limited to the excess of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account, including any expensed cost (or the excess of the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account), over any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (B) Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii). Example. (i) T , a calendar-year corporation, maintains a general asset account for 1,000 calculators. The calculators cost a total of $60,000 and were placed in service in 1995. Assume this general asset account has a depreciation method of 200 percent declining balance, a recovery period of 5 years, and a half-year convention. T does not make a section 179 election for any of the calculators. In 1996, T sells 200 of the calculators to an unrelated party for a total of $10,000 and recognizes the $10,000 as ordinary income in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (ii) On March 26, 1997, T sells the remaining calculators in the general asset account to an unrelated party for $35,000. T chooses to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. As a result, the account terminates and gain or loss is determined for the account. (iii) On the date of disposition, the adjusted depreciable basis of the account is $23,040 (unadjusted depreciable basis of $60,000 less the depreciation allowed or allowable of $36,960). Thus, in 1997, T recognizes gain of $11,960 (amount realized of $35,000 less the adjusted depreciable basis of $23,040). The gain of $11,960 is subject to section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the account (plus the expensed cost for assets in the account) less the amounts previously recognized as ordinary income ($36,960 + $0 ^ $10,000 = $26,960). As a result, the entire gain of $11,960 is subject to section 1245. (iii) Disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition _(A) Optional determination of the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction. In the case of a qualifying disposition of an asset (described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section), a taxpayer may apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply). Under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs, and the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction for the asset is determined by taking into account the asset's adjusted basis. The adjusted basis of the asset at the time of the disposition equals the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset less the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included. The recognition and character of the gain, loss, or other deduction are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 (or section 1250) is limited to the lesser of_ ( 1 ) The depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, including any expensed cost (or the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset); or ( 2 ) The excess of_ ( i ) The original unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account plus, in the case of section 1245 property originally included in the general asset account, any expensed cost; over
