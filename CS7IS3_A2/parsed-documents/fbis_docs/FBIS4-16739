A serious partnership requires closer political coordination, Andrey Kozyrev said to journalists today. The relations of true partnership should rule out situations where important measures are being taken without consulting Russia in areas where close cooperation is needed -- as in, for example, looking for a solution to the Bosnia crisis, Kozyrev said. Moscow is interested in a serious agreement, stressed Kozyrev. He also noted that all the sides involved will perhaps need some time to reflect on what it is that they want exactly. Russia intends to propose its own, really substantial draft agreement to NATO. We want a true, serious partnership, said the Russian foreign minister.
