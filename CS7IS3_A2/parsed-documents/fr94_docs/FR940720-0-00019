FR940720-0-00019 FR940720-0-00001 (c) Travel. (d) Program support. 3. Direct program support, which is the use of contract or other services in support of the line organization's direct program, is excluded because these costs are charged directly through the various categories of fees. 4. All other costs (i.e., Salaries and Benefits, Travel, Administrative Support, and Program Support contracts/services for G&A activities) represent ``in-house'' costs and are to be collected by allocating them uniformly over the total number of direct FTEs. Using this method, which was described in the final rules published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), and excluding direct Program Support funds, allocating the remaining $376.6 million uniformly to the direct FTEs (1,628.9) results in a rate of $231,216 per FTE for FY 1994. The Direct FTE Hourly Rate is $133 per hour (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). This rate is calculated by dividing $376.6 million by the number of direct FTEs (1,628.9 FTE) and the number of productive hours in one year (1744 hours) as indicated in OMB Circular A&hyph;76, ``Performance of Commercial Activities.'' Table III._FY 1994 Budget Authority by Major Category [Dollars in millions] 1␣ 1␣ Salaries and benefits $259.5 Administrative support 86.7 Travel 15.9 n,s Total nonprogram support obligations 362.1 Program support 150.9 n,d Total Budget Authority 513.0 Less direct program support and offsetting receipts 136.4 n,s Budget Allocated to Direct FTE 376.6 Professional Hourly Rate 133 Section 170.21 Schedule of Fees for Production and Utilization Facilities, Review of Standard Reference Design Approvals, Special Projects, Inspections and Import and Export Licenses. The licensing and inspection fees in this section, which are based on full-cost recovery, are revised to reflect the FY 1994 budgeted costs and to recover costs incurred by the NRC in providing licensing and inspection services to indentifiable recipients. The fees asssessed for services provided under the schedule are based on the professional hourly rate as shown in §170.20 and any direct program support (contractual services) costs expended by the NRC. Any professional hours expended on or after the effective date of this rule will be assessed at the FY 1994 rate shown in §170.20. Although the amounts of the import and export licensing fees in §170.21, facility Category K, have not changed from FY 1993 as a result of the very small increase in the hourly rate from $132 per hour to $133 per hour, they are being published for purposes of convenience. For those applications currently on file and pending completion, footnote 2 of §170.21 is revised to provide that the professional hours expended up to the effective date of this rule will be assessed at the professional rates established for the rules that became effective on June 20, 1984, January 30, 1989, July 2, 1990, August 9, 1991. August 24, 1992, and August 19, 1993, as appropriate. For topical report applications currently on file which are still pending completion of the review and for which review costs have reached the applicable fee ceiling established by the July 2, 1990, rule, the costs incurred after any applicable ceiling was reached through August 8, 1991, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional hours expended for the review of topical report applications, amendments, revisions, or supplements to a topical report on or after August 9, 1991, are assessed at the applicable rate established by §170.20. Section 170.31 Schedule of Fees for Materials Licenses and Other Regulatory Services, Including Inspections and Import and Export Licenses.
