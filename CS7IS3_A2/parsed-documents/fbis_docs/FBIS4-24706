The defendant, a native of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, was former deputy secretary-general of the provincial government, deputy director of the Hainan Securities Supervision Commission and deputy head of a leading team of the reform of the shareholding practice. He was accused of collecting false information on conduct of the former governor known by his surname as Liu since 1992. He later incited a person to forge evidence to frame the former governor. The fabrication was finally uncovered, and Li was arrested in August last year on a charge of frame-up. During the interrogation, Li admitted that he had accepted shares and cash worth a total of RMB510,000 [renminbi] from three shareholding companies as bribes during his tenure as the deputy director of the securities commission. The Haikou People's Procuratorate lodged prosecution against him on charges of frame-up and bribe taking with the intermediate court on May 16. During the public trial today Li confessed to all charges against him, and a verdict will soon be passed on the defendant by the court.
