This was stressed at a conference in Moscow, organised by the Commission on Citizenship, attached to the president, and the Russian Foreign Ministry. The report of the committee chairman Abdullah Mikitayev says that special attention will be paid to the situation of ethnic Russians in Latvia and Estonia, many of whom have been denied citizenship. He said that he advocates the granting of the Russian citizenship to them, if they want it, and stressed that the settlement of the problem of ethnic Russians in ex-soviet states as soon as possible meets the interests of both Russia and newly-independent states.
