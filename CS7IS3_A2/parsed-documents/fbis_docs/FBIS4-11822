He said the meeting was an advanced step down the road of normalizing relations between Iraq and France. In an interview with AL-THAWRAH published today, Salih said the meeting revealed a serious French desire and concern on the part of the French Government to normalize relations with Iraq and to move on toward a new stage in which France will greatly contribute, through the Security Council, toward lifting the Iraq embargo. He said the atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings of the Interparliamentary Union, concluded recently in the French capital, highlighted a noticeable change in the international arena and a frank call for lifting the Iraq embargo, especially the oil embargo. Commenting on the agreement of the Arab sides to a Moroccan proposal to hold an ordinary session for the Arab Parliamentary Union to clear the Arab atmosphere, Salih said: Definitely, the question of the Iraq embargo will command the attention of everybody, because the removal of its causes opens the door for a unified Arab position. On a visit by a Jordanian parliament delegation to Iraq tomorrow, Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the delegation, led by 'Abd Musa al-Nahar, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, will hold talks with several officials within the context of brotherly relations between the two countries. The delegation will also attend part of the new session of the Iraqi National Assembly.
