FBIS4-19002 "drweu071__a94009" FBIS-WEU-94-071-A Daily Report 13 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Rights Groups Photograph German Arms in Kurdistan Rights Groups Photograph German Arms in Kurdistan AU1204115994 Hamburg DPA in German 1008 GMT 12 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1204115994 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [10 April] representatives of German human rights groups presented the Foreign Ministry in Bonn with material which, as they claim, proves the use of German arms by the Turkish Army in Kurdistan. The pictures and eyewitness reports document, among other things, the use of BRT-60 tanks from stocks of the former GDR People's Army (NVA). Spokesmen for the groups told journalists that this is proved, among other things, by the special equipment on the tanks and the NVA signs that are only superficially painted over. The government in Ankara had stated that people had mistaken them for BRT-80 tanks, which Turkey bought in Russia. This argument had also been picked up by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who, however, has meanwhile temporarily suspended the supply of further German arms. The German observers said that if Ankara's statement was right, then the 10 Russian "alibi" tanks would have to be able to show up in many places at the same time. The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the presented material. Martin Glasenapp, of the medico international relief organization, said that some 300 members of delegations from Germany and other countries "repeatedly" observed "the use of German arms against the Kurdish civilian population" during the Kurdish new year's celebrations Newroz on 21 March and the following days. Apart from BRT-60 tanks, observers saw and photographed also Leopard tanks, MAN personnel carriers, MTW M 113-type armored vehicles, and special task forces with G3 guns made by the Heckler and Koch company. Moreover, there were "innumerous" reports by eyewitnesses on the bloodbaths caused with these arms. Angelika Beer, a member of the Alliance 90/Greens Executive Committee, said that she was an eyewitness to Turkish air strikes on 26 March against the villages of Besuke and Gaver, in which 34 people were killed. While Ankara spoke of one bomb that was accidentally discharged, in reality a total of eight bombs were dropped on Gaver alone from helicopters and one aircraft.
