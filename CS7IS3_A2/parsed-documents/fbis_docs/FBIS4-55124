"We were the first to sign the document-framework," he recalls, adding that "Romania's adherence to that programme is not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing of national security, but it comes to answer also our determination to fully integrate within European and Euro-Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all political parties represented in Romania's Parliament. The adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all Romania's neighboring states and their commitment to observe the principles of that programme would be able to provide certain indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national security. That is why we have insisted on the fact that the Partnership for Peace should be open to all states, for we want them to take active part in the process initiated by NATO," the Romanian minister added. Mentioning that "Romania had already set its aims in the process of army restructuring, before the initiation of the Partnership for Peace programme, whose aims are similar to the programme's objectives," Gheorghe Tinca went on to say that "the Romanian military doctrine is traditionally a defensive one, which matches the partnership's norms, while as regards the army's restructuring, training and techniques, all these are to face a process of modernization". "We would say that Romania is viewing the peace partnership as an instrument to encourage investments, business, and economic development. In fact it is not by mere coincidence that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, Romania's President Ion Iliescu referred to the need for an economic partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the European continent but to the entire world," the Romanian minister of defense concluded.
