The intergovernment agreement "on the procedure for the unification of the Belarus system with the Russian Federation monetary system and the mechanism for the functioning of a common monetary system" was signed. Its successful implementation could serve as the start of the ruble zone and raise integration processes in the CIS to a qualitatively new level. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true: Failure could seriously delay these processes. That fear is by no means unfounded. The experience of many of the CIS' good initiatives which have disappeared into the sand requires heightened circumspection and responsibility here. In assessing the objective chances of success we must highlight the main point -- the optimum selection of partners on the basis "of love and calculation," as the saying goes: The mutual sympathy of the two countries' peoples, the contiguity of their territories, their close economic ties. Suffice it to say that Belarus sells nearly one third of its GNP in Russia, acquiring in exchange rolled metal, cement, petroleum products, gas, and other things. But the successful combination of partners and their desire to unite their monetary systems still do not guarantee success. After all, it is a case of a unique step unprecedented in world practice. Consequently, the most serious preparatory work is needed. The foundation of this work was laid by the agreement of a program nature between Russia and Belarus concluded in September last year. Something has already been done, particularly in the field of coordinating foreign economic, trade, and customs policy. But radical questions of the interaction of the two countries' budgets and in particular questions of the normal functioning of two emission banks with a single currency have not been sufficiently worked out in such a short time. In addition to unresolved problems new problems have arisen in recent months, complicating the unification of the monetary systems. The first act here is the replacement of Belarusian rubles with Russian ones. In September 1993 the exchange rate was 1.5 Belarusian rubles for 1 ruble. The one for one principle stipulated by the program agreement for the exchange of money did not give rise to any special objections at the time. But since then the market exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble -- the "hare" -- has declined to 5 for 1 Russian ruble. But in the January agreement the "hare's" exchange rate against the ruble remains the same. Of course the currency exchange rate is determined not only by their purchasing power but also by supply and demand, the saturation of the market, and other factors. Nonetheless the correlation of one to one for the exchange of Belarusian rubles for Russian rubles now seems absolutely unacceptable. The September agreement on the unification of the monetary systems has been approved by a parliamentary majority in Belarus. It must be supposed that the January agreements will also be ratified there. But the Russian Duma will hardly agree to such a disadvantageous exchange of money. We know the relatively recent experience of the exchange of GDR marks for FRG marks after Germany's reunification. The nonequivalence of the exchange produced many additional difficulties even for that country's prosperous economy. To avoid inflation additional taxes had to be introduced in its western lands. Russia, where tax rates are already excessive, is barred from such a route. Consequently, nonequivalent exchange could intensify inflation. To determine a rational rate for the exchange of "hares" for Russian rubles regular exchange sales of Belarusian currency are needed -- to refine its quotation price; we must also calculate the cost of similar selections of consumer items in Belarusian and Russian rubles -- to compare their purchasing power. The drastic decline of the Belarusian ruble exchange rate in recent months makes concern for the stability of the future joint monetary system -- not only statically, at the moment of unification, but also dynamically -- particularly topical. And the main thing for this stability is to ensure that market reforms are conducted in synchrony. Hence Belarus' task of accelerating the liberalization of prices and privatization, bringing them up to Russia's level. In conclusion, it must be admitted that less than four months have not been enough for such a complex and crucial matter. Time out essential for the more thorough working through of the problem is in my view preferable to hasty decisions. But there are grounds for fearing that political motives will yet again prevail over economic expediency and the fundamentally necessary agreement will in practice become a heavy burden to the Russian economy.
