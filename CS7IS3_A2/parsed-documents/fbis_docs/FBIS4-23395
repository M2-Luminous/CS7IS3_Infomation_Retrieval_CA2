The truth is that the Bakassi crisis, which has embroiled Nigeria and Cameroon in a near-war situation, is now like a dormant volcano. Dangerous as this already is, it seems Cameroon is foolhardy enough to be playing with the tail of a sleeping cobra. We all know that this can result in the cobra asserting its self-defensive prowess. Besides, the Cameroonian press is not helping matters by not being objective and resorting to self-deception. For instance, the press in Cameroon anticipates the withdrawal of Nigeria from Bakassi Peninsula as a result of what it perceives as sustained international pressure. They believe that the pullout is probably being delayed while Nigeria searches for a way to keep its prestige intact as giant of Africa. Well, this imagined international pressure is a figment of the imagination of the Cameroonian authorities because Nigeria feels no such pressure from any quarter. The fact of Nigeria being the giant of Africa is not self-aggrandizement. The appellation was thrust on Nigeria by countries like Cameroon which had at one time or the other enjoyed enormous largess and support from Nigeria. It is a pity that the Cameroonian press is mounting a propaganda war that is giving it ego problems. The truth is that the Biya administration is struggling against a dwindling reputation. The press is, therefore, offering Cameroonians a distraction. But the frustration of the populace will surely come back once the inebriation of the press propaganda wears off. In spite of the heavy propaganda, mounted by Cameroon in international circles, its case is not progressing well. A good number of African countries, including Ghana and Guinea, have blamed Cameroon's threat antics over the Bakassi problem. In fact, President Rawlings of Ghana is not happy about the handling of the matter, particularly, at the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] level. He is known to have blamed President Soglo of Benin Republic, who is current chairman of ECOWAS, for allowing the Franco-Beninois military exercise at a time Nigeria was having problems with Cameroon. Although President Soglo apologized for his action, it is probably belated because his support for the French in their effort to intimidate Nigeria is what has given Cameroon the false security that has prolonged the dispute. Nigeria hopes that level-minded leaders like Rawlings will see the Bakassi dispute in its true perspective and openly call the bluff of France's Hitlerism. While Cameroon is working hard to deceive the world about the real situation on the ground in Bakassi Peninsula, it is still massing French military support. Even as recently as mid-April, 22 military vehicles and a cache of assorted arms and ammunition came into Cameroon from France to boost the already superfluous arsenals in the hands of Biya's unwilling soldiers. But the truth is that the Bakassi topsy-turvy by Cameroon is a ploy to detract from a restive population. Even those who want a war do so because they want Biya's administration to be weakened so that they can have their way. Right now, the Bakassi campaign has embolden various movements to move from their desire for restoration of federalism to outright secession. A forum known as All Anglophone Conference, an umbrella of many English-speaking groups, is spearheading the campaign. It has warned that unless the status quo in Cameroon is changed, secession is the alternative. But Paul Biya, ever so insensitive about the real problems of his countrymen and concerned only with his own personal interests, has other distractions. At the time the morale of Cameroonian soldiers is very low with those from the north complaining that they were being deployed to Bakassi to be eliminated so as to reduce their population in the Army, Biya was more concerned with erotic pleasures. At 61, he married 24-year old (Chantal Bevgoron) last April and left immediately with her to Europe on honeymoon, leaving Cameroonians to wallow in the depression his Bakassi campaign has caused. Well, Cameroonians now know better who their real enemy is because although Biya has fooled many of them most of the time, he cannot fool all of them all the time.
