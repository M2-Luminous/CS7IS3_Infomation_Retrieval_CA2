In his speech during the session of the Dniester Supreme Soviet, Smirnov said that Moldova owed Tiraspol 30 billion rubles for electricity supplied from Dniester. At the same time, the fees for licenses for external economic activity of the Dniester enterprises are transferred into Moldova's budget. The Dniester authorities intend to compel the enterprises in the Dniester Republic to register again. Now all taxes for licenses and other payments will be transferred in the budget of the self- proclaimed republic. According to Smirnov, the Dniester enterprises have transferred in Moldova's budget for the obtained licenses 85 billion rubles. Igor Smirnov also established by a decree customs duty for transiting goods on Dniester territory. According to that decree, for every truck with a cargo a $30 transit tax will be paid. The decree does not refer to transport means belonging to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.
