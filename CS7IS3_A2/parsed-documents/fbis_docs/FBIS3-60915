Adelaide Mendez, 50, had reported that she and her live-in boyfriend Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, from Houston, Texas, were walking to a restaurant late Tuesday when two men in a car abducted him. Mendez said she believed Nelson was kidnapped on the orders of his Filipina wife, Nimfa Pilapil, who was demanding child support. But investigators said they were wary of Mendez's account because she could not recall exactly where the kidnapping occurred, or the color and make of the car used in the abduction. Mendez was being investigated and police released no further information on her.
