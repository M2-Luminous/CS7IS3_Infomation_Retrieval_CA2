It is thanks to the mighty independent national economy that the DPRK has developed the economy unaffected by the worldwide economic fluctuation under the situation in which the socialist market collapsed and anti-DPRK campaign by the imperialists and reactionaries has been intensified as never before. Today Korea has many-sided and modern industry enough to produce by itself heavy and light industrial products needed for economic construction, defence upbuilding and people's living. In the electric power industrial domain the Pukchang thermal power complex, the Taechon power stations and many other large hydro and thermal power plants and minor power stations have been built. As a result, the electric power output was 55,500 million kwh in 1989 and that in late 1993 was 30 percent up on the 1986 figure. In mining industry, large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon and Pukchang and the Komdok general mining enterprise and other mines in Tanchon and Yanggang Province have been reconstructed on an expansion basis and a large number of new coal mines, ore mines and pits have been developed in those districts rich in deposit and favourable for mining. The coal output has grown year by year and in 1993 it was 40 percent up on the 1986 figure. The output of nonferrous metal ores increased 60 percent in the period of the fulfilment of the third seven-year plan. The production capacity of the Kim Chaek Iron and steel complex, the Chollima steel complex and other iron and steel works has expanded and new bases for producing various kinds of steel such as pressure pipes and stainless steel pipes have been built to considerably raise the steel output in the metal industry. With the rapid development of machine building, electronic, and automation industries, a great advance has been made in introducing precision, large-size and high-speed equipment and the material and technical foundations of the electronic and automation industries have been further consolidated. These sectors produced a 10,000-ton press, 125,000 kv-a [kilovolt-ampere] hydraulic generators, an extra-large-sized oxygen plant and NC [numerically controlled] machine tools and are now manufacturing complete sets of metal, chemical, building, electric and other equipment needed for different sectors of the national economy. With the development of chemical industry, light industry, fisheries and agriculture the need for the people's living is being met with domestic products. The Korean people have the mighty socialist independent national economy and abundant resources enough to live on their own efforts under any situation. No political and ideological offensive, economic blockade and military threat of the imperialists and reactionaries can frighten the Korean people.
