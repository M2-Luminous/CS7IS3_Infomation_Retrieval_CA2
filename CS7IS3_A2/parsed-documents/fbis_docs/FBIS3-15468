Peslyak including recorded interviews with S. Lozhkin, deputy director general of Russian State Television and Radio Company, and A. Lysenko, general director of Russian State Television and Radio Company, outside the Finance Ministry in Moscow, date not given -- from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Peslyak] Being decided in this building today is the question of whether Russian Television will continue to exist; whether you will watch us or not, and whether we know you are watching us. [Lozhkin] No meeting with the heads of the Ministry of Finance took place, but according to the information we have received, the Finance Ministry's position remained unchanged. It will meet about one quarter of the 1994 finance needs of Russian television and radio. [Peslyak] According to Anatoliy Lysenko, as a result only news and childrens' programs will be left, along with a few things on health and for pensioners, nothing more. No films or shows! [Lysenko] The destruction of Russian radio and television, which comrade Anpilov and DEN have spoken so much about, is indeed taking place. [Peslyak] We are talking about Russian Television, but is the First Channel involved here too? What will happen to Ostankino? [Lysenko] Exactly the same, just the same! I talked to Aleksandr Nikolayevich Yakovlev today. Broadcasting there is, altogether...[pauses] Well, we'll just have to get used to two hours or an hour of television at a time, which will be exclusively information. [Peslyak] The practice of lobbying exists all over the world, and there are powerful lobbyists in Russia, too -- agro-industrial lobbyists, lobbyists from the military industrial complex, and from defense. We, though, are hoping for help from millions of television viewers and radio listeners: They can influence deputies and the government.
