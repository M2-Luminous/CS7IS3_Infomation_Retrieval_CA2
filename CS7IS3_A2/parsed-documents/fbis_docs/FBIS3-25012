They are Desire Vieyra, minister of state in charge of national defense, and Alabi Antoine Gbegan, minister of interior, public security, and territorial administration. The delegation was welcomed at the Benin-Togo Hila Kondji border by Combevi Georges Agbodjan, minister of territorial administration and security, in the presence of the permanent undersecretary to the president of the Republic, and Colonel (Sezin Walla), commander of the National Gendarmerie. Soon after arriving in our capital the delegation was received in audience by General Gnassingbe Eyadema in Lome, Ward 2. After the audience, Mr. Vieyra, leader of the delegation, told newsmen that he was dispatched by Beninese President Nicephore Soglo to meet his Togolese counterpart for discussions on security problems between the two states, particularly the kidnapping of a Beninese subprefect by an armed gang. According to the Beninese Government, the kidnappers and the hostage took refuge in Togo. Let us listen to Mr. Vieyra: [Begin recording] [Vieyra] President Nicephore Soglo dispatched me to his friend and brother, President Gnassingbe Eyadema, to first discuss problems concerning our two countries, mainly security problems. As you know, there was an incident on our territory recently. An armed gang which, we think, was led by a fugitive soldier, kidnapped a subprefect and is holding him hostage. According to the information we have, we believe that they took refuge in Togolese territory. We have therefore been dispatched by President Nicephore Soglo to seek President Eyadema's assistance so that those bandits can be quickly found and the subprefect in question can be handed over safely to the Beninese authorities. We found in Gen. Eyadema all the necessary support, understanding, and availability that we were expecting of him, and we are returning confident that searches will continue and the matter will be settled. This affair should not be an obstacle to the friendly and fraternal relations that have always existed between Benin and Togo. [Unidentified reporter] Is it confirmed that the kidnappers and the subprefect are on Togolese territory? [Vieyra] In such cases, nobody can confirm anything, but according to our information we know that they crossed the Togolese border. Are they still on Togolese territory? We are not in a position to confirm that. [passage omitted] [end recording]
