FR940207-1-00063 FR940207-1-00013 Lastly, the license amendment dates for two additional sites, the Ford-Dawn Mining site and the WNI site both located in the Agreement State of Washington, are also beyond the dates contained in the MOU. However, Washington State notes that for these sites the closure date was changed because of the groundwater remediation schedule, and the difficulty experienced in drying the piles due to the evaporation and precipitation rates. In sum, EPA believes that the license amendments adopted by NRC and the Agreement States to date reflect a good faith attempt to implement the MOU and require closure of the sites as expeditiously as practical considering technological feasibility. While NRC and the Agreement States have obtained license amendments for all but one of the relevant sites, they have not as of yet established a record for enforcement of these milestones, including action on requests for extensions. Based on NRC representations, no milestones occurring after the date of the MOU, October 1991, have been missed and as included in footnote 2 of Table 1, an application for an extension is pending but no action has been taken. However, given their response to the requirements of the MOU, and the rulemaking being conducted by NRC to implement the requirements of subpart D, EPA believes it may well be able to conclude that the milestones established in the licenses for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier (i.e., the tailings closure plan (radon)) will be implemented and enforced in significant part on a programmatic and site-specific basis. The relevant portions of the amended licenses have been placed in the docket for this action, as well as letters from NRC to EPA apprising the Agency of the status of the license amendments. EPA and NRC have completed many actions required by the MOU, including: revising the NRC and affected Agreement State licenses to reflect the MOU requirements, promulgating amendments to EPA's UMTRCA regulations at 40 CFR part 192, subpart D, and proposing to conform the NRC regulations at 40 CFR part 10 to EPA's revised UMTRCA regulations. Based on EPA's review, to date, of the regulatory program established by NRC under UMTRCA (as contained at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A), EPA has determined that, once the timing and monitoring concerns are fully and finally addressed consistent with EPA's UMTRCA standards, as well as consistent with and including the other actions (e.g., license amendments) contemplated by the MOU, the NRC criteria will result in reclamation designs and schedules fully adequate to ensure compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). Additionally, EPA expects that when the NRC regulations are finally amended, the Agency should be able to find that NRC and the affected Agreement States are or will be implementing and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations governing disposal of tailings and the operating license requirements (tailings closure plan (radon)) that establish milestones for emplacement of a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard on a programmatic and a site-specific basis. The Agency intends ``in significant part'' to mean that NRC or an affected Agreement State is implementing and enforcing the regulatory and operating license requirements in a manner that EPA reasonably expected to not materially (i.e., more than de minimis) 1 interfere with compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee). As part of its determination, EPA requests comments on whether any judicial challenge to EPA's and NRC's regulations are to be expected and whether such challenge presents a significant risk of interference with the purposes and objectives of the MOU, as reflected in the regulatory changes as part of its determination of whether EPA's and NRC's regulatory changes have been effectively promulgated. 1 The phrase ``de minimis'' as used in this notice is not intended to be restricted to the meaning of section 112(g)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act, as amended. EPA does not intend to take final action on its proposals until NRC's regulations at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A, are effectively revised, as necessary and appropriate to implement the revisions to EPA's regulations at 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA does intend, however, to take final action on the proposed rescission prior to the time compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard is achieved at all sites. B. Reconsideration Provisions Under the Atomic Energy Act, NRC has the authority to waive, for reasons of practicability, the dual requirement of the MOU that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility. 42 U.S.C. 2114(c). NRC considers the term ``practicability'' to include certain economic considerations not contemplated by the requirement of the MOU that compliance occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility. In promulgating subpart T, the CAA did not permit, and EPA did not consider, site-specific waivers from ultimate compliance with that standard. Thus, as a theoretical matter, EPA recognized in its December 1991 proposal that this waiver authority might be exercised in a manner not addressed in the MOU even after the UMTRCA regulations have been promulgated and each license amended, although EPA has no reason to believe such relaxation of restriction will actually occur. Nevertheless, EPA recognized that this authority would not exist under the CAA and subpart T and, thus, there is some concern over the potential for deviation from the agreements contained in the MOU.
