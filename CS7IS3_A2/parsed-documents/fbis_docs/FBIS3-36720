Kozyrev told reporters both sides made clear their desire to conduct in a business-like manner -- without dragging feet or making haste -- preparations for the next Commonwealth summit meeting. "It is time we had such a meeting because many mutual problems can be resolved only at the presidential level," Kozyrev said. Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Kozyrev said that during his talks with Nazarbayev, they reached an agreement on focusing preparations on three main points -- the drafting of an agreement on military cooperation, for which some points of principle have already been agreed; cooperation in Baykonur, which Kozyrev is due to visit on Thursday to take a closer look at the situation in the former Soviet space centre; and aspects of double citizenship and a humanitarian package. The Russian minister dwelled in detail on the last point, because it was given much time and attention during his talks with Nazarbayev. This problems is most serious since it concerns very many people in Kazakhstan and Russia. But it should not be politicized or ideologized, or else viewed as inter-ethnic, Kozyrev said. Such an approach would play into the hand of nationalists in all Commonwealth countries. He said the question was of special concern to ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking people who found themselves in a very vulnerable situation as a result of current historical changes. The big, central treaty to be signed by Russian with Kazakhstan will contain a package of agreements on these matters with solutions proposed at a world practice level. The cardinal solution of the problem consists in giving every Russian and Kazakh the opportunity to fully exercise their rights. When moving from one country to the other, none of them should feel a foreigner. Other solutions to particular problems will be found, since the presidents of both countries think it necessary to speed up their preparation, including the drafting of the agreement on citizenship, in time for the Russian-Kazakhstan summit. All this inspires hope that by the time of the signing of the bilateral agreements, all demagoguery will have exhausted its potential in this respect, Kozyrev said. Kozyrev was evidently referring to the position of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and other fascist-like and nationalist circles, who, according to Kozyrev, are seeking to fan the issue in order to aggravate the political struggle and bank on it. They have no thought for the people when they seek to push nations to the verge of war. The problem can be solved by taking into account the interests of different ethnic groups on the basis of civilized, legal and peaceful approaches, Kozyrev said. The Commonwealth is moving towards economic integration but not towards a split, Kozyrev stressed. This understanding was made clear to him during his visits to Tashkent and Almaty. "We reached an agreement with President Nazarbayev on setting up working groups which will work fast and on a fundamental basis. Kozyrev resolutely rejected allegations of territorial claims between Commonwealth member states.
