Our correspondent Stefanos Kasimatis has the following report. [Begin Kasimatis recording] The YEETHA operations staff will be in a state of vigilance and readiness to follow developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Admiral Khristos Limberis believes the incident is not a reason to suspend peace efforts in the region. However, the chief of YEETHA does not rule out the possibility of a mistake by the U.S. aircraft since the identity of the planes shot down remains unclear. At the same time, Admiral Limberis noted that there are Galeb planes in Serbia's arsenal since they are built in that country and also noted that, according to his information, the Serbs in Bosnia have a small number of these aircraft. Belgian Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General [name indistinct], who is on an official visit to Greece, also made a statement on the incident. Despite the difference in emphasis, the positions of the Greek and Belgian general staffs coincide on the need for a political solution to the Bosnian issue. The Belgian lieutenant general said that military action can be used only to the extent that it pushes the belligerent sides to negotiate. [end recording]
