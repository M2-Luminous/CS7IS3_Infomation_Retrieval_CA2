The memorandum values the House's efforts to spread freedom and democracy in order to fulfill the requirements of the pan-Arab project. The memorandum refers to the continued detention by the Syrian authorities of a number of Jordanian political prisoners, including pan-Arab struggler Dafi al-Jam'ani, who has been imprisoned for 23 years without trial, and without any charges being brought against him, and who is considered to be the world's longest-held political prisoner. The memorandum says that al-Jam'ani is suffering from ill health, and appeals to the House of Representatives to take the initiative to urge the Syrian president to immediately release al-Jam'ani and other political prisoners so that they can return to their families after almost three decades of imprisonment.
