"I cannot see any other option -- there is simply none," Sergey Tsekov said at a news conference in Simferopol on Saturday. He said that, as the legislature discussed the matter, some of its members made more drastic proposals, namely for a referendum on the status of the peninsula. Restoration of the 1992 constitution is "the mildest form of relations with Ukraine," Tsekov said. Answering a question by Interfax-Ukraine, he said the ultimate objective of the Russia Bloc is to make Crimea an independent state and then unify it with Russia, although the peninsula might be "reunified" with Russia "together with Ukraine." "Many of the problems, above all economic ones, can only be solved by the integrating Ukraine with Russia," Tsekov said. He said nothing today poses a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity. Asked about troop movements in Crimea, Tsekov said, "There are such movements, but they are normal routine troop movements. No emergency measures have been planned." He ruled out that the Crimean parliament would be dissolved, for that, he said, would be illegal. "There are sensible people" in Ukraine's leadership, who "will not allow an aggravation of the relations with Crimea," he said.
