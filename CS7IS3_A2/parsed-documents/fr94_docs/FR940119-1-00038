FR940119-1-00038 FR940119-1-00011 The leak detection performance data should be provided as a log and may be submitted either as a computer printout or on a diskette using standard ASCII format. Historical performance data gathered during developmental phases such as system installation and modification also should be submitted. It would be helpful if commenters group data for each different data collection time period or pipeline segment, so that all data (questions 1&hyph;6) relates to only one specific segment and time period. For the purposes of these questions, a pipeline segment is defined as that part of the pipeline between two points where the product can be contained, such as between two pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and a terminal, between a pressure pump station and a valve, or between two valves. Question 1 : Provide the following general information about the segment of hazardous liquid pipeline to which the series of questions 1&hyph;6 relate: 1.1␣Pipeline segment length description covered in this data submission: 1.1.1␣Starting point (mile post or survey station no.) XXXX 1.1.2␣Ending point (mile post or survey station no.) XXXX 1.1.3␣Length of segment (miles) XXXX 1.2␣Pipeline nominal diameter (in.) XXXX 1.3␣Number of pumping stations on segment? XXXX 1.4␣Number of injection points on segment? XXXX 1.5␣Number of delivery points on segment? XXXX 1.6␣Commodity(s) transported during this data history XXXX 1.7␣Nominal flow rate (bbls/day) XXXX 1.8␣Beginning date covered by this data history (MM/DD/YY) XXXX 1.9␣Ending date of this data history (MM/DD/YY) XXXX Question 2: Classify the leak detection system(s) installed on this pipeline segment (check each that applies and answer questions 4 through 6 for each system checked). 2.1␣Mass balance XXXX 2.2␣Pressure wave XXXX 2.3␣External hydrocarbon sensor XXXX 2.4␣Other (specify) XXXX Question 3 : For each leak detection system checked in Question 2, check whether the system was supplied by an independent vendor or was the system developed within your company. 3.1␣For the system in Question 2.1? 3.1.1␣Vendor (name) XXXX 3.1.2␣Internal company developed XXXX 3.2␣For the system in Question 2.2? 3.2.1␣Vendor (name) XXXX 3.2.2␣Internal company developed XXXX 3.3␣For the system in Question 2.3? 3.3.1␣Vendor (name) XXXX 3.3.2␣Internal company developed XXXX 3.4␣For the system in Question 2.4? 3.4.1␣Vendor (name) XXXX 3.4.2␣Internal company developed XXXX Question 4 : For the alarm history, leak detection system availability history, and performance data of the leak detection system submitted, include answers to the following: 4.1␣For the time period reported, at what threshold volume was the leak detection system set to alarm (including any error bandwidth that is incorporated into that amount) (bbls.)? XXXX 4.2␣At that volume how long should detection take (mins.)? XXXX 4.3␣What was the average detection time for that volume (mins.)? XXXX 4.4␣For each alarm during the time period reported in your response to Question 4, include the following data: 4.4.1␣Alarm Initiated (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time 6 ) XXXX 6 ``Military time'' is using a 24 hour clock. For instance, 4:00 pm = 1600 hours or 5:15 pm = 1715 hours. 4.4.2␣Alarm Cleared (MM/DD/YR & hours & minutes in military time) XXXX 4.4.3␣The length of time it took to identify the cause of the alarm (if not equal to the difference between the initiation and cleared time)(mins.)? XXXX 4.5␣For each alarm, was the alarm attributed to one of these causes (Y/N)?
