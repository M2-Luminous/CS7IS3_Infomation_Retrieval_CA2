As yet, and after nearly one month, this document remains unsigned. When will it be signed and where.? [Al-Iryani] Really, it is regrettable that one month has passed and the document is still unsigned. The reason is that some wish to sign it abroad. This principle is welcomed. But, unfortunately, it has delayed the signing of the document more than needed. We thank God that we reached a final agreement that it will be signed on 20 of this month in the capital of the fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Personally, I had hoped that this document would be signed 24 hours after it was adopted. [Birru] Will President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali salim al-Bid leave for Amman to sign the document? [Al-Iryani] This is what has been agreed. I believe this will take place. [Birru] After this, will Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid return to Sanaa? [Al-Iryani] First of all, the document of pledge and accord is a document to end a crisis. The crisis with all its manifestations and consequences is known to all, specifically by the Yemeni people. Thus, the signing should end this crisis that has disturbed the people. One of the most important manifestations as to the end of the crisis, or the most important obligation resulting from the signing is that the state institutions, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and the House of Representatives should meet with all their members. If any of the present partitioning manifestations remains, this means a violation of the document and an evasion of its implementation. [Birru] The Yemeni Socialist Party has asked for security guarantees before signing the document and before Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid returns to Sanaa. What are these guarantees? [Al-Iryani] These are arrangements on which agreement will be reached, God willing, before the departure. In my opinion, these will be specific arrangements that will be immediately implemented upon the signature of the competent official quarters. These quarrters, of course, cannot start implementation, except after the state bodies meet to give them instructions for implementing them. There is no dispute about the adoption of security arrangements and implementing them. However, the present division obstructs the implementaton of these guarantees. God willing, agreement will be reached on the measures that will lead to implementation. All of this, in the end, depends on signing the document and on the state officials reassuming their duties to implement these guarantees. [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, it is noted that the Socialist Party and all its officials, including the prime minister, have moved to Aden. They are making decisions and appointing officials in south Yemen, the last of which was appointing a governor for Abyan area. How do you interpret this escalation? [Al-Iryani] I do not consider it as evidence of goodwill. But let us assume that the crisis atmosphere imposes some inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors. The signing of the document is sure to end all these practices, otherwise, all efforts made to conclude this document will be useless. The document now belongs to the whole Yemeni people, and no one can claim that he possesses it or that he is authorized to implement it by himself. Likewise, no executive authority party can avoid implementing it. Let us view all the regrettable developments and all the practices that are going on with good intentions. Let us consider them as imposed by the atmosphere of crisis although these practices are unconstitutional. What is important is the implementation after signing of the document. The first and most important test is the unity of the political leadership in words and deeds as stipulated by the document of pledge and accord. If this was not realized, I say that from now that the responsibility will be shouldered by those who did not commit themselves to its text. [Birru] You mean that the current escalation is a temporary one and, in your view, will be over after the signing of the document of pledge and accord? [Al-Iryani] This is true if we consider good intentions for bad behaviors. [Birru] Dr. al-Iryani, how do you view the situation? What is on the horizon? [Al-Iryani] I believe the signing of this national document, that belongs to the Yemeni people now, will be the test of commitment to the implementation and to adherence to unity and democracy. Any action that prevents the state's establishments from implementing the text of the accord will be a hostile action toward the Yemeni people as a whole. [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Thank you.
