Investigation and Prosecution of Parental Abduction Cases $250,000 Through this project, Title IV funds are used to provide assistance to local prosecutors that will allow them to more effectively prosecute non-custodial parents who abduct their children. The project will identify legal and social issues in these cases that should be addressed, summarize and analyze current research in this area, identify experts who have successfully prosecuted these cases, and produce legal analyses and guidelines that can be disseminated to prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. The grantee for this program is the American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI). No additional applications will be solicited in Fiscal Year 1995. Model Treatment & Services Approaches for Mental Health Professions Working With Families of Missing Children $195,000 This project is designed to provide mental health professionals with effective treatment approaches for the rehabilitation of families traumatized by child abduction so that a state of normalcy can be established in the aftermath of such events. During Fiscal Year 1995, training manuals and support materials will be developed that can be used during the implementation of treatment models defined during the project.
