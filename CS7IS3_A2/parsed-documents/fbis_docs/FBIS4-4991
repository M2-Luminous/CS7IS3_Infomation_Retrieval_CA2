The special committee decided the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly will hold an extraordinary session on 8 April to adopt a statement calling for a halt to landing and takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the crash is fully investigated, and to adopt a resolution protesting the crash of the F-15 fighter. During a question-answer session, Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office in the Okinawa Prefectural Government, made clear that he will fly to Tokyo on 6 April to ask the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the commander of U.S. Forces in Japan, and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to prevent a recurrence of the crash. Draft statements and resolutions to be adopted by the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly strongly protest the crash of the F-15 fighter, claiming: "The crash site is near Kadena Air Base's ammunition dump as well as tourist areas; it could have resulted in a terrible disaster." They also demanded a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash and a halt to landing and takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the crash is determined. During the session, members of the special committee agreed that "the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly, the Okinawa Prefectural Government, and Okinawans should take concerted actions to protest the accident." The special committee decided that the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly should send a delegation led by Speaker Mitsuo Gima to Tokyo on 13 April to protest the crash. During the question-answer session, members from the ruling and opposition parties asked the Okinawa Prefectural Government to strongly demand an investigation into the cause of the crash, while asking U.S. forces in Okinawa to explain a briefing given by a pilot involved. In response, Matayoshi stated: "We have yet to receive any report on the cause of the crash from U.S. forces in Okinawa." He added: "During my stay in Tokyo I will strongly ask for a report on the cause of the crash, including reports on past crashes." During the session, Matayoshi added that when he protested to U.S. forces in Okinawa over the crash, they replied: "The investigation will take six months at the longest." The crash inflicted damage to crops in tacitly approved fields near the crash site. As for the question of U.S. Forces compensating for the damage, Matayoshi said: "My understanding is there are rules providing for such compensation, but I will inquire with the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau about it."
