The decision to devaluate the dinar by 40 percent which went into effect Saturday was "not in Algeria's interest," the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper quoted Rabah Kebir, FIS leader outside Algeria, as saying in an interview published Tuesday. Under a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Algeria is to receive a 1-billion dollar loan. The measure also opened the door for other financial aid to the country. "The move does not solve the financial crisis facing Algeria. It is worsening it," Kebir told AL-HAYAH in the telephone interview, according to the daily which is published in several Arab capitals. "The front has said in the past its respect for loans contracted by the former Algerian Governments but it announced after the coup (scrapping of 1992 elections) that it would not respect any new loans," Kebir said. The FIS "considers any loan or any financial assistance from any country as not beneficial for the Algerian people. "These loans contribute to criminals who kill innocents in the streets," he added. The devaluation has triggered criticism in Algeria. Islamic groups have said the government crackdown on militants claimed more than 500 lives and was part of a plan to "help the country swallow the IMF plan's impoverishing of the masses." Algeria's main trade union, the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers], said it was unhappy that it was not included in the IMF negotiations and will call for strikes if the effects of the devaluation become unbearable for workers. Other associations said the plan was not well-adapted to social conditions in the country and have pledged to form an "anti-IMF front." After the devaluation, the dollar stands at 36 dollars.
