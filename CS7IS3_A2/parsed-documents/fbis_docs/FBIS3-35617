In particular, it reads that on 27 January 1994, the Polish newspapers ZYCIE WARSZAWY and SZTANDAR MLODYCH published a report about a court case that was being instigated against three Polish citizens on 31 January and that they were being accused of smuggling. One of the accused described himself as an agent of the Polish special services. This gave the mentioned newspapers grounds for describing the case as revenge for Lysenko and a Polish-Ukrainian smuggling and espionage war. The Ukrainian Embassy announced that the criminal case that was initiated against the Polish smugglers over a year ago has no bearing on the case of Major Anatoliy Lysenko. None of the Polish citizens are being accused of espionage, and that is why there can be no question of revenge or an espionage war. The Ukrainian side regards the arrest of Major Lysenko as a spy to be groundless, and that is why it has continuously demanded his release.
