According to him, the region where the Russian battalion was carrying out its duties is one of the most dangerous in Sarajevo. At the same time, the Russian diplomat stressed that "every necessary step is being taken to create political guarantees of security." With regard to the possibility of increasing the Russian contingent of peacekeeping troops, Vitaliy Churkin said that "there is no immediate necessity for this to be done." However, in his opinion, the need for additional peacekeeping forces will certainly arise in the near future, when a peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached. The Russian diplomat believes that "there are still many dangers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no place for euphoria. It is important not to lose momentum and get down to political settlement. If there is no settlement, this psychologically opportune moment can be lost and all sorts of things might yet happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina." In Vitaliy Churkin's opinion, there are no "fundamental differences" in Russia's or NATO's approaches to the Bosnian crisis. He stressed that now everybody understands that "the Sarajevo experience cannot fully be transplanted to other regions and hot spots in Bosnia and Herzegovina." At the Bonn meeting, in particular, there were no calls for using strong arm tactics. There was full understanding of the need for political settlement.
