Disclosing that some sections of the enquiry have been handed over to the Milanese prosecutor's office, the sources said the Left Democrat Party officials whose names have come up during the collection of evidence include Party Secretary Achille Occhetto, his right-hand man Massimo D'Alema, and others. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, an ex-Christian Democrat, said in an electoral speech in Pisa that the investigators had so far shown "little curiosity" about contracts granted left-wing cooperatives. According to Andreatta's charges, the left-wing parties seemed to be unaware of the way in which many of the present cases involving crimes against the public finances included agreements drawn up to leave space for these cooperatives, especially in those working in construction. In particular, he mentioned, but failed to identify more precisely cases in Milan in 1975, in Sicily, in the area covered by the former Fund for the Mezzogiorno to finance development in southern Italy, and in aid projects, for example in Mozambique. [passage omitted] Judicial sources, who disclosed that a meeting of investigators here this morning covered the state of play in the investigations and speculated that they may extend more widely, confirmed that Occhetto and others were on the list of those who had entered the enquiries, a formal procedure for anyone whose name crops up during the collection of evidence, but far short of issuing any form of subpoena or warrant. The judicial sources said that all the cases in question were among those mentioned in a dossier submitted to the Roman judicial authorities in February by former Socialist Party Secretary Bettino Craxi, himself under multiple investigation for accusations of massive corruption, illegal party funding, and other misdeeds. The sources said that the cases extracted from the dossier and handed on to the Milanese prosecutors include the building of the Milanese subway and the re-building of Malpensa Airport; the installation of emission purification plant at Brindisi power station; and various bribes allegedly paid for construction contracts. [passage omitted] The sources said the Rome prosecutor's office has kept the section of Craxi's dossier alleging that the ex-Communist Party received illicit funding from East Europe. Many of the charges within the competence of the Milanese investigators have already been shelved for some defendants, only to be exhumed when Craxi cited the names of Occhetto, D'Alema and the others in Rome. The Left Democrat Party's lawyer, Guido Calvi, pointed out that the various names involved had been registered in Rome on the list of those whose names appear in an enquiry only on the basis of Craxi's allegations. In a further step, as the result of a recent agreement between the Turin, Milanese, Roman and Venetian judiciaries, the investigators agreed to criteria for territorial competence in anti-corruption enquiries whereby the Roman magistrates have now sent back those sections of Craxi's allegations that "could find no roots in Rome," Calvi noted. "Nothing more has happened, and nothing more could happen, since Milan has been investigating the subway and Malpensa for over a year, and the preliminary hearings are now very close," said the lawyer, who also appealed for respect for the facts of the case: "The rest is pure, shameful electoral speculation". A statement from the Left Democrat Party also pointed out that entering a name on the register of those entering an enquiry is a "formal obligation which is therefore automatic." The statement also reiterated the Left Democrats' conviction that Craxi's allegations were based on "slanderous and unfounded accusations destined solely to set up hurdles and traps on the path of justice." Meanwhile, in a radio interview, Milan's Chief Prosecutor Saverio Borrelli said that, "after deep thought," his office has decided to pursue its anti-corruption investigations "as if there was no electoral season." "I would be a hypocrite if I said the problem doesn't exist," added Borrelli of the debate over whether the enquiries should proceed during the campaign for the March 27/28 vote, but he also pointed out that, if the investigators were to allow their work to be conditioned by political circumstances as regards "timing, let alone substance," accusations of having pursued political criteria in rendering justice would surely follow. "Even delaying acts for which the time is ripe in strictly judicial terms could be a choice representing a favour to one political side and a disfavour to another, and tomorrow could represent a reason for blame," he noted. In other points, he said it was a simple rule of "good civic education" to read the acts of the magistrature for what they are and for what they "objectively appear as." "I think it is uncivil...to try to psychoanalyse a measure, carrying out psychoanalysis of the motivation in order to claim that the words say one thing, but underneath them there is something else."
