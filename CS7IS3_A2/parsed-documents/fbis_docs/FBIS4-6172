Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Insight 1994 meeting in Sydney on Monday [18 April], Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan is well positioned to expand its already significant role as a contributor to regional economic cooperation and development, especially as a supporter of Asia's developing economies. "We can serve as an effective gateway for overseas investors who wish to enter Asia's fast-growing markets," he said. He said Taiwan has four key assets in shaping its future economic role in the Asia-Pacific region -- its geographic location, its rapid economic development and highly skilled labor pool, its manufacturing and engineering resources, and its historical and cultural links with its neighbors. Attending the meeting were business leaders and senior officials from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea. Among them were Singapore's former Prime Minister Li Kuan Yew and Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. Hsiao said Taiwan's trade with the Asia-Pacific region totaled US$120 billion in 1993, accounting for 75 percent of its overall trade. About 35 percent of Taiwan's total trade is with South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Mainland China, he said. The ROC has become the largest investor in Vietnam, the second largest in both Malaysia and Mainland China, the third largest in Indonesia, [words indistinct] Thailand and the fifth largest in the Philippines, he said.
