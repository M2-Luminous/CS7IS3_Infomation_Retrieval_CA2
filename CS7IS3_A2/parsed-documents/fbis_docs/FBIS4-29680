FBIS4-29680 "dreas119__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa Task Force Established OW1706112594 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706112594 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Tokyo -- The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee held a meeting at the New Sanno U.S. Forces Center in Minato-ku, Tokyo on 16 June. In the meeting, committee members agreed to establish a "task force" under the Special Committee on Facilities [SCF] to deal with the issue concerning the return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. The task force will be composed of working-level officials from the U.S. Forces Headquarters in Japan, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA]. It will discuss technical matters about the issue of providing U.S. forces with a substitute for the airfield, and the possibility of removing Sobe communications site, which is adjacent to the airfield, to another place. Commenting on the establishment of the task force, DFAA Director General Ichiro Yoneyama said: "I hope it will work for the return of the airfield." The task force is scheduled to hold its first meeting before the end of June. DFAA Facilities Coordination Officer Akira Sato has been appointed Japanese chairman of the task force. The Foreign Ministry is currently looking for suitable officials for members of the force. Colonel Malepoty [name as published], SCF chairman, is in charge of selecting U.S. members. It is expected that about 20 Japanese and U.S. officials will be picked as task force members before the first meeting is held. U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner recently visited Japan to attend a meeting of the Consultative Committee of Japan- U.S. Security. On that occasion, Wisner and Yoneyama agreed that "developed communications technology may make the current vast radio wave buffer zone unnecessary." Thus, the task force is expected to look for a substitute for Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and to discuss in detail technical aspects of two possible measures to return the airfield to the locality -- one is removing Sobe communications facilities to other site and the other is reducing the size of the buffer zone. With the establishment of the task force, the existing "task force to study removal of parachute training area at Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield" was dissolved. This task force was established in 1982 to survey suitable land for a substitute. It has proposed several sites as a substitute. The results of the survey will be given to the new task force. In recent years, problems concerning the return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, the return of Naha Military Port, and the suspension of live shell firing exercises across highway 104 have drawn attention as three pending issues. The establishment of the new task force is expected to help make progress in solving the airfield issue. Meanwhile, Joint Committee members also agreed on the return of a 16,000-square-meter lot located east of Camp Kuwae, which Chatan town has demanded to construct a health center there.
