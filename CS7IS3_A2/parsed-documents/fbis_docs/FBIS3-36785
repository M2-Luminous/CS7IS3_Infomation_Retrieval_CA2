The Latvian and Estonian foreign ministers are expected to arrive there too. A meeting with Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen will be held to discuss the links of the Baltic states with NATO. The three foreign ministers were invited to Copenhagen to discuss the Partnership for Peace agreement, because Denmark feels it has a special responsibility for the Baltic states. The agreement is not yet a proposal to become a member of NATO; however, it provides the possibility of taking part in joint military exercises and receiving consultations from NATO if a threat arises against these states. It has been proposed to determine the date of the expiry of the agreement and the conditions of future membership. Apart from this, the costs with regard to the partnership and practical means of cooperation wdill be discussed at the meeting. The relations of the Baltic countries with the European Union will be one of the issues under discussion.
