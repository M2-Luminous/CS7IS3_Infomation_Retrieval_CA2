FR940106-2-00072 FR940106-2-00036 It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. General Statutory Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' ``High rate'' means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1989 or 1990, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing 1989 or 1990 graduates in the specified settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year (1990) are working in these settings. Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the Federal Register at 58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993.
