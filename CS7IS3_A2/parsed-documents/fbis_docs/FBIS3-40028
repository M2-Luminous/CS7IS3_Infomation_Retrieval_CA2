"He is unreliable -- a regional leader destined to disappear as soon as he tries to acquire a national dimension." The League? "It will collapse in the elections." These words are worthy of a sworn enemy, but they were actually spoken by [National Alliance (AN) leader] Gianfranco Fini, the League's ally in the elections. There is constant strife within the alignment clustered around [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. While Bossi, for his part, attacked the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] from Milan, vindicating the League's hegemony within the right-wing alignment, the AN leader fired a volley against the Senator [Bossi nickname] in an interview with MILANO FINANZA. "Bossi has no concrete arguments," Fini said in the interview. "He can shout when he stands there alone, claiming to be a tough guy, but when it comes to moving on from the shouting stage to the reasoning stage, he becomes unreliable and is not recognized as a leader." Fini was almost laughing at the League's political chances in the future: "Bossi had to join an alliance with Berlusconi because he knew that Forza Italia would take half of the votes away from him. The League could hold its ground," Fini added, "as long as it presented itself as an absolute novelty. However, the real novelty today is Forza Italia -- and, in the north, the AN may also constitute a novelty." The AN leader went on to give his grim forecasts of the League's electoral results: "I am convinced that, in the proportional voting, the League will be deserted by its supporters in favor of us and Forza Italia." However, Fini was predicting a difficult outcome for the political situation after the elections: "I do not think that an overwhelming victory of any of the contending forces is likely. It could happen, of course, but I do not believe it will. Instead, we risk ending up with a parliament in which those with the least support, namely [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, will wield a much greater power -- the power of restraint." This scenario reminded Fini of the situation in past years: "It is the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] old power scheme, typical of a proportional voting system. It is also the best way to set off on the wrong foot, but unfortunately this is exactly what may happen." Finally, according to Fini, [President] Scalfaro will have to resign as soon as the elections are over: "The last president of the First Republic cannot be the first of the Second Republic, and this is so irrespective of the illegal funding and the Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] affair."
