In a statement released today the minister said it was of paramount importance at this critical time that the entire Basotho nation should join hands and strive to combat all acts of sabotage which were aimed at frustrating Lesotho's democracy. He said the acts of lawlessness and crime perpetrated by criminal offenders were not aimed at destabilizing the ruling Basotholand Congress Party, BCP, but were instead aimed at causing national instability and the frustration of the democratic process. Mr. Malie said it was necessary to project tolerance and respect for one another among the people of Lesotho and that further bloodshed in Lesotho should not be allowed to take place. The minister said it was unfortunate that political gatherings by the main opposition Basotho National Party, BNP, and reports by its official newspaper (Mothlanka) left much to be desired. This, together with utterances by some of the leadership of the BNP, could have disastrous effects. Mr. Malie condemned the acts of abduction of people and misuse of government property, such as vehicles, by the striking police and said such acts were detrimental to the economic, social, and political stability of the country. The acts condemned by the minister included the brutal killing of the BCP youth leader, (Selabalo Mathie), the abduction of the principal secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and some police officers, and the erection of road blocks. The minister extended his appreciation to members of the Lesotho army who had responded promptly in dealing with the rampant lawlessness and the instability in some parts of the country.
