Addressing the gathering of Congress Parliamentary Party members on Friday he said that India cannot avoid multilateral trade anymore; we are having to import fertilizers, machinery, and many other important commodities, and we have to sign the GATT so that there can be control in these dealings. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji spoke in a manner alleviating distrust and fear towards the negotiations. He answered questions posed by members. Many members felt if this briefing had been timely, they could have handled the agitated opposition effectively in the parliament. At first, when GATT's chief author/director Arthur Dunkel revealed his plans by means of drafted proposals, there was a lot of apprehension of what its consequences to the developing countries would be. Prime Minister Rao pointed out that the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had sent a high level delegation comprising of then finance minister V. P. Singh, K.C. Pant and others to the first round of discussions following its introduction. Pranab Mukherji said it is not clear what the opposition parties are trying to say. He said that even the Gujral Committee recommends that it is best to stay in and negotiate for the most concessions. Getting out in a huff or staying aloof is not the right course of action. He reminded everyone that no party had wanted India to get out of the consortium.
