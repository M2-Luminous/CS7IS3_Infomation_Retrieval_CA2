In recent months the China National Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC] once again made its mark domestically and internationally with the signing of a series of cooperation contracts with foreign partners to prospect for and exploit oil reserves in the East China Sea. So far they have signed 18 contracts and agreements with nine oil consortiums formed by 15 companies from seven countries. Its foreign partners would provide a total of $300 million in risk investment. According to authoritative persons, the bidding for contracts on the East China Sea's oil resources were conducted with even more success than those for previous oil contracts, with such major world-famous oil companies as Texaco, Chevron, Esso, Agip, Shell, and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company Limited emerging as successful bidders. The CNOOC's well-established enterprise image within the international oil industry and its excellent reputation as a business partner--in addition to such major factors as China's political stability, rapid economic development, and the deepening of reform and opening up to the outside world--played a major role in bringing about such success. The following is a related report by our station reporter Xu Hualing: [Begin recording] [Xu] With the spring festival drawing near, evening parties fill Beijing. The CNOOC's new year reception at the Chang Jiang Hotel takes on an entirely new look. Its foreign liaison manager, Zhu Dazhi, told me that today's guests include many representatives of foreign oil companies in Beijing as well as domestic business partners. The foreign companies have very good cooperative ties with the CNOOC. As all the guests are watching with great interest the performers passing amongst them and walking up to the stage, I began looking for interviewees from among the crowd. Excuse me, you are Esso's representative in China, correct? [Unidentified Esso representative] Yes, I am. [Xu] Would you please tell me when Esso began its cooperation with the CNOOC? [Esso representative] Esso is known as Exxon in the United States. We began to explore opportunities for cooperation with China back in 1978, and signed our first mineral prospecting contract with China in 1979. We established a representative office here as early as 1981. That was when I first came to China. [Xu] We know the Exxon Corporation has many oil exploitation projects and sites around the world, and has established very good cooperative ties with many countries in oil exploitation. What are your comments on the CNOOC in comparison with other foreign companies? [Esso representative] In short, we may say the CNOOC, like other oil companies around the world, has a work style in absolute conformity with international standards and caters to international cooperation. [Xu] Hello, sir. You are the Chevron Corporation's chief representative in Beijing. Would you please give us your comments on the CNOOC? [Unidentified Chevron representative] Of course I can. I feel that the CNOOC has, from the day of its founding, always operated under the criterion of foreign cooperation. Such a condition makes it easy for them to carry out harmonious cooperation with foreign counterparts, get their work on track, and be accepted by foreign companies. Moreover, because of their early intent to reform and open up to the outside world, they are also especially quick to accept foreign knowledge of advanced management as well as production and prospecting techniques, thus achieving particularly rapid development. [Xu] Compared to Esso, Chevron, and other large companies in the world which have been around for decades or even a century, the CNOOC is a novice, with a history of only 11 years. Nevertheless, the rapidity of its development and growth has drawn worldwide attention. In his modest words, CNOOC General Manager Wang Yan reviews this history with a hint of his sense of accomplishment. [Wang] Over the past decade, the CNOOC has gone through three stages. First, we carried out foreign cooperation immediately after the CNOOC's founding. As we had reached a higher level and accumulated some capital by 1987, we began to gradually increase the proportion of oil prospecting and exploitation carried out on our own. By now our independent work has already substantially outweighed foreign cooperation projects. We are now able to independently carry out not only prospecting, but also construction, exploitation, and some installation work at sea. We can handle all offshore operations by ourselves. With the standards of some of our techniques, we can operate not only in Chinese but also international waters. [Xu] So far 10 oil and gas fields have been tapped and put into production, and 10 more are currently under construction in the vast expanse of Chinese waters which were absolutely empty a decade ago. By 1997, China will have 20 offshore oil and gas fields producing 12 million metric tons of crude oil and 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. [end recording]
