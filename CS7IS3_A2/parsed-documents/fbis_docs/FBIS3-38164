Chief of Staff spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu said that all targets in Zhalah have been completely destroyed, adding that in line with the confirmation of any information and political authorities' directives, the TAF may at any moment repeat similar operations. Following close inspection of detailed air photographs of the region, it was determined that all the targets, including training installations, tents, buildings, warehouses, and communications bases have been hit and destroyed, Silahcioglu said, adding that a total of 132 bombs were thrown at the terrorist bases. Accordingly, in line with the number of targets hit, there has also been a large number of losses among the terrorist members present in the camp at that time, he added. Silahcioglu further said the aim of the operation was to incapacitate all the elements of the organization, and this "was reached with the destruction of the logistic center, the training camp, in a way that cannot be repaired." Answering a reporter's question on whether northern Iraqi officials were warned or not, Silahcioglu said that Turkey has in the past repeatedly warned the northern Iraqi officials, that the terrorist targets in the region may be hit at any moment.
