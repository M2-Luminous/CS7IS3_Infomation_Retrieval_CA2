The decline of exports was the most visible characteristic of foreign trade in 1993 which resulted in a spectacular deterioration of the trade balance. In 1993, exports were 13 percent lower than a year before. The reduction was typical mainly in the sales to market economy countries. Within this, Hungarian exports to the countries of the European Union (EU) decreased by 18 percent. In 1993, the amount of imported goods increased by almost 21 percent. Of this, 12 percent more goods arrived from the market economies and 49 percent more from transforming [atalakulo] countries. The latter was mainly in connection with on-off deliveries like MiG airplanes or the repair of Lithuanian airplanes. As a result, the import of machinery and transport vehicles from these countries increased almost sevenfold. The volume of imports exceeded the previous year in all main product groups. In addition to significantly increased machinery import, the import of consumer industrial goods from the transforming countries and foodstuffs from the market economies increased the most, by 66 and 18 percent respectively. The KSH detected further deterioration in the first quarter of 1994. While exports calculated at current prices increased by 25 percent, imports exceeded the level of the same period last year by 30.8 percent. A little over half of the balance deterioration arose in trade with the market economies, mainly with EU member states.
