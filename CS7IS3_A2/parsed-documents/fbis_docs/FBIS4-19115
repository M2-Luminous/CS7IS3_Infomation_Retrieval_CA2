Rwanda is about to have a completely new regime, that of the rebels. What will your government's attitude be toward this new regime? [Dehaene] I do not believe that we can anticipate how the situation will shape up. I believe that, in a country such as Rwanda with two tribes, only a negotiated settlement will offer a long-term solution. I believe, however, that it is still too early to comment on this. We have to continue our efforts, together with the United Nations, to find a negotiated settlement, just like we did for the Arusha agreement. [Becaus] Professor Doom of Ghent University has reproached the government for not not having an Africa policy, that it is acting like a fire brigade in Africa. What is your reaction to this? [Dehaene] I have much respect for professors who give advice after the fact. I believe that today, as a result of the president's killing, we are facing a new situation which we could not have anticipated. We indeed are facing a new situation, and, as we told the parliamentary commission earlier this week, together with Parliament we will have to define a new policy, or at least adapt our policy to the new situation. This applies both to our African policy in general and to the way in which we will organize our African development aid. Given the current sensitivity and emotions, we have to avoid making rash decisions which will have a long-term consequences. I believe that, in the long term, we will have to continue our aid to and development work in Rwanda and in Africa, although today we can provide only humanitarian aid. But we will have to examine this more carefully once we understand the new situation in Rwanda, and then make decsions based on a long-term perspective.
