Concluding that production could be increased on the basis of consumer loans, he, at the same time, announced their introduction. Dragoslav Avramovic stressed that it is encouraging that we have noted a drop in unemployment for the first time since the outbreak of the war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. He added that the policy of the National Bank of Yugoslavia is determined by the fact that more than half of the capacities in the economy are unexploited, while the reserves in the labor force are also great. Dragoslav Avramovic is of the opinion that company profits should be taxed and not salaries.
