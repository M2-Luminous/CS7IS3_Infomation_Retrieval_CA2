Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov supplies further details: [Begin Stoyanov recording] Basic attention was devoted to the visit of Lord Owen and Stoltenberg to Bulgaria and the forthcoming Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of countries bordering on former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria's position is as follows: It will participate in the meeting only if the foreign ministers of all invited countries participate. The president expressed his doubt whether this meeting could contribute anything to achieving peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially against the background of Saturday's [5 February] massacre in Sarajevo. It was again pointed out that Bulgaria's position on the situation in former Yugoslavia remains unchanged. Bulgaria opposes any armed involvement in the conflict of Balkan or other countries bordering on former Yugoslavia. In the past other countries joined this position, and recently Greece repeated that it adheres to the same position. [end recording]
