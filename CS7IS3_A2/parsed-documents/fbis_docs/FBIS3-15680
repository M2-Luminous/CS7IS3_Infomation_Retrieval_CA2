During the elections, six CSCE teams visited more than 50 polling stations in Almaty, Kapchagai, Issyk and other cities to supervise their opening and closing and the counting of votes. Winship's conclusion that the elections were undemocratic is based on the fact that political parties and movements and individual candidates did not have enough time to organize their election campaigns, while an entangled candidate registration procedure provoked offenses on the part of constituency electoral commissions. In addition, the national roll compiled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev ensured 20 percent of seats in the future parliament for government officials, according to the CSCE experts. There were registered cases where one person voted for several candidates. CSCE experts revealed instances where electoral commission members forged or replaced ballots. The Central Electoral Commission also withdrew independent candidates under unconvincing pretexts. There were cases when local authorities put pressure on electoral commissions, Winship said. But the main flaw of the elections was that "many electors did not understand the system of voting and voted simultaneously for several candidates," the CSCE experts said. In some towns, such as Kapchagai, located only 60 km from Almaty, some pollling stations were closed, which prevented about 5,000 people from voting. Besides, the independent media had limited access to information on the elections, Winship said.
