The communique states that the CE experts said that Gagauzians cannot assume priority over other national minorities that live in Moldova: they believe that Gagauzians can receive only cultural autonomy. The CE experts agreed with the Gagauz Parliamentary Commission on the 12 articles of the draft law on the "Gaguz Eri" project. The law's preamble and Articles 1, 2, and 12 on the Gagauzians' self-determination and Gagauz Eri self-administration as well as the prerogatives of the local administration were discussed. The CE recommendations are juridical amendments that were accepted by the Gagauz side. The communique states that the "meeting in Comrat was productive. However, as a result of the negotiations held with the CE representatives the conclusion can be drawn that an unjustified delay in settling the Gagauz problem is again imposed due to Moldovan officials that create artificial barriers and deceive not only the Moldovan public but the international organizations as well." It is obviously Moldova's wish to enter the CE without resolving political problems, but the Gagauz issue impedes the fulfillment of this wish: that is why spirits are again stirred around a problem that should have been settled long ago, states the communique.
