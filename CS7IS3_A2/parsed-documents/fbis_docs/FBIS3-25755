Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, Fantahum Michael, told AFP Saturday [26 February] that he personally presented the request to Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira on Wednesday. He said Shamuyarira told him he would present the request to the cabinet and a response could be expected at a later date. The Zimbabwean authorities have not yet responded publicly to the request. Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe just before a 1991 uprising in his country and was granted political asylum by President Robert Mugabe, a former ally, in May 1991. Early this month, Mengistu breached one of his conditions of asylum, and broke years of silence over his home country saying Ethiopia was in a "disgusting" state and that he had plans to rescue it. Michael, however said the extradition request was not sparked off by Mengistu's recent outburst. He said it was a coincidence as preparations had already been underway to ask for his extradition. The request was finalised in Addis Ababa on February 15 and brought to Harare this week by a team of European lawyers helping the government of Meles Zenawi investigate Mengistu's human rights violations together with some members of the office of the special prosecutor of Ethiopia. The request documents detail Mengistu's abuse of human rights, which included the massacre of at least 100,000 Ethiopians. Analysts say it is likely to take months before Zimbabwe answers to the request as it will take legal experts from both countries, as well as international agencies to meet and examine the various points of international law under which the extradition and trial should take place. The DAILY GAZETTE newspaper said Saturday that the Ethiopian Government was also seeking the extradition of Mengistu's aides, 24 of whom were in Kenya, 14 in the United States, six in Europe and several others in other African nations. Three of the wanted aides are reportedly holed up in the Italian Embassy in Addis Ababa and many others are already in Ethiopian Government custody.
