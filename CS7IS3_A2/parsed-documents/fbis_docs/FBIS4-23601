In the studio with us today is Mr. Mathews Phosa, the premier of the Eastern Transvaal Province. Welcome to you. But before we start, let's look at a background sketch on Mr. Phosa and the Eastern Transvaal. [passage omitted] [Berry] Nice to have you with us in the studio. You have two obvious problems that one wonders how you're going to address. The one is that one of your biggest potential earners, the Kruger Park, is divided between two provinces, yours and Northern Transvaal, and you have the story of the two capitals. Which one should we take first, the Kruger Park? [Phosa] Let's start with the Kruger Park. The Kruger Park stretches from around Messina right into the Eastern Transvaal. The administrative structures are in the Eastern Transvaal and I think they are going to remain there. [Berry] Can you ensure that, because it doesn't make sense not to do that. [Phosa] Well, we have dealt with that already. What we need to do, we need to be fair to the Northern Transvaal. We need to share some aspect of the income, because some of the tourists will be going through the Northern Transvaal and of course the national government will also want to take the Kruger National Park, which is quite reasonable. So that's an area which we need to contest and see what we get out of it. With regard to the capital, at the moment we have allowed a debate to continue because we've always said that we should have people-driven decisions taken, and this is a good example. We've allowed a very good debate to go on. It has narrowed to Witbank and Nelspruit, and we interviewed Witbank and Nelspruit last week. They both made substantial presentations, and we've now asked them to come together and say to us how much will it cost. It's going to depend on the cost now. We cannot ignore the cost. It would be stupid to do so. If it's going to be cheap to have a capital in Nelspruit, we'll have it in Nelspruit. If it's going to be cheap to have it in Witbank, we'll have it in Witbank. So we're going to look at the cost and the cost only. [Berry] I must say to the viewers in the Eastern Transvaal who have just joined us, you specifically. We were talking earlier, and he actually doesn't have any preconceptions, so it's going to be a fair choice. [Phosa] It must be a fair choice, and I'm happy that it will have been a choice proceeded by expansive consultations and input from business and the community as a whole, and that gives me a very good feeling about the matter -- the way it's been handled. [De Vos] A lot of problems can be solved through negotiations and talking to people, and finding out what budgets are and what moneys are available. But some of the other problems that also came out in this profile we saw on the province, I think one of the major problems that you do face is the pollution problem through the heavy industry which the province has and also through forestry. You know, trees being planted on the upper slopes, retaining the water, etcetera, etcetera. Those two problems coupled to Kangwane, which has a growth rate at the moment of about 7 percent, which is one of the highest in the country. Now put those together and you have a major headache on its way. Have you considered those issues? [Phosa] Well, the question of pollution is not peculiar only to the Eastern Transvaal. It's a problem peculiar to industrialization and a lot of things are being done to try and reduce the level of pollution, especially in areas of Witbank. I was mentioning to you earlier this funny concept about healthy pollution. It's very expensive to get involved in [word indistinct] pollution. But something is being done. I am satisfied there. We discussed it with members of the Witbank town council because it is a matter of concern. The ozone layer is quite low there, and we need to deal with it on a continuous basis. The same thing with forestry. One other thing that we have to look at is how to conserve nature; and we are going to be very strict with some of the companies which are not careful about how to deal with nature like water and everything. The aspect of the 7 percent, it's related to the entire region; it's in fact 9 percent of the national GDP [Gross Domestic Product]. We are the second smallest region, but we are the fourth strongest economically in the country. [Berry] When we talk about Kangwane, it has a high unemployment rate, the people are poor, they're close to game reserves. How are you going to enforce the preservation of our natural resources as in wild life and trees and bushes, and that sort of thing, as well as managing to help these people? [Phosa] You see, we've got two rural settlements in the Eastern Transvaal; it's Kangwane and Kwandebele. There is enough room for everybody. The tourism development which we want to embark on is not going to affect in any way the residential areas of the people in Kwandebele or Kangwane. The beauty of the Eastern Transvaal is there, it's given. It's how we are going to develop it. Now, we obviously are talking about decentralizing power in Eastern Transvaal. In a particular way the issue of the capital is part of the discussion. We want to create the one stop service: Witbank, Nelspruit, Secunda, where you will have officials who will give service to the people and resolve problems of people on the spot. But the third element is departmental decentralization which is guided by the needs and the resource base. Here again we are having debates. We think it is a very good idea to bring government close to the people, where decisions can be taken at the lowest local level. You don't disrupt people, you don't shuttle people around, you say tourism is best suited in Nelspruit, Hazyview, Sabie. You put your head office there for tourism. Trade and industry is in Secunda, you put it there. Most economic activities are in Witbank, you put it there. Policing is more in Middelburg. You put it there. You don't shuttle people around in this whole transformation. [De Vos] I wonder if Middelburg will agree with the policing [laughter]. [Berry] And are you looking for the policy of educating the people into not bleeding land, not stripping the trees, and deforesting the area? Half of Northern Transvaal has been completely wiped out. Look at Lesotho and the terrible erosion there. [Phosa] We don't have such a problem in Eastern Transvaal. On the contrary, we have too many forests, and we are happy to have those forests. We would like them to grow. That's an industry on its own. We don't have that problem really. We would want to focus on empowering our people. We do have a number of problems. You heard what was mentioned there. A lot of these big companies make money in the Eastern Transvaal and it flows out to some headquarters somewhere. We do have a problem with that and we are going to engage commerce and industry into serious discussion which will lead to them having to invest substantial parts of their profit from where they get the wealth. We have a problem with that. Per capita income is 180 rands per month. It's very low, taking into account the wealth of the province. Now we need to reinvest in there. Questions like beneficiations [as heard] of raw material in Eastern Transvaal can only lead to more job creation for our people there and absorb this labor force in Kangwane and Kwandebele in other areas, in urban areas. Now those type of things will require a lot of discussions. [Berry] From a personal point of view, you personally, what do you see as your greatest challenge? [Phosa] Well, the greatest challenge at the moment is to improve the living and working conditions of our people, if I may put it in that (?crisp) manner. You look at the health aspect of our situation. It's deplorable. We need to adjust that. We have been offered a number of clinics by a company which for ethical reasons I will not mention -- more than 20 clinics. Now we are going to identify spots where they are most needed and put those clinics there, and these are modern clinics. And education, technical educational and other types of education; we have been offered a university, the funds are there, we don't take one cent from the government. We want to proceed with that project. We want to twin that university with one of the top international universities in the world, because we want it to have that status of a proper university which will produce people who will be immediately useful to the economic activity of the Eastern Transvaal. We want to produce planners and researchers which we don't have at the moment. We want to produce good managers and good administrators, which we don't have at the moment. [passage omitted]
