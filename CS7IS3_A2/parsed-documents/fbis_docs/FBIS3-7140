Since such collusion and conspiracy is mainly aimed at our country, they are of an even more dangerous nature. The United States and Japan are attempting to continually maintain the Japan-U.S. security treaty--the remnant of the cold war--on the pretext of instability on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. and Japanese authorities jointly claimed at the first Japan-U.S. security consultative meeting held in Tokyo some time ago that the importance of the Japan-U.S. security treaty was further heightened following the cold war. By raving about so-called regional instability, the United States is maintaining its armed forces deployed in advance areas in the Asian-Pacific areas including Japan, and is undisguisedly posing a military threat and pressuring our country. Allowing the United States access to ports and land for military bases, Japan even offered to foot maintenance expenses. Furthermore, Japan welcomed the stationing of U.S. Forces--the basic factor for regional instability--in Japan, and is frantically running amok to realize its ambition of becoming a big military power to expand overseas with the United States on its back. The amount of expenses shared by Japan to maintain U.S. Forces in Japan has increased 40 times since 1978 and reached $4.6 billion last year. Meanwhile, last year alone, the United States turned over $9 billion in military equipment required for the modernization of Japan's Self-Defense Forces. The United States and Japan undisguisedly strengthened collusion and conspiratorial relations in an attempt to realize a theatrical missile defense system. The United States and Japan are even going to conclude a treaty on mutual adaptability [sangho yungtongsong] of materials and manpower in order for Japan to furnish unlimited logistical support to U.S. Forces in Japan in an emergency, including transportation vessels and manpower. The U.S.-Japan military collusion against our country has entered a very grave phase at a time when the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks has been ruptured. During the period from mid-February to early March, troops of the 2d Division of the Northern District Command of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force and U.S. Army troops based in the U.S. mainland staged a joint military exercise on the Kamihurano training ground in Hokkaido, Japan. The purpose of this training exercise was reportedly to accelerate preparations for joint operational activities by U.S. and Japanese troops in the event of an emergency in a cold area with much snowfall. Since the United States ruptured DPRK-U.S. talks and strengthened the military threat to our country, Japan actively cooperated and joined U.S. maneuvers to crush our republic. As the United States decided to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea and began provocative steps of moving the missiles, Japan, keeping step with this, openly staged an exercise on 22 March of mobilizing Patriot missiles on a Japan Air Self-Defense Force base in Shariki, Aomori Prefecture, in northern Honshu. Japan will join the United States when the latter provokes a new war on the Korean peninsula. Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN exposes on 23 March the undisguised assertions for taking legal steps to remove restrictions in incumbent laws in order for Japan to support U.S. Forces in Japan in the event of a military clash breaking out on the Korean peninsula. Japan is attempting to mobilize airplanes and ships of the Self-Defense Forces into South Korea under the pretext of evacuating Japanese residents in South Korea in the event that the United States starts a new war on the Korean peninsula. Late last year, the Japanese Government already revised its law on the Self-Defense Forces on the pretext of rescuing Japanese residents overseas and worked out a policy on dispatching airplanes of Self-Defense Forces overseas. U.S. naval ships, including the aircraft carriers Carl Vinson and Independence, frigates, and cruisers, are maintaining a posture of mobilization and deployment to the coast of the Korean peninsula by using Japanese bases. Thus, U.S.-Japan military collusion and conspiracy which places our country as the main target of attack have become more undisguised.
