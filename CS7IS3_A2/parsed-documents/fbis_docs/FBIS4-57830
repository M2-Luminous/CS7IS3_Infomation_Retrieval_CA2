After a week of observation, some political parties have begun to take positions on the 11 May provisional decision. Clarence Renois filed a report: [Begin Renois recording] First, the socialists from National Congress of Democratic Movement are hoping for a quick return to constitutional order. The party of Professor Victor Benoit, minister of National Education in the resigning Robert Malval government, called on all Haitian democrats to express solidarity for the purpose of provoking a return to constitutional order. A small party, which had supported the appointment of Judge Jonassaint, Pastor Vladmir Jeanty's Haitian Party of God, now dissociates itself from the new government. Pastor Jeanty says this team is not credible and has a negative profile. [passage omitted] In opposition, Eddy Volel's party, the Christian Democratic Assembly, sees a dictatorship being installed in the country. The party's spokesman finds proof of this in the governmental press release, warning against any offenses to the current authorities. [passage omitted] The MDN [Mobilization for National Development] of Professor Hubert de Ronceray, who had established some distance from the Jonassaint government even though he had previously supported it, is now consulting with the Jonaissant government. Between 19 and 22 May, Professor De Ronceray met three times with three delegations of the provisional government. Following those talks, a special consulting commission was formed by the MDN. This commission is in charge of meeting with ministerial authorities and studying the policy planned by the government in an effort to confront the total embargo ordered by the United Nations against Haiti, according to a press release from the party. Two other major parties, Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti, led by Serge Gilles; and Movement For the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti, led by former Prime Minister Marc Bazin, took a stand against the arrival of Emile Jonassaint in the provisional presidency of the Republic, especially denouncing the unconstitutional character of the provisional government.
