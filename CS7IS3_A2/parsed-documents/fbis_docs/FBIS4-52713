However, these parties will not be organized parties, nor will they be groups of like-minded people. These parties will have a structure of a leader and a machine which automatically accepts the leader. Introduction The political reform bill was passed at the end of January after a great struggle. Needless to say, the core of the bill was reform of the election system. As Professor Takeshi Sasaki points out, this is the most major system reform carried out under the Japanese constitution. With the exception of the general election of 1946, the traditional medium constituency system has lasted since 1925, when it was first established. This reform is the first in 69 years. A total of eight national elections were held under the small constituency system. Six of them were held between 1890 (22d year of Meiji era), when the first general election was held, and 1898 when the sixth general election was held. The 14th and 15th general elections, in 1920 and 1924, were also held under this system. However, these elections were restricted elections; the number of eligible voters in the first election was 450,000 (total population was 39.9 million), and in the 14th election, 3.06 million (total population was 55.39 million). These figures cannot compare to the number of eligible voters today, which is 93 million. Under the Meiji constitutional structure, the House of Representatives was just another national organization, and there were many powers, such as the House of Peers, the Privy Council, not to mention the Army and Navy, which the House of Representatives could not effectively control. Elections in those days were not given much weight. Above all, Japan during the Meiji and Taisho eras was basically a poor agricultural country, in comparison with today's Japan, which has achieved a high economic prosperity and is highly urbanized. It is unnecessary to reemphasize that this is a major difference when it comes to elections. By the way, the main issue in the first six elections was the reduction of land tax. In short, the election system based on small constituencies is a totally new experience for the rich Japan under democracy and under the parliamentary cabinet system. Furthermore, since 1955, fairly unique party politics existed in Japan, where no real competition took place between the overwhelmingly powerful main party and powerless nongovernment parties. Many arguments about political reform showed lack of understanding of the dynamism that party politics should possess by nature. They believed that what they had had since 1955 in Japan was genuine party politics. This election system reform will bring a substantial change to Japan's party politics. As I stated before, this will be a new challenge for Japan. In order to identify its direction, it is necessary to study the nature of party politics and the situation of today's Japanese society. Through this task, this article is to discuss political reform, which is expected in the near future, and party politics, which goes beyond the reform. First, we will discuss some arguments about the recent election system reform. Parties With No Name First, we want to look at the criticism that new parties do not have names that correspond with their ideologies and principles. This is true with the Japan New Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger]. However, this is an unavoidable phenomenon when the age of ideology is coming to an end. Examining Japan's existing political parties, the policies of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] cannot necessarily be called general terms, such as liberal democracy, or socialism. The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] is not solely democratic socialist, and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] is trying hard to explain that it is not communist. Komeito's name [Clean Government Party] has nothing to do with its ideology. When looking around the world, we find that many parties have "liberal", "democratic" and "national" in their names. There are also religious names, such as Christian. Many still use "social", "people," and "labor"; however these will not be popular anymore. Among all these, "liberal" and "democratic" are still popular, and even the extreme rightists in Russia are naming themselves the Liberal Democratic Party. "Liberal" and "democratic" must be good names. But these names do not function to distinguish one party from another anymore. As you can see, it is difficult to ask new political parties for names that suit their ideologies and principles. The existence of criticism about party names means that there is a belief that a political party must be a group of people who share common ideology and belief. However, this belief is false. As Max Weber said, there are two types of political parties. One type is those whose members share a certain idea, ideology, and world view. The other is those whose goal is to obtain a government position. We can call them the shared-ideology type and power-oriented type. (As you will see, this does not mean the former is good and the latter is bad.) Parties possess both aspects more or less. But, theoretically there are these two types. In addition, I think there is a third type, if parties exist, that represents strong subgroups characterized by race, language, or religion. U.S. political parties are typically the power-oriented type. Compared to major parties in Europe, there is very little difference between the two major parties in the United States. The little difference between them exists due to the small-constituency system. This means that parties have conflicts in the small-constituency system, and this system works in conjunction with the national presidential election to create the bipartisan system in the United States. Therefore, it is of no use to criticize parties that they have no ideologies or beliefs that run through them. In Japan's case, we have very few class, racial, or religious differences. When the ideology aspect is weak, it is natural that power-oriented parties will become the main players. With the SDPJ bidding good-bye to socialism, major parties, which had tended to be the shared-ideology type, will disappear. Party, Ideology, Power I want to mention here about the idea of "modernization of parties" which once was advocated in the LDP by Mr. Takeo Miki and some others. This opinion also had the idea behind it that the basis of parties and other political groups is sharing of ideologies. Their image of a modern party was that it had many members and had a structured organization. Based on this idea, it would be difficult to call the LDP, which had diverse politicians from the rightist to the leftist, a political party, and they would be extremely out of date having several leaders who led factions. This criticism of factions came from misunderstanding what political parties were. First of all, factions are based on common ideas, policies, and political beliefs. Only for the sake of simplification are they divided into the so-called "right" and "left." When we compare the mainstream conservative factions, we can say that the Ikeda-Maeo-Ohira-Suzuki-Miyazawa faction is the left, the Kishi-Fukuda-Abe faction is the right, and the Sato-Tanaka-Takeshita faction is the middle-of-the-road. You rarely see a hawk (hardliner) in the Miyazawa faction or a dove (softliner) in the Fukuda faction. It is a surprising fact that this form has been lasting over a long period of drastic changes. This has something to do with the fact that the major factions in the LDP had been after power. Major factions have been organized by influential members in order to obtain the office of LDP head. The influential leaders would gather their supporters, help them in their local precincts, and assign them posts. To return the favor, faction members always worked together for their leaders' pursuit of power. However, faction leaders have their own ideas, policies, and political beliefs. These might have come from their educational backgrounds and experiences, or from particular situations. Anyway, they do have some ideas of their own. Furthermore, a political leader would be asked to speak in various situations, and the accumulation of these words would create an overall image. His faction would come to share this image. Thus, the idea of a leader becomes the idea, policy, and political belief of his faction. For example, people who share the same idea as Mr. Shinsuke Kishi tend to flock around Mr. Kishi, and as they act with Mr. Kishi, his ideas tend to become those of his faction. Also, Mr. Kishi had Mr. Toshio Fukuda in mind as his successor, and this was based on the closeness of their ideas, and their shared experience reinforced this closeness. Thus, the Fukuda faction possessed similar ideas and policies to those of the Kishi faction. The same thing happened to some extent in the transition from the Fukuda faction to the Abe faction. Thus, a faction tends to carry on the same ideas and policies even though the leadership changes. However, this depends on how the leadership is passed on. When the Sato faction became the Tanaka faction, there was an intense power struggle, and naturally there is a substantial difference between before and after the struggle. Factions Becoming Like Guilds In recent years, factions have been changing from power-oriented groups, which are after the office of the LDP head, to guild groups, which have the distribution of posts as their objective and which value harmony within the faction. A group that fights to make its leader the prime minister and a group to maintain faction unity are completely different from each other. The latter trend began in the 1980's in the establishment of the Suzuki cabinet and the Suzuki faction, following the sudden death of Prime Minister Ohira, and it spread among the other factions. With these changes in factions, cartelization of LDP politics progressed. However, because I have discussed this point in another article, I will not go into it. ("Bid Farewell To Cartel Politics," CHUO KORON March 1993; "From Cartel Politics to Competitive Politics," CHUO KORON September 1993) [passage omitted] The LDP's factions used to be power-oriented groups. They were not based on solidarity of policies and ideas. However, this is the very reason why they came to be unified on policies and ideas. But, when a faction becomes like a guild, coordination (or harmony) within the faction comes before everything else and its unique ideas and policies disappear. If factions are power-oriented groups now, one or two of them might have withdrawn from the LDP, justifying themselves. The factions have weakened this much. The Time for Leaders To Compete In short, when open power struggles cease to exist in the LDP or the whole political parties, conflicts on ideas and policies grow weaker. Contrary to this, what is happening now is the revival of open power struggle--which is party politics--and conflicts about ideas and policies are becoming clear. However, this conflict manifests itself as a struggle between leaders. Since the establishment of the Japan New Party by Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa a year ago, and especially since publication of Mr. Ichiro Ozawa's Blueprint for Building a New Japan, more and more politicians are publishing books. Some are well done, and some are poorly done. But, this is a good thing. We are able to learn the ideas and policies of our national leaders, and are able to choose. It is also true with the SDPJ, which is the last ideology-based party, that the leader stands out. Until now, the SDPJ officially has had a socialistic world view to bring socialism to realization. However, this view was strongest among party activists. The top officials, who are members of the Diet, were more realistic. General socialist supporters were merely anti-LDP. This shows that there were three layers in the structure of the SDPJ party. Therefore, when summarizing the party members' (activists') opinions under the name of party democracy, the left would always win. The fact that the SDPJ is in power, though only partially, changed the meaning of the leftwing spring, and made the Diet members lean toward their parties. As a result, parties are divided into the power-oriented part and the part which has criticism of those in power as its motive. (The next generation leftist would be the latter.) This would cause an even greater impact than the worldwide decline of socialism. This break from being a party with a world view, naturally demands a leader. Their hopeful argument to make Mr. Takahiro Yokomichi the leader comes up often, showing this trend. One criticism of the small constituency system was that they cannot choose candidates, while it is possible to do this under the medium constituency system. At the first glance, this may sound correct. Under the medium constituency system, people could choose whom they liked among the LDP candidates, A, B, C, and D. Or one could vote for candidate E because of his personality, while he might not particularly like the JCP. However, the problem was that there was no telling whether those chosen had any influence within their parties. For example, it is very rare that one votes for Miyazawa faction candidate A because he wants to support Kiichi Miyazawa. For this vote to work effectively, it requires a roundabout route. In comparison, last July's election was simpler. The parties that made great strides forward were the Japan New Party and Shinseito. There might have been various motives, but it is safe to think that those who voted for the Japan New Party, in essence, voted for Mr. Hosokawa, and those who voted for the Japan Renewal Party, voted for Mr. Hata and Mr. Ozawa. In the last analysis, it is a matter of whom one wants to support as the national leader, as in the presidential election in the United States. In fact this is a desirable way to be for the national election. This is much healthier than an election influenced by local interests. Under the new system, the election will definitely be party oriented. However, the parties will not be organized parties nor groups of those who share the same ideologies. Their structure will be that of a leader and the machine that automatically accepts the leader. I would like to mention here, in relation to this, that there was criticism that the prime minister should not come from the number-four party among the coalition. However, this is common among coalition governments, and happens all the time in countries such as Italy. What is unusual about Japanese elections is that it is hard to know who are the heads of the parties. The LDP kept its party leader Miyazawa out of the public eye, and it fought the election campaign using Shintaro Ishihara, Yohei Kono, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had completely different political orientations. This was very unusual. When the coalition government is established, it would be against the rules for Shinseito to support Mr. Ozawa rather than Mr. Hata. However, it is not strange that they choose a leader from among the heads of individual parties. Campaign and Parties When tahe political party-oriented time came, a problem would arise about the relationship between parties and other groups. What is interesting about this issue is the criticism that the small constituency system makes it hard to produce female representatives. When the political reform bill was voted down in the House of Councilors, one female Diet member said that it was difficult for female candidates to be elected from a small constituency. There were also similar criticisms, such as that the small constituency system would choke off citizens' movements or concerted actions by residents. In short, these criticisms mean that the party-centered small constituency system would act against minorities and citizens' movements. Some went even so far as to say that the small constituency system was against democracy. However, many democratic nations in the world have the small constituency system, and this particular criticism can be ignored. It is a simple misunderstanding that it is difficult for female candidates to be elected from a small constituency. This is clear when you see the numbers of female candidates elected from medium constituencies and small constituencies. The reason why the LDP has an extremely small number of female members in the House of Representatives is that it is under the medium constituency system. The other nongovernment parties have a relatively large number of female members. This is due to the fact that they do not put up more than one candidate per constituency. For nongovernment parties, a medium constituency is similar to a small constituency. It is also a mistake to criticize that the small constituency system would work against concerted actions by residents or citizens' movements. Today's election, unless there is a great difference in ideologies, is a competition among political parties that are more or less alike. People can demand that individual candidates make their positions clear concerning the environment, consumers' movements, or whatever the issue may be. Especially, a nationally organized group movement may allow the group to obtain the deciding vote in many constituencies. If the competition is close, each candidate would try hard to get their support, and these group movements would have increased influence on the outcome of the election. This may pressure these citizens' movement groups themselves to change. Various campaigns in the past have been unified with the SDPJ and the JCP, and this prevented them from spreading. If these groups would obtain the deciding vote, their narrow view might be corrected. In the past, single-issue politicians could be elected, but it was difficult for them to have influence in the national government. The largest constituency (opposite of small constituency) has been the House of Councilors' national constituency and proportional constituency. It was possible there to include representatives from minorities and citizens' movements, and to make sure that one or two of them were elected. However, this could only serve to inform the whole country that there are problems in the welfare, tax, sports, or whatever field it may be. How much influence it could have was questionable. In reality, most policies depended on the bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki. In fact, this answers the question why the consumers' movement is weak in Japan. Consumers' movements used to have close connection with the political reformists. But this prevented the movement's expansion. Very few representatives who were included in the SDPJ or the LDP, could do very little. Movements are movements. Politics is politics. By regaining its role, the consumer movement can expand. This is also the key to solving the problem between professional politicians and amateur politicians. The complex political administration of today cannot be handled part time. In order to handle this on site, there are enormous number of bureaucrats who work full time. In fact, only the full time politicians are able to control these bureaucrats. It may be more effective to influence these politicians by citizens' movements, rather than having one of the movement leaders become a politician. Problem of Candidates As you can see, it is crucial for a political party to put up good candidates. Some say that the small constituency system may give too much power to headquarters of parties. They may become powerful, but it does not mean that they can do anything. Democracy is a system of competition, and if the party loses because they could not put up good candidates, the party headquarters will be responsible. Ichiro Ozawa, when he was secretary general of the LDP, resigned his post because his party lost in Tokyo gubernatorial election. Although the Shinseito-Komeito coalition seems strong, they may be labeled as a "a party for which people would not vote for any reason," them), and it is very possible that they may lose the election. If the parties would eagerly look for good candidates, one big problem would be solved. It is the problem of an increasing number of second-generation Diet members. The increase in the number of second-generation Diet members is making it difficult for new politicians to enter the political world. The same thing is happening in the other Japanese industries, also. When Eisaku Sato, Hayato Ikeda, and Aiichiro Fujiyama came into the political world, each of them was instantly the leader of the party. It is highly desirable that people like these three men, who have experience in fields outside politics, come into the political world. However, we cannot expect that to happen in today's political world. Instead, in order to compete with second-generation candidates, some candidates do anything to be elected. This is a bad side effect of having so many second-generation politicians. However, there is a strong demand for the political world to have new politicians. The victory of Rengo in the House of Councilors election in 1989, and the last year's victory of the Japan New Party was due to the fact that each party provided a way for newcomers to enter the political world. If the victory depends on whether they can gather enthusiastic, capable men, party leaders would try very hard to do that. This would lead to finding more talent in Japan. Political Parties and Bureaucrats Another important thing is the relationship between political parties and bureaucrats. It is true that the new administration's slogan was to break the iron triangle, which represented the connections between the bureaucracy, zoku Diet members, and industry. However, some criticize that the bureaucrats are getting more powerful. What is being overlooked here is the fact that bureaucracy was already at a deadlock. It is true that their Kasumigaseki headquarters had a great power, which no other power came even near. There, all the ministries and agencies held one another in check, each swayed by its own interests. They had lost their direction. When this structure falls, it is no wonder that some reformist bureaucrats begin more liberal activities. Overthrow of bureaucracy takes a long time and much energy, and cannot be accomplished overnight. However, as a start some bureaucrats will gain more power, and the rest will gradually lose power. Kasumigaseki is still a brilliant think tank. There is no other organization that has such detailed knowledge about political administration. Overthrowing bureaucracy should mean more effective utilization of bureaucrats' great ability. However, this alone is not enough. The limitation, which is fatal for bureaucracy, is that it cannot be comprehensive nor creative. This is because bureaucrats are to act within the rules and precedents, and are not supposed to go beyond them easily. In this sense, the Prime Minister's Official Residence needs to gain more power, and it is desirable that a solid, comprehensive policymaking structure be established in party's center or around influential politicians. With the pressure on leaders to present their policies, establishment of this structure may rapidly progress. Coming Framework of Conflict What will the framework of coming conflict between parties be like? The argument often comes up concerning this is the argument whether it should be the lenient multipartisan system or the bipartisan system. This is not a very appropriate argument. When they say lenient multipartisan system, there are five to six parties at most, including the LDP, Sakigake and others (anti-Shinseito bloc), Shinseito-Komeito-plus others, the SDPJ's left wing, and the Japan Communist Party. Even under the bipartisan system, there will be the LDP and unified new parties, and the SDPJ's left wing and the JCP will remain. Therefore there will still be four parties. There is not much difference between the multipartisan and bipartisan systems. The bottom line would be whether they want two primary parties or three. It is very funny to ask party members whether it is going to be bipartisan or multipartisan. Whether it will be two parties or three parties, is a result. If party members have confidence and a strong sense of responsibility in their policies, they should try to get the majority, if not, they are being mere observers. What could cause parties to oppose each other? One of the deciding factors would be whether Japan will willingly play a role in the international security or not, that is whether Japan is a so-called "normal nation" or not. However it is hard to tell if this will be the point of conflict. As I mentioned earlier, you cannot explain the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans on the basis of ideology. Each of the two parties may possess an aspect of "normal nation" and an aspect that is not normal. This depends on the future political situation. I think Japan should take a nonmilitaristic approach and become an "normal superpower." I will not touch this subject here, since I have already written an article concerning this ("Normal Countries and Countries That Are Not Normal" in THIS IS YOMIURI February 1994). I just want to mention the minimum requirements when policies and ideas are presented. Ideas and Policies What should parties or leaders present to the people? Many say that it is their responsibility to clearly present their ideas. However, as I wrote before, it is difficult to present clear ideas that will distinguish one from another. Take for example, an often talked about idea of "protection of the Constitution." There are various ideas in the Constitution, and it is difficult to distinguish one party from another solely on the basis of protection of the Constitution. The "idea of constitutional pacifism" is also vague. The argument that, since pacifism is advocated most clearly in the Preamble, Japan should act positively for peace, and therefore we should participate in PKO [UN peacekeepig operations] more fully can be valid. What so-called constitutional protectionists advocate is different from this. When they say protection, they mean protection of Article of the Constitution. No one is against Paragraph 1 of Article 9, and many nations of the world support this principle. What is at issue is Paragraph 2 of Article 9. When parties (or leaders) present their ideas, I would like them to be very specific. For example, they should say that they advocate the idea of demilitarization of Paragraph 2 of Article 9. Second, ideas are important, but policies and programs are more important. For example, some are insisting, "let's export Article 9 of the Constitution to the world." This is good. But I have a request. They need to clearly present the way to export it. Unless they have a concrete way to make the world "import" Article 9, and know how long it will take for the whole world to adopt it, and unless they have a program to protect the countries from aggressions of other countries during the adopting period, it will just be an ideal, a play of words. They should clearly present a concrete plan, especially the cost and the risk without ignoring time factor, along with the idea. Conclusion Political reform is expected to accelerate in the near future. However, this article went beyond that and attempted to take a midterm view. My suggestion that the time will come when leaders will compete on the basis of their policies may sound too optimistic. Even if my prediction comes true, this does not guarantee a good result. Leaders may fall so low as to be only concerned about their popularity, and we cannot deny the possibility of people electing such leaders. However, I feel that this is a phase that we must go through in the development process of democracy. We must bid farewell to the age when even though the voters make a poor choice, bureaucrats, the LDP, or the United States will do something to take care of it. In this sense, those who are faced with most the serious choice are the people themselves. The mass media carry a great responsibility. They must change their habit of reporting only the criticisms of those in power, or basing their report only on human relationship or power struggle. They must report politics, which is a mixture of ideologies and power, viewing from a proper distance. Their attitude since the birth of the Hosokawa administration also has leaned too much toward exposing the inner workings of the politics and political technique. Finally, quoting Mr. Weber one more time, it is a job of very few top leaders of parties to present the list of their candidates and to present their party policies (New Order Germany's Diet and Government). This is where party leaders compete, as well as parties. This is the foundation of competitive democracy. Then, journalism must devote itself to judge political policies and candidates. The future of the party politics depends on whether the mass media can fulfill this responsibility.
