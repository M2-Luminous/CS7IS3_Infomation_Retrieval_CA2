We will take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban delegation? [Amat] The meeting of Ibero-American justice ministers is a conference that has been held for several years. As you stated, this is the 10th conference. On this occasion we touched on topics that appear to be permament topics on our agendas. One is the topic of the fight against drug trafficking. This topic does not have the same implication in Cuba as in other countries because our society does not engage in using, trafficking, or producing drugs. For other countries, however, it does have a serious connotation. Some of those countries are drug producers and are hard hit by the drug trafficking problem. Although we do not have this problem in our country, it is a very useful topic because the experience of countries that are victims of this situation can always be learned from. They are teachings that benefit us because Cuba is fighting hard to prevent drug trafficking from invading us. This does not mean, however, that we are immune to it or are exempt from it. It could happen to us. Our duty, therefore, is to prepare technically and to learn about the problem, to be able to wage an anti-drug program if necessary. There are isolated cases, however, involving tourists. It is not a problem that affects us to the extent it affects other countries, however. Another topic, which has been very important, is the topic of the family, which was discussed in recognition of the international year of the family. In this sense, the essence of the debate has centered on children who are abandoned and on the problem of adoption. Of course, such topics are discussed fundamentally from a legal standpoint, considering juridical aspects. In the case of the family, the social aspect also plays an important role. Cuba has had many years of experience in which it has dedicated much attention to minors and devoted much attention to working mothers, so that children can be taken care of. Legally, our laws recognize the adoption problem. We have a family code which provides for discussion of the topic with special relevance. This shows the importance the revolution has always placed on the family, as the nucleus of society. In this sense, Cuba was able to contribute to the discussion. We had the opportunity to explain our experiences. Our proposal was well received. Many questions were asked and we heard of situations that exist in other countries. [Otero] Thank you, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat, for your statements for Radio Havana Cuba.
