The Council of the Union, responding to the call by the European Council of Copenhagen with a view to establishing a "structured relationship" between the Union and Central and East European countries, suggests that: - in principle once a year, a meeting between the presidents of the European Council and Commission be arranged with the Heads of State and Government of the associated countries; - the Union presidency should inform the ambassadors of the associated countries after each European Council; - as envisaged by the European Council of Copenhagen, there be a special Council convened with the Foreign Ministers of the associated countries once per presidency of the Union to look at problems involving the CFSP [Common Foreign and Security Policy]. The agenda will be thoroughly prepared in order to cover matters of common interest with a view to arrive as much as possible at common operational conclusions and to accommodate specific concerns of the associated countries. Further meetings in Troika format may also be held at the discretion of the presidency; - once a presidency, as envisaged in Copenhagen, there be a meeting between the political directors, in the form of a special session of the Political Committee, preferable before each regular European Council. At this level too, the presidency will be able to convene meetings with the Troika on specific issues of an urgent character; - the convening of meetings at expert level with the associated countries, once a presidency, including groups active in security, terrorism and human rights. These meetings could also be held at Troika level, and the agenda concentrate on questions of common interest; - meetings at expert level with the Associated countries once per Presidency will be extended to other groups including security, terrorism, planners and human rights working groups. These meetings may be in Troika format, or with all partners present immediately after regular sessions. In every case the agenda should be organised so as to focus on matters of common interest; - in appropriate cases, the Associated countries will be invited through an agreed mechanism publicly to align themselves jointly with European Union declarations on a particular subject; - when certain demarches are made by the Troika, Associated countries could be invited to support them; - the Associated countries could be invited to associate themselves jointly with the implementation of joint actions, if appropriate; - cooperation with the Associated countries in international organisations and in the run up to and during international conferences should be intensified. They will be invited to coordinate their position with the European Union whenever appropriate; - to facilitate coordination between themselves and the European Union, the Associated countries are invited to appoint Shadow European Correspondents. In addition they should be invited to nominate contact points for CFSP issues in their missions to the European Union which should establish regular contacts with their counterparts in the Member States' missions and the Commission as well as with the Council Secretariat; - regular contacts between the EU missions in third countries and at headquarters of international organisations and conferences and missions of the Associated countries shall be encouraged; - the European Union shall examine the possibility of further cooperation between the administrations of the diplomatic services of Member States, the Commission and of the Associated countries. The European Union notes that in some cases the modalities of cooperation between the Associated countries and the European Union might require the Associated countries to nominate a single representative. In particular, the Associated countries are invited to establish a system providing for a single representative on rotation for coordination purposes. The European Union considers that the meetings provided for should focus on specific questions which need an in-depth discussion.
