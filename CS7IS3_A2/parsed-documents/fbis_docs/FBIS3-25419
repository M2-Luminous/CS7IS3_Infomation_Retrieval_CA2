Mr. Mandela, currently on a visit to The Hague in the Netherlands, reacted to the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] response that Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the series of far- reaching concessions to the alliance, by saying that it was still too early to assume that Chief Minister Buthelezi has turned his back on the proposals. He added that it appeared the IFP had left the door open for participation in the election. Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg says he hopes to have full details of the proposals by later today. He described the ANC's reference to self-determination as vague and said that the CP demanded complete self-determination for the Afrikaner in his own territory. The Democratic Party [DP] has welcomed the proposals as a meaningful step towards federalism. DP leader Dr. Zach de Beer said during his election tour of the Little Karoo that his party would support the proposed changes to the interim constitution and the Electoral Act. He said he regarded the double ballot system as a fundamental right and welcomed the proposed increased powers for provinces. Bophuthatswana said that the proposals were very interesting and that a full statement would be issued later.
