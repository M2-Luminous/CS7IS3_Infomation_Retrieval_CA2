We welcome the fact that the combat operations in the confrontation zone have been suspended. The agreement for a cease-fire has rarely been violated, but Azerbaijan has to be blamed for the violations of the agreement. That Republic's military units have intermittently fired on various points of the Armenian front line. The NKR defense units have refrained from returning the fire. Regrettably, Azerbaijan has violated the cease-fire. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units tried to capture a strategically important hill in the Gadrutskiy and Fizulinskiy sector of the front line at about 0300. The NKR defense units repulsed the attack. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Center has informed us that the situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been relatively peaceful. No incident has occurred in that region. We hope that a completely peaceful situation will be established on the border as soon as possible.
