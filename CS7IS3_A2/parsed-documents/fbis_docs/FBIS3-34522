After two weeks of continued talks, Israel asked that these talks be suspended until 25 February. This shows the Israeli position is still the same in terms of intransigence, procrastination, and prevarication. It still adheres to all the obstacles threatening the peace process and continues to adopt proposals and ideas that will not achieve real, durable, and comprehensive peace. This is revealed by Israeli assertions that issues have not reached fruition on the Israeli side and that circumstances are not yet conducive to achieving peace. No doubt, these flimsy pretexts conceal an Israeli attempt to sabotage the peace process, striking at its roots via a well-known policy of extending the period of talks and considering talks an end in themselves. These Israeli efforts cannot be separated from practices designed to obstruct the peace process and to lay traps in its path. This is revealed by the Israeli Government's decision to expand two settlements in the Golan and to allow settlers to carry out this expansion with government support and sponsorship. No other evidence is needed that Israel does not want peace. These practices and positions all show, either directly or through impressions and maneuvering, that Israel still refuses to respond to the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace. Israel is hostile to the resolutions of international legitimacy that demand its withdrawal from occupied Arab territories. Israel is being hostile to peace and is contradicting it. Even in its separate deal known as the Gaza-Jericho agreement, Israel is still procrastinating, prevaricating, and avoiding implementation. Furthermore, the secret Oslo deal is still blocked, facing Israeli obstacles. Events and developments prove the Israeli plans cannot lead to the desired peace--a peace that secures the region's security and stability. Hence, we believe that the Israeli positions and practices threaten not just the peace process, but also place the region in a state of continued disturbance and tension and spread an atmosphere of pessimism and darkness. Israel alone is responsible for this disturbed and worrying situation. It is responsible for the possible consequences of such a situation in terms of complications and reactions. This is because Israel's waste of the available peace opportunities has not been a coincidence. Each time, this has happened after careful considerations and planning. This is reaffirmed by Israel's refusal, inside and outside the talks, to speak about a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and by its refusal to stop settlement activities which are a manifestation of the occupation. This is also reaffirmed by Israel's refusal to comply with the basics and formula of the Madrid conference and by its disavowal of the principle of restoring the land in return for peace. The continued Israeli rejection of all this is a rejection of peace and its requirements and of the resolutions of international legitimacy. This is because whoever is concerned about peace does not prevaricate, procrastinate, or deceive.
