These clarifications do not prevent replies to a number of issues raised by the national press, citizens, or parties in the dialogue. Among these, we will mention the pilot study for the platform of dialogue with its contents. It has introduced clear amendments to the constitution, and in this the commission went beyond its powers. The pilot study also included a chapter devoted to the economic, social, and security guidelines. In this chapter there were some people who said these were not enough. There were also those who said that by including these guidelines in the document, it means participation in issues that have a relationship with the social project. Regarding the chapter on commitments, there were some people who said that it should remain unchanged, whereas some other people demanded there was a need to amend it. A third side raised the possibility of discarding it altogether. There were also those who demanded there was a need to drop the preamble because it came up with ideas close to the social project. On this occasion the commission wishes to make the following clarifications: The pilot study endeavored to go along with the spirit of the constitution. Those who drafted the pilot study never had an intention to amend the constitution. In the view of the commission, the constitution remains a basic reference document and the basic law that regulates the state's institutions. But the institutions of the transitional period and particularly the state presidency and the provisional national council are not elected. Therefore, they cannot occupy the same status of the republic presidency and the national people's assembly. Consequently, the powers of the interim institutions have a special nature, a matter which necessitated they run under special rules. This is on the one hand. On the other hand, in view of the seriousness of the multi-faceted crisis and the results of this crisis that prevent the literal implementation of the constitution, and in view of the inevitability that dictates on us the need to provide the maximum level of success to attain the aims of the interim stage to ensure a return to the electoral course, the commission believed in its drafting of the pilot study. The commission also believed the implementation of the chapters on regulating the powers governing the transitional stage so that they can provide the greatest possible extent of effectiveness -- a matter that was misunderstood and regarded by some as an amendment to the constitution. In view of these considerations, the commission believes that this action on its part is in keeping with the constitution and not an amendment to the constitution. Concerning the economic, social, and security objectives, the commission believes, on the basis of a request by the sides to the dialogue, that defining the economic, social, and security objectives is a requirement imposed by the reality of the transitional period. The government, whose objective is to restore the country to normal life and civilian peace, needs general directives from the conference that would clarify to it the landmarks on the road. This led the commission to devote a chapter to this matter. The question of enriching and amending the contents of the chapters remains a valid point. This is a matter to be decided by the sides to the dialogue in the end. The question of the commitments was also raised by the commission, at the request of the sides to the dialogue. Its aim is to make the sides to the dialogue committed and obligated to one another and to public opinion on the need to respect the essence of these undertakings. The commission did not come up with these commitments on its own accord, but it derived them particularly from the constitution and from the laws enforced in the country. We have made these clarifications in answer to some of the questions raised by some sides to the dialogue and quoted by the the press. As the commission has promised you in the past, it is still continuing its efforts with the aim of involving these tendencies. Contacts were established during the past few months. These contacts are still continuing. However, because of the private and sensitive nature of these contacts, the commission apologizes for not providing more details about the issue. Whenever it realizes there is something worth informing the public opinion of, it will not hesitate to inform you. We are a few days away from the convening of the national dialogue conference. To clear the air, restore tranquillity to the people, and consequently make available the best conditions for the success of the conference and achieve national accord, the commission reports that it has received definite guarantees from the authorities concerned that a first batch of people will be released from [detention] centers in the south in the next few days. Second, it has received definite guarantees that also in the next few days house arrest orders will be lifted with regard to all those to whom the measure applies. The commission hopes that these measures will constitute a major turning point in the path leading to the restoration of peace of mind and gradual return to civil peace. The issue of participating in the national conference has been in the forefront of the national press for a few days. [passage omitted] On the eve of holding the national conference, the commission sees that this is the time for closing ranks and uniting. At this time, those who love Algeria and those who want the reins of power will come to light. This is a test period, and history will certainly be the judge and arbitrator. Thank you.
