Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy, National Guard Commander Volodymyr Kukharets, and other state officials attended the meeting. Considering the importance of the president's address in terms of various problems in Ukraine's domestic and foreign policy, we are broadcasting the larger part of the speech. [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] I am grateful to the Organization of Veterans for raising the issue of Crimea and offering to address the people of Ukraine on this issue because your words and your voice will have a great impact. I am not exaggerating. [Words indistinct] the situation is developing as follows: We are acting in accordance with the Constitution and the law. By we, I mean the president and the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Believe me, I have not violated Ukraine's Constitution and legislation so far. The Supreme Council resolution passed last Friday [20 May] fully accords with the Constitution and the law on delimitation of powers between the authorities in Crimea and Kiev and with the law on citizenship. No one violated anything. We will continue to act within the framework of the Constitution, within the framework of the legislation, while our power structures follow the laws and the norms adopted in Ukraine. We proceed from the main premise that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. This has been recognized worldwide. On the way here, I received reports from the world's biggest powers: the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany. The Russian foreign minister also declared this. They all are united in the opinion that Ukraine's territorial integrity is a fact of life, Ukraine's sovereignty cannot be violated, and that the defense of territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, and a country's sovereignty is a sacred duty of every individual and every state. This is the bottom line, which no one is allowed to cross. This is, as they say, the red line. When we are involved in a discussion with Crimea, we say: Recognition of the basic fact that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and the same constitution and laws apply on its territory as on the territory of Ukraine, open the door to any compromise, and any economic, social, and political solutions. But Crimea and its leadership [words indistinct] are also violating their own laws, that is, laws enacted in Crimea, and not only Ukrainian laws. Naturally, in this situation it is difficult to take the settlement of the issue into the legal framework. Our delegation, led by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, has gone to Moscow to settle the issue of the Black Sea Fleet, which is very acute. There is some progress, and there are difficulties. I hope, however, that both Russia and Ukraine will have enough diplomatic ability and that their attitude toward the situation will be sufficiently politically discerning--taking into account all possible positive and negative consequences--to resolve this problem properly in order first to preserve peace in Crimea and second not to become an apple of contention, as it were, between us; and for us to settle it in a way that would make friendship, partnership, and cooperation with our great neighbor Russia determine our policy and be a priority in it. You yourselves can see that this does not depend entirely on Ukraine's position. I cannot help but talk today about the wild and untruthful information that the Russian mass media is disseminating. The mass media, however, is the mass media. I cannot help but tell this audience, which is composed of experienced, politically balanced, and intelligent people, that the rhetoric at the state level in Russia, at the level of representative and state power, is unacceptable to Ukraine. All sorts of hints, all sorts of warnings to the president of Ukraine cannot be recognized by the civilized world as according with international norms if one should be guided by these norms. Any president can issue warnings to his own structures, his own ministers, his own government, and state and other structures subordinate to him, but not to the president of another state. This is not fitting. It is not a democratic approach and does not do any credit to anyone resorting to it. I want to be understood: I cannot help but pay attention to such things when Mr. Sergey Filatov hints that someone provoked the problems in Crimea in order to retain power. I would like to know whose opinion is this? Is it Filatov's personal opinion, or his opinion as chief of presidential staff, or is it someone else's opinion? This is a serious issue. We do not allow ourselves any attacks at the state level against our neighbor, a state with which we want friendly, equal, partnerlike relations for good, not for one day. Everyone must consider that.
