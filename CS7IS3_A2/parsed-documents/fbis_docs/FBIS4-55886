So far, it has had just one division in Warsaw, but as of Friday, it also has a branch. "The bank is getting ready for privatization. Is is second in line after the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy SA" -- said Edmund Tolwinski, the bank's chairman. "But first we must put some internal things in order and prepare a program. After two privatizations of banks of the `Group of Nine,', we want to conduct our privatization in the safest possible way." So far, the establishment of an information management system has been of the main directions of activity. Divisions and branches have been computerized for the customers' needs, but there is no integrated management system. Availing itself of World Bank credits and working in line with its procedures, Bank Gdanski will make a decision in June as to who will deal with designing and implementing such a system. An extension of the range of activities is another issue. Talks with a French insurance group named Azur are already in progress. The bank will be selling a few of the group's products as its agent before the end of the year, while a joint undertaking is being planned for 1995. Its main goal will be life insurance. The process of restructuring bad debts has been progressing favorably. As the first bank in the country, Bank Gdanski SA resolved the problem of difficult credits by selling its financial claims. It happened in 1992 and it applied to a debt incurred by the Szczecin shipyard which constituted 25 percent of Bank Gdanski's "bad credits." For 31 December 1991, such bad credits constituted 32.5 percent of the total value of credits. On 31 March this year -- the deadline for finalizing the restructuring -- the figure dropped down to less than 20 percent. "The structure of the current difficult debts is completely different from that of three years ago" -- said Hubert Kierkowski, the bank's deputy chairman for restructuring. "Back then, difficult debts were comprised of credits for huge state-owned enterprises whereas currently, they are loans granted to smaller privately-owned companies." Commenting on rumors regarding a merger with Bank Slaski, Chairman Tolwinski stated that some analysis work has been conducted but without any specific bank in mind.
