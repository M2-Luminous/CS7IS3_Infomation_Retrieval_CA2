In the period from February 21 to 24 strategic reconnaissance planes committed aerial photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the areas of the North as a whole repeatedly making flights between Kangnung and Tokjok Islet in the West Sea of Korea. On Feb. 25, twelve reconnaissance planes including RV-1 and RC- 12 made day-and-night cross flights between Tokjok Islet and Chunchon, between Chunchon and Kangnung and between Yonchon and Kanghwa Island for photographing and reconnaissance on the frontline and the eastern and western coastal areas of the North. U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane committed photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the depths of the North on 29 occasions in February. The U.S. imperialists' aerial espionages against the North via high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, Army and Airforce tactical reconnaissance planes and early warning planes number more than 190 cases in February. All these aerial espionages clearly show that the U.S. imperialists are desperately stepping up their preparations for another war of aggression against the northern half of Korea.
