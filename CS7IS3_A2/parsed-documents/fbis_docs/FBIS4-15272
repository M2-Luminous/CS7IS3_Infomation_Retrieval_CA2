This matter was previously dealt with by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. This decision has been made by the government commission on operational issues. In the opinion of experts at the RIKA news agency, the government commission's decision is connected with the fact that the state budget received just $6.9 billion of the $8.5 billion revenue from state oil export quotas. In order to prevent petrodollars leaking abroad, a group of authorized banks will soon be entrusted with the handling of oil exporters' accounts.
