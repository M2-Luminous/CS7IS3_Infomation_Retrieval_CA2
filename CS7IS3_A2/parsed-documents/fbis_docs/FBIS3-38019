"Neither I, nor my comrades, have not committed any crime in August of 1991. We were defending the Constitution of the USSR and trying to rescue the country from collapse and death. An amnesty is applied to criminals, and we are not criminals," Starodubtsev said. At the same time, he called the State Duma resolution on the amnesty "a courageous step" showing that "the Duma will not be obedient."
