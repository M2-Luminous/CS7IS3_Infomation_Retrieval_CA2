The AVF says the presence of British and American mediators, Lord David Carrington and Dr. Henry Kissinger, will put the Boer-Afrikaners and other whites in South Africa at an even greater disadvantage. Similar interference in the old Rhodesia led to the forcing of former premier Ian Smith into a settlement, and the action held nothing good for the whites of Rhodesia. The AVF trusts that the mediators are in South Africa to find a solution rather than force the Zulus into surrendering to the ANC and communism. According to the AVF, the mediators, with the aid of former prime minister John Vorster, forced Mr. Ian Smith to surrender. The Lancaster summit saw to it that the whites of Rhodesia received nothing, the AVF said. The AVF contends that the mediators' first task should be to see to it that the National Party-ANC alliance is convinced into postponing the election. Thereafter, they could play a more meaningful role in negotiations. They should also see to it that the violence in kwaZulu/Natal comes to an end. The military presence and the state of emergency in the region create an intimidating climate. The AVF said a settlement in the self-determination of a free Zulu nation will not be found in this way.
