Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Ramon Mota Sanchez, chairman of the National Defense Committee, said Mexico remains firm in its foreign policy, which considers inviolate the self-determination of nations and the principle or nonintervention. "I totally and absolutely disagree with a proposal of this magnitude because it only shows us a manifestation of the policy traditionally maintained by that country, which pretends to act as an older brother" in Latin America. He demanded that the neighboring northern country's attitude be stopped "once and for all," and he expressed his confidence that the firm and invariable Mexican position will be stated in Mexico and various international forums. Gabriel Jimenez Remus, parliamentary coordinator of the opposition National Action Party (PAN), said it was absurd that Clinton issued a proposal of this magnitude and, worse yet, is trying to get Mexico to support him." He emphasized that Mexico "has a firm policy on this issue and, therefore, all PAN members and federal deputies condemn this request, which only proves that this country insists on becoming judge or arbitrator of everything that occurs in the world, particularly in Latin America." Ricardo Valero Recio Becerra, coordinator of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said his party will in no way support such a petition. Valero, who is also secretary of the Lower Chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the U.S. policy "is no longer fit for our times." He added: Nevertheless, it reminds us of the Inter-American Peace Force that was created in the 1960's and whose activities were very dangerous for the region. He considered it worrisome that the United States make such a proposal given the situation of uncertainty which prevails in Haiti and which shall undoubtedly affect the region's stability. The U.S. Government, through its Department of State, has asked Latin American nations to endorse an armed action on the Caribbean island, to replace the Haitian military government, but apparently only Uruguay and Argentina have endorsed the proposal.
