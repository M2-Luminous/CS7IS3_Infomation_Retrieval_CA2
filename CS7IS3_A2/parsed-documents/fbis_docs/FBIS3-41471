Enterprises that work with dangerous waste should register themselves at local governments to get licenses for its use and transportation, under the amendments. The inspectorate established businesslike cooperation with the Customs Department, which is provided with the list of dangerous substances, Roska said. Customs officers also inform regional inspectors on any suspicious cargos, he said. Customs officers together with the regional inspector, for example, recently detained 15 railway containers with phenolic waste, which the Belarus-based Ruta firm was sending to its Latvian partner Service SPB. Roska said that Service SPB must have planned to sell the waste as cheap heating fuel. When burnt, phenolic waste produces toxic foul-smelling fumes that are harmful to nature and people's health. The Basel convention also forbids interstate transportation of phenolic waste, Roska said. The cargo was returned to Belarus 6 January.
