Staresina report on news conference by Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Mate Granic in Zagreb; date not given: "The Way to the Final Solution"] [Text] The Washington agreement is a historic one because it marks a definite geostrategic orientation of Croatia toward the West, and everything that follows, and the complete conciliation of the Croats, except certain marginal people, concerning the concept of Bosnia-Herzegovina and connecting Croatia to the Bosnia- Herzegovina federation. The current negotiations in Vienna concern the constitution of the future federation. In the next few days, the delegations in Vienna should determine the intercantonal demarcations, especially in central Bosnia, after which the negotiations on the demarcation toward the Serbs will follow. Once the relations with the Serbs are settled, then follow the talks on the model of the confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, said Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, before leaving for Moscow, where, as he remarked, he was going to demand a confirmation of the Russian recognition of the territorial sovereignty of Croatia. Minister Granic pointed out that the Washington agreement was the expression of the continuity of Croatian politics, which has supported the model of a decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina and the proposed peace plans since the beginning -- from Cutiliero's to Vance-Owen's to Owen-Stoltenberg's -- which offered various degrees of decentralization. The Croat-Muslim talks on a confederation started as early as last fall, when several models of the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its relations with Croatia were discussed. "However, there was no realistic force from the outside that would support one of the peace plans and become involved in their implementation, until, after the stagnation in the Geneva talks, the United States signaled that it would implement the agreement in consultation with Russia and the European Union," said Dr. Granic, adding that, following the U.S. decision to become actively involved in the peace process, U.S. Vice President Al Gore talked to President Tudjman on the phone, telling him about the U.S. initiative, which was accepted immediately, while, in the final stage of the Washington negotiations, President Clinton talked to the Croatian president. During the Washington negotiations, the consultations between Washington and Moscow, Washington and the European allies, and Granic and Tudjman were practically constant. "The reaching of the agreement was welcomed by practically all the important countries. Many European countries congratulated President Tudjman. The only country in which the agreement has been received with some anxiety is Serbia," said Minister Granic, adding that the Bosniak side also accepted the agreement very well, that all the members of its delegation involved in the negotiations were interested in the confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia, and that the results on the ground, primarily those related to the ending of the conflict between the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, were beyond expectations. As far as the special solutions are concerned, Granic said that western Bosnia would be a canton with the Muslim majority and one Croat municipality, while its demarcation with the Serbs is left to be negotiated. Posavina will be a canton with a Croat majority, considerably extended in relation to the present territory held by the Croats and Muslims, and will contain a corridor for the Serbs, but just a corridor. Talking about the pressures on the Croats regarding the reaching of an agreement, Minister Granic said that the Croat delegation entered the negotiations with thoroughly worked-out models that also contained the proposal of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with Croatia, as the United States had the information that most Bosniaks also wanted the same and just needed a mighty force that would support those wishes and give guarantees for their realization. Regarding the occupied areas of Croatia, Minister Granic says there are no written guarantees, but that U.S. Vice President Gore offered U.S. assistance in their reintegration should the agreement with the Muslims be reached. Croatia, on the other hand, will offer the United Nations, or rather the secretary general, its proposal for solving the problem of UNPA [United Nations Protected Area] zones based on Security Council resolutions (even on the one regarding the control of borders) but which would contain the means for their implementation. Referring to the possible future course of the negotiations, Minister Granic concluded that the reaching of the Washington agreement and the active involvement of the United States crossed the Rubicon on the way to the final solution, for without coordinating Croat-Muslim relations, the negotiations could not go forward, and that, for the first time, this laid a firm foundation for negotiations with the Serbs.
