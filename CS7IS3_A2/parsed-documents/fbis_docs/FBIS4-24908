"China believes that the most practical and effective framework so far for properly settling this issue is the trilateral dialogue between the four parties" -- North and South Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. But nevertheless China would study seriously Moscow's call for a multilateral conference, he added. Since the North Korean nuclear crisis began about 18 months ago, Beijing has refused to consider it an international issue and has tried to block most initiatives taken within the United Nations. Instead China, which is Pyongyang's only ally, has pushed for the United States to talk directly with the communist regime in the hope that this would eventually lead to Washington's official recognition of Pyongyang. In March, China snubbed a similar Russian call for a multilateral conference because it countered its own efforts to force the Americans to talk directly with Pyongyang. The United States has called for sanctions against Pyongyang following the IAEA report to the Security Council that it was unable to verify whether North Korea removed plutonium from its Yongbyon nuclear plant to make atomic weapons. China, torn between its role as an international power and its links with Pyongyang, may take advantage of the Russian proposal to delay any UN vote on sanctions which would put it in an embarrassing position, diplomatic sources said.
