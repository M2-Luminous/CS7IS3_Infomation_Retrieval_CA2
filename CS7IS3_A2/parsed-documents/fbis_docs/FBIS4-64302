By this, do you mean to say that the real representatives of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples should come together and initiate a new process of democratic reconstruction? [Ocalan] Of course. Contrary to public perception, I am not engaging in "maneuvers." I do not think it is suitable to consider Kurdish independence in the form of separation from Turkey, even if we forge a military capability capable of doing so. This is certainly not my ideal solution. We want to discuss this issue with those sectors that really want to think about and understand Turkey and solve her problems. That is, we do not believe that the Kurdish problem can be solved without Turkey, or that Turkey can advance without solving the Kurdish problem, or surmounting some of these problems. I can clearly demonstrate this. Even the present intensity of the war has halted Turkey's progress. Everything is tied to the war effort. Even they themselves have been saying so for the last two years. This trend will escalate, thereby undermining the internal balances in Turkey, and it will push the country into a major crisis and wreck it. Hence, those who really love Turkey and are concerned about it should come forward now. I know well the mentality of the special warfare forces. This mentality has been evident not only today, but during all the previous Kurdish uprisings. The mentality is: "Suppress the Kurds, massacre and hang some of them, and force the rest to surrender. That is how the problem will be solved." The method of repression is evident: "This job can then be completed by starting a process of assimilation." This has been the official thesis for the last 70 years. We are now proving the futility of this thesis. One cannot ensure Turkey's territorial integrity this way. The Kurdish principalities had considerably greater autonomy even under the Ottoman Empire. They were even in power for a long period. Compared to the Turkish Republic's oppression and assimilation system, the Ottoman tolerance was a splendid blessing. There was no Ottoman pressure on the Kurdish language and culture. The republic ushered in a policy of suppressing and eroding identity! A policy of destroying a centuries old culture. It tells the Kurds: "Stop being yourselves." This is a heavy punishment, a frightening humiliation! The effects of the official ban on language, on people's minds and psychology must be understood. And, here I am not even talking about economic, social, and political conditions. Already, even the slightest political stirring is punishable by execution! One must realize what effect all this will have on the people. There should be some progress beyond this republic's theory of national unity and integrity. All right, you Turks managed to deport the Armenians. It was a solution for you. The Kurds face an even worse situation than the Armenians, but you are unable to deport them. Why are you unable to deport the Kurds? Because there are various [Kurdish] clans and there are the mountains. The situation is a bit different. The suppression and genocide of the Armenians cannot be effectively applied in the case of the Kurds. It has now been realized that the genocide of our identity will lead nowhere and Turkey will face bottlenecks henceforth. Can Turkey achieve a turning point at this stage? Can the state's official ideology and policy chart a new course? These are their own problems. But, these last few governments have persistently tried to press ahead with the policy of the last 70 years, and at least for some time to come. [Former president Turgut] Ozal tried to end this policy but died under mysterious circumstances. As for us, we have to issue a call to our banner. Being the bearers of Turkey's 70-year old policy, this government, or a possible national front government, will want to continue with this policy. They will say: "Let us continue the war for yet another year." At this point, let me also say the following: We have made preparations to continue the war for yet another year. Look at our strength in 1993; and if it means anything to you, our strength in 1994 will be at least quadruple that! At present our armed forces number around 20,000. If we wish to, we can increase it to 30,000 at any time! Supposing that each guerrilla is equivalent to 10 soldiers; then, if we lose 30,000 people they will lose 300,000! It is not difficult to arrive at this figure, judging by last year's casualty figures. [Reporter] But, those in Turkey who think that there can be no talk of any solution before the "PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is completely eradicated" are still very influential. To what extent does such an approach obstruct a possible solution? [Ocalan] To persist with this mentality means the destruction of Turkey. Could they ever venture to inflict so much destruction on Turkey? Undoubtedly, some would. People like [leader of Nationalist Movement Party, NMP, Alparslan] Turkes are saying "we can destroy the PKK." His companions might venture to try such a thing. But let me state that we will not remain silent if they do try it. If they launch a massive massacre, we will definitely defend ourselves! We too could speak in the language that Turkes understands. He has frequently massacred leftists and committed big massacres. Now, he is forming a special army. We know that the special army is being organized by his men. They are all members of the NMP. We will form a special army in response! We will raid their homes! We will raid their villages! If they escalate the conflict, we will do the same! We will move against these fascist leaders if the Turkish people do not break with them. We will move against them because we do not consider them to be a part of the Turkish people, but fascists. We will not harm a hair of any Turk who does not side with the fascists. Such an escalation of the conflict is not our choice. But the opposing side might want to escalate the conflict. The counterguerrilla faction and Turkes' supporters within the state belong to the group that wants to escalate the conflict. They want to escalate the war to eradicate the PKK and the Kurdish people. They showed this inclination in their recent behavior in parliament. We will try to stop this trend and we will succeed! It is time for us to listen to the voice of reason. [Reporter] What does the "voice of reason" say? [Ocalan] Let us remove the shadow of force from Kurdish-Turkish relations; we are ready for any solution. I assure you of this. I am saying: Renounce the use of force and let us rearrange things according to the free democratic choice of the peoples, firmly within the existing borders! I am not evading this; rather I am stating it openly. I guarantee this, if you have the power to bring about such a solution! I ask: Where is the separatism in this? They repeatedly claim that "the PKK will divide and dismember the country." The public should not be taken in by such claims. We believe that the improvement in relations will generate enormous riches, that democracy will uplift the peoples, and that it will also be an enormous gain for Turkey if the Kurdish people develop their culture, it will enrich our lives and uplift every individual! This is what I want! Is it a sign of magnanimity to utterly degrade the opposite side? By way of example, would you be able to enjoy the friendship of your spouse if you beat her every day, maimed her, and even cut out her tongue? [Reporter] A provision in the decisions adopted at the Brussels conference calls on you to inform the Swiss Government that you will abide by the Geneva Convention. Are you thinking of complying with this call even if there is an intensification of the conflict? [Ocalan] We expressed our desire to abide by this convention a long time ago. But, Turkey rejected it by refusing to recognize us as a counterpart. Anyway, Turkey does not recognize us as a belligerent party. There is a de facto war. They also know this, but they deny its de jure existence. Of course, we would like to abide by the Geneva Convention. Let me state that we will abide by the war conventions word by word. But, the other side has a counterguerrilla organization, and there are many unsolved murders. Is there a war convention that contains provisions about unsolved murders? Theirs is a dirty war, unrivaled even by the wars of the Middle Ages! In those times they had their own methods of fighting, but nothing like this existed. Theirs is a dirty, filthy war. We want to abide by the war conventions. But they are not abiding by them. [Reporter] Speaking realistically, do you expect the official circles to respond to your call for a cease-fire by this spring or summer? The General Staff regards these months as advantageous for this. [Ocalan] We entertain no such cheap illusions. But making such a proposal at the beginning of spring was important from the point of view of our going on record as one of the belligerents in the conflict. A feeling of responsibility is also important. We want peace and a democratic solution. We hope this problem will be solved without bloodshed. This is an expression of goodwill. Will the Turkish General Staff take it seriously? This is a General Staff that thinks it is above everything. It sees itself as more powerful than the Ottoman sultans. But, it has to start thinking about the heavy cost of this war, about who would gain or lose during the spring and summer months. Supposedly they were going to finish us during the heavy winter conditions. Check out carefully who really faced difficulty during the winter. The guerrillas might gain great advantage in the coming months. In the meantime, we are improving our combat methods. They have already launched the spring offensive. There is an operation around Gabar Mountain. According to our observations, some 12,000 to 13,000 troops and village guards took part in it. They lost at least 80 troops killed and 150 injured, and then withdrew, leaving behind a considerable amount of military hardware on the battlefield. This is despite the fact that Gabar Mountain is close to where the army has been massed. This is how their major spring offensive is faring. They are now attacking Mount Ararat. According to wireless reports from Ararat, more than 40 troops were killed on 19 and 20 March. They suffered twice as many wounded. We lost only two guerrillas. We lost four guerrillas on Gabar Mountain. This is an indication as to who will achieve better results in spring. I know how well trained our forces are. We have never been so sure of ourselves. [Reporter] Aside from Ararat and Gabar, how do you view the general situation in the region? [Ocalan] Lately, area meetings have been held and a restructuring of forces was carried out. Take Botan [region covering Semdinli, Baskale, Hakkari, Uludere, Cukurca, Sirnak, Cizre, and Catak], where we will attempt to establish a federal government. At present our influence there is greater than that of the state, our weight is greater there. We will spread the area of this influence. We will also establish local governments in other provinces, and it is highly likely that we will run these governments. We already have nearly a 10,000-man guerrilla force in Botan. This is a very powerful force. Some 60 to 70 percent of the territory there is under our control. It could be stated that despite strong attacks, the army is unable to enter it, whereas we are enlarging our own army there. They want to subjugate Serhat [region covering Kars, Agri, Erzurum, and Van], but they are unable to go higher than the foothills of Mount Ararat. In Dersim they are unable to venture out of the city. They also tried to penetrate the Diyarbakir-Bingol-Mus triangle, but could not even prevent the guerrillas from consolidating there. They also could not evict the guerrillas from Kozluk, Sason, Mutki, Tatvan, and Hizan -- these regions form the Garzan line. There are guerrilla cells on Taurus, and in an area extending from Malatya to Binbogalar to Adiyaman. No matter how many plans of destruction the General Staff draws up, they will not be very effective. It will only lead to bloodshed; the spring and summer of 1994 will be violent. We might also suffer losses during this period, but the Army will lose at least 10,000 men. We really do not want this degree of butchery of the troops. [Reporter] This would mean a major crisis for Turkey? [Ocalan] Definitely, and the already paralyzed economy will reach the point of complete collapse. Probably only then will some people really start to think about a solution. I think at that point this government will leave--should leave--the scene. Those pro-special warfare people who are shaping this government's policy will be called to account. Maybe only then might the democratic alternative be placed on the agenda. [Reporter] Could the opposite happen? Could Turkey attack the region in a manner similar to the Serbian attack on Bosnia? [Ocalan] They are already walking along that path. [Reporter] But, this is being concealed from the public? [Ocalan] You are correct when you say that this is being hidden behind the screen of the Serbian massacres committed in Bosnia. The attacks on the Kurds in Kurdistan is worse than the Serbian attacks on Bosnia! The Turkish public does not know this because the special warfare forces have extraordinary control over the press. Turkey's emulation of the Serbian attacks will become obvious once the Bosnian issue moves toward a solution. [Reporter] Will we too have Milosevics? [Ocalan] What Milosevic? There will be worse and more extremists ones. Let me remind you, the General Staff has some plans of repression. We believe that the final stage of the plan envisages the complete destruction of villages and the massacre of everyone having any link with us. This plan is now in force. They might escalate the implementation of this plan. They have already destroyed more than 1,000 villages. Only, a few thousand more villages remain. They will also destroy them. Because of the destruction of the villages, cities, primarily Diyarbakir, have grown in population. Writing in the THE TIMES [not further specified], an American said: "The situation in Diyarbakir reminded me of America's fate in Vietnam." They have interesting observations. The situation here is similar to Saigon when the fortunes of the war turned against America. He is saying: "I have now seen both Saigon and Diyarbakir." They brought the war to this stage. You know what the situation is like in Diyarbakir. It is ready to explode. They emptied the villages and now a single huge village has cropped up. What are they going to do with that big village? Where are they going to send the people from there? They expanded Istanbul and gave it a peasant character. Istanbul will vanish with further peasantation. Is this a solution? It will backfire if they transport so many Kurds to Istanbul. Already this policy has Kurdified Cukurova, and the Aegean is fast becoming Kurdified.
