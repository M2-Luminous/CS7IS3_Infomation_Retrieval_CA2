The two-day conference, which opened at UNESCO headquarters here on Thursday, agreed to set up two regional round tables, one dealing with the problems of Russian minorities in the three Baltic states, and the other with Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and Romania. Accords reached at the round tables will be enshrined in a Stability Pact which could be signed early in 1995 and registered with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The conference is sponsored by France and the European Union to defuse potential conflicts between would-be candidates to the European Union from eastern and central Europe.
