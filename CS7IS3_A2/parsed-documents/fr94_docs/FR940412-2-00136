The exchange is consistent with the Bureau's planning for the lands involved and has been discussed with local governmental officials. The public interest will be served by making the exchange.

If the exchange values are not equal, the transaction will be phased or the acreage adjusted or money will be used to equalize the values upon approval of the final appraisal of both the offered and selected lands. The selected lands were identified in a Notice of Realty Action published in the Federal Register (58 FR 47472) on September 9, 1993. For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , interested parties may submit comments concerning the offered lands to the District Manager, Las Vegas District, P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126. Any adverse comments will be reviewed by the State Director. Dated: April 5, 1994. Gary Ryan, District Manager.
