The current developments in the Japanese political life are an internal affair of Japan and the choice of its people, the diplomat said. As far as Moscow's approach to relations with Japan is concerned, the strategic policy line, determined on the strength of the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo in October last year, towards large-scale development of bilateral relations and intensification of the political dialogue remains unchanged, he said. The level of mutual understanding reached between the two sides during the Russian leader's visit rendered the relations between the two countries civilised, taking them out of the category of sensations which were unnecessary at times, the Russian Foreign Ministry staff member said. "We are prepared to continue to maintain such a level of mutual understanding in future as well," he added. Upon mentioning that he has available so far only preliminary and conflicting information on the latest developments in Japan's political life, the Russian diplomat did not rule out the possibility that Mr Hata will retain the premiership in a new government which the country, judging from everything, will get next week.
