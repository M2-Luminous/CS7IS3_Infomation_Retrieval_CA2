Attending the meeting were CPV Advisers Pham Van Dong and Vo Chi Cong, Le Duc Anh, Vo Van Kiet, Nong Duc Manh, Nguyen Duc Binh, General Vo Nguyen Giap, many high-level party and government cadres, and representatives of all central and Hanoi sectors and departments. Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Hanoi party committee, delivered a speech recalling the glorious tradition of our party in the past 64 years. He said: "Right from its birth, our party firmly held the revolutionary banner and outlined a correct platform to widely gather and unite people from all walks of life and lead them to the victory of the August Revolution, establishing the first worker-peasant government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Southeast Asia. "Then the party successfully led a nine-year resistance war against the French colonialists, opening an era of the disintegration of the Old Colonialist System in the world. After the Geneva Agreement in 1954, the party led our people to hold high the banner of national independence and socialism to simultaneously carry out the two revolutions: the socialist revolution in North Vietnam and the national democratic revolution in South Vietnam for the national unification. "That correct line became the revolutionary action of our people. It led our people to the great victory in 1975, liberating South Vietnam and unifying our nation for the whole country to move forward to socialism. "In the socialist revolution, our party has exerted many efforts to study, search, and invent for the outlining of correct socialist lines, goals, and directions. Sometimes it committed mistakes. Our party seriously criticized itself and initiated and led a national renovation undertaking in all social aspects at the Sixth National CPV Congress. The Seventh National CPV Congress developed the Sixth National CPV Congress's renovation line to continue taking the renovation undertaking into new depths. "The result of the implementation of the Seventh National CPV Congress resolution was evaluated at the recent MNPC. The conference confirmed that we have scored very important achievements. The great achievement with a paramount meaning is the overcoming in an important step our socioeconomic crisis. Three years on the road, our economy scored a fairly good developing rates. The average annual development rate was 7.2 percent. Inflation, from two digits in earlier years, reduced to 5.2 percent in 1993. The life of major part of the people has been stabilized and partly improved. Those achievements have positively contributed to the firm maintenance and consolidation of political stabilization, a necessary condition for national construction and development. "In recent years, due to the successful renovation and the broadening of our external relations, our reputation and position of our country in the world has been improved, creating favorable conditions for the national construction and protection." The Hanoi party committee secretary confirmed that the aforementioned great achievements have created a premise for our country to move to a new developing era, an era for the first step of the national industrialization and modernization. After confirming the achievements recorded by the Hanoi party committee and people in the past year, Comrade Pham The Duyet stressed: "With its role and position outlined at the Six National Party Congress, the Hanoi party committee has actively led the people in the implementation of the renovation undertaking. The recent 11th Hanoi party committee meeting unanimously evaluated and found that in 1993, under the party and government leadership, the Hanoi people have recorded great achievements. That is the maintenance of political security and social order. The economy continued to score new achievements with fairly good development rates. Its gross domestic product increased 11.2 percent over 1992. Nearly 30,000 new jobs were created. The Hanoi average production per head increased from $517 in 1992 to $565 in 1993. Hanoi industrial production reached its highest level so far. Education and training service; cultural, arts, physical education, and sports activities; public health care; and other social welfare service achieved prominent progress compared to the previous years. Hanoi party and government and mass organizations widely expanded many public movements for the implementation of political, economic, and social duties in the past year." Comrade Pham The Duyet pointed out the strengths and weaknesses in socioeconomic development scored by the Hanoi party and people in the past and stressed party building work. He said: "The Hanoi and local party committee accelerated their leadership, considering the party renovation and rectification an important task for 1993. They implemented suitable steps and measures and reviewed their work regularly to learn from experiences in wards, villages, state enterprises, colleges, and so forth. "Party building, renovation, and rectification work, however, still bears many shortcomings. Many problems have not been solved adequately. Various party organizations especially still are confused in their leadership content and method. Cadre planning and training was carried out, but did not receive appropriate attention and investment. "Our party tirelessly has struggled, explored, and innovated, thus achieving great and glorious victories throughout the 64 years of its history." The Hanoi party committee secretary then outlined the socioeconomic targets that set forth by the Hanoi party committee for 1994. He also reasserted the determination of the Hanoi party organization and people to bring the MNPC resolution to reality and to fulfill all socioeconomic targets. In his conclusion, Comrade Pham The Duyet said: "In developing our party's glorious revolution traditions, the Hanoi party organization and people pledge to closely unite around the party Central Committee led by our beloved Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, to continue our renovation undertaking, to advance further in the industrialization and modernization process, to fulfill the socioeconomic targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress, and to make Hanoi become evermore prosperous and civilized on the socialist path, deserving the trust of the people in Hanoi and in the entire country. We will greet the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Hanoi and other national holidays in 1994-95 with practical action."
