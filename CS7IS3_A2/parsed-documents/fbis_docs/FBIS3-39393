On Saturday [15 January] the New Democracy [NYD] breakaway faction formed a new party in Vaxjo, the Riksdemokraterna [National Democrats]. The party will nominate candidates in the Riksdag election and compete with NYD. The splinter group's main criticism involves the control from the top that characterizes NYD, in its view. For example, the party leaders in Stockholm autocratically decide on the slate of Riksdag candidates, the National Democrats charge. Protecting Children, the Aged "It is no longer possible to influence New Democracy," according to newly elected party leader Birger Andersson, a 47-year-old business consultant from Farjestaden, Oland, who said his main goals are to protect the interests of children and old people--and knock NYD out of the Riksdag. Bert Karlsson does not view the new party as a threat. "It is good that they formed this party. If they have different views, then of course they should make a party out of them. But I doubt they have much more in common than their negative attitude toward New Democracy," he commented on the decision in Vaxjo. There is great dissatisfaction with Ian Wachtmeister and Bert Karlsson among NYD members, according to representatives of the new party who think they can get as many as 10 percent of the votes in a Riksdag election. Last year the splinter group formed a NYD municipal federation consisting of around 40 local NYD associations. This happened after NYD decided at an extra meeting to be solely a Riksdag party. Local NYD associations were given a chance to enter into cooperative agreements with the Riksdag party. Will Not Go After Refugees Helena Karlgren, a 32-year-old law student and mother of two from Eslov, Skane, is a new female face in Swedish politics. At the founding meeting of the National Democrats in Vaxjo yesterday she was elected as the party's first vice chairman. Her goal is to win a seat in the Riksdag and knock out NYD, which she describes as a "wolf in sheep's clothing." "It is an undemocratic party with racist elements," she said. In spite of this, the breakaway party is using the NYD program as a basis. But the National Democrats will have a democratic control apparatus. A municipal federation made up of member associations in the municipalities will have insight into the activities of the party's executive committee. Refugee Policy Tough Enough That is exactly how Karlgren and newly elected chairman Birger Andersson wanted to reorganize NYD. They tried to get Wachtmeister to listen to them. "But he was completely unreasonable when we met him in November." It was after that disappointment that the idea of breaking away from the party took concrete shape. The new party's program will be worked out during the next few weeks. How will the National Democrats differ from the New Democrats? "We will apply democratic organizational principles. Unlike NYD, we will not concentrate on going after individual refugees. Refugee policy should be revised, but we do not want a stricter policy. It is tough enough, in view of the fact that we deport 90 percent of those who come here." Karlgren also mentioned youth unemployment as an important issue. But the party will announce what it will do to combat this problem later. "The pension system should be revised in order to provide pensions that everyone can get by on. They should be the same for everyone. And it should then be possible to supplement them with private insurance." Does Not Believe in Bloc Politics The defense force should be a career army, without getting rid of universal military conscription. "I think we can have both. The Swedish boys who are serving in Bosnia today should be given an opportunity to serve in Sweden instead," she said. Before she became involved in NYD, Karlgren always voted for nonsocialist parties. Are the National Democrats a nonsocialist party? "No. I think we stand exactly in the middle. I do not believe in bloc politics," she said. And the European Union? "That is a good question. I must first confer with my party chairman on this point," said Karlgren, who feels she has something to contribute to Swedish politics, partly because she is a member of the "lost" generation of the 1960's and partly because she is a woman.
