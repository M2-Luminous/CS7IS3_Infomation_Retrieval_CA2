The program emphasized the need for the government to augment ongoing efforts in the private sector for realizing such a society, in particular through integrated networking of computer and telecommunications systems. Specifically, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) called for promotion of such networking in five sectors -- education, research, medical and welfare services, administrative operations and public libraries. The task, however, will be impossible to achieve unless the government makes efforts to improve business, technical and social conditions in these areas, the program said. It said the conditions include computer standardization, establishing security systems in computer-related business, protection of intellectual property rights, deregulation of various rules and upgrading telecom-related infrastructure, the program said. MITI said the program was formulated to give concrete shape to policy measures recommended last June by the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory body to the trade minister. In the past year, a drive to build information-oriented societies has been accelerated on a global basis, including the national information infrastructure scheme proposed by the United States and the trans-European network program by Europe.
