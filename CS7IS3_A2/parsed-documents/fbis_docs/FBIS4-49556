Some provinces and municipalities had in the past agreed to the demand of too high a rate of return on investment and other harsh terms in order to seek an early success for negotiated items, such a phenomenon causing the great concern of the State Council. The State Council has in principle fixed a rate of return at between 11 percent and 12 percent. Demands higher than this will not be accepted by the Chinese side. China last year saw RMB 52.2 billion [renminbi] investment in power construction with newly installed capacity put at 12 million kilowatts. Some RMB 60 billion capital will be put into this sector this year and the newly installed capacity is expected to be little bit higher than last year. China now has a per capita provision of 600 kilowatts-hour (kwh) while that in the United States is over 5,000 kwh and that in Hong Kong, Japan and Britain is more than 2,000 kwhs. China is determined to increase its total installed capacity to 1.2 billion kilowatts in a bid to catch up with the level in medium developed countries. Coal-fired, hydroelectric and nuclear power will be constructed simultaneously and foreign investment in this sector is welcome.
