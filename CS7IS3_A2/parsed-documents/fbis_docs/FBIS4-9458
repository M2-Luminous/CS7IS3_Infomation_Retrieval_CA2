"However, even amidst such circumstances, Hungary was able to transform its industrial structure, halt inflation, and the government has taken successful steps to find markets for the changed agriculture", he added. Speaking at the election rally of the Sopron (western Hungary) local organization of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], Boross, who is the prime minister candidate of the MDF, pointed out: "Although we have made many mistakes, we have confessed to these and have learned from them." Boross voiced the hope that the Hungarian Democratic Forum will achieve good results in the May parliamentary elections. "I would like to serve on as prime minister for another four years," he said.
