Our collaborator, Renata Havranova, an editor of the daily PRACE has telephoned us the following report. [Begin Havranova recording] [passage omitted] Immediately after the meeting opened, Igor Uhrik resigned his post as SNS deputy chairman. In a written statement on his resignation, he said that he was driven to taking that step by the group's dirty methods, which centered around Deputy Prime Ministers Prokes and Andel. According to Uhrik, apart from lies and punching below the belt, a certain group was not shrinking away from drawing a picture of bloody conflicts in southern Slovakia only in order to depose the party's leader, Ludovit Cernak. In his statement he has rejected the destructive policy of Vladimir Meciar. I do not mean to put a mark of legitimacy on this meeting by my presence when it is apparent that corruption is one of the main factors, Uhrik told Czech radio. The fact is that SLOVENSKY DENNIK today published under the heading: The price of Cernak's head, names of SNS members who have received letters of appointment to lucrative posts in the state administration and other posts. The first name on the list is Vitazoslav Moric, who, in his own words, has the post of head of Armex holding company, which exports arms abroad, in his pocket. As a reward for removing Cernak, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia has offered Jozef Prokes the post of minister for foreign affairs and to Marian Andel the post of deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, currently held by Ludovit Cernak. In play are state secretaries [deputy ministers] posts, the head of the Office for Labor Safety, and chairman of a parliamentary committee, as well as promises made by the ruling movement to where and to whom the post of head of the State Inspection Office will not go. Those whose names have been listed in the daily ignore with a smile questions about the truthfulness of the published article. No one has, however, denied the report. Cernak said in an informal conversation that the SNS congress will certainly be convened, apparently in February. [end recording]
