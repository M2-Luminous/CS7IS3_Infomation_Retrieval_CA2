Prosecutors asked them the details of how Pusan made a contract with Kim Chu-sung, son-in-law of Yi and Chang. Yi and Chang will be summoned early next week, a prosecution spokesman said. Pusan, a footwear maker, Thursday accused the couple and Kim of fraud over a deal to sell 6,976 square meters of land in Pusan to Pusan that fell through because Chohung Bank had a lien on the land. Kim, who had received 2.3 billion won from Pusan as contract deposit, gave Pusan a promissory note for 4.25 billion won (5.25 million U.S. dollars) as breach-of-contract damages. The note, issued by Kim and endorsed by Yi and Chang, was later dishonored.
