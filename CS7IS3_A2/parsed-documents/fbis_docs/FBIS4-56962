Centrist and rightist politicians and voters also want to be heard. The PFL [Liberal Front Party], whose leadership has been pressured because of the alliance with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], could find an exhaust valve in Deputy Gustavo Krause's "Principles and Main Targets for a Program of Government," a study that the deputy has coordinated for several months. The document, which was drawn up by a commission made up of Daniel Dantas, Mauro Salles, Nilton Molina, Paulo Guedes, Roberto Procopio Lima Netto, and Thomaz Pompeu Magalhaes, was submitted to Jorge Bornhausen on 4 May, and will be released to the 3,000 party executive boards, 18,000 party councilmen, and to the deputies, senators, and governors in order to listen to suggestions and to introduce changes into it. The 83-page PFL document is as thick as the 112-page PT [Workers Party] report. The main difference is that it attaches much more importance to economic and financial problems, and that it proposes more concrete solutions, especially in those fields. This emphasis has been caused, first, by the fact that the economy has preponderance over politics in a country that has been plunged into chronic superinflation; and second by the number of economists on the commission, beginning with the coordinator. The study identifies five phases of the crisis: the political crisis, with the operational difficulties of democracy and inefficiency of the state; the currency devaluation crisis; the misery and starvation crisis; the ethical crisis; and the crisis of confidence. The study says: "Even though these are different phases, the fate is the same: an impasse. The political sector has proven to be extraordinarily incapable of creating a minimum consensus in the search for a solution to the impasse. Everyone has opposed everyone in this search." The principles of a political alliance and of a joint program of government "should be: A) the reform of the political system; B) the reform of the state, which should be politically strong and managerially efficient; and C) a development pattern based on: the reorganization of the economy and the expansion of the market, which should become increasingly global, competitive, and specialized; on the promotion of human rights; on the preservation of natural resources; and on increasingly expeditious and creative managerial standards, both for the public and private sectors." Economic stability is a precondition that the PFL sets before anything else. The study says that "no income-generating sector, including the state, is powerful enough to curb inflation. The fight against inflation is fought by the entire nation." In the operational part -- in addition to the well-known position favoring an independent, strong Central Bank that preserves the currency; an end to monopolies; an end to discrimination against foreign capital; privatization with strong participation by social funds; and a smaller state with the implementation of a new federal pact -- the program raises an innovative proposal: the reconciliation of the debts and credits that the Union and the state and municipal governments are demanding from one another, in a Credit Clearing Chamber that might operate through National Social Treasury Bonds (Osins). Such bonds could also be used as currency for privatizations. The document also makes interesting proposals for fiscal reform, advocating an end to the revenue allocations provided for by the Constitution. The proposal to adopt a single 10 percent income tax proves that the document is ideologically based on Reaganism. There are also encouraging positions on public security, science and technology, and regional policies for the Amazonas and for the northeastern region. Summarizing, the PFL study is serious and is worth reading. It is actually a pioneering, innovative effort for conservative parties, a document that seeks to compete with the ideas of the leftist parties.
