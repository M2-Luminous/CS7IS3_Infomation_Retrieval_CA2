Rocco Tolfa reports: [Tolfa] Smiles, handshakes and peace signals -- all this in public. In reality there is a battle going on between Achille Occhetto and Massimo D'Alema. The battle is taking place in the secret rooms of the party's headquarters in Rome, however, rumors of this duel are emerging and Occhetto has let it be known that he could even give up the secretaryship of the PDS on condition that D'Alema is not his successor. The battle is wounding the party. [Emanuel Macaluso] "I have never understood what the political basis for their divisions were. There has never been any sort of explanation in any party publication nor in public." [Tolfa] A personal dispute? The men from the party say no. [Fabio Mussi] "None of us -- from Occhetto downward -- can remain in his place for ever and ever. What counts is the political perspective, and it remains to be seen who will be in charge." [Tolfa] Moves and countermoves in the light of the forthcoming autumn congress. Occhetto has tried to calm the waters by offering D'Alema the deputy leadership of the party. The editor of the party newspaper, L'UNITA has for the moment said no. He said that at present he does not want to enter the fray, but it is clear that he is now part of the fight. It is from this settling of scores that the man to challenge Berlusconi will emerge.
