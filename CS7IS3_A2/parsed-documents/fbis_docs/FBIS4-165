FBIS4-165 "drafr064_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA TEC Establishes National Police Inspectorate TEC Establishes National Police Inspectorate MB0104131894 Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English 31 Mar-7 Apr 94 p 5 MB0104131894 Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN English BFN [Report by Chris Louw] [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has taken its first decisive step to rein in rogue elements in the South African Police [SAP] during the election period with the establishment this week of a National Police Inspectorate [NPI]. At a meeting in Pretoria the NPI was quietly brought into being with the specific task of keeping a check on the various policing agencies -- including the SAP -- during the election period. Its first task will be to concentrate on the "flashpoints" of Natal and the Wits/Vaal [Witwatersrand/Transvaal] area. The first of the 13 members of the NPI -- five civilians, four SAP officers and four officers from homeland police forces -- started moving into their new offices on the 10th floor of the Saambou Building on Tuesday [29 March]. The existence of the NPI will only be announced next week, but the MAIL & GUARDIAN has been leaked details of the secret launch meeting this week in the Saambou Building in Pretoria. Chairing the meeting was Peter Gastrow, who heads the TEC's law and order subcouncil. It was revealed at the meeting that a national complaints mechanism is to be established in 10 days' time for civilians to protest about unacceptable police conduct. The NPI will take over many of the functions of police officers who are presently operating under the National Peace Accord. Described by our source as the eyes and ears of the TEC, the NPI will identify rogue elements in the SAP and the homeland police forces, and report to the TEC on possible crises in the police, logistical plans, problems of low morale and tension between different policing agencies. It will also see to it that decisions by the TEC's law and order subcouncil are implemented. All police plans regarding control of the election process will be reported to the subcouncil by the NPI's nine regional inspectorates. All steps taken by police will be measured against a national police plan, which was recently accepted by the law and order subcouncil. With less than four weeks to go before the elections, short cuts were taken in appointing a director for the NPI. It was decided at Tuesday's meeting that Fanie Bosch, project leader of co-operative education and programme development at the Technikon RSA in Florida, Transvaal, will be the executive director. Bosch, who attended the meeting as an observer, was instructed by the law and order subcouncil to convene the first meeting of the NPI before the existence of the new body was made public. Because of the time limit, those attending the meeting were told to squeeze the TEC for as good a financial package as possible. Gastrow is believed to have promised that the subcouncil would support its demands, because at this late stage it hoped not to readvertise for the position. Members of the NPI were told that although they should not impose themselves, they should be part of decision-making meetings of the various police forces all over the country. Decision-making meetings outside the security forces -- such as city council meetings -- should also be attended. The NPI will be expected to evaluate unrest regulations and report to the subcouncil on what steps to take. Members of the NPI were warned to be specifically on the lookout for tensions between homeland police and the SAP, and to report any problems to the subcouncil. Joint operational centres (JOCs) will shortly be established in many parts of the country for the various policing agencies, and the NPI members will have an important role in seeing that everything is in place for the elections. Gastrow warned during the meeting that the politicians and experts had done very little forward thinking on the key issue of the integration of South Africa's various police forces, and that serious problems could be expected. A police general at the meeting also warned that there were morale problems within the police, and that there was a need to motivate the police to play a constructive role before the election and under a new government. During the meeting Bosch made it clear that he was not prepared only to criticise the police, as the inspectorate was designed to help the police as much as the TEC. Gastrow said his subcouncil also wanted to help the police to do their job properly, in part by identifying weaknesses in the police force.
