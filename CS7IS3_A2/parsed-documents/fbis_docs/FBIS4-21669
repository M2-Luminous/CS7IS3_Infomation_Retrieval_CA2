As has been reported, on 10 March a soldier on duty suddenly opened fire and killed his commanding officer and wounded several other fellow servicemen. The soldiers guarding the military facility refrained from returning fire for fear of hitting the fuel tanks of missiles with nuclear warheads. According to the statement from the press center of the missile force, the system of the duty roster in such units guarantees nuclear security in ordinary as well as in emergency situations. Information carried by the daily IZVESTIYA about a supposed threat of a nuclear missile conflict is groundless, the statement says.
