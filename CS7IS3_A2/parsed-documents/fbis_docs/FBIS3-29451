Referring to a possible political realignment in the future, Kubo said: "I think it is impossible to merge coalition parties into one based on the theory of nation building, behind which there is an idea of establishing a two-conservative-party system advocated by Ichiro Ozawa, chief secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]." In this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would not agree to a plan proposed by Shinseito and Komeito that coalition parties should merge and form "a new party" to contest the next House of Representatives election as a single party. Kubo stressed: "I share the same view with Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi. We think that the coalition parties should cooperate in tackling urgent issues and that those who aim to establish a similar government should cooperate." In a question and answer session after the lecture, Kubo clarified differences between his idea and Ozawa's, saying: "My idea about the nation is different from Ozawa's. I think we also have differing opinions on Japan's international contributions and the Constitution." With regard to the issue of reshuffling the cabinet, Kubo said: "If the government is considering a cabinet reshuffle to remove a certain minister, it will lose its centripetal force."
