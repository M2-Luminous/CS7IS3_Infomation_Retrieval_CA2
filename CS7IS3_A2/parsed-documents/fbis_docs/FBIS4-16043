This Is Not in Russia's and Ukraine's Interests"] [Text] In the view of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy, the Odessa events amount to "a state armed action aimed against Russia." If logic is to be followed, Ukraine, which is trying to justify the actions of special purpose unit members, should long have commanded "Halt," the admiral noted. Events are unfolding further, however; the Black Sea Division has been proclaimed "Ukrainian," and by the time Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Ukrainian Navy, comes to Odessa, Ukrainian flags will be hoisted along with other trappings of "the nationalization" of a Russian military unit. This "state hooliganism" has also discredited even the date of Odessa's liberation, and efforts to seize the hydrographic ship have disrupted the navigation security system in the Black Sea, Adm. Kasatonov stressed. Arrests and harassment of Russian officers, and the sight of children wounded by splinters of broken glass were characterized by Igor Kasatonov as "an unprecedented action, in which the attacking side just waited for the Russian side to fire the first shot."
