Beginning 10 April, the commodity price inspection team went down to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Dongguan to conduct on-the-spot price inspection. The results of the inspection showed that the province's current economic and market price developments are fine on the whole, but the price hiking momentum is relatively grim. There is still something to be done in intensifying price inspection work and implementing some specific measures. The commodity price inspection team pointed out: To check the price hiking momentum, Guangdong Province should intensify price inspection work, focus on the main points, and rectify the price order while conducting price inspection. With regard to the hot-point items that are most sought after by the masses of people and to those important commodities that have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood, the province should organize forces to conduct special inspections. As for the commodities, grain, edible oil, important service items, and chemical fertilizers, the prices of which were forced up without authorization by capitalizing on taxation system reform, the province should persist in rectifying the price order while conducting price inspection, and should strive for speedy and innovative advances in this regard. It should adopt appropriate measures to manage grain, edible oil, pork, and major vegetables, and should step up efforts to introduce a system of risk funds for grain and for non-staple food, concentrate necessary forces on implementing the practice of selling goods at marked prices, and put price readjustments under strict control.
