FR940919-0-00142 FR940919-0-00017 In December 1992, the Department of the Interior signed a revised Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of the Army that provides an administrative process for requesting higher level review of District Engineers' decisions on section 404 individual permit applications. One criterion necessary for higher level review under the Memorandum of Agreement is that the wetlands in question must constitute ``aquatic resources of national importance.'' The ultimate determination on whether the criterion is met will be made on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works). Requests for higher level review only apply to projects subject to individual permits, not Nationwide permits. Projects determined by the Corp's Sacramento District to quality for authorization under Nationwide Permit 26 are not eligible for higher level review. Department of the Army concurrence with the designation of vernal pools at the project site at issue ``as aquatic resources of national importance'' does not ensure application of additional protection to vernal pools beyond that site (see discussion under Issue 29 and Factor D, ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'', for a complete discussion on the adequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms for the four species listed herein). Such a designation must be made on a site-specific basis and, by itself, does not necessarily effect any protection of these resources. San Francisco District of the Corps considered possible revocation of Nationwide Permit 26 in the Santa Rosa Plain that would have ensured that all projects affecting wetlands in this area would require authorization on an individual permit basis and potential higher level review. However, the Corps decided instead to impose stricter conditions on the use of Nationwide Permit 26 in this area, including demonstration that no rare or endangered plant or animal species are supported on the wetlands within any proposed project site. The Corps also determined that individual permits would be required on wetlands that support federally proposed or listed threatened or endangered species. Regardless, of the four species listed herein, only the California linderiella is found at the Santa Rosa Plain and this area constitutes a small percentage of the overall geographical range of the species. Therefore, any additional protection afforded vernal pools in this area would not provide rangewide protection of these animals. Based on this and other information discussed under Factor D below, the Service concludes that proposed and on-going damage or destruction of vernal pools in California caused by urban and agricultural development is prevalent despite existing Federal, State, and local regulations and that existing levels of protection are not adequate to assure the survival of these species. Issue 23: One commenter completed a literature survey of three reports that addressed trends in overall wetland losses throughout California and the Central Valley, in particular. Essentially, this commenter concluded that the historic trend of wetland losses throughout California subsided in the mid-1980's and that current wetland acreages actually are increasing in the State, apparently as a result of the implementation of Federal wetland regulatory mechanisms.
