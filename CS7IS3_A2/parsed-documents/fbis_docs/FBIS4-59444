Many members of the latter forces had earlier surrendered and joined the ranks of our forces, having been forced into the war by the al-Ahmar gang by various immoral means. Our forces are now in complete control of the entire areas of al-Dali' and Shu'ayb, having captured or put to flight the forces of the adventurist al-Ahmar gang. In the Bab al-Mandeb Kharaz area, our forces succeeded this morning in repulsing the offensive of the oppressive forces of the treacherous gang of the al-Ahmar clan, forcing them to retreat to their rear positions after driving them out of the Ra's al-Arah and the Kahabup center areas. Our forces are currently in control of this area, which is in the region of the former border existing before the union. The Defense Ministry has expressed conviction that victory will soon be won and the destructive and oppressive war declared by the so-called 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April 1994 will soon be silenced.
