He will promise President Boris Yeltsin that he will back to the hilt Russia's determination to enter the political, although not the economic, dimension of the group. But this move, spearheaded by Britain, could if successful end centuries of distrust and suspicion that the West to this day still feels about Russia. And it could mean the end of the East-West divide which still cuts Russia off from capitalist Europe. John Major flew into Moscow late last night for crucial talks with Mr Yeltsin in the Kremlin. Both agree that Russia's rocky economy makes it impossible for her to become a fully fledged member of G7 -- for a while anyway. But Mr Major feels -- and he will probably find that a majority of his G7 colleagues think likewise -- that Russia should now be allowed to get a foot in the door. British officials had denounced as "cynical" suggestions that it is merely a sop to buy off Russia to ensure her support for Nato's threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. Russia's centuries of affinity with the Serbs makes her reluctant to support any "muscular" action against them. But Mr Major hopes today to persuade the Russian leader that air strikes, if the Serbs refuse to remove their heavy artillery from the outskirts of Sarajevo, could be one way of ending the bloody civil war. Russian will almost certainly come "onside" although with reservations. In any event they have no veto so the air strikes could go ahead even with opposition from the Kremlin. Mr Major and Mr Yeltsin are on extremely cordial terms. This has a lot to do with the fact that it was Mr Major who was the first of all the world's leaders to back Yeltsin during the aborted coup in 1991 and again during the attempted and failed insurrection last autumn. Mr Major will seek from Mr Yeltsin information on the progress of Russia's massive programme of economic reform and the gradual introduction of privatisation throughout industry. Meanwhile, Mr Major has made plain that he does not want to be questioned by reporters about back-to-basics and kiss and cuddle MPs during his joint news conference with President Yeltsin later today. Mr Major is insistent that the objectives of his visit to Russia should not be overwhelmed by problems on the domestic front. If these questions do arise at the news conference, indication is that the Prime Minister will decline to answer them, saying that he will only take questions relating to his visit. Mr Major flew into freezing Moscow last night wearing a typically Russian-looking furry hat. But it was disclosed that he bought it at a hatters in the West End of London. Mrs Major, who is accompanying him, also wore a furry hat and a striking brown and red coat. She was presented with a bouquet of flowers when she arrived last night. During today she will attend some of the functions with the Prime Minister but her programme will also include a visit to a children's hospital, particularly a burns unit in it, and to the Bolshoi ballet school. Tonight she will attend with him a "grand dinner" in their honour at the Kremlin. Mr Major will make a brief speech before the meal highlighting President Yeltsin's success in transforming Russia's economy and his personal courage in dealing with violent attempts to depose him and his government.
