FV94&hyph;948&hyph;1FIR, FV94&hyph;953&hyph;1FIR] Expenses and Assessment Rates for Specified Marketing Orders (Colorado Potatoes and Southeastern Potatoes) AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 948 and 953 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee, Northern Colorado Office (Area III) and the Southeastern Potato Committee (Committees) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 1, 1994, through May 31, 1995, for ยง953.251 and July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995, for ยง948.211.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 97 and Order No. 948, both as amended (7 CFR part 948), regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Colorado; and Marketing Agreement No. 104 and Order No. 953, both as amended (7 CFR part 953), regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Southeastern States (Virginia and North Carolina). The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, Irish potatoes grown in Colorado and Virginia and North Carolina are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, which began June 1, 1994, and ends May 31, 1995, for Southeastern potatoes and began July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, for Colorado potatoes. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 85 producers of Colorado Area III potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 15 handlers. Also, there are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may be classified as small entities. The budgets of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period were prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of these Committees are producers and handlers of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input into these processes. The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee expenses by expected respective shipments of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. Because these rates will be applied to actual shipments of potatoes, the assessment rates must be established at levels that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committees' expenses. The Colorado Potato Administrative Committee, Northern Colorado Office (Area III) met on April 14, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $24,325, $7,474 more than the previous year. Increases in the Federal portion of the administrative budget include $200 for Committee meetings, $450 for Committee mileage, $50 for insurance and bond, $2,860 for the manager's salary, $620 for medical insurance, $1,750 for office equipment, $500 for office supplies, $219 for payroll taxes, $200 for telephone, $250 for miscellaneous, $125 for manager's expense, and $250 for Federal meetings. The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work.
