The Council rejected cooperation with a state-appointed commission on any issue pertaining to the holy places. Our Arab affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that the decision to boycott the Shamgar commission was inspired by Jordan, and contravenes the Waqf's initial position in support of testifying before the commission. Several days ago, the Hebron Municipality published a proclamation calling for the expulsion of the Jewish settlers from Hebron, the dismantlement of Qiryat Arba' and the other settlements, and the lifting of the closure from the town. The Municipality, which was appointed at the time by the Military Government, also demands the removal of the Jewish synagogue from the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the restoration of the site's Islamic nature.
