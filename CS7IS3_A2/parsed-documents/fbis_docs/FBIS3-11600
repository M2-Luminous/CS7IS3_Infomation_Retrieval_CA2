Local newspaper reports had reported the possibility that Camacho might be one of the contenders in view of his primary role in the Chiapas peace process and that political analysts had included him in the list of "presidential hopefuls." "The decision I am making might disappoint some people, but I am certain that they would reproach me if I were to place any other interest above the topic of peace," Camacho stated in statements to newsmen. He also dismissed the possibility of occupying a Senate seat and said he will dedicate his efforts to peace in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several towns and attacked a garrison early this year, prompting the Mexican Army to step in. Camacho was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on 10 January. After intense negotiations he achieved a preliminary agreement which will be analyzed by the government and the armed group. "Without this (political) definition, it would be difficult to continue my work in favor of peace in Chiapas," Camacho added. His position is independent of the government [words indistinct] refusal to participate in the elections. The commissioner noted that "if it is noted that my priorities include being a presidential candidate, it could harm the peace process" in Chiapas where over 100 persons were killed. Some 42 million voters, a little less than half of the country's population, will go to the polls on 21 August to elect a new president, new deputies, and part of the Senate. The candidates in the elections will be Luis Donaldo Colosio of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. There are two female candidates: Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party and Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party. Other hopefuls are Rafael Aguilar of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, Pablo Emilio Madero of the National Opposition National Union, Alvaro Perez of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, and Jorge Gonzalez of the Ecologist Party of Mexico.
