FR940922-2-00102 FR940922-2-00069 III. Scope A. This agreement defines the way in which DOE and NRC will cooperate to facilitate the NRC's obtaining of information and knowledge regarding the gaseous diffusion plants and USEC's operation thereof through routine and special inspection activities during the interim period before NRC assumes regulatory responsibility. The NRC inspection activities will be conducted for the purpose of gathering information useful to the NRC in developing the 10 CFR Part 76 standards and making the initial certification decision for the GDPs as directed in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. This Agreement does not apply to investigations or inquiries conducted by DOE. B. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term ``inspection'' as applied to DOE shall mean the examination, review, or evaluation of any program or activity of the USEC with respect to: (1) the effectiveness of the program or activity in ensuring that the health and safety of the public and plant personnel are adequately protected; (2) the safe operation of the facilities; (3) compliance with any applicable DOE Nuclear Safety and Safeguards and Security Requirements as defined in the Regulatory Oversight Agreement (ROA). With respect to the NRC, the term ``inspection'' is defined as the onsite or Regional/Headquarters Office review of any program or activity of USEC with respect to prospective compliance with proposed NRC standards for the regulation of the leased portions of the gaseous diffusion plants. C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the authority of DOE or to affect or otherwise alter the terms of the ROA. D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the NRC Inspectors authority to (1) interpret or modify DOE requirements imposed on the USEC; (2) take enforcement actions; or (3) direct or recommend gaseous diffusion plant employees to take or not to take any actions. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to DOE, until the NRC assumes regulatory oversight for the leased portion of the gaseous diffusion plants in accordance with the Act. E. Nothing in this agreement is intended to restrict or otherwise limit the authority of the NRC to exercise its full regulatory authority, including both inspection and enforcement authority, at such time as NRC assumes regulatory authority over the leased portion of the gaseous diffusion plants in accordance with Title II of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. F. Under this Agreement, up to three NRC Resident Inspectors may be located at each gaseous diffusion plant site with visits from Regional and Headquarters staff to become familiar with plant operations. IV. DOE's General Responsibilities DOE is responsible for conducting nuclear safety and safeguards ad security inspections of the leased portions of the gaseous diffusion plants to ensure that the plants are designed, constructed, tested, operated, maintained, and decommissioned in accordance with DOE regulatory requirements. These inspections are conducted in accordance with the DOE Regulatory Oversight Inspection and Enforcement Manual (Manual) using personnel appropriately qualified and trained to perform the necessary tasks. Only the DOE may take appropriate enforcement actions for all inspections conducted under this Agreement. V. NRC's General Responsibilities A. The NRC, through its Resident and other inspectors, will conduct inspections and make observations for the purpose of obtaining information and knowledge of the gaseous diffusion plans and USEC's operation thereof. Such inspections shall be coordinated with the authorized DOE representative to ensure that both the scope and findings of the inspections are clearly communicated. B. NRC activities will be performed in accordance with Federal standards and requirements and DOE practices, with no undue burden on the DOE or the USEC. VI. Implementation The DOE and NRC agree to work in concert to ensure that the following staffing, inspection and enforcement, communications and information exchange, and conflict resolution protocol regarding the NRC Inspector activities are followed. A. Staffing 1. The NRC will select its inspectors in accordance with its own procedures and qualifications. 2. The NRC is responsible for obtaining security clearances for its inspectors. 3. The NRC is responsible for ensuring that NRC Inspectors comply with safety requirements established by the USEC. The NRC is not required to follow USEC's fitness-for-duty program but will instead follow its own internal fitness-for-duty program. DOE is not responsible for ensuring access or space for NRC personnel. USEC is responsible for ensuring access and space for NRC personnel. 4. NRC and Office of Government Ethics Conflict of Interest regulations will be in effect for NRC Inspectors conducting inspection activities related to the Gaseous Diffusion Plants.
