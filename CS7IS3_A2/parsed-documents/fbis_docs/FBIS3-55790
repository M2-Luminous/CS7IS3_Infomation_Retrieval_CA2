Anatoliy Smirnov, who has not yet turned 30, defeated former speaker Yuriy Manakov who boasts the highest popularity rating in the republic, according to the latest opinion polls. Smirnov made a typical Soviet-Russian style career. He began as an ordinary worker, but then switched to Komsomol, the youth branch of the former Soviet Communist Party, and succeeded to raise to the post of the secretary of a district party committee. However, when market reforms began in the country, Smirnov abandoned the Communist post and went to work in a commercial bank and after that to a property managing fund which organised privatisation.
