Both countries were sharing in the unification of Europe, he emphasized -- in the ensuring of security, in political dialogue and in the development of trade. The Czech Republic was an important part of this process, Hurd said. As far as its journey to the "European family" was concerned, the Czech Republic was cooperating with its neighbors, but when it came to membership of NATO and the European Union, it was proceeding individually, he added. Hurd said that his talks with Zieleniec and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has shown that the two countries had similar opinions on the future development and shape of the European Union. Both of them believed in free trade leading to improved living standards, and in the identity of nation states, not in the subjugation of national identities to some sort of "European superstate." There had been progress in trade between the Czech Republic and Britain, Hurd said, but "it was not enough." He believed that British trade and investments in the Czech Republic had to be supported. Zieleniec praised Britain's role in promoting the integration of Central Europe into the European Union, and above all Hurd's personal efforts. There had been much discussion between him and Hurd of the significance of free trade in European integration, Zieleniec said. They had agreed that the liberalization of world trade was valuable in itself, and that new protectionism could not be camouflaged with fictions about social dumping and so on. Zieleniec also expressed his pleasure at the British support of Czech membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). "For us becoming part of an organization which unites the developed countries of the West is of not only practical, but also symbolic significance," Zieleniec said.
