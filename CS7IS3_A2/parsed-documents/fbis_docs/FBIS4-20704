A wide variety of information must be collected and analyzed and a broad range of expertise is required when working up decommissioning plans and undertaking decommissioning projects. For this reason, there has been a need to establish a decommissioning database system that gathers together, analyzes and systematically sorts decommissioning-related information obtained from domestic and overseas open-source documents, international cooperative efforts and overseas studies. In response to this need, the Research Association for Nuclear Facilities Decommissioning (RANDEC), in addition to having been commissioned by the Science and Technology Agency (STA) to construct a personal computer-based ``General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System,'' is also developing a personal computer-based ``Materials Management Database System for the Decommissioning of the Nuclear-powered Vessel `Mutsu','' for JAERI, and a ``Nuclear Fuel Facilities Dismantling Database System'' for the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC). RANDEC is also pushing forward with the development of its own ``Multimedia Database System (RAIDA)'' that will be capable of being applied to numerous other fields as well. This article is designed to provide an overview of the ``General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System'' that RANDEC is developing at the behest of STA, as well as RANDEC's own ``RAIDA System'' currently under development. 1. General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System As shown in Figure 1, the General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System is actually comprised of three sub-databases: a bibliographic information database, a general information database and a technical information database. Figure 1. Configuration of the General-purpose 1.1 Special Characteristics of Each Database (1) Bibliographic Information Database Comprehensive science and technology-related databases are already being operated by INIS, JICST and others, but these users have to retrieve needed information from voluminous data registered in mainframe computers, and these retrieval operations require a good deal of experience and knowhow. To provide users with an attractive option, one capable of being much more user friendly, this bibliographic database has been equipped with the following special features: [1] It stores bibliographic data dealing exclusively with the field of nuclear facilities obsolescence; [2] It contains a broad range of information, including information presented verbally at meetings of scientific societies, associations, etc. and made public at international conferences; [3] It makes use of a list of codes that classify obsolete equipment as to technology field, facilities, theme and target country to make it possible to draw associations between the bibliographic data collected in the database and to more rapidly retrieve that data. The major classifications used to define obsolete equipment technology fields are general decommissioning technology, systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement, remote operations, reutilization, measures to deal with dismantled waste, safety management and inventory evaluation. A specific example of these classifications, to include a few intermediate classifications, is provided in Table 1. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Examples of Decommissioning Technology Classification Codes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |0000 |General decommissioning technology | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1000 |Systems engineering | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2000 |Decontamination (General) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3000 |Dismantlement of steel structures (Ge-| | |neral) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3100 |Electrical energy disconnection (Gene-| | |ral) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3110 |Plasma arc method | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3111 |Plasma jet method | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (2) General Information Database The General Information Database is designed primarily for use in planning and PA, and classifies and sorts information collected from various documents and materials into [1] government policies/regulations, [2] organizations, [3] projects, [4] international conferences, [5] research reactors, [6] commercial reactors, [7] nuclear fuel cycles, [8] waste, [9] patents and [10] others. This database stores both textual and image data. (3) Technical Information Database The Technical Information Database is made up of a ``Qualitative Technical Information Database'' and a ``Quantitative Technical Information Database.'' [1] Qualitative Technical Information Database The Qualitative Technical Information Database is designed to enable the collection of general technical information related to obsolete equipment. Data stored in this database consists of qualitatively sorted technical information related to obsolete equipment (systems engineering, decontamination, dismantlement, remote operation, reutilization, dismantled waste measures, safety management and inventory evaluation data), and provides users with summaries, special features, performance, scope and achievement data related to obsolescence technologies. [2] Quantitative Technical Information Database The Quantitative Technical Information Database is designed to sort and store quantitative information required for evaluating appropriate technologies for application to obsolete equipment, and can be used as a dismantlement systems engineering database. This database provides users with quantitative information on dismantling time schedules, numbers of workers and processes, radiation dosage, generated waste volume and costs. 1.2 Database Size At present, there are roughly 10,000 data elements of bibliographic information related to obsolete equipment stored in the Atomic Energy Database operated by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), another roughly 12,000 such data elements available via the INIS database and an additional 2,000 such data elements stored in the Japan Information Center for Science and Technology (JICST) database. The General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System is expected to contain roughly 20,000 bibliographic data elements, comprising the most useful information from existing databases plus similar such information expected to be generated in future, as well as approximately 3,000 general information data elements and about 1,000 technical information data elements. 1.3 System Configuration After conducting comprehensive evaluations of database size, ease of system development, ease of maintenance and operation, information provision methods (online services, etc.) and development costs, it was decided that this database system would be built around a personal computer. Each of the databases comprising this system feature roughly the same overall system configurations and functions, and share the same classification codes. And database operations have been simplified thanks to interactive input systems that employ pull-down menus. Figure 2 shows the overall system configuration for the Bibliographic Information Database, and Figure 3 shows its functional configuration. Figure 2. Overall Configuration of the Bibliographic Figure 3. Functional Configuration of the Bibliographic Arago dBXL, an off-the-shelf database software was selected as the software for the General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System, and application programs are being prepared. Arago dBXL is compatible with dBASE IV, possesses image data-handling functions and it has a compiled run module that is license free. It also features multi-system support functions, which enable it to run on PC-98, IBM, J3100 and FMR personal computers. Figure 4 shows the system's principal retrieval functions and the retrieval flow. When conducting item search operations, the user can focus his search by specifying multiple items, such as the above-described classification items (specifying the classification code from pop-up menus using a mouse) and data numbers, titles (character search) and authors (character search) as search conditions. Free term searches are also possible. Figure 4. Principal Retrieval Items and the Retrieval Tables 2 and 3 provide sample outputs of search results obtained from the Qualitative Technical Information Database. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

High 1.4 Management System This database system is not that large, and its users will most likely be limited to parties directly involved in decommissioning operations. Studies are therefore currently aimed at initially providing data in the form of photomagnetic (magneto-optical (MO)) disks or floppy disks. 1.5 Development Schedule Development of the Bibliographic Information Database got under way in fiscal 1990, followed by work on the General Information Database and Qualitative Technical Information Database, all of which are still under development. Detailed design work on the Quantitative Technical Information Database is about to commence. These various database systems will be made available to the public one at a time in the future. 2. RAIDA System Development At the office, bibliographic data and black-and-white image data are managed using electronic file servers. But since color image data, such as photographs, albums, videotapes and the color drawings and diagrams attached to reports of research results cannot currently be handled by these file servers, personal computer-based data management systems are coming into demand. At RANDEC, therefore, as part of our work aimed at developing a ``Dismantlement Material Control System,'' which is a constituent part of dismantlement systems engineering, we are in the process of developing the RANDEC Image Database (RAIDA) system, which will feature a library function for rapid retrieval of these types of color image data, and a presentation function for storing images, including video images, complete with narrations. 2.1 Past Problems and Solutions to Constructing Image Databases The personal computers and applications software used in conventional databases have been limited to processing textual information, and this has created numerous problems in constructing image databases. These problems are outlined in Table 4. However, the recent appearance of multimedia personal computers and related software has dispelled these problems and made it possible to easily and inexpensively construct database systems capable of handling both still and moving images, complete with narrations. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

Table 5 shows the main functions, principal configuration equipment, database software and special features of the two component systems of the RAIDA system. Figure 5 provides a configuration diagram of the RAIDA-MAC system. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5.

Block Diagram of Entire RAIDA-MAC System These systems take data in directly from the video cameras and video tape recorders, create moving picture data (RAIDA-MAC) or still picture data (RAIDA-98), and register this data in their respective databases. Users can use the database retrieval functions to have the data they want to see displayed rapidly on the PC monitor screen. With moving picture data, the narration starts automatically as soon as the video/movie is displayed on the screen. The narration-supported image displayed on the CRT can be simultaneously displayed on large-sized home TV sets with either system, a capability that makes for convincing presentations that have a strong impact on the viewer. Ordinary video libraries take time to search out and display the desired video presentation, and from the standpoint of costs, cannot be updated all that frequently. However, with the RAIDA system, not only can desired data be retrieved quickly, but replacing old information with the latest image data can be carried out easily, inexpensively, and therefore frequently. And when moving picture data is created, new video titles can be made in-house without ordering them from outside parties. 2.3 Uses Since the RAIDA system is a multimedia database that fuses together moving picture and voice data, it is capable of presentations that overflow with realism. For example, this system can display the atmosphere of work sites inside access-restricted cells, thereby allowing people normally denied access to that site to get a real feel for the atmosphere of that site. And parts replacement operations that are difficult to understand from verbal or textual explanations alone can be quickly understood and carried out without a hitch by referring to full-color image data retrieved from this system and displayed on the CRT screen. Some other specific areas where the RAIDA system is expected to find application are: [1] For presentations of the results of research and development work and records of construction projects; [2] For PA presentations; [3] For training manuals for plant operations and maintenance (collections of moving picture data focusing on those aspects requiring specific knowhow); [4] For safety manuals; and [5] For government orientation presentations (related to approvals and licenses). 2.4 Future Tasks RANDEC will strive to enhance the operability of the RAIDA-98 system in future, and enable it to handle Arago-Windows database software. As for the RAIDA-MAC system, however, there is not that much development work left to do since the off-the-shelf software capable of running on this system is already so complete that RANDEC can enhance system functions simply by selecting the appropriate software from among the numerous packages available. When it comes to displaying moving pictures on a big screen, as it stands now, these systems require the addition of dynamic image compression/extension boards that display more than 30 frames per second in order to produce a smooth moving picture display. RANDEC is looking forward to the commercialization of an inexpensive compression/extension board. In future, we can expect to see the integration of these RAIDA systems with materials and worker management database systems for structures slated for dismantling. Conclusions RANDEC would like to complete development and testing of the General-purpose Obsolescence Information Database System, open it to the public and commence formal operations as soon as possible. And in future, in addition to collecting new data and perfecting the data registered in this system even further, it hopes to expand its functions to include full-color data capabilities, and will strive to fine tune its database management system and integrate it with other, related databases. The RAIDA systems are the latest in multimedia database systems, and feature technologies that can be put to use in a wide range of applications in addition to the field of nuclear power PA. RANDEC would like to further develop these systems in future by equipping them with new multimedia technologies and expanding their functions.
