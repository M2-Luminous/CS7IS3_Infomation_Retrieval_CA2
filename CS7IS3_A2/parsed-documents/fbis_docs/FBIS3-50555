After that meeting, Rojas read before local and foreign media representatives a three-page communique admitting that there is a significant social and ancestral underdevelopment in Chiapas State. He assured that this state occupied first place in the government's social investment over the past five years. Rojas said that the secretariat under his responsibility--that is, the Social Development Secretariat--by order of President Salinas will continue its dialogue with various social organizations of the jungle area, the Chiapas border area, Catholic Church bishops, and members of other churches to continue projects that have been carried out in the past few years. These projects were defined by the authorities mainly with the participation of regional social groups. Let's listen to a portion of the communique that Secretary Rojas read this afternoon at Los Pinos: [Begin Rojas recording] Due to the violent incidents that occurred on 1 January, the government of the Republic reaffirms its willingness to establish new means to settle the problems of the jungle area and border areas of that state; in this regard, President Carlos Salinas has instructed us to make additional efforts to reach this goal. A group of officials will visit Chiapas State to establish a discussion table, along with Governor (Elmar Checher), to address the regional social problems, to review, along with the various social organizations, the progress made by the agreed upon works, to review technical files, to (?discuss) production works and projects that will be carried out, and to define new actions for this year, as was agreed upon previously with regional groups. I would like to point out that for the Federal Government Chiapas State is top priority. We know of the ancestral social underdevelopment affecting it, and this is why it occupies first place in social investment of the national Solidarity Program. During the past five years of the current administration, Chiapas received 8 percent of the total national investment. Social investment grew by more than 1,000 percent during this period. [end recording] Secretary Rojas mentioned some figures reflecting the magnitude of the efforts made in the past years. Eighty first-rate centers and rural medical units and hospitals in Huitzla and Mapastepec were built. More than 4,000 schools were incorporated into the (Digna) school program, and 1,900 school rooms and 108 laboratories were built. About 3,000 km of roads and highways were built. More than 1,200 communities and low-income settlements have electricity today. Five hundred water and drainage systems were built and rehabilitated in 65 municipalities. More than 90,000 peasants received credits without collateral [credito a la palabra] to cultivate 150,000 hectares. The 110 town councils of the state have municipality funds from the Solidarity Program to meet the people's most urgent needs. Nineteen regional Indian funds were established to support the production projects of the ethnic groups. Carlos Rojas added that to face the drop in the international price of coffee--a problem that has worsened economic problems in the Chiapas highlands--the government has supported 60,000 growers who face this difficult situation. The secretary said that in Chiapas there has been a willingness to hold talks and conciliatory efforts; he added that this has led to the solution of agrarian problems such as those in Venustiano Carranza, Simojovel, and (Huiztiupan). Rojas said that there was progress in the efforts to reach a consensus with the groups residing near the jungle and its original inhabitants. This unprecedented effort, according to Carlos Rojas, has reduced the number of landless peasants in Chiapas State. Let's continue to listen to Secretary Rojas: [Begin Rojas recording] Despite the great efforts made by the state and federal governments and by the state social groups, there are areas where demographic growth and the deterioration of natural resources have worsened social problems. [end recording] Secretary Rojas read the document and left the Venustiano Carranza Room with no other comment.
