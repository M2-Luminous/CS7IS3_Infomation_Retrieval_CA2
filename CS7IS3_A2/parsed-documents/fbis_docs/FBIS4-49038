In his welcoming remarks, Brown said he hopes Zou's visist will mark a new beginning of U.S.-China relations. He said the two countries have a lot in common and how their relations will develop is something that has a great bearing on both American and Chinese peoples. It is his belief that with the joint efforts by both sides, the difficulties that exist at present can be overcome, Brown said. In reply, Vice-Premier Zou said his current visit is aimed at keeping the momentum of high-level contacts between China and the United States and exploring, together with U.S. leaders and friends from the industrial and business community here, ways to expand economic and trade cooperation between the two countries and pushing ahead bilateral relations in all fields. When the world is making the transition from the old pattern to a new one, he noted, economic considerations are becoming an increasingly important factor in international affairs. As the largest developing and the largest developed countries, China and the United States have great complementarity in the economic and trade fields, he said, adding that these favorable subjective and objective conditions have afforded Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade a broad prospect for development. China's economy, he continued, is entering a period of high growth and its tremendous market potential is being tapped. In face of the huge China market, people of vision and businessmen of different countries are considering and formulating their strategies from a new perspective in order to meet the increasingly fierce competition, he said. Zou expressed his sincere hope that the foresighted people in the U.S. industrial and business community will seize the current historic opportunity to expand their business in China. "What is more, I hope the U.S. Government will render more support to its people in their efforts to compete in China and create necessary conditions for them," he stressed. He described it as the duty of the leaders of the two countries to give top priority to the fundamental and long-term interests instead of being swayed by a single, fleeting event. So long as the two governments abide by the principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the principle of enhancing mutual confidence, reducing trouble, increasing cooperation and refraining confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will register a greater development, the Chinese vice-premier said. Zou arrived in Washington last weekend to pay an official visit. He is the highest-level Chinese leader to visit the United States in five years.
