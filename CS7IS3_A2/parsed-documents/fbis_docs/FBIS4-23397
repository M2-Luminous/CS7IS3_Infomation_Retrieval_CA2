These sources also say that the government offer should not in any way be viewed as a weakness. On the contrary, they add, it should be viewed by UNITA and its leader Jonas Savimbi, who have claimed to be champions of peace and democracy, as a realistic and beneficial stand for the nation. The figures contacted by Angola Radio Nacional have called on the international community to pressure UNITA to end the bloody war that will have unforeseen consequences for the country. Meanwhile, it is already known that, within the framework of the national sensitization campaign and pacification of hearts, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel will continue to broadcast in short wave, as an exception, for about 260 days once a peace agreement is reached in Lusaka. After that date and in accordance with the legislation in force, the UNITA radio will become a depoliticized radio station, broadcasting in adequate frequencies to be accorded to it.
