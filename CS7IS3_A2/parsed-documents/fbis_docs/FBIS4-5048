The agreement, which came after two days of talks ended in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Wednesday, also calls for serving the new ferry route on a trial basis in July, the official said. The shipping talks were held under a February 1991 agreement between the Japanese and then Soviet governments. The two sides are slated to meet again between late May and early June in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to negotiate details of the trial service, including how many and how long.
