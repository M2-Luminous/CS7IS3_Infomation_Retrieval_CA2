FR940323-0-00104 FR940323-0-00024 As explained in the report, Runzheimer surveys airline fares to determine the cost of Public Transportation. Runzheimer does not survey municipal mass transportation. The cost of bus, subway, or taxi service is not part of the surveys because the service available in many allowance areas is not comparable to the service available in the DC area. Instead of public mass transportation, Runzheimer compares the cost of round-trip airfare from the allowance area to Los Angeles, California, with the cost of round-trip airfare from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles. Two commenters objected to the selection of Los Angeles as the common destination point for comparing airfares. They stated that the Los Angeles routes were highly competitive and resulted in lower fares compared with other destinations. As stated in the report, Los Angeles was selected because it is a common point within the continental United States that is roughly equidistant from each of the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The route may be highly competitive, but that does not invalidate cost comparisons because it is the relative cost of air travel that is being measured. If competition reduces fares, the reductions will be reflected in the Washington, DC, to Los Angeles fares as well as the allowance area to Los Angeles fares. Therefore, OPM believes the comparisons are appropriate. Some commenters stated that the model did not measure true air transportation costs. The commenters stated that inter-island travel, travel within Alaska, and travel to the contiguous 48 States required more frequent use of air transportation. OPM included in the employee survey several questions regarding travel. OPM plans to review the transportation component of the COLA model in light of the results of the employee survey. Comments on the Miscellaneous Component One commenter objected to the assumption in the model that the cost of certain Miscellaneous Component items is the same in the allowance area as in the Washington, DC, area. The commenter said that cultural differences might lead to larger expenditures for gifts. The commenter also noted that the Senate Committee asked OPM to review the Miscellaneous Component to ensure that the results reflect actual living costs and do not assume equal costs between areas. The relative costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Component index reflects ``actual'' living cost differences. The cost of only two items does not differ among areas_(1) Life insurance and pensions and (2) cash contributions and gifts. For Federal employees, the cost of life insurance and required contributions to a Federal retirement system do not vary by area. Any additional insurance or contributions to retirement systems are a matter of personal preference. Gifts and cash contributions for church, charity, or other purposes are a matter of personal preference and/or reflect lifestyle differences that are beyond the scope of the COLA program. As noted earlier, OPM is studying the issue of lifestyle differences and plans to discuss it in its report to Congress. One commenter proposed using the Goods and Services Component index to adjust the cash contributions/gifts category to reflect the cost of gift items purchased locally. OPM is researching this issue along with the general composition of and assumptions used in the Miscellaneous Component. OPM plans to include the results of this review in its report to Congress. One commenter said that the medical expense portion of the Miscellaneous Component failed to reflect the higher out-of-pocket expenses that Federal employees in the allowance areas frequently incurred. The commenter cited several possible causes for such higher costs including higher costs not covered by insurance carriers, the absence of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in several allowance areas, and the need to travel outside the area to obtain some medical services. In the employee survey, OPM asked several questions regarding medical expenses, and in addition, OPM is researching related health cost issues. OPM plans to include the results of its research and the employee survey in its report to Congress. One commenter stated that employees in the allowance areas have to save at a higher rate to afford the down payment for a house or car or to pay for college/university education. The commenter said that OPM should take this into consideration and use the Goods and Services Component index to adjust the amount of money saved relative to Washington, DC. As noted in the report, Runzheimer believes that savings and investments made for the purpose of future purchases of housing, durable goods, education, and similar items are best accounted for in the category or component associated with the item. OPM agrees with this approach and notes that this approach is consistent with the methodology the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in the CES. The commenter also stated that the COLA model should take into consideration the fact that COLAs do not count toward retirement. The commenter believed that Federal employees had to invest at a higher rate in pensions and other savings vehicles to afford to retire in the allowance areas.
