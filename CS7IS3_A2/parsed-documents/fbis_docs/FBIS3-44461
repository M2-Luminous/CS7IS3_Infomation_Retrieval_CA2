Yao Zhenyan said: With gradual delegation of powers in fixed assets investments and the introduction of market mechanisms since China embarked on its reform and opening up programs 15 years ago, a new structure is being developed. Investment units, which in the past depended heavily on state appropriations for investment funds, have shifted to raise their own funds through such means as bank loans, financial allocations, and utilization of foreign funds. The role of main investor -- primarily played by the central government in the past -- has been taken over by local governments in cooperation with the central government, by state-owned enterprises, by collective enterprises, by individuals, and by foreign firms. The format of investment has been shifted from near exclusive government investment in the past to joint investment between the central and the local governments, between local governments, between governments and enterprises, and between enterprises; as well as to Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperation. The format for expanding reproduction has changed; rather than relying heavily on new projects and items as in the past, equal emphasis is being laid simultaneously on technical transformation of existing enterprises to broaden their internal reproduction. Administrative assignment of constructing investment projects has given way to tender and bidding. In meeting the requirements of the 14th CPC National Congress on the establishment of a socialist market economic system, Yao Zhenyan maintained that, obviously, the current investment and financial system is still rather incompatible for facilitating markets to truly play the fundamental role in disposing of resources under state macroeconomic control. Judging from the actual situation prevailing in the current investment field, problems do exist prominently in the following three aspects. First, the scale of investment is overextended, as reflected mainly in excessive investments. Second, the structure of investment is irrational; and a large amount of funds are being diverted to low-level, low- efficiency overlapping construction or blind development of real estates or development zones, leaving little for bottleneck departments and key construction projects. Third, low investment efficiency, huge amounts of waste, unregulated fund-raising, and indiscriminate borrowing have worsened the irrational disposal of resources, raised investment costs, and lowered the macro efficiency of investment. To fundamentally resolve problems existing in the investment and financial field, we must start with reform and establish an investment and financial system compatible with a socialist market economy. The overall objective of restructuring is to reform the investment and financial format by fully bringing out the market's regulatory role in investment and financial activities; to establish a mechanism aimed at reducing the investment risks of enterprises who, as main investors, have to make their own decisions and face risks; to perfect the indirect regulatory system on aggregate investments and structure compatible with a socialist market economic system so that timely and effective regulation and control can be effected; and to establish an investment-related service system and essential factors markets to ensure fair competition under relevant laws and regulations. Yao Zhenyao said: In the near future, reforms covering the following six aspects will be carried out actively but prudently and will gradually be implemented: -- On the basis of efficiency, market demands, and the nature of investment and financial activities, construction projects will be classified into competitive, infrastructure, and public welfare project investments. A new financing format will be formulated, under which enterprises will become main players in competitive project investment with the market as their main source of financing; infrastructure project investment will be invested and financed by the central government, with increased participation from local governments and enterprises; and governments will be primarily responsible for investment in public welfare projects. -- We will establish mechanisms aimed at reducing investment risks, and change the methods for deciding on and the procedures for examining and approving projects. A legal person is essential before a project is decided upon. In order to expand the decisionmaking powers of legal persons, they may conduct feasibility studies and work out tentative plans for competitive investment projects meeting the requirements of the state industrial policy. -- As far as macro regulation and control over investments are concerned, the central government will work out unified regulatory and control policies and objectives to be carried out by both the central and provincial governments. Provincial investment companies will be the main source of investment for local infrastructure projects. -- In reforming methods for planning management, the total volume of investments will no longer be controlled by a set planned target but through the source of funds, using economic means for indirect regulation and control. There will be no targets for individual investments at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous levels, while the supervision of collective investments by local authorities will be intensified according to the state industrial policy and actual local conditions. -- Policy lending must be separated from commercial loans. While projects in line with state industrial policy may get loans from commercial banks, it is up to the project operators and the banks concerned to mutually select each other and take their own risks; government departments can only provide guidance. -- We will formulate a central policy on investment and financial system and organize the establishment of a state development bank.
