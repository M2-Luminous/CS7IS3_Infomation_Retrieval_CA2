Zhu Senlin gave an interview to the guests. At the meeting, Xie Fei pointed out: We hope that Hong Kong will have a smooth transition in 1997. Stability and prosperity are in the interests of both Hong Kong and the mainland as they have identical interests. Zhu Senlin remarked: In the last 15 years of reform and opening up to the outside world, Guangdong and Hong Kong have established very close ties. He maintained that Guangdong and Hong Kong can complement each other using their own strong points. In the days to come, they can open up new avenues of cooperation in two ways: One is that Guangdong and Hong Kong can join hands to develop the international market and the other way is that in finance, Hong Kong's strong point as a financial center should be utilized to do an ever better job of raising funds. This will help to raise funds promptly for Guangdong's economic construction and provide support in funds for the province's effort to set up enterprises abroad.
