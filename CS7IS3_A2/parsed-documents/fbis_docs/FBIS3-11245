PDC priorities are to invest in people and focus national efforts on the universalization of services, like education, health, nutrition, environmental protection, and potable water. It will seek to increase fiscal reform to ensure that the state has the necessary resources to invest in these areas. Secondly, the PDC will broaden and strengthen the business base. It offers the facilities to any Salvadoran who wants to establish his own business. It will strengthen those who already own businesses and will promote mini-, small-, and medium-scale businessmen as well as farmers and professionals. The third axis of the PDC strategy is to promote productive investments. The party offers to generate new and better jobs; build a healthy, strong, and productive economy through the creation of a stable macroeconomic framework; promote an honest system of economic incentives; and increase public and private savings nationwide. It also proposes programs to promote the productive use of remittances and the participation of the private sector in areas like energy and communications. The policies proposed to promote productive investment include a broadening of financial reform, including the creation of a special financial system to meet the needs of farmers and small-, and medium-scale businesses. The following existing organizations, Agricultural Development Bank, FIGAPE [expansion unknown], Credit Federation, and all nongovernmental organizations that grant credit to the sector, would comprise this system. It proposes defining and implementing a comprehensive industrialization and productive reorganization policy and special programs to promote foreign investment. Points by Sector The PDC platform emphasizes the importance of modernizing and diversifying agriculture by creating the National Agricultural Council, which would represent the sector tasked with defining national agricultural policy. The PDC offers to reform state-owned institutions related to the agricultural sector. This reform would seek to decentralize agricultural support services and modernize its institutions. It seeks to find realistic and viable solutions to banking and agricultural problems and farmers who suffered the effects of the armed conflict. This policy seeks to comply with the "Rehabilitation of Production Sectors Affected By the Armed Conflict Law." The PDC offers to implement a comprehensive policy to promote agricultural exports, privatize state-owned assets related to the agricultural sector by granting privileges to small- and medium- scale farmers and cooperative member associations, and promote a comprehensive policy of technical and technological assistance in this sector. The government strategy proposes strengthening a special financial system for the business sector through modern methods that are in keeping with characteristics and the beginning of production reorganization to increase competitiveness in the face of foreign competition, including measures like: -- Short-term financing for working capital and medium- and long- term financing for the acquisition of machinery and equipment in favorable conditions. -- the development of business training programs. -- the application of a human resources program in this sector. The plan includes establishing a professional training program with post-graduate scholarships and financing for companies that offer professional and consultation services. It suggests implementing scientific-technological strategies focused on the private sector, government, and academic institutions to promote the creation and strengthening of professional associations. External Sector The PDC proposes to promote exports by creating a joint organization between GOES [expansion unknown] and the private sector which would be tasked with coordinating and implementing the export policy. It calls for the establishment of adequate macroeconomic incentives (stable and realistic exchange rates as well as timely financial resources). Also, the creation of an international network to promote the country's export offers and the establishment of a productive reorganization program to support the sectors that were and will be affected by the commercial liberalization process.
