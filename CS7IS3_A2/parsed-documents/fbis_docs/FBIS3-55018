At a press conference Monday, Landsbergis said signs of a "new Yalta" have appeared and are very threatening to central Europe, especially Lithuania. Discussing the problem of NATO membership, the opposition leader said a decision to join the alliance is "self-determination, and not only for countries in our region, but for western countries, as well." Landsbergis said Bulgaria and Macedonia have already officially asked for NATO membership and are treated as "the last states to have expressed a wish" to join the alliance. He expressed hope that Lithuania will be "the last one" and the Dec. 23 resolution of the Lithuanian parliament will be taken into account. Meanwhile, the Lithuanian administration simply awaits the Jan. 10 NATO summit, the opposition leader said. He reminded reporters that Lithuanian authorities still have several days left to make their move. Landsbergis said he is deeply concerned about a New Year's speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who vowed to better defend the interests of Russians living in the former Soviet republics. The opposition leader pointed out Yeltsin's words that Russia will have difficulty in preserving peace and that Russia will defend its own interests, as well as the interests of its citizens in other countries.
