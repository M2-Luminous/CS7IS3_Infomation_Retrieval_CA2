Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, told the 1994 China summit that the operational order of China's foreign trade has been relatively normal and the operation of the new foreign trade system has been satisfactory. In her speech entitled "Deepening Foreign Trade System Reform, Promoting Sino-Foreign Economic and Trade Cooperation", she said that the reform of the foreign trade system this year is markedly different from that carried out during the previous 15 years. The reform this time is being closely coordinated with that in other main areas of the national economy, such as taxation, finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and enterprises. "It is unprecedented in terms of scope, dynamics and difficulties," she said. To ensure the smooth progress of the reform, she said, it was necessary to focus attention on the overall situation of economic system reform and properly handle the relations between the foreign trade reform and reforms in other sectors. It was also imperative to conscientiously handle relations between foreign trade development and reform and effectively maintain good order in foreign trade operations, as well as encourage and protect legitimate competition among enterprises, she added. "China has consistently pursued a policy of independence, maintaining initiative in its own hands, equality and mutual benefit," she said. "We are willing to develop various forms of economic and trade cooperation with all countries and regions." At today's meeting, other Chinese officials, including Liu Zhongli, minister of finance, Chen Yuan, vice-president of the People's Bank of China, Liu Hongru, chairman of China Securities Supervision and Management Commission, Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany, as well as some foreign entrepreneurs, also delivered speeches. The meeting came to a close this evening.
