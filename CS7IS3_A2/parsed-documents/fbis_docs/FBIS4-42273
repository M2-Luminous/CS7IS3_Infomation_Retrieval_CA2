It seems the government did not take these warnings too seriously and went ahead to implement certain measures with the potential of creating social disorder in an already volatile society. Demirel has been urging the leaders all along not to take excessive measures like closing down factories and other state facilities, which will only serve to increase the jobless rate in Turkey and sow the seeds of social upheaval. The president is aware that some sensible austerity measures are needed but sees that this should not create social discord in the society. If the price of immediate economic salvation is social unrest then the president says we have to accept the fact that the austerity measures can be delayed or can be implemented at a slower pace to avert a crisis which could eventually turn into political turbulence. This is one of the reasons why the president on Wednesday vetoed the bill which was designed to sell off all residential accommodation and social facilities owned by the government. This would have meant the accommodation provided for civil servants at highly reduced rates being taken away from them and being sold by the State to the public to earn money.... The president felt the loss to the country because the anger and social unrest created by the sale of the homes for civil servants would far exceed the revenue of 100 trillion Turkish lira expected from the sale of these accommodations to the public. The president says civil servants cannot afford current rents but, with their meager salaries, can only afford low-rent State accommodation. The loss of these privileges would create deep resentment among civil servants and this is the last thing the country needs at the moment. Both Demirel and Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk share the view that social unrest has to be avoided at all costs, because once the people take to the streets it will be very hard to convince them to return to their homes. One leading state official, who asked not to be named, told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS: "If these trends continue and the workers as well as the civil servants spill into the streets none of us would be able to face them any more." This is clearly what Demirel sees on the horizon and is set to avert. So Demirel did his duty and took the appropriate decision to veto the bill. When he did so, the coalition partners, instead of feeling betrayed or voicing some kind of criticism, seemed to bow to the verdict and reacted in a positive manner. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, the leader of the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), was quick to say there were several clauses in the bill which they felt were defective and that the veto gave them the opportunity to correct these mistakes.... True Path Party (DYP) spokesman Hasan Peker said the president had given the government the opportunity to make amends. This is a rather odd situation. If the two parties governing Turkey jointly felt the law was defective then why didn't they try to correct their mistakes in the Parliament, and why did they simply allow such a bill to clear the house? This is a government which cannot even defend its own legislation. The entire episode demonstrates the incompetence and weakness of the coalition administration. Turkey clearly does not deserve this.
