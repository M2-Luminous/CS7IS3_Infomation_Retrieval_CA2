"We must strive to push ahead with reform and development amid stability, and achieve social stability and the country's long-term stability through reform and development," he said. He said that 1994 is an important year for China's economic restructuring, with the implementation of so many new reform measures. He stressed the need to further emancipate the mind, do everything in line with specific conditions, properly resolve contradictions and problems arising in the course of implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform measures.
