FR941110-0-00179 FR941110-0-00016 There is no evidence in the Act or the legislative history that the Congress intended to vest nursing home residents with the right to challenge the correctness of the decision to take enforcement measures against the facility. That decision lies with either the Secretary or the State and is subject to challenge by the facility, not the residents. There is no reason to believe that the Congress, in drafting these provisions, had as its objective the overturning of the Supreme Court's decision in O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center , 447 U.S. 773 (1980), and we cannot presume that O'Bannon has been overturned by indirection. Moreover, the plain implication of the transfer and discharge provisions in sections 1819(c) and 1919(c) of the Act is that their focus is on actions that may face an individual resident of a facility rather than all of a facility's residents. Thus, subsection (c)(2)(A) speaks to a transfer or discharge for the resident's welfare or for the health of individuals in the facility. These imply individualized determinations, not the kind of facility determination that automatically subjects the entire Medicare or Medicaid patient population to forced removal from the facility. Additionally, when describing the documentation requirements for discharge or transfer, the Act (in the paragraph immediately following the listing of permissible grounds for such actions) speaks to the necessity for documentation to appear in the resident's clinical record and often times to be entered by the resident's physician. We know, however, that decisions to terminate a facility's provider agreement are made by either the Secretary or the State, not by residents' physicians. Thus, it would seem that the kind of transfer appeals referred to in sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the Act do not encompass issues that are central to the provider agreement termination, but rather decisions affecting the fate of an individual resident that may be made by his or her physician. We believe that sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act give the Secretary and the States discretion in how to apply the transfer notice and appeal provisions of sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2). The Act's enforcement provisions require that the transfer of residents whose facility faces termination be done in a manner ``consistent with'' the provisions of subsection (c)(2). Had the Congress intended that there be strict adherence to the Act's transfer provisions, it could easily have specified that they be followed precisely. Use of the phrase ``consistent with,'' however, implies a less rigorous standard that permits the Secretary and the States to make judgments as to how to best accommodate the notice provisions, for example, while not compromising the effectiveness of the termination action. Thus we believe residents should receive as much notice as possible of their impending transfer as long as the notice period does not further compromise their quality of care. Comment: A few commenters mentioned that the proposed regulation improperly references proposed §488.206(c). Response: The reference to proposed §488.206(c) has not been included in the final rule as §488.426 has been revised to include closure and transfer of residents in NFs and SNF/NFs. Comment: One commenter suggested that the term ``Medicaid facility'' be changed to read ``Medicaid certified facility `` so as not to give the false impression that a facility must be 100 percent Medicaid in order for these provisions to apply. Response: The term ``Medicaid facility'' is commonly used to designate Medicaid certification, regardless of whether or not the entire facility is occupied by Medicaid eligible patients. Proposed §488.228␣Alternative or Additional State Remedies␣(now incorporated in §488.406) Proposed §488.230␣Civil Money Penalties In the final rule, we are redesignating proposed §488.230 as the following sections: ␣ 1Redesignated Section 1Proposed §488.230 §488.430␣CMP: Basis for imposing penalty (a) §488.432␣CMP: When penalty is collected (b) §488.434␣CMP: Notice of penalty (c), (d) §488.436␣CMP: Waiver of hearing, reduction of penalty amount (e) §488.438␣CMP: Amount of penalty (f), (g) §488.440␣CMP: Effective date and duration of penalty (h), (i) §488.442␣CMP: Due date for payment of penalty (j) §488.444␣CMP: Settlement of penalty (k) Comment: We received many general comments regarding civil money penalties. A few commenters who supported this provision of the regulation stated they believed in a swift and certain fine structure which is mandatory in nature and imposed directly on ownership. Response: We appreciate the support of these commenters who realize that civil money penalties can be an effective remedy to encourage prompt compliance with participation requirements as well as to promote the continued rendering of quality health care in a safe environment. Comment: One commenter suggested that we prohibit the recoupment of fines through rate increases.
