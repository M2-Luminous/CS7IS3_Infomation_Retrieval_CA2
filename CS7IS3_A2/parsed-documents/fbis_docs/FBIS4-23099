FBIS TRENDS-9JUN94-China-UK-HK China-UK-Hong Kong China-UK-Hong Kong Beijing Warns Hong Kong on Political Dissidents SUMMARY Reflecting apparent Chinese leadership's sensitivity to the potentially destabilizing influence on China of anti-Beijing dissident activity in Hong Kong, a highly unusual editorial in the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po suggested that Beijing may be reconsidering its longstanding pledge to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist system after the transition to Chinese rule in 1997. END SUMMARY Signs that Beijing may be rethinking its policy of "one country, two systems"--a concept associated with senior leader Deng Xiaoping which calls for the retention of a capitalist economy in Hong Kong for 50 years after the transition--came in a caustic editorial carried by Wen Wei Po on 30 May. The editorial warned that this policy is "feasible" only if dissidents do not use Hong Kong as a "bridgehead" to "interfere with, subvert, or sabotage" China's socialist system. It went on to assert that the implementation of the principle will "suffer" if "one system" tries to "bring down" the other. The editorial also implicitly associated this harsh message with the current Beijing leadership, selectively quoting from a "well-known speech" on Hong Kong policy delivered by party chief Jiang Zemin after China's suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen prodemocracy movement. The editorial referred to Jiang's use of the metaphor of "well water not mixing with river water"--a warning against extending Hong Kong's capitalism to the mainland--but did not mention his assurances that "one country, two systems" would prevail. The editorial's harsh warning flies in the face of repeated assurances by Chinese leaders that capitalism will prevail in Hong Kong after 1997. In a major policy speech as recently as 6 May, Lu Ping, the State Council's Director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, reaffirmed China's pledge to retain Hong Kong as a capitalist "bridge" to the West even as he warned against "movements" that "disrupt the Chinese economy" and efforts by "Hong Kong people" to "exert pressure on the Chinese Government" (Xinhua, 6 May). The "one country, two systems" concept, he said, is "truly China's longterm policy" and is "guaranteed by law." In an apparent effort to portray Lu's speech as consistent with its own hardline theme, the Wen Wei Po editorial highlighted Lu's warning that Hong Kong is not a "political city" that can "influence the mainland politically" and his references to Hong Kong's "economic value" as the basis of Beijing's policy. It did not, however, mention Lu's references to Hong Kong as a bridge to the West. The editorial's harsh rhetoric on Hong Kong may have been prompted by anti-PRC dissident activity in Hong Kong in the runup to the 4 June anniversary of Tiananmen and by fears that Hong Kong authorities will tolerate such activity in the future. Reflecting these concerns, the editorial was particularly critical of the Hong Kong Government's widely reported decision to allow exiled labor activist Han Dongfang to remain in Hong Kong, complaining that Han intended to "organize a solidarity trade union" and make "trouble out of nothing." It also expressed concern about efforts by other prominent dissidents in the United States to "follow in the footsteps of Han Dongfang" and return to Hong Kong to "put on a 'show' first" before moving on into the mainland via the springboard of Hong Kong to "make trouble." While clearly meant as a warning to Hong Kong authorities, the editorial was also critical of U.S. support for the dissidents. It claimed that Han's "anti-China activities" were being funded by "none other than the AFL-CIO." It also purported to see a U.S. hand behind the desire by other dissidents to make Hong Kong their base of operations, saying that "one foreign country" has provided political asylum for this "batch of so-called 'prodemocracy activists'" and that their "bosses" are now "telling" them to return to the mainland to carry out "subversive activities."
