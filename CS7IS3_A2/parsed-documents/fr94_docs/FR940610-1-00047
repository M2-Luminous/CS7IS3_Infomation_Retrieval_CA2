FR940610-1-00047 FR940610-1-00007 Example 5. _ Eroding corpus in an annuity trust. The donor, who is age 60 and in normal health, transfers property worth $1,000,000 to a trust. The trust will pay a 10 percent ($100,000 per year) annuity to a charitable organization for the life of the donor, and the remainder is to be distributed to the donor's child. The section 7520 rate for the month of the transfer is 6.8 percent. Because the 10 percent annuity payout rate exceeds the 6.8 percent income and growth rate that the trust is expected to experience each year, the annuity payout must be assumed to progressively erode the corpus. Using an interest rate of 6.8 percent, an annuity payout of $100,000 per year will exhaust a $1,000,000 trust corpus in 18 years. The final payment at the end of the 18th year will consist of a partial payment of $32,712. Under section 7520, the standard life annuity factors are based on the assumption that any person may survive until age 110. This means that the standard life annuity factor for age 60 (9.8585) takes into account the separate probabilities that a person age 60 may survive to receive each of 50 different annuity payments. However, in the present case, because of the eroding corpus, the person age 60 can be assumed to receive no more than 17 $100,000 annuity payments, regardless of how long that person might survive. Therefore, the standard life annuity factor for a person age 60 (9.8585) is not applicable in this case, and special section 7520 annuity factors that take into account the 18-year limitation on the annuity payout must be used. The special annuity factor for the present value of the right to receive $1.00 per year for 17 years or until the prior death of a person age 60 is $8.6121, and the special factor for the present value of the right to receive $1.00 in 18 years if a person age 60 survives is $.1836. The present value of the charitable annuity interest is $867,269 ($100,000 X 8.6121 plus $32,712 X .1836). (3) Mortality component. The mortality component prescribed under section 7520 is not to be used to determine the present value of an annuity, income interest, remainder interest, or reversionary interest if an individual who is a measuring life dies or is terminally ill at the time the gift is completed. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an individual who is known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating physical condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a 50 percent probability that the individual will die within 1 year. (4) Example. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are illustrated by the following example: Example. _ Terminal illness. The donor transfers property worth $1,000,000 to a child in exchange for the child's promise to pay the donor $103,000 per year for the donor's life. The donor is age 60 but has been diagnosed with an incurable illness and has at least a 50 percent probability of dying within 1 year. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the transfer is 10.6 percent, and the standard annuity factor at that interest rate for a person age 60 in normal health is 7.4230. Thus, if the donor were not terminally ill, the present value of the annuity would be $764,569 ($103,000 X 7.4230). Because there is at least a 50 percent probability that the donor will not survive for 1 more year, the standard section 7520 annuity factor may not be used to determine the present value of the donor's annuity interest. Instead, a special section 7520 annuity factor must be computed that takes into account the projection of the donor's actual life expectancy. (5) Additional limitations. Section 7520 does not apply to the extent provided by the Internal Revenue Service in revenue rulings or revenue procedures. (6) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph are effective with respect to gifts made after [the date these regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal Register].
