FBIS3-25436 "drafr034_d_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Opposition Parties Explain Foreign Policy Positions MB1102094294 Maputo DOMINGO in Portuguese 6 Feb 94 p 4 MB1102094294 Maputo DOMINGO Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Text] With the exception of the Mozambique People's Progress Party [PPPM], which gave a short reply, and other parties, which did not bother to reply our questionnaire, the foreign policy favored by the three parties -- the Mozambican Nationalist Movement [Monamo], the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], and the Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] -- is more or less the same and, curiously, coincides with the foreign policy of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]. Basically, what the three parties favor is a policy of cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of each country, respect and noninterference in internal affairs of each country. What differs, apparently, are the priorities to be taken into account. Some consider cooperation with the five Portuguese-speaking African countries to be a priority, while others give priority to regional cooperation. This theme -- foreign policy -- is the last part of the list of questions that DOMINGO sent to registered political parties, excluding Frelimo. We had formulated our question in the following manner: a) What are the priorities in a political relationship? b) What are the strategies to reduce (or eliminate) foreign debt? c) What is your assessment of the Nongovernmental Organizations [NGOs]? d)What regional integration projects--the Southern African Development Community [SADC] and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa [Comesa]--do support? e) Of the economic, social, and cultural exchange policies, what are the priorities? f) Is there a need to join the Commonwealth? And finally, g) What are the criteria to choose the best economic partner? Monamo In international relations, priority will be given to respect for the treaties and protocols signed with the Mozambican State. Monamo/PMSD will strengthen further international relations with neighboring countries and developed countries that have been economically assisting and expressing solidarity with Mozambique. Foreign Debt: This is a burden that the country will have to reduce through increased productivity and export of surplus produce or essentials, such as the Cahora Bassa power supply, transportation to landlocked countries, mining, timber, prawns, and so on. The foreign debt should be renegotiable and capable of being canceled, with a safe and feasible repayment policy. The NGO's will have to be studied case by case to understand their specific work and assess its national interest. Monamo/PMSD's attitude regarding NGO's is however to recognize their solidarity gesture. d) [as published] Regarding the policy of regional economic integration, we feel that, before integration, we have to organize our own house so that the country can benefit from the institutional advantages of economic integration. It is first necessary to achieve internal stability so that we can have a true integration and not just copy what we see happening in other parts of the world. e) Regarding the policy of economic, social, and cultural exchange, this will depend on the degree of relationship. It should not be a political choice but an exchange based on advantages obtained therefrom. Monamo/PMSD will be governed by pragmatic principles, without forgetting the natural cultural, lingusitic, and economic interdependence. Fortunately, the country, under a social-democratic government led by Monamo, will not be tied to ideological or political interests, but national interests, respecting diplomatic and international principles. Unamo Foreign Policy a) Establishment of amicable relations with all southern African countries, Portuguese-speaking countries, African countries, and other countries in the world in general, on the basis of mutual respect for each state, noninterference in the internal affairs, and mutual benefit. b) We have a potentially rich country. By granting investment facilities to nationals, it would be easy to reduce the foreign debt. This has not been possible because the policy on the country's production and development followed by the government over the past 18 years was disastrous. c) NGO's are welcome because they assisted the Mozambican people during the 18 disastrous years under the ruling Government. They can continue in the country, assisting the Mozambican people in other fields for the country's speedy reconstruction and development. d) As is the case of the EEC in Europe, a similar organization in Southern Africa would be beneficial. This will depend on the development of the Comesa and SADC however. e) The policy of economic, social, and cultural exchange, should be geared first to the countries of the region, Portuguese-speaking countries, Western countries, and -- taking into account current changes -- former East European countries, as well as Nonaligned countries, depending on these countries' interest. f) Since Mozambique is a now a democratic country, based on the rule of law, there is every interest to remove the country from its current misery. Thus, if the Commonwealth expresses interest, we shall certainly join it. g) All countries that want to invest in the country are welcome, provided they have good humanitarian intentions. There is a need to respect national policy, because we shall not accept the country's monopoly in the benefit of foreign interests. Thus, we are open to countries like Italy and others, as long as they respect the principles mentioned above. [Text] Pademo Pademo favors a foreign policy of national independence, solidarity, and cooperation with all countries in the world. Cooperation and international relations should be extended to diplomatic, economic, scientific, and cultural fields, among others. The principle of mutual respect among peoples and national sovereignty, as well as equality among sovereign States, is fundamental for relations and international cooperation. These two fields are interdependent and their development demand the centralization of defined tasks. The noninterference in the internal affairs of other States defended by our party include the rejection of the use of economic and military power to impose on other countries a political and social system, against the wish of the majority of their people. The development of relations with all countries worldwide will be promoted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. The present Higher Institute for International Relations and the School of Journalism should be transformed into an academic and technical institute. The resulting institution should be similar to "business schools" existing in other countries. Pademo is aware of the deep historical links which exist with Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking African countries. With these countries, we favor special relations on the basis of mutual and balanced interests. Pademo also favors the continuation of existing relations with Latin American countries with which our country signed different kinds of accords, within the framework of world solidarity and promotion of technical and scientific development in Mozambique. The party respects principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter and advocates the adoption of a foreign policy which favors peace and views negotiations as the best form to resolve international conflicts. In brief, the policy defended by Pademo in the field of international relations and cooperation, is aimed at achieving and promoting the following objectives: - Promotion and defense of national interests. - Promotion of human solidarity and mutual respect among peoples and nations. - Promotion of international cooperation to consolidate universal peace and eliminate discrimination in all its forms. - Respect for the international law and obligations in treaties, as well as the solution of international disputes, through negotiatioon, mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, and adjudication. - Promotion of a new more just world economic order which will allow less developed countries to find acceptable solutions for problems facing their peoples. Defense of African Unit and Regional Economic Organizations: The OAU, based in Addis Ababa, played an important role in the struggle for political independence of many African countries, including our country. The assistance given by this organization to liberation movements, mainly based in Tanzania, is unparalleled. During the present moment, the struggle for political independence is almost over and most African countries are carrying out internal reforms to democratize their societies. Conscious of the historical responsibilities of the OAU, Pademo supports the role of this organization in its struggle for the economic independence of the continent. This constitutes a new phase of struggle for the emancipation of Africans. It was on the basis of resolutions and recommendations by the OAU heads of state, particularly in the Lagos Plan of Action, that regional organizations, such as Southern African Development Coordination Conference [SADCC], the Preferential Trade Area [PTA], and others were born. The aim was for African countries to form firm fronts of struggle for economic, scientific, and social development. Our party support for these organizations is unconditional. It is our hope that through these organizations, we shall be able to reduce the gap of inequality in various fields between our continent and other continents. The objectives defined by African leaders for the promotion of cooperation between African countries, have not had the desired effect, because of lack of implementation of approved decisions. It is not only because of lack of means that regional projects are not being implemented. Thus, Pademo recommends the adoption of new attitudes in economic, scientific, and other kind of cooperation among African countries. United Nations: The United Nations is an organ that includes most of the world's independent countries. It is made up of various agencies that specialize in various areas. Its principal aims are to promote well-being, justice, and peace in the world. Our party's pacifist policy faithfully and actively supports the resolutions made democratically by UN organs with a view to a peaceful settlement of problems among nations. By the same token, the party advocates: - A policy of neutrality; - Promoting and upholding the policy of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons; - Eliminating all kinds of mass extermination weapons; - Promoting a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries; - Promoting a good neighborliness policy. b) [as published] Only by seeking greater efficiency will it be possible to make sound use of the debts we assume, or they will never benefit the Mozambican people. Debts must be assumed, but in a planned manner. It is not possible to avoid them. c) The nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] must operate in this country in a well planned manner, without interfering with the work of the state and without conflicting interests among themselves. Coordination between NGO's and the state shall always be recommended and the executive must create mechanisms for that purpose. d) It is important that the aims and the nature of Southern African Development Community, SADC, and the "contested" Comesa within the southern African context. Some actions by those organizations suggest their aims are political rather than economic. Pademo recommends a cautious approach by those organizations and it believes that true economic integration will only be possible with the reduction of development imbalances in the various countries that are members of those organizations. However, membership in those organizations is important and operational mechanisms must be treated with caution. e) Annex c) answers this question. f) Pademo does not see the need for Mozambique to integrate the Commonwealth, just as it sees no need for it to become part of the Organization of Islamic Countries. We believe those were opportunistic moves by the Frelimo government in a bid to secure support from countries that are members of those organizations. g) Criteria for choosing economic partners will depend on the country's economic climate. However, our party does not exclude economic cooperation with any country, as long as it also includes economic advantages for this country. Moreover, Pademo believes cooperation should be as diversified as possible to prevent complete dependence on a single economic, scientific, or technical partner. In regard to the advantages of cooperation at large, it is important to note that Pademo believes Italy has played a very important role in our country's political and economic life. We should not blame foreigners alone if the things that are built do not work. It is an open secret that one of our society's major problems has to do with project management. To the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM, "the concrete strategy for pulling the country out of its economic chaos, achieving social progress, and pursuing a foreign policy is to introduce federalism, meaning political decentralization comprising statutory, basic legislative, and general political powers, in addition to administrative, economic, and financial autonomy."
