A two-day conference of representatives of more than 40 regional affiliations of the movement opened today in the parliamentary centre of Russia to form an organising committee and discuss the strategy and tactics of advocates of reforms. According to one of the leaders of Democratic Russia, Aleksandr Korotich, the new party will differ from other Russian parties formed after the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] pattern, that is it will abandon the vertical line of democratic centralism. In his speech, one of the co-chairmen of Democratic Russia, Lev Ponomarev, noted that the idea of turning the movement into a party has been maturing for a long time and become now vital since under the new law on parties, currently considered by the State Duma, only parties may participate in elections while movements should leave the political stage and become mass organisations only. "Like when we started our struggle against communism, now as reforms have choked we should start from the very beginning and are doomed to many years of tenacious efforts," said Lev Ponomarev.
