Citing unidentified sources close to Soares, the article notes that the president's staff is no longer discussing the dissolution of the National Assembly, an option Soares had been rumored to favor for some time. Instead, Soares' staff has focused on possible cooperation between the PS and the Communist Party (PCP) in the 1995 parliamentary elections. According to a source close to the president, the change is the result of the recent municipal elections. Soares was betting that the PSD would sustain heavy losses and that the PS would be supported by a significant number of communists. Disappointed in both instances, Soares now believes that the best way to defeat Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is to unite the Left. PS leader Antonio Guterres, however, seemingly disagrees with the president's new initiative, the article reports. At a meeting of the party's political commission, Guterres made clear that the PS will run alone in the next parliamentary elections and, if elected, would prefer to govern alone. The article cites a number of participants at the meeting as stating that the atmosphere was "very cordial" and that the minority calling for cooperation with the PCP quickly "lowered its flag." According to the article, Guterres stated at the same meeting that the PS's presidential candidate will not be chosen before early 1995, thus forestalling any talk about his own candidacy.
