The federal prosecutor's office announced today in Karlsruhe, in response to an inquiry, that it has started investigations into persons unknown suspected of setting up a terrorist organization and supporting the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). In a letter claiming responsibility, which was made available to WIESBADENER TAGBLATT, it said: "It was no accident, even though it looked like one. We manipulated his Mercedes 300 SE in such a way that it was impossible to tell what caused Saelzer's accident despite the most thorough of examinations." On 27 June this year, the operation aimed at finding the RAF members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld took place in Bad Kleinen. Georg von Rauch was shot in December 1971 in west Berlin during the search for members of the Baader-Meinhof group, the predecessor of the RAF.
