The foreign and economy ministers from the four member countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) today will analyze the Brazilian proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area (ALCSA), some of whose points were anticipated by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in February in Montevideo during the eighth meeting of the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] Council of Ministers. The Brazilian proposal aims at liberating up to 80 percent of the trade in goods and services in South America during maximum 10-year period, between 1995 and 2005, as well as the progressive, linear, and automatic lifting of trade tariffs to practically include the entire regional market. According to diplomatic sources, the idea not only is to reinforce the hemispheric position of South America but also to reinforce regional agreements like Mercosur, ALADI, and the Andean Group. A totally reliable government source told LA NACION: "This is something to which Amorim referred to once. In case it is approved, ALCSA should not hinder the other agreements like the Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, or the free trade agreement between Chile and Mexico." It has not been ruled out that the possibility of Mercosur joining NAFTA might be discussed during the brief consultation meeting among the Mercosur ministers. This was mentioned by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo during his tour of Germany and on other occasions by President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. For the time being, expectations are centered on 1 July, when U.S. President Bill Clinton will send Congress a list of countries he believes could join NAFTA. It is known that the negotiation agenda for the four Mercosur members will be strictly respected. Negotiations on a Common External Tariff [Arancel Externo Comun -- AEC] remain on the agenda: 30 June was agreed on as the deadline to reach an agreement. A meeting during which important progress was made on the chapter on chemicals was held recently. More than 80 percent of the tariff positions were defined during the meeting. The Common Market Group will meet in Buenos Aires during the first days of April, and the Mercosur Council will meet on 9 July, possibly in Mar del Plata, with the presence of Presidents Menem, Wasmosy, Lacalle, and Franco.
