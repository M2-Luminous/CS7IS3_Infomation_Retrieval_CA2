If troops are being moved up, an armed conflict is virtually inevitable." The Russian Defense Ministry has been receiving reports about the concentration of Ukrainian troops in Crimea. There are around 400 Ukrainian special-purpose troops in the area of the Belbek airport (10 km north of Simferopol); 500 contract servicemen landed on the cape of Khersones; and 200 Ukrainian national guards (primarily from Ukraine's western oblasts) are on Sevastopol's eastern outskirts (Sukharnaya Balka). Reinforcements amounting to another 200 men are also expected. Russian intelligence agencies are checking reports that the 1st Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade in Bolgrad has been put on full alert. Currently the brigade is under the command of General Babich (former chief of staff of the 98th Airborne Division). General Grachev knows him as "a competent and decisive officer" who is "capable of a great deal." Black Sea Fleet units have been ordered to "stop any provocations in the most decisive fashion." Presently, facilities of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry have been protected by special-purpose army units and the OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry.
