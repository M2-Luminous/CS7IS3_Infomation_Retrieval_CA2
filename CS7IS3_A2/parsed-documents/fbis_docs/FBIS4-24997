Most of the investors come from Hong Kong and Taiwan and some from European and North American countries. One of the revolutionary bases of China and consisting of seven counties, the Yimeng Mountains area is economically backward compared with the coastal areas because of geographical reasons. But it is rich in workers as well as agricultural and mineral products, such as peanuts, silk, chestnuts, walnuts, ginkgo, apples, pears, hawthorn, limestone, marble, diamonds, borax, gold, silver, copper and iron. To attract more overseas investment, the province has poured a great amount of money into infrastructure construction in the area. In recent years, the province has built a railway and a highway cutting through the mountain area. Program-controlled telephones have linked all the counties in the area with the national telecommunications system. A local airport is also being expanded there.
