At a press conference that concluded Yerin's three-day visit to Poland, Milczanowski added that the Polish police is considering the purchase of Russian arms. Both ministers said they want to intensify cooperation in combatting organized crime, especially drug smuggling. The scope of such cooperation is determined by the inter-ministerial agreement signed in November 1992, which was reviewed during Yerin's present visit. Reporting on the possibility to carry out joint actions against organized crime, Milczanowski disclosed that during the coming month, the Russian Interior Ministry will make a catalogue of crimes associated with Russian citizens in Poland which will be made available to Polish policemen. A similar catalogue will be made by Polish police to help Russian law enforcement. Russians were second (after Ukrainians) among foreigners suspected of committing crimes in Poland last year when their number reached 667. Victor Yerin said that both countries are ready to exchange liaison officers but that the decisions must be made by both governments. Asked whether foreigners are safe in Russia he replied that "their security is guaranteed if they behave normally."
