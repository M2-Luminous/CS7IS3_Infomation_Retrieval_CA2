FR940413-0-00013 FR940413-0-00002 Response: Since certain purposes will not be financed depending on the type of loan, REA has used the term ``simultaneously'' to clarify that these types of loans may be made to the borrower at the same time or in the same set of documents. The term ``simultaneously'' was used so as not to confuse the reader since, historically, ``concurrent loans'' has referred only to the combination of REA and RTB loans.
