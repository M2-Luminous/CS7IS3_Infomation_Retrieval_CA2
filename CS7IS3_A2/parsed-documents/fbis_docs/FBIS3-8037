Such institutions as the Academy of Sciences and the Albanological Institute, which enjoy a high prestige that surpasses Kosova borders and have scored achievements that have been recognized outside the Albanian world, are now being threatened directly with closure by the repressive Serb power. The statement says that the Albanian Helsinki Committee considers this a further escalation of the campaign against human rights and the individual and collective rights of the Albanian population that is systematically conducted by the Serbian authorities. After the closure of Albanian schools, the suspension of Albanian television and radio programs, and the dismissal of dozens of thousands of employees on the only basis of being of Albanian national origin, this is a new measure that enters the framework of that alreadt known notorious plan, which aims to uproot the Albanian population, and isolate and segregate it to make its life unbearable on its ancient territories. Increasingly, the Serbian regime in Kosova is assuming the features of an apartheid regime. By losing every feeling of responsibility, the Serbian authorities are not stopping their dangerous course that may lead the present crisis in Kosova into an open conflict in Serbian-Albanian relations and further terrible consequences for the overall peace in the region. The statement ends adding that the Albanian Helsinki Committee regretfully makes this act known to the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation and all the Helsinki committees that act in the name and defense of the great principles [words indistinct] of cooperation in Europe. The Committee also calls on them to raise their voice to denounce the escalation of repression in Kosova.
