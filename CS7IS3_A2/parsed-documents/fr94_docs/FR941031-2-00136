FR941031-2-00136 FR941031-2-00094 There was a typographical error made in the E.I. Nemours Dupont Company (Dupont) discussion of the notice. Dupont's petition requested a waiver through December 31, 1996. EPA's intention was to grant a waiver from labeling requirements, for the fine synthetic fiber manufactured by Dupont, through December 31, 1996. The September 13, 1994, Federal Register notice stated on page 47051 in the first column that the waiver should be granted through January 1, 1996. That notice should have stated that the waiver be granted through December 31, 1996. Therefore the notice of September 13, 1994 is corrected to grant the waiver for Dupont's fine synthetic fiber through December 1996. Dated: October 20, 1994. Richard D. Wilson, Acting Assistant Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26666 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
