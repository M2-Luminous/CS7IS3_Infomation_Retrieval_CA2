"The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible toward subgeneration [sous-generation] so as to limit the quantities of plutonium produced," added the press release issued by the offices of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, which also set forth several conditions relating to security. The Superphenix, which will now become "a research prototype" and no longer function as "an industrial power station," will be reactivated after the successful completion of the work aimed at combating the fires caused by sodium leaks, after a phased start-up procedure, and on condition that the production of electricity is no longer a prime objective. Moreover, the offices of the prime minister stressed that by virtue of its being a prototype, the functioning of the Superphenix could be suspended. In an effort to explain this decision to reactivate the Superphenix, they stress its importance for research into long-life radioactive waste reduction. In its press release, the government also stressed that the reactor would be integrated "into efforts to master nuclear technologies," with the "two main objectives being research on the utilization of plutonium (...) and the reduction of long-life radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel from nuclear reactors."
