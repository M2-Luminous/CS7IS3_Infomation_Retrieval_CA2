The leaders base their call on the fact that the money reserved will only pay for the debts for goods already produced. In addition, 80 percent of defense enterprises will go bankrupt and 1.4 million people lose their jobs simultaneously. The statement stresses that 30 trillion rubles will be required for the payment of unemployment benefit alone and the inhabitants of 70 factory towns will be without means for survival. In order to prevent such a turn of events, the leaders believe it essential to insist on the preservation of the level of funding in line with the state order for 1994 and on opening credit lines for conversion programs. They also call on deputies to take measures to increase the budget income by stimulating production, collecting taxes fully, effectively organizing the sale of arms and military technology abroad as well as the export of civilian products produced at military plants following conversion, with the direct involvement of the producing enterprises.
