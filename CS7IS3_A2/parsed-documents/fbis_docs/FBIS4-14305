During our talks, we reviewed with Christopher our common positions regarding the threat which Iraq still poses to regional security. We agreed on a common, firm, and vigilant stand toward Iraq to ensure the full implementation of UN sanctions in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 833 on the demarcation of borders between the state of Kuwait and Iraq. Christopher also reaffirmed, on behalf of the American President, America's commitment to defend the Gulf. This commitment is appreciated by all the GCC states. The two sides expressed their utmost appreciation for the efforts made by the United Arab Emirates and which are aimed at solving the crisis of the three islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The two sides also asked the Islamic Republic of Iran to enter serious negotiations with the United Arab Emirates with a view to reaching a peaceful solution to the issue of the three islands in accordance with international law and the principle of peaceful coexistence between states. Christopher presented the GCC foreign ministers with a resume on the progress of the peace process and the objectives of his visit to the region. The states of the region reaffirmed their full support of the peaceful settlement through negotiations. In this respect the ministers noted with satisfaction the progress that have taken place in the Palestinian-Israeli accord, stressing once again the need for speeding up the implementation of that accord. The ministers also pledged to continue their tireless efforts to back up the negotiations and the agreements that are reached at in the other courses, and their effective participation in the multilateral talks.

The ministers condemn terrorism anywhere in the world and stress the need to abandon extremism which threatens the peace process.
