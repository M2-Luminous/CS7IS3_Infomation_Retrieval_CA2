Last week former Governor Eduard Rossel, now a senator from Sverdlovsk Oblast, officially submitted a package of documents to the Federation Council in an attempt to legalize the Ural Republic. Copies of the documents were forwarded to the State Duma. According to plan, the State Duma should pass a law to change the status of the federation member, and the Federation Council should ratify it. Both will require the support of a two-thirds majority. Eduard Rossel and his fellow countrymen in the Duma have launched an intense lobbying campaign. The former governor, who was removed from office by the RF president precisely for his declaration of the Ural Republic, asserts that he is finding support in the higher chamber. Furthermore, he is winning the support of not only senators from krays and oblasts, but also senators from republics who were previously against this idea. In the lower house, parliamentary hearings on the Ural initiative have already been scheduled for 18 April. On his next trip to Moscow, the ex-governor hopes to talk to the leaders of political parties and parliamentary factions: Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and Gaydar. He has special hopes for his meeting with Vladimir Volfovich, who is "always talking about the equality of federation members." Sergey Shakhray, the leader of the PRES and the minister for federation affairs who is willing to support the idea of a Ural Republic extending to at least two oblasts, but who objects to a republic confined within the boundaries of only Sverdlovsk Oblast, was given a copy of the constitution of the Ural Republic, autographed by Rossel: "A keepsake, an example of the construction of a strong Russian state." "This will be a colossal breakthrough," Eduard Ergartovich told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We are the flagship. If we break through the lines, all oblasts can have the same status in the future." In the words of the ex-governor, "after the blow we were dealt, none of the oblasts is claiming the right to republic status and its own constitution." The new Russian Basic Law, however, gave each oblast the right of legislative initiative and the right to approve its own charter. This started a run on the Sverdlovsk Oblast legislative drafts. According to Rossel, all krays and oblasts, without exception, quickly analyzed the text of the Ural constitution and copied it in their own charters. There was no need to rack their brains: All they had to do was preface the text with their own title: "Charter of X Oblast." In view of the fact that the new Russian Constitution proclaimed the equality of federation members, can the duplication of the Ural constitution in the kray and oblast charters serve as a practical method of realizing this desired equality? Can this give new life, "a second wind," to Rossel's own initiative, which seemed to have been stifled completely by the president's stern decision? The Ural constitution does not grant the federation member the kind of privileges that were granted to Kazan, for example, in the treaty with Moscow. There is one article, however, which Rossel calls a "major breakthrough": The declaration that anything within the boundaries of Sverdlovsk Oblast "belongs to the Ural Republic." On this basis, local economic laws can be published and local economic programs can be launched. There would be no need for the dozens of economic agreements Kazan concluded with Moscow. Everything would be defined by local laws. The Ural Republic is being used as a model in several oblasts, such as Ulyanovsk Oblast, for example, where bicameral representative bodies of government will be empowered to make laws. "We see the Ural Republic as the prototype of the territorial division of the Russian Federation," Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko of the Senate Committee on Federation Affairs, the Federation Treaty, and Regional Policy told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent after he had read the package of Ural documents. He warns that they still need careful examination. "If, however, they do make references to regional or territorial legislation, I would welcome this. All krays and oblasts need good basic legislation today." Rossel has less chance of success in the Duma. The Duma Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy insists that the general principles of the federal process must be consolidated before specific forms of this process can be regulated. Chairman Vladimir Lysenko of the Subcommittee on the Development of Federal Relations believes that Rossel's idea is less relevant now that the new Russian constitution has granted federation members equal rights. "As soon as this equality was declared, the other oblasts seem to have calmed down and stopped making demands. Precedents can be quite dangerous in Russia, however, and if the Ural Republic wins approval, the others will begin demanding the same treatment, and this process will be impossible to stop." The next "breakthrough" in the federal process could be accomplished in different ways: either by elevating the status of a particular RF member or by concluding a separate treaty with one of them. The "breakthrough" could occur far from the Urals (Kaliningrad Oblast was the first claimant) and could have completely different consequences, especially in view of the fact that Chechnya and Tatarstan--and not the Urals or Kaliningrad--are still the main source of headaches for central government officials.
