Another group of 15 former recontras of the so-called 3-80 Northern Front, an armed group which demobilized in April, occupied the offices of the OAS International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) in a simultaneous act this morning, demanding government compliance with the disarmament agreements, official sources confirmed. Although the former rebels inside the Colombian Embassy have not publicized the reasons for demanding asylum, local sources believe both actions seek the same objective: to exert pressure demanding compliance with the agreements in which the government offered them protection, land, and the participation of a former guerrilla sector in the police, among other things.
