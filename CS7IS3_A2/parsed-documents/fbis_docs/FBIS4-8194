FBIS4-8194 "dreeu070_i_94023" FBIS-EEU-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Serb Paramedics Killed in 2d NATO Attack Serb Paramedics Killed in 2d NATO Attack LD1204094594 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 0812 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204094594 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- The details of events on the Gorazde battlefield following the U.S. bombing raids on civilian targets and positions of the Bosnian Serb Herzegovina Corps have finally been revealed, the TANJUG correspondent from Cajnice, south of Gorazde, reports. According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, the second NATO attack at about 1445 yesterday [11 April] took place in the area of the Serb village of Bare, 2 km from Gorazde. However, ambulance cars belonging to the Serb forces were hit instead of Srpska republic army tanks, as NATO representatives claimed. Two paramedics from Gacko [Serb-held town south of Gorazde] were killed on this occasion and two ambulance cars were completely destroyed. Two Serb houses were also completely destroyed. Their inhabitants had fled the Muslim attacks almost two years ago. The Americans fired missiles and dropped bombs of great destructive power on Serb positions. This is illustrated by the fact that one of the missiles broke through three 20 centimeter-thick concrete floors. According to Serb sources, everything was most probably carried out in agreement with the Muslim side -- immediately before the bombing raid yesterday thick black smoke rose from chimneys of houses in Gorazde. In this way the Muslims were marking the no-target zone for the Americans. Simultaneously with the attack of the American planes, the Muslim forces launched an infantry attack on Serb positions from Gorazde, with strong support from recoilless guns, mortars, antiaircraft guns, and multiple rocket launchers. Where did the Muslims from Gorazde, a UN safe area, get all the weapons and ammunition? That is what only they and the NATO representatives know. However, they were not able to move the Serb positions. Details of the U.S. attack in the Mount Preljuca area two days ago have also been revealed. This area is 15 kilometers from Gorazde and it is a part of the [Serb-held] Foca municipality. It is logical to ask: How did the Americans want to protect UN military observers in Gorazde by bombing positions so far away? As long as one can remember, Preljuca has always been a Serb territory, and a year ago the Muslims committed a horrific crime in the village of Crnetici just beneath Preljuca, killing more than 20 civilians, including two infants. The U.S. planes have carried on the job.
