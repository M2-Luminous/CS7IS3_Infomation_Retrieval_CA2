In a discussion with leading comrades from the provincial department of transportation, the Changji Autonomous Prefecture, and concerned departments of the Autonomous Region, he pointed out the need to definitely make highway construction an important task to be emphasized in Xinjiang's development. He said that six of the eight highways turned over in 1993 to the state by the Xinjiang Transportation Department were assessed as fine projects, being a great contribution. Highway construction in Xinjiang is particularly important, so must definitely be made an important task to be emphasized. In such a large place as Xinjiang, highways carry 84 percent of Xinjiang's freight and 97 percent of its passenger traffic. In Xinjiang, highway construction is a matter of economics, culture, and stability, with more and better-built roads strengthening unity among the people of all nationalities, thus being a blow against ethnic separatism. As 1995 will be the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, we will need to put more energy and funding into building better roads to make Xinjiang more thriving and prosperous. Tomur Dawamat inspected the second phase of the motor vehicle highway from Changji to Hutubi in the blowing snow, visiting with highway construction workers of all nationalities. The second phase of National Highway No. 312, the section from Changji to Hutubi, is 49.86 km long, being a westward extension after the first phase from Urumqi to Changji was completed and opened to traffic, and having been built in the five years beginning in September 1988 by the Xinjiang Transportation Department's Second Highway Construction Office. The Examination and Acceptance Commission has assessed it as a fine project.
