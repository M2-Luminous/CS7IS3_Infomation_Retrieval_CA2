FR941006-1-00086 FR941006-1-00015 (F) To defray the cost of producing, delivering and explaining the computerized information and materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.6 and explaining the operation of the computer system's software; (G) To make a loan to an account established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 to defray qualified campaign expenses incurred prior to the expenditure report period or prior to receipt of federal funds, provided that the amounts so loaned are restored to the legal and accounting compliance fund; and (H) To defray unreimbursed costs incurred in providing transportation and services for the Secret Service and national security staff pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.6. (ii) (A) Expenditures for payroll (including payroll taxes), overhead and computer services, a portion of which are related to ensuring compliance with title 2 of the United States Code and chapter 95 of title 26 of the United States Code, shall be initially paid from the candidate's federal fund account under 11 CFR 9005.2 and may be later reimbursed by the compliance fund. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a candidate may use contributions to the compliance fund to reimburse his or her federal fund account an amount equal to 10% of the payroll and overhead expenditures of his or her national campaign headquarters and state offices. Overhead expenditures include, but are not limited to rent, utilities, office equipment, furniture, supplies and all telephone charges except for telephone charges related to a special use such as voter registration and get out the vote efforts. In addition, a candidate may use contributions to the compliance fund to reimburse his or her federal fund account an amount equal to 50% of the costs (other than payroll) associated with computer services. Such costs include but are not limited to rental and maintenance of computer equipment, data entry services not performed by committee personnel, and related supplies. If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for payroll or overhead expenditures, the candidate shall establish allocation percentages for each individual who spends all or a portion of his or her time to perform duties which are considered necessary to ensure compliance with title 2 of the United States Code or chapter 95 of title 26 of the United States Code. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support the derivation of each percentage. Such records shall indicate which duties are considered compliance and the percentage of time each person spends on such activity. If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption for costs associated with computer services, the candidates shall establish allocation percentages for each computer function that is considered necessary, in whole or in part, to ensure compliance within 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq ., and 26 U.S.C. 9001 et seq . The allocation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with each computer function, such as the costs for data entry services performed by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function. The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt compliance costs. (B) Reimbursement from the compliance fund may be made to the separate account maintained for federal funds under 11 CFR 9005.2 for legal and accounting compliance services disbursements that are initially paid from the separate federal funds account. Such reimbursement must be made prior to any final repayment determination by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2. Any amounts so reimbursed to the federal fund account may not subsequently be transferred back to the legal and accounting compliance fund. (iii) Amounts paid from this account for the purposes permitted by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H) of this section shall not be subject to the expenditure limits of 2 U.S.C. 221a(b) and 11 CFR 110.8. (See also 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15).) When the proceeds of loans made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(G) of this section are expended on qualified campaign expenses, such expenditures shall count against the candidate's expenditure limit.
