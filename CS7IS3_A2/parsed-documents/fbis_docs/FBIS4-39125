The overall debt has been estimated at $850 million. "Today's talks with our Russian partners are very important," Kovalko said. The sides are expected to look into political problems connected with the further development of gas pipe line systems in Russia and Ukraine and an increase in exports of Russian gas to countries of Western Europe, Kovalko said. "Chairman of the board of the Gasprom joint stock society, Rem Vyakhirev, told ITAR-TASS that they regard financial difficulties faced by their Ukrainian colleagues with understanding. Vyakhirev said that they approved of Ukraine's proposal to repay part of the debt at the expense of construction of houses for Gasprom workers in Russia. "Today, we intend to discuss the terms of construction and evaluate its cost," Vyakhirev said. "We are also interested in a more efficient use of Ukraine's gas pipe line system for exports of Russian gas to Western countries," Vyakhirev said. Later in the day, the sides are expected to sign a contract on further cooperation in this field.
