Ukraine thus became a nonnuclear state, and the president's signing of the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement has been confirmed. Kravchuk is in a sense demonstrating the strength of his own positions to his partners at the Moscow summit, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. However, this demonstration is almost a Pyrrhic victory. Opting for foreign political concessions, parliamentarians decided to "recoup their losses" at the expense of presidential power, scheduling elections of the new head of state in June and rescinding the power of presidential representative in the regions, in which authority is to be returned to the local councils. In contrast to representatives of the Russian president, who perform only representative functions, representatives of the Ukrainian president directly exercise all power in the republic's oblasts and cities. And the Ukrainian parliament's attempt to deprive Leonid Kravchuk of his needed chain of command right at the eve of parliamentary and presidential elections distinctly reveals the true measure of sympathy the parliamentary corps hold for the head of state. It stands to reason that only the "party of power" can count on any serious success in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, and that only in the event of this party's victory can Leonid Kravchuk hope to have the new parliament call off the presidential elections. Or to win such elections. However, there is hardly any logical basis for these plans: Voters in post-Soviet states have been known to vote the opposition. And the last elections in Ukraine (in Crimea) gave the Ukrainian leader a good idea of how fickle the sympathies of voters are, and how they "love" centrists today. By the way, Leonid Kravchuk has been taxed by yet another ordeal--a meeting with the new Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov.
