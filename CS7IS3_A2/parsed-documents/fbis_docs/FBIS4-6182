On 14 April, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea attacked the two-headed government troops at Toek S'am adjoining Pailin. In the fighting from 0700 to 1800, we destroyed a T-54 tank and a military truck and we killed 17 enemy soldiers and wounded many others. The remaining troops were forced to retreat for their lives to Stoeng Kanh. 2. On 15 April, we intercepted a group of transport forces on the road linking [word indistinct] and Pailin, killing 15 enemy soldiers and wounding 12 others. The remaining troops were forced to retreat behind their lines. 3. Those in the Pailin town now are complaining about the shortage of rice, [word indistinct], and medicine. Wounded or killed soldiers are found everywhere. And roads are blocked [words indistinct]. The situation so far is that the invading forces have been routed extensively. 4. Puppet leaders, like Fifth Military Region Commander Hul Savoan and Battambang Province Commander Manh Sophat, have already run away from their troops, leaving their subordinates to die in Pailin. As for the remaining 200 (Dac Cong) Vietnamese soldiers at Phnum Yat, they are also prepared to beat a hasty retreat. Since Pailin has completely been surrounded, they can only run away through the bamboo-covered jungles. Nevertheless, they will be killed by stepping on land mines or lose their way and become foxes' or lizards' prey.
