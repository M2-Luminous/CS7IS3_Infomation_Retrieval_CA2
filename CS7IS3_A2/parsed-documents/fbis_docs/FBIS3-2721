China sees ruling Hong Kong after 1997 an internal, domestic issue. How can the Joint Declaration be secured by Britain after the transition in 1997? [Patten] Nobody is arguing for an extension of sovereignty, nor extending British influence. It's very curious to suggest that fair elections are a way of extending British influence. Equally, it is a complete contradiction of the meaning of the Joint Declaration to say that Britain has no moral responsibility and no interest in Hong Kong after 1997. First of all, until 2000, there will be meetings between the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) and Chinese officials about transition issues, and that is an agreement made with Britain and China. Secondly, since the Joint Declaration is a treaty signed between Britain and China, Britain plainly has an interest in ensuring that it is properly implemented. It's a treaty lodged at the United Nations and also a treaty between Britain and China. We have a moral responsibility to ensure the freedoms and values of Hong Kong are maintained and will continue after 1997. It's a moral responsibility and a practical concern but I totally accept it doesn't involve any aspects of sovereign action. [Tsao] But it is a declaration, not a treaty. It is called a declaration, not even an agreement. [Patten] It is a recognised treaty lodged in the UN like other international treaties. China is obliged to abide by it. Equally, since we are the other name on the document, we have a continuing interest in it being implemented. [Tsao] Can you define what you mean by continuing interest? Would it be regarded as a challenge to China's sovereignty over Hong Kong? China has its own glossary on the words and terms of the Joint Declaration, especially on words like "freedom" and "election." It is the basis of endless arguments between the two sides. [Patten] We can't do anything which involves sovereign intervention in Hong Kong, but we certainly would, if we believed the Chinese were breaking their solemn undertaking of the Joint Declaration. We'll certainly raise it internationally. For example, freedom of speech. There is no amount of re- interpretation which can turn freedom of speech into brutal intervention by Government in the affairs of newspapers or broadcasting organisations. If China means, by elections, arranging things so that you get the result you want, then China should say that. But "elections" in the Joint Declaration were never meant to imply that. Look at the debates that took place after the document (was signed) in which people talked about a steady development of representative government. China can't go back on that now and make words which appear in the Joint Declaration have meaning which they have never borne. I'd prefer to believe China means to keep her word rather than speculate about arrangements that we'd need to follow if China wasn't keeping her word. I believe China has given her word to Hong Kong, Britain, and the international community. But if it was apparent that China wasn't doing so, then I'm sure there are a number of options which would need to be followed by Britain. [Tsao] During your trip to Australia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans was the only cabinet minister who expressed strong support publicly for your democracy package. Did you not see this as a disappointingly solitary voice when compared to the reaction you received after you announced the dem-ocracy package in 1992. [Patten] I have said at the outset that I haven't travelled principally to Australia just to persuade Australians to throw their hats in the ring on the issue of political development. I am in Australia to encourage more people to do more business in Hong Kong and to give a reassurance to Australian businesses that are already in Hong Kong. But, if you look at the support that we've had this week, it seems to me difficult to argue that (support) has been in any way diminished. I think every major Australian newspaper has had a leading article supporting what we've been doing (in Hong Kong). We've had the support of every level of government, from the states as well as the federal government; from right across the political spectrum. I was giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Joint Committee yesterday and the support, or the understanding [of the issues], is very considerable indeed. Hong Kong has good friends around the world and some of our best friends are in Australia. [Tsao] Do you think that your Australian visit will be seen as an attempt to gather international support for your reforms? [Patten] Intelligent, rational discussion isn't advanced by taking the frequently repeated propaganda of pro-Beijing newspapers, or of United Front activists, as representing the truth and a sensible view of the world. All this propaganda about internationalisation is ridiculous. Every time anybody from Hong Kong travels abroad, those propaganda bugles play their tune about internationalisation. It's a very curious argument. Are we to believe that when Chinese officials go abroad and are asked about Hong Kong, they don't set out their views and thoughts about Hong Kong? Of course they do. Given that, everywhere I've been, there's been a recognition that resolving successfully the argument between China and Britain is a matter for China and Britain. But equally, everywhere I've been and places I haven't been, people take an active interest in what happens in Hong Kong. They do it because Hong Kong is such a regional and global asset. Those are the realities. No amount of propaganda from the New China News Agency (Xinhua) or from the communist newspapers in Hong Kong is going to change that. Sir Leon Brittan (Vice-President of the European Commission) is to visit China this month to express concerns that British business may suffer discrimination in trade with China because of the Hong Kong democracy debate. Is it not likely an EU (European Union) consensus may be difficult to negotiate because Europe does not have a united position on this matter. [Patten] First of all, it's not for me to talk about British trade with China. It's not one of my responsibilities. Secondly, Chinese officials keep on saying there is no relationship between politics and trade. I assume when they say that they mean it. Were they to behave in a different way, it would have profound implications for the China-European Union Cooperation Agreement and it would have profound implications for China's application to join the GATT. It would also have distorted some other arguments China is having around the world about trade issues. I don't believe China will be well advised to ignore what the Chinese leader and other Chinese officials have said. [sentence as published] As for Sir Leon's visit, I know very little about that. The visit has been long planned. [Tsao] You've spent more than 10 days in Australia, including a private holiday. Have you, since you left Hong Kong, being in a more relaxed mood, come to a firmer idea about when to table the rest of your bill and in what form? [Patten] Nothing I've thought or done in Australia during my leave has changed the decision about the legislative process made before I came. We still want to return to the negotiating table with China. Realistically, that seems less and less a possibility. When the present bill is concluded, we'll have to move on to the last remaining legislative brick and place that in the wall. That will depend on the timing of that and crucially, when the present bill emerges from the Legislative Council. [sentence as published] It's worth noting the present bill has been in the Legislative Council [Legco] for nearly two and a half months and there are about four months until Legco rises for the summer recess. There's a recognition that if we were able to get talks going again, we'd have to go into a more intensified form of negotiation -- like a week or two -- to sort things out during prolonged negotiations. I wish time was on our side, but it's not. [Tsao] Although there is still no official response from China to your latest proposal on the airport project, some peripheral pro- Chinese voices have called for additional injections of funding, over and above the $6bn reportedly offered by the Hong Kong government to China. There is plenty of money left in the government reserve. Why is the Government still so financially cautious given that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) requires that $25bn be left to the future special administrative region (SAR) government. [Patten] We've put forward, in good conscience and with considerable sincerity, a financial package which appears to me to include all the points that China put to us last year. I hope China can react positively and quickly, but I don't think I can react to the reports of the so-called friends of China. I just hope some of those socalled friends of China would be friends of Hong Kong. [Tsao] You have encouraged Australian companies to compete in bidding for projects in the new airport plan. You have also assured them there will be fair treatment from the government on assessments of tenders. But China claims unofficially that some British companies have been given favourable treatment when contracts have been granted for the Chek Lap Kok project. [Patten] That's, of course, a load of rubbish. Of the large projects, about 60 percent have been won by Japanese-led consortia. That paranoia should be put on one side. [Tsao] Equally pressing is the issue of the Final Court of Appeal. Legco has reached a consensus on the agreement between the two governments. When will there be a resolution, so that a Final Court of Appeal, which is acceptable to Legco, will be put in place? [Patten] We're working on draft legislation for the Final Court of Appeal. We then have to put it to legislators. I hope they will take a swift decision. I don't think there is any chance of being able to renegotiate the settlement made in the JLG [Sino-British Joint Liaison Group]. [Tsao] You've always said Legco's opinions should be listened to and respected, yet they clearly rejected this agreement. [Patten] We'll have to see what they say when they're presented with the actual legislation. If Legco says we prefer no Court of Appeal rather than one which reflects the agreement then we'll have to take account of that. That's an obligation. We've have no other alternative. The Legislative Council has the responsibility of legislating.
