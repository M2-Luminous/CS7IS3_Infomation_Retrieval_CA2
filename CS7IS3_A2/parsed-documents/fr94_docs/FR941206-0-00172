FR941206-0-00172 FR941206-0-00019 B. New Sources All air emission controls required by 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, and CC must be in place and operating upon startup of a new TSDF. Under 40 CFR 270.10, owners and operators of new TSDF are required to submit Part A and Part B permit applications and to receive a final permit from the EPA prior to construction of the facility. The Part B application for a new facility must incorporate the requirements of 40 CFR part 264. Owners and operators who have submitted a Part B application for a new TSDF but have not been issued a final permit as of June 5, 1995, are required to modify their Part B applications to incorporate the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart CC. C. State Authority 1. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States Under RCRA section 3006, the EPA may authorize a qualified State to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the State (refer to 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization). Although an authorized State has primary responsibility for enforcement of RCRA, the EPA retains enforcement authority under RCRA sections 3008, 7003, and 3013, as well as inspection authority under RCRA section 3007. Prior to the enactment of the HSWA, a State with final authority administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and the EPA could not issue permits for facilities in that State. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact equivalent requirements within specified time frames. The new Federal requirements did not take effect as Federal law in an authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law and was granted authority by the EPA to administer the requirements. In contrast, new Federal requirements promulgated under authority of the HSWA, become effective in authorized States at the same time they are effective in nonauthorized States. Under RCRA section 3006(g)(1), the EPA is directed to administer the new Federal requirements in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authority to do so. While authorized States must still adopt all new RCRA provisions as State law to retain final authorization, requirements promulgated under RCRA provisions added by the HSWA are administered by the EPA as Federal law in authorized States in the interim. Today's rules are promulgated under authority of RCRA section 3004(n), a provision added to RCRA by the HSWA. Therefore, the EPA is adding the requirements of the rules to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j). This table identifies the Federal program requirements that are promulgated pursuant to the HSWA and that take effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status. 2. Effect on State Authorizations The EPA will implement the air standards promulgated today in an authorized State until such a time when the State either: (1) Modifies its RCRA program to adopt the rule and receives final authorization from the EPA for the modification; or (2) receives interim authorization from the EPA as described below. Because these air standards are promulgated under authority of the HSWA, a State submitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim or final authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalent to the EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications for either interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. The availability of HSWA interim authorization was recently extended by the EPA until January 1, 2003 (see 57 60129, December 18, 1992). In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2), States with final authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and subsequently must submit the modifications to the EPA for approval. The deadline by which a State must modify its RCRA program to adopt today's rulemaking is determined by the date of promulgation of the final rule, in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). This deadline can be extended in certain cases [40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)]. Once the EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become subtitle C RCRA requirements. A State that submits its Base program application less than 12 months after the effective date of these standards is not required to include standards equivalent to these standards in its application. However, the State must modify its program by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization 12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standards equivalent to these standards in their applications. The 40 CFR 271.3 sets forth the requirements a State must meet when submitting its final authorization application. States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those in today's rule. Such State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being finalized today to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorized to implement these requirements as RCRA requirements until the State program modification is assessed against Federal requirements and approved. Of course, States with existing standards may continue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of State law. In implementing the Federal program, the EPA will work with States under cooperative agreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, the EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, rather than take separate actions under Federal authority.
