"It seems, the Russian minister added, that this is linked to the fact that the American side is not yet familiar with the main parameters of our proposals on this. They will be handed over to NATO's acting secretary general today." In P. Grachev's words, the meeting which lasted for over an hour discussed primarily issues of bilateral interaction. "Our cooperation is growing stronger by the day and we are finding more and more mutual understanding," he stressed.
