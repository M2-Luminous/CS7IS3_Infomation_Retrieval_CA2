The latest surprise move once again comes from Moscow: On Wednesday [24 February] Boris Yeltsin proposed a summit on the former Yugoslavia at short notice -- and he did not do so via the usual, relatively discreet diplomatic channels but in front of gathered journalists. An "interesting idea," London commented succinctly, but one has not yet received a "formal invitation." What are the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and Germany supposed to decide at this one-day summit? This is not known, but even today one can assume that Yeltsin is not so much interested in peace as in Moscow's advantage as the one taking the initiative, because in the same breath Yeltsin complained about the "attempts by some Western leaders" to "discriminate against Russia." Whoever they might be -- they will certainly not be happy about the fact that Chancellor Kohl (as the Bonn Foreign Ministry has let it be known) has already given his blessing to the Russian summit project. A common Balkan policy along the Bonn-Moscow "axis" -- this gives rise to unpleasant memories among certain "Western leaders." In addition, another problem is putting a strain on Bonn's Bosnian policy. Since relative calm is now reigning in Sarajevo, people are turning to look toward Mostar, where it is not the Serbs but the Croats who are besieging the Muslims. Therefore, the international community would also have to act energetically against the Croatian troops in Herzegovina. However, as a Western diplomat, who wants to remain anonymous, complains: "We have not exerted any real pressure on the Croats. We cannot even threaten them with sanctions, because Germany would prevent them." If this is not only a private opinion, Klaus Kinkel will have problems with offering his "good services" in Bosnian diplomacy. Anyone who is identified with one side in the conflict cannot really play -- as Bismarck in the past -- the "honest broker." And what about the Americans? They seem to have lost their courage again. Could one not extend the policy of threat in Sarajevo to the other parts of the country, where there are sieges and attacks? The State Department spokesman waves that aside: "Sarajevo was a very special case; we do not want to exaggerate." As regards the other case, NATO must hold discussions again. NATO is hanging on the United Nations, and the hinges are already creaking a lot. When on Tuesday five blue helmet soldiers were attacked by mortar fire in Tuzla, Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, wanted to call in NATO planes. However, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander in Chief Jean Cot rejected the wish -- possibly in consideration for the UN Security Council in New York, where the Russians are stubbornly trying to prevent any NATO operations. Summary: The ultimatum of Sarajevo might indeed remain a special case. And the war will continue, while the large and medium-sized powers are struggling for prestige and position.
