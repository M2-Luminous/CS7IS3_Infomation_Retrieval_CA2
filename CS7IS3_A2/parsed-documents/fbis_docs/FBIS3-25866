The 19th meeting of the International Union for Protection of Nature and Natural Resources, held at the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, began to discuss the so-called motion on Tibet. In his speech, delivered on the morning of 24 January, the Chinese representative strongly urged the meeting to cancel the motion on the Tibet issue put forward by Australia's Wilderness Society, for it contradicted fact and international law. This evening, the Chinese representative was the first speaker. He reminded members of the union, above all state members of the union, to note that "this shortest motion, which in fact does not have any suggestions, is only a political petition; it views Tibet as a country and preaches the independence of Tibet. This is an action which violates international law because the United Nations recognizes Tibet as an inseparable part of Chinese territory." The Chinese representative pointed out that the alleged "rapid destruction of environment in Tibet," mentioned in the motion, is not in accordance with the facts. Thereafter, the representatives of the Norwegian, Pakistani, and Belgian state members, the latter representing the European Community, spoke. They pointed out that "what is mentioned in this motion involves China's internal affair, and is a political matter," "not a matter for the union." Therefore they were opposed to the motion. The representative of the Australian state member was also opposed to the motion, saying that "this is a matter which involves state sovereignty." These righteous speeches made the motion sponsor feel uneasy. The representative of Australia's Wilderness Society falsely claimed that "according to the data provided by the exiled Tibetan government, the number of forests in Tibet has greatly decreased, the human rights of `natives' have been seriously infringed, and the environment in Tibet has been seriously destroyed." He still stubbornly adhered to his original motion. Thereafter, a representative of an environmental protection organization from New Zealand pretended to be very solemn when reading a so-called document which said that "politically, Tibet has no human rights, and its natural environment has been destroyed." The Chinese representative pointed out in his speech that the meeting of the union is not a political forum for discussing human rights, and that "if the motion sponsor is interested, we can provide him with the white paper published by China on sovereignty over Tibet and the human rights situation there." "We have a lot of data to illustrate that Tibet's environmental protection is the best in China." The Chinese representative pointed out, tit-for-tat, that "Tibetans are not so-called `natives,' they are the masters of Tibet and account for an absolute majority of the population in Tibet. What has been mentioned by the motion sponsor is totally not in accordance with fact..." The chairman of the meeting decided to put the motion to a vote. An absolute majority of state and governmental organization members, as well as nongovernmental organization members, voted against it. The so-called motion on Tibet issue was rejected by the meeting in this way. A just cause enjoys abundant support; an unjust cause finds scant support. Obviously, one cannot wins hearts and minds if he attempts to use international forums to achieve the aim of dividing China.
