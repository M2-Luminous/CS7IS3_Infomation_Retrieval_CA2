The local press last week quoted a report from the Brussels-based UN sanctions committee (SANCOMM) giving Cyprus good marks for its enforcement of the embargo on the rump Yugoslavia, which groups Serbia and Montenegro. Since SANCOMM was created, in October 1992, it has sent only 41 enquiry requests to Cyprus, out of a total of 6,000, and "Cyprus unlike other countries, carried out most of those (enquiries)," SANCOMM chief Richard Vork told AFP. Cyprus wants to abide by the international resolutions, because they also provide for Turkey to clear the northern part of the island it occupies since 1974, Central Bank official Spiros Stavrinakis said. Cyprus even "went beyond UN wishes" concerning Yugoslavia, and all transactions with countries neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro are so much "closely monitored that Croatia has complained," he added. But a diplomat said monitoring is difficult since Serbian companies are registered here as off-shore, and do not carry on business with Cyprus. "The Cypriots' control bothers no one, trafficking is very difficult to monitor since it is mainly financial," he said, asking not to be named. For example, a Serbian private company in Cyprus might pay for an oil shipment stocked in Greece to go to Hungary. Hence, no deal is done with Serbia, but, at the same time, no one can check that the shipment really went to Hungary, and was not diverted to Serbia or Montenegro, the diplomat explained. "We cannot check their activities," reckons Dhimitrios Khatzikostis, chief of the Cyprus customs enquiry department. "To date, we did not uncover any violation of the sanctions. Two or three cases are under investigation," he added. Some of the Serbian companies existed in Cyprus before the United Nations security council voted the sanctions, in 1992, but hundreds were created in the days following the vote. At that time, "Yugoslavs came with suitcases filled with money," a diplomat recalled. American and British central banks have sent several delegations from April to October 1993 to push Cyprus into enforcing the embargo, he said. "Controls have improved since, but they did not go to the bottom of things." Ten Serbian companies listed as suspect by the U.S. Treasury Department have branches in Cyprus, he added. Some of them seem to have kept the same level of activity as before the sanctions were imposed, although their assets were frozen. Cyprus' Central bank did not disclose the number of Serbian off-shore companies, but the most prominent are Beogradska Bank, here since 1988 and very active before the embargo, state trading firms like Yugo-Arab and Yugo-Metal, and Unibros, a private trading company. None of these companies, which are accused of breaching the embargo by the Western media, agreed to answer AFP's questions. The Central Bank has assigned two employees to watch over the activities of Beogradska Bank. Its overt operations range from sponsoring Serbian painting exhibitions to hosting the Cyprus-Serbia humanitarian association activities. This group told AFP it collected 4,000 dollars to buy medicines, that later were sent to Belgrade with travellers, to circumvent a UN authorization. Cyprus and Yugoslavia had close ties, mainly within the Non-Aligned movement. Thousands of former Yugoslavs, mainly Serbians, live in Cyprus -- 2,198, according the interior ministry, much more according to diplomats. Public opinion as reflected in Parliament or the media is largely pro-Serbian, and the Cyprus Orthodox Church last year offered 200,000 dollars to its counterpart in Serbia. Conservative MP Tasos Papadhopoulos has even spoken against Cyprus enforcing the sanctions, branding them as "anti-constitutional."
