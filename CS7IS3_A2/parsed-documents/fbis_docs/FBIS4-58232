Coastguards had to call in air force reinforcements when they came under fire from the boat on Friday off al-Sha'm, in the northern emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah, the agency quoted the Interior Ministry as saying. "A clash took place between the coastguard patrol and the boat, but after an aircraft intervened the boat and all the people on board were seized," said acting border- and coastguard chief Salih al-Shalwah. He did not say where the boat came from or identify those on board. However, police records show most of the illegal immigrants captured over the past two decades came from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. They came in search of jobs in the oil-rich Gulf state. Al-Shalwah gave no further details of the incident, but said the wounded soldier was taken to a Dubai hospital and his condition was satisfactory. "It is not the first incident of its kind," a Ra's al-Khaymah coastguard official told AFP by telephone. "There have been many cases involving clashes with infiltrators," he added, but refused to reveal the nationalities of those involved in Friday's incident.
