According to a report in EASTERN EXPRESS today, the three proposals on sentencing Xi made by the Ministry of State Security included: 1) giving a strong warning to Xi Yang and sending him back to Hong Kong; 2) taking KUAI PAO [EXPRESS] reporter Leung Wai-man's case as a precedent and banning Xi Yang from entering the mainland for three years; and 3) handing the case over to the Ministry of Justice for trial with the instruction that Xi should be "heavily sentenced" to two years in prison with eligibility for parole. The Ministry of State Security's proposals were sent to Jiang Zemin for consideration, and Jiang is in charge of state security and the administration of justice in the Political Bureau. At the same time, it was disclosed to MING PAO through XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office that so long as MING PAO handled the case with a low profile and admitted their guilt, Xi Yang would be treated leniently. Yu Pun-hai, chairman of the MING PAO Group, once sought help from Bo Yibo and was told about the three proposals made by the Ministry of State Security. It is reportedly said that State Security Minister Jia Chunwang told Xu Simin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in November last year that the Ministry of State Security would give lenient treatment to Xi Yang according to the laws of China. However, Xi Yang's case took an abrupt turn in March this year. After the National People's Congress, Jiang Zemin handled the case personally, rejected the three proposals from the Ministry of State Security, and held that the punishment was not heavy enough. In particular, Leung Wai-man of KUAI PAO, who published a leaked advance copy of the full text of a speech by Jiang Zemin in 1992, was only sent back to Hong Kong immediately and banned from entering the mainland for two years. The punishment was too light; therefore, it was decided to punish Xi Yang heavily to serve as a warning.
