The review is the result of a resolution issued last night by the JCE, which instructed the director of its vote-counting center to work with technicians appointed by the parties and the JCE advisers to review the released figures. The PRD maintains that the numbers cited in JCE bulletins differ from those issued to the parties in diskettes that supposedly contain the same information. The JCE vote-counting director admitted the discrepancy but explained that it is because the diskettes given to the parties do not always contain all the information released in the bulletins. The method of review to be used by the JCE technicians and the parties has not been revealed.
