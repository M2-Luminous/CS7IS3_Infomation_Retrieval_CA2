The decision was taken at a meeting attended by the ANC, Inkatha and the SADF's 41 Battalion last Friday, said SADF Witwatersrand spokesman Maj. Christo Visser. The battalion had agreed to provide security for people returning to homes vacated during violence in Katlehong and Thokoza. Visser said the SADF had made the undertaking because it wanted to help the SAP restore normality in the townships by ending violence. "The SADF has deployed other troops in Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus because the ones that were stationed in these areas have been taken into the national peacekeeping force." Visser said the army was in the townships to provide security and not to take part in the politics of the area. He said the troops had agreed to assist people returning to clean their homes before reoccupying them. ANC East Rand subregional secretary-general Xeba Soyaya confirmed that a meeting between Inkatha and the SADF had taken place last Friday and said members of the army had agreed to guard the refugees when they cleaned their homes this weekend. He said that after the announcement of the peace plan being worked out between President F.W. de Klerk and ANC president Nelson Mandela, the ANC would call a series of rallies to welcome troops "and introduce them to the people." An Inkatha official in Thokoza, Abram Mzizi, said he attended the meeting but as a parent, not an Inkatha member. He confirmed that army members had agreed to provide security in the area. He said this exercise was to last two weeks, after which a meeting would be called to review progress. If the need still existed, the army would continue providing security. However, the Inkatha East Rand region accused SADF members of harassing its members in Katlehong and Thokoza. Inkatha regional organiser Thabani Dlamini said 17 cases of assault and harassment had already been reported to the Thokoza police station. "SADF members blockaded the only access available to hostel residents in and out of Katlehong," said Dlamini. "This has contributed to hundreds of hostel dwellers, particularly shift workers, losing their jobs," he alleged. Dlamini said Inkatha was astounded at the sudden deployment of SADF troops without East Rand residents being consulted. "The decision by the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] to replace the internal stability unit with SADF troops despite our known objections confirms once again widely held suspicions that the TEC is an instrument set up to rubber-stamp ANC demands." Visser said the SADF "distances itself from any political party and is there to serve the community as a whole." To stabilise the area and keep fighting factions apart, the support of the whole community was needed. Any person assaulted or harassed was free to report this to the police. SAPA reports that Visser confirmed that troops in Katlehong had blocked some routes yesterday to control the movement of weapons better but this had been done after discussions with Inkatha and the ANC. The SADF had also agreed to build another road for hostel dwellers, he said,but was unsure about its progress.
