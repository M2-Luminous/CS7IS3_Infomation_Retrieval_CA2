The man in charge of the polls that guided Collor after the end of 1988, political scientist Marco Antonio Coimbra of the Vox Populi Institute, supports that argument to some degree and believes that the major similarity between the two is "the personification of something new." The argument that Britto is now repeating the rising curve shown by the Collor "phenomenon" at the start of 1989 and that this could indicate to political parties interested in a candidate in the center that the path "lies that way" is supported by Deputies Miro Teixeira and Gustavo Krause--both above suspicion in theory. They do not belong to the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], nor do they belong to the same trend of political opinion. Even so, on different days during this week of tension between the executive and legislative branches precisely on the issue of the presidential race, the two men circulated through various congressional circles with the same message. "This is a unique opportunity that Britto cannot let slip," said Krause. "No doubt about it, the phenomenon is the same; the percentage curves are very similar," Miro agreed. Far from Brasilia in Belo Horizonte, a calm Coimbra has been working intensely since the middle of last year on polls concerned with this race. He is coming up with technical analyses which, if they do not support the view held by the congressmen, at least do not overthrow it completely. In Coimbra's opinion, the close similarity between Britto and Collor lies in their identification with the idea of renewal. "Despite the frustration with Collor, who also represented renewal, the voters still prefer someone who strikes them as being less tainted by old political vices," he said, and he then presented the figures that are beginning to be used to point up not the similarities but the differences. At the start of 1989, the polls showed that 50 percent of the voters would choose the candidate whose image indicated a lack of ties with the old power structures--in other words, someone new. Now--"perhaps a little because of fear of the disappointment caused by Collor"--there has been a change unfavorable to Britto. The winning profile is no longer that of the squeaky clean. First of all, the voters are saying that they prefer a candidate "with labor--union--ties." Score one for Lula. Second, however, there is still a desire for something new. And that is where Britto's rise in popularity comes in, although with a difference compared to Collor. The poll respondents feel that unlike Collor, who had been a deputy, mayor, and governor, the former minister lacks any other experience in government. Coimbra interprets this to mean that they like Britto very much. But that they think he should run at some future time. But one fact is causing the pendulum to swing back in Britto's favor. Out of 50 politicians whose names were presented to respondents with the request that they assign them a score of from 1 to 10, Britto scored highest. He received a 7, and with the exception of Jaime Lerner, who got a 5, all the others scored a rousing 1, 2, or 3. Getting back the comparison between Britto and Collor, Coimbra recalls that at the start of 1989, Collor's standing with the voters was more or less what Britto's is now. It hovered around 6 or 7 percent, whereas the former minister now stands at around 8 percent. But Collor was known to only 12 percent of the voters, whereas Britto is known to 50 percent. Since the other candidates--Lula, Maluf, Brizola, and Quercia, for example--are known to 95 percent of the voters, Coimbra's conclusion is that like Collor, "Britto has room to grow." Less room than Collor had, but much more than any of the other current candidates. As far as differences are concerned, Coimbra introduces another element, this one unfavorable to Britto. "Collor entered the race with the image of leader, savior of the fatherland, and fighter in all areas. Not Britto. The voters know that he solved an extremely important problem in the Ministry of Social Welfare, but only one. This means that he still has the image of a specialist, and that is not good in a paternalistic country, where the voters want the candidate to solve not one but all the problems in their lives." But Coimbra draws attention to one basic fact. "Over 50 percent of the voters do not know anything about this election. They have no idea of the date on which it will be held or even that it will cover three levels of government." This, he says, indicates two things. The first is that in Brazil, every election is a surprise from the standpoint of rules. The second is that the game is still very much in its beginning stages and that the voters are very apprehensive, distrustful, and uncertain as to who they will vote for.
