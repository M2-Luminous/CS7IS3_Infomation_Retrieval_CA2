In the USSR, the Communist Party kept the sanitary inspectors' mouths shut tight with its' ``classified'' stamp and with its ``concerning nondivulgence'' signed statement, and it knew how to deal with insubordinates. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Belyayev, who until recently was the chief sanitary inspector of one of Russia's oblasts, himself felt both the degradation and arbitrariness of such a service. For this reason, after becoming chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, Ye. Belyayev insisted, with government support, on the independence of his committee from the departmental service and, in some regions, from the local authorities. The masters of the sanitary service have always felt that it does not pay and were even sometimes afraid to give the public the truth about morbidity, the condition of the environment, and barbaric working conditions. [Lukyanova] I congratulate you on your independence for the first time in 70 years. But independence is tied to accountability. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, have sanitary inspectors learned to use their independence to protect the public? [Belyayev] That is a difficult question. You will agree that not all of the service's directors and specialists have successfully managed to immediately restructure their psychology after crippling dependence on party discipline, after decades of the forced necessity of hiding the truth about the state of health and ecological problems from the public. However, we can now act on the basis of the law ``Regarding the Public's Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare'' and be guided by society's interests. I suggest that such independence should fix everything. It will be difficult, but we will learn to make decisions independently, and reform of the service is proceeding in this direction. [Lukyanova] Tell me, is sanitary inspection in the country now all-encompassing. Does it cover all industries or are their still exceptions? [Belyayev] Unfortunately, there are exceptions. The sadly familiar principle -- divide and conquer -- still applies to our service. It is very convenient for hiding negative information. The Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation has its own departmental public health service. Its status is such that it is not always able to halt public health violations. The Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Ministry of Security also have subdepartmental services. The main thing that alarms us is that our committee does not oversee the enterprises of the defense industry, the space complex, or the production of nuclear fuel. Departmental control of the former Third Main Administration of the USSR Ministry of Health has essentially been maintained, and the Federal administration of Biomedical and Emergency Problems is currently attached to the Russian Federation Ministry of Health. The departmental public health services do not have any legal basis for activity at closed enterprises. [Lukyanova] So do they have their own standards? Their own maximum permissible concentrations [MPC]? Their own levels? [Belyayev] Yes...Now there is the problem of destroying the very same chemical weaponry. Maximum permissible concentrations and maximum permissible levels must be established. The scientific research institutes working on this problem are under the management of the specified main administration. A situation has been created wherein the department itself will develop standards, and we will be forced to approve them. The last emergency in Tomsk is yet another example of closure. We have no oversight over this secret facility nor over analogous facilities. When an emergency arises, the committee is obliged to participate in clearing the consequences without knowing its specifics, process, etc. We have proposed subordinating the aforementioned departmental public health services to our committee but have encountered fierce resistance from the ministries. We do not intend to destroy them. They have knowledgeable specialists; too often, however, their departmental affiliation ties their hands and does not allow them to tell the whole truth. The government supports the associations of all departmental public health services in our committee, but the resistance... [Lukyanova] Forgive me. For months the government has permitted itself to ``support'' reorganization, but the authorities do not make use of it. If there are not enough authorities, it is possibly time to summon the people to the next referendum. Must we really wait for the next Chernobyl, Chelyabinsk, or Tomsk?.. Departmentalization closes the circle of problems of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service's independence. Do not take offense, but will it really be more comfortable and easier for the specialists under the its wing? [Belyayev] You have touched upon the most difficult question in the development of our service. For years, quiet, submissive, obsequious directors have been selected and have learned to work in the bureaucratic style in order to, pardon the expression, survive and remain in their job. In the very same meat combine, there is the technology, the critics below, and the unsanitariness all around. And they ask the sanitary inspector, ``What, do you want the public to go without meat? Put yourself in our position. We must feed the people and not shut down production as you are prescribing.'' Builders delivering homes with unfinished work offer the same arguments. That is why some sanitary inspectors practically never make use of their right to shut down harmful or unsanitary production. It is very difficult for our services' directors to change their psychology. They do not want to fight, they do not want to...It is very difficult for sanitary inspectors to break the habit of ``putting themselves into somebody's position.'' I have already said that not everyone has been able to change his ideology and get over the old system under the new conditions. But I also wanted to mention that we have many examples where service directors have made decisions based on principles. They have made full use of their right to halt violations of public health legislation. For examples, there are the Moscow, Perm, Sverdlovsk, Orenburg, and many other republic, kray, and oblast services. [Lukyanova] The press has reported information about the fact that foreign athletes and businesspersons, especially artists, have brought their own drinking water when visiting our country. Is this fact or fiction? [Belyayev] It is difficult to talk about this, but they do in fact bring in drinking water. It is a product used every day. Most of ours does not meet the international standard. In Russia, 12.6 percent of the drinking water used absolutely does not meet even our state standards [GOST] with respect to bacteriologic indicators, and 23 percent does not meet the chemical indicators. There are territories in Russia where up to 70 percent of the water drunk by the public does not meet the standard. It is not pleasant for us to speak about the cost of drinking water or about the fact that it is a product. The GOST ``Drinking Water'' requires studies of water for 28 ingredients. The World Health Organization proposed that water be studied for 50 ingredients back in 1984, and the list is now nearly up to 100. So you judge our level. Our out-of-date water purification process makes it impossible to test for either 50 or 100 ingredients. And out-of-dateness creates the appearance of well-being. Together with scientists, we are revising the GOST for water. I am afraid that 70 percent of our drinking water will turn out to be of poor quality. [Lukyanova] Is there any possibility of providing Russians with normal drinking water? [Belyayev] In the distant future. It will involve replacing the entire water treatment system and refraining from using chlorine. Civilized countries have long stopped using it. Chlorine compounds form corrosive and toxic substances in the body. Abroad, ozone purification of water is a stage that has already been passed, and we have not yet begun using the method in most cities. Other water purification and disinfection methods have already been discovered and are being used, and we must switch over to them. And the quickest way is that of building local units for additional water treatment, as is being done throughout the entire world. They may be designed for the home, hospital, children's settlement, or even apartment. The units are expensive but effective. A second way is to sell drinking water in containers as is done everywhere. And it must be decided quickly. The water supplied to the public in Moscow meets the GOST for drinking water. [Lukyanova]Your committee developed a document regarding compensation for harm inflicted to human health in connection with environmental pollution. What is the fate of this document? [Belyayev]It is now being examined in Russia's state legal administration. And I fear that the legal experts are trimming it it so that all that will remain is a shell with no teeth. In saying this, I am not implying any criticism of the legal experts. Very weighty arguments are necessary to prove the causes of such harm in court. This type of compensation is very unusual for our government. They have been ``tossing the document around'' for half a year already; however, we are standing up for the public's interests. [Lukyanova]I know that the committee has created a register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological materials. What is the purpose of this work? [Belyayev]Increasingly newer compositions, alloys, and chemicals are being used. Before they are used to manufacture, let us say, children's toys, we must know everything about these materials from the standpoint of adherence to public health standards and prevention of harmful health consequences. Construction materials that have not passed health tests and that have not been approved by the sanitary and epidemiological service have, for example, been used in finishing the interior of buildings. And it later became clear that they are harmful to health because they give off toxic materials. A register is needed to eliminate this type of ignorance. It is a check for the toxicity of materials used in the national economy and everyday life. [Lukyanova]While becoming familiar with your committee's work, I was surprised: You are continuing to actively set up antiplague institutions. I can't bear to find out that plague is again with us. But what about typhus and cholera? [Belyayev]Plague has not been recorded among Russia's population for many years. Natural foci of the infection have recently been activated, however. That is, there has been an increase in the number of cases of rodents and fleas excreting plague microbe. Each year, the institutions of the antiplague system exterminate rodents in order to reduce their number. The members of the public who live within the territories of natural foci, as well as geologists and shepards, are being inoculated. Antiplague institutions are maintaining constant oversight of this menacing infection and developing new diagnostic preparations. Specialists at antiplague institutions are now taking preventive measures against especially dangerous infections. As far as cholera is concerned, only isolated cases of its being brought in from India and other countries have been recorded in Russia in the past 3 years. Poor-quality sewage treatment and contamination of water reservoirs by sewage are creating a real threat of cholera in several places, however. The deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the country, increase in detergent and disinfectant prices, and lack of baths have all led to a significant increase in scabies and pediculosis. The high louse infestation of the population constitutes a potential threat of the occurrence of nearly forgotten typhus. [Lukyanova]Fresh vegetables have appeared, and with them a panic over nitrates. What should we do -- eat them or just feast our eyes on them? [Belyayev]There are no vegetables without nitrates. Nitrates are a natural phenomenon in vegetables, and the only threat lies in their level of accumulation. Even if vegetables are not fertilized at all, they will still have a natural nitrate content. The danger lies using chemical fertilizers with no control of time or amount. In such a case, the amount of nitrates in vegetables may reach a toxic level, and when they accumulate in the body, they prevent the circulation of blood, bind hemoglobin, and facilitate the formation of carcinogens. Standards for safe nitrate contents in different fruits and vegetables based on safety criteria have been established. In a vegetable predominating in the diet of the population of a given local, the nitrate standard should be as low as possible. Local public health services have the right to make nitrate content standards more stringent. I will note our country has the greatest number of nitrate content standards for fruit and vegetable products. Other countries do not view them as strictly. The nitrate level in lettuce and beets, for example, is low in our country. Farmers and truck farmers are obligated to adhere strictly to norms and times between the fertilization and harvesting of vegetables, espeically in the case of ammonium nitrate. Otherwise, the plants do not have time to process the nitrates into other compounds that are harmful to humans. Thanks to inspection by Moscow sanitary inspectors, the amount of nitrates in vegetables grown around Moscow have decreased by a factor of 1.5 to 3.
