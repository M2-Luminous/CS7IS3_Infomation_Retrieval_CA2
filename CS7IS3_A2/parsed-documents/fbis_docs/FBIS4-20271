In his opinion, the proposal of consultation made a few hours earlier by General Workers Union Secretary General Candido Mendez means more of the same thing, since it entails a radical reconsideration of the labor reform currently passing through parliament, COLPISA reports. The statements by the bosses' boss were made in the Senate where he went like the other social interlocutors in order to set out his views on changing the labor regulations. The CEOE chairman reiterated to the Social and Employment Policy Committee that the approaching changes "are insufficient." He stated once more that the cost of dismissals remains high under the bills. "Imposition" Jose Maria Cuevas initially described Candido Mendez' proposal as "useful," but later said that it is "an imposition." He stated that the withdrawal of the labor reform must be negotiated with "the parents who made it" -- not with the CEOE. "With the deputies, with the government, with the parliamentary forces, and so forth," he counted, while emphasizing that the reform is necessary and urgent. In short, in the employers' leader's opinion, the proposal by Nicolas Redondo's replacement "has begun badly because it is to return to where we were." The CEOE chairman refused to comment on Felipe Gonzalez' speech. He argued that his tight schedule prevented him from following the Congress of Deputies debate. However, he explained that he does not share the government's optimistic view on emerging from the crisis. "Some economic indicators are recovering, but not the country's economy. I do not believe that we are in a process of clear expansion," he specified. He reiterated the employers' will to negotiate on an agreement for employment "if the trade unions' proposal is sincere," he emphasized. [passage omitted]
