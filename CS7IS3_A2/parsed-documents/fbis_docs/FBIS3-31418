The adoption of a law according to which high-ranking judiciary posts -- from chairmen of Okrug Court and okrug prosecutors upward -- become a unique monopoly of the former Communist Party is not a mere act of recommunization or a normal loss of the opposition in a normal parliament, but an overt communist counterrevolution. It is true that there is still a long time until the law comes into force, thus the opinion of the leadership of the SDS parliamentary faction that there is a sufficient reason for the faction to remain in the parliament is acceptable. On the other hand, when we declare that we will not accept this law it must be clear that we are serious. The SDS chairman's walkout of the parliament, with the total support of the parliamentary faction, could be a clear signal of our categorical readiness to react in a sufficiently sharp manner if the law comes into effect. Until then the parliamentary faction must continue its struggle, notes Filip Dimitrov. Such an experience does not divide our faction but rather consolidates it. It does not split the SDS but rather shows that in our movement everyone accepts his responsibilities in an organized and consistent manner in accordance with the functions with which he has been entrusted. I hope that in any event, after the Communists' dangerous move in the parliament, the SDS will exhibit a sufficiently mature and convincing reaction, states Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating Council.
