Except Moldova, military leaders of all CIS members including Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine attended the meeting. Moldova, whose parliament allowed the country to join the CIS last week, has repeatedly stressed that it only accedes to the CIS' economic agreements instead of military ones in view of its independence. The meeting also approved a draft declaration on security coordination among the CIS member states and their stance toward the "partnership for peace" plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The declaration pointed out that the signatories should not use force against one another and that the treaty on collective security has laid the foundation for the establishment of a Euro-Asian defensive alliance. It also said that its signatories regard the "partnership for peace" plan as a practical choice which is aimed at enhancing an all-European cooperation mechanism based on the conference of security and cooperation in Europe without enlarging NATO. The "partnership for peace" plan will allow former Soviet-led Warsaw Pact members to take part in peacekeeping, military exercises and other NATO activities without becoming NATO members.
