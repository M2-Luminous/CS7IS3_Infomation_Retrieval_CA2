After firing into the ceiling, the criminals seized a female teacher and 12 schoolchildren and led them out to a bus standing outside the school. The bus was then driven by a driver, also taken hostage, in the direction of a military camp. One of a number of servicemen who began negotiations with the kidnappers was himself taken hostage. The kidnappers demanded a helicopter and crew and talked about "Georgia-Makhachkala-Iran" as a preliminary route. According to unsubstantiated data, the terrorists have released one of the female pupils. They have called for the oblast's administrative head, Vladimir Chub, to take part in negotiations. Negotiations are continuing.
