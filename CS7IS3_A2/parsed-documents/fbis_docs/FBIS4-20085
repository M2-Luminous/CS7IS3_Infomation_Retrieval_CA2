Sanberk speaking before meeting with UN special envoy for Cyprus, Joe Clark, and his aides Gustave Feissel and John Paul Cavanaugh said Turkey always wanted a secure atmosphere to find a peaceful solution to Cyprus problem. Recalling that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) has accepted the points included to the original confidence building measures package of July 1993 and Turkey has supported this, Sanberk said the UN proposed package has been twisted after talks which began on February 17, 1994. Clark told the press that the confidence building measures have reached a point and it would be a pity to stop it during this process. Clark said he has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in New York and is due to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara on Monday and Tuesday. Clark called for a contribution from everybody. `We arrived at this point with Turkey's active support and contributions,' Clark said. He claimed that the TRNC would lose very important economic advantages if the process failed to succeed. He also said the package will benefit both sides and the partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the TRNC's economy by 20 percent. The confidence building measures package has two points, one being the opening of the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] section for Greek settlement under UN supervision, and the other being the opening of the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport also under UN direction and the partial lifting of the embargo imposed on the Turkish side. The envoys will leave Turkey early Wednesday morning.
