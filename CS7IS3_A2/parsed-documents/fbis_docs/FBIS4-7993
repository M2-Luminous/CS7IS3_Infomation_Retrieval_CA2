The explosions stopped at 1:00 a.m. (2300 GMT Thursday), 11 hours after the dump was rocked by a first blast. Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who Thursday announced an evacuation order for all residents within a 2.5-kilometre (1.5-mile) radius, said the blasts in the depot in Sesvete, about 12 kilometres (seven miles) outside Zagreb, were a "disaster." Deputy Defense Minister Josip Juras said he did not rule out sabotage. Damage was huge but could not be immediately assessed. Firemen were still unable to get near the flames Friday at noon. Ten buildings near the military facility were destroyed by exploding ammunition and 100 others were damaged. Fragments of exploding mortars and, according to western experts, probably of ground-to-ground and anti-tank missiles, flew around and even seriously injured a man in a central Zagreb street Thursday. Authorities maintained a general alert but traffic near the dump was reopened. The numerous blasts opened up a huge crater at the dump which is one of Croatia's biggest.
