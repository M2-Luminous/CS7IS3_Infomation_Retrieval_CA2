Statistics show that high-tech enterprises in Beijing totalled 4,443 last year, including 980 joint ventures, creating profits worth more than 11.3 billion yuan. Among them, 15 boast revenues exceeding 100 million yuan each and another 130 have made profits topping the 10 million yuan mark. The Beijing Municipal Government has attached great importance to the exploitation of new and high technology during recent years as part of the efforts to boost overall prosperity. In order to open more channels for fund-raising and to better adapt the management and operating mechanism to international standards, the local government has encouraged various high-tech enterprises to introduce the joint-stock system. Stone Corporation and the Beijing Legend Computer Group Company, the country's two leading high-tech enterprises, have both been listed on stock exchanges and raised more funds for further development. Beijing has the country's largest number of scientific institutes, universities, all kinds of talents and China's first technology-intensive scientific zone -- Zhongguancun in Haidian District -- providing a firm foundation for the burgeoning of the high-tech sector. Success of the Beijing University Founder Group Company, which has quickly built a good reputation in the past several years, is based on the scientific and technological strength of the country's top school of higher learning. Color laser photocomposition developed by the company has ushered in a new era in China's industry in printing Chinese characters, the world's most complicated written characters. The founder company created record profits worth 900 million yuan in 1993 (more than 100 million U.S. dollars according to the current exchange rate) and is confidently heading toward the vast domestic market of high-tech electrical telecommunications products. Praised as the "dark horse" by its counterparts, Lantong Electronics Co., Ltd in the Beijing high-tech experimental development zone has miraculously occupied 60 percent of the domestic display screen market almost overnight. Aggregate sales of the company also soared to 100 million yuan from the initial 16 million yuan last year. Collective or individual high-tech enterprises founded by state scientific research institutes and universities have also shown great vitality. The Huasheng Computer Co., Ltd., under a department of the Ministry of Electronics Industry, has become a big profit earner with a yearly income of 300 million yuan. The Violight Group Company of Qinghua University, the country's number one school in natural sciences, has put 100-plus of its latest inventions and technological achievements into production and produced great social and economic benefits. According to reliable sources, the Beijing Municipal Government plans to promote new high-tech zones that have gradually taken shape including a land information center in Haidian District and two science and technology zones in Changping and Fengtai Districts. A technology development zone in Qinghua University and a biological garden in Beijing University are also to be set up in the near future.
