Although he said the government would study the French measures, he told reporters that one could not forget budget limitations, adding that many of the measures the government had imagined in support of industry had been shelved for budgetary reasons. In particular, he said Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini and the Auditor-General's Office were particularly zealous in telling the government that certain things cannot be done for financial reasons. Asked about how he plans to keep the government on course in sorting out the public debt crisis while maintaining electoral pledges not to increase taxation, he said he had no reply "apart from indicating the work that needs to be done." In particular, he suggested that the money he needs could come from re-organising major budget sectors such as health, education and defence and containing expenditure on them. He also claimed the restructurisation he has in mind would maintain jobs or find alternative jobs for those working in some sectors. "In this way, as soon as possible, we'll also find a way of making different investments for the money that comes from all of us," he said. "It has to be done, even if it isn't easy and can't be put into effect at once." The national health service seems to be one budget item in Berlusconi's sights. Pointing to what he said was the "low quality" of the services offered, he also noted the waste involved, quoting union figures indicating that as much as 40 percent of health service expenditure can be considered as waste. According to Berlusconi, whose electoral platform rested on pledges designed to place Italian economic management on new foundations within a year or so, seemed to indicate that the time-scale should now be lengthened since even health service reform could take years. "It's a big job, and the government will do it," he promised. "It's a job that can only be done in the course of years. It's a hope and it's a commitment. But one can't imagine doing it in a short time or without sacrifices." In other domestic points, he said he was unable to say whether Italy intends to move to obtain French radar traces recorded at the time of the Ustica tragedy in June 1980, when an Italian airliner crashed into the sea north of Sicily, killing the 81 passengers and crew on board. The crash has been explained variously by structural failure, a bomb on board or a missile. The preponderant view is that a missile was responsible and may have been fired by French or American vessels believed to have been in the area at the time. "I'm not omniscient," said Berlusconi of reports that Italy would be seeking more active cooperation from France on the affair. "I am unable to answer. These are things I know nothing about." Berlusconi also said he was thinking of creating a complaints or suggestions office at Palazzo Chigi, the Prime Minister's official residence.
