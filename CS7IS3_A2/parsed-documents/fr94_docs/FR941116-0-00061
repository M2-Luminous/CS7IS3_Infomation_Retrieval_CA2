If actual data are not available for calendar year 1994 when the rate change filing is made, the information for calendar year 1994 must be comprised of the most recently available actual data annualized for the year 1994. A schedule containing the information comprised of actual data for calendar year 1994 must be filed not later than March 31, 1995. Thereafter, carriers must file page 700 as a part of their annual Form No. 6 filing. * * * * * 4. Section 342.4 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §342.4 Other rate changing methodologies. (a) Cost-of-service rates. A carrier may change a rate pursuant to this section if it shows that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the carrier and the rate resulting from application of the index such that the rate at the ceiling level would preclude the carrier from being able to charge a just and reasonable rate within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. A carrier must substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by Part 346 of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under §342.3. * * * * * 5. Part 346 is added to subchapter P to read as follows: PART 346_OIL PIPELINE COST-OF-SERVICE FILING REQUIREMENTS Sec. 346.1␣Content of filing for cost-of-service rates. 346.2␣Material in support of initial rates or change in rates.

The statements, schedules, and workpapers must be based upon an appropriate test period. (a) Base and test periods defined. (1) For a carrier which has been in operation for at least 12 months: (i) A base period must consist of 12 consecutive months of actual experience. The 12 months of experience must be adjusted to eliminate nonrecurring items (except minor accounts). The filing carrier may include appropriate normalizing adjustments in lieu of nonrecurring items. (ii) A test period must consist of a base period adjusted for changes in revenues and costs which are known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become effective within nine months after the last month of available actual experience utilized in the filing. For good cause shown, the Commission may allow reasonable deviation from the prescribed test period. (2) For a carrier which has less than 12 months' experience, the test period may consist of 12 consecutive months ending not more than one year from the filing date. For good cause shown, the Commission may allow reasonable deviation from the prescribed test period. (3) For a carrier which is establishing rates for new service, the test period will be based on a 12-month projection of costs and revenues. (b) Cost-of-service summary schedule. This schedule must contain the following information: (1) Total carrier cost of service for the test period. (2) Throughput for the test period in both barrels and barrel-miles.
