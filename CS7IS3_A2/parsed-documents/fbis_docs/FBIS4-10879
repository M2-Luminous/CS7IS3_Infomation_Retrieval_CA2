FBIS4-10879 "drlat075_o_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Colombia Government Denies Amnesty International Report Government Denies Amnesty International Report PA1704014594 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena A in Spanish 1730 GMT 15 Apr 94 PA1704014594 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena A Spanish BFN [From the "Midday Television Newscast"] [Text] The Colombian Government has reacted angrily to an Amnesty International document that asks the United States to suspend military aid to Colombia because of an alleged increase in human rights violations. The government today vigorously denied the Amnesty International report, which asks the U.S. Government to suspend or freeze military aid to Colombia because this aid is being diverted to help repress and violate human rights. According to Government Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, the international organization is not only misinformed, but it has been acting in an ill-intentioned and biased manner. [Begin Villegas recording] There is true ill-will in statements Amnesty International frequently issues on Colombia. To ignore the efforts that Colombia has made in the area of human rights, the strengthening of our institutions to face these problems, and the fact that the 1991 reform of the Constitution is based on this nation's desire to overcome its human rights problems -- all of this goes beyond simple misinformation on behalf of Amnesty International. It shows bias in the organization's assessment of Colombia. [end recording] Although there is no legal recourse by which the government can report these irregularities by Amnesty International to another international organization, Colombia will continue its policy of using evidence to prove that it is taking steps to halt human rights violations.
