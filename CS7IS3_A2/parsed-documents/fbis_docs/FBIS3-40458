The goal is for a prestigious third party to evaluate the results and progress of joint research at that research laboratory where researchers from Japan and overseas, and from industry, the government, and academia have gathered and tackled problems. In addition, the employment of Russian researchers as public research employees will also be studied. The evaluation committee will consist of people with well-known achievements both as researchers and as research managers. The members are currently being selected. Beginning with Japanese scientists who have won the Nobel Prize, 14 candidates are being appointed. Two or three heads of research institutes in the United States and Germany are expected to participate. The content and management system of ongoing research at the same research laboratory will be discussed every one or two years. The evaluations of the evaluation committee will be received as outside opinions; however, the independence of the laboratory will be respected concerning the progress of research. AIST will reorganize its national laboratories at Tsukuba. As one link, the laboratory was set up in January to undertake basic research that intersects fields like materials and information. To promote joint research with, for instance, foreign or private corporations, in 1993, 14 foreign researchers have already been employed as public researchers in 15 national research laboratories throughout Japan. Currently, one researcher from Russia has been accepted at the Hokkaido Government Industrial Research Institute (GIRI). The employment of a second person in fusion research is being studied.
