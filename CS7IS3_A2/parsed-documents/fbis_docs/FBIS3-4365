In this way, the Chinese leader's daughter stressed that her father Deng Xiaoping is still in good health. In the interview, Deng Rong disclosed that CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have often called on her father to seek his advice on major issues. Deng Rong is in Japan to commemorate the publication of Japanese edition of her book: My Father, Deng Xiaoping. Explaining her father's daily life, she said he does not skip his daily three-km walk and he still strengthens his body at the age of 90. In the interview, she said, "His regular life appears to be a key to his long life." Commenting on television news reports in February showing her father's blurred eyes, Deng Rong said: "My father's eyes were blurred by camera flashes. My father's eyes are so good that he can read 10 pages of newspaper every morning." In the interview, Deng Rong said: "Her father sees the reversion of Hong Kong to China as an end to the humiliating chapter in Chinese history and as a great issue on which he himself was involved in negotiations." She went on to say: "My father wants to visit Hong Kong by car and stand on its soil even for a minute. This is what my father desires the most." In another interview that day, Deng Rong touched on the Tiananmen incident in June 1989 and said: "Now, China is entering an era of political stability and economic development, and I believe that my father does not repent for his handling of the incident," adding that the comment represents "her personal view." On Mr. Deng's advice to General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Deng Rong said, "My personal view is that when my father is asked to make a judgment on options, he always adds something." In this way, she stressed that her father stays away from the affairs of state.
