In a by-lined article calling for further increasing the might of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the paper says: This movement must fully play the role of a leading force in building a new world where all the countries and nations would exercise independent rights in the international arena on an equal footing. What is important in this is to activate the work for the reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of international issues with equal responsibility and rights. Only when the United Nations is democratized is it possible to do away with arbitrariness and privilege in the United Nations and ensure equality, allow its member nations to lift up their voices of justice and solve international issues in a fair way. The non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for the reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of the authority of the United Nations. If the NAM is to be kept pure, any attempt to open its door without consideration must never be allowed, the paper says, and goes on: Whether a country can be a member nation of the NAM or join it with any other qualification depends on whether it pursues a policy according with the basic idea and principle of the NAM or aspires after and sympathizes with it. The non-aligned nations must take a joint action for a total elimination of the nuclear weapons in the world and the removal of the inequality of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
