Under the terms of the proposed partial consent decree, within 30 days of the effective date of the decree Hecla will pay $516,000 and the United States will pay $100,000 to reimburse the Hazardous Substance Superfund. The United States will pay an additional $72,000 plus interest to the Superfund within 1 year of the effective date of the decree. The decree provides that, subject to certain reservations, the United States covenants not to sue or take any other civil or administrative action against Hecla pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, and Section 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6973.
