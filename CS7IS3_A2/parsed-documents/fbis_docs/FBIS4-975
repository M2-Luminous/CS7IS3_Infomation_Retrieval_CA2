The Union of Social Forces [Union des Forces Sociales], UFOS, announced its formation this morning at the People's Palace press center during a news conference. The new party intends to find solutions to the nation's problems. It springs from the ashes of civil society. This group has been set up to guide society's actions because civil society, which was supposed to be the product of the people's aspirations, is disconnected and resembles a 36-headed monster. This party, which is coordinated by Martin Kavundza, includes the following associations: trade unions, cultural circles, athletic clubs, nongovernmental organizations, student movements, and friendly societies. The UFOS is therefore in solidarity with all these associations. It wants politicians to help defuse the situation. Martin Kavundza stressed that the party proclaims its independence from the other forces. It also strongly supports the gains of the national sovereign conference. [passage omitted]
