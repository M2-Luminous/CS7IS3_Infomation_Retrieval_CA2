The goal is to find more reserves and maintain oil production in this part of the country at 124 million tons, according to a senior official of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The eastern region covers the vast area east of the Taihang Mountains and the Three Gorges and north of the Chang Jiang River. Oil reserves in this area are estimated at 33.5 billion tons, 54 percent of China's total onshore oil reserves. It produces 90 percent of the country's oil, which is expected to reach 140 million tons this year, slightly higher than last. After more than four decades of exploitation and development, most of the production wells have entered the period of decline. The high content of water makes production difficult. The amount of reserves verified is less than the amount of oil tapped. Oil production in this region is essential to maintain the current level of production, as oil exploration and development in the western part of the country has just begun and transportation problems have hampered development. According to the CNPC official, a plan has been in place to increase the recovery rate of the old wells by five percentage points by drilling more wells and adopting such technologies as water control and tertiary extraction. At the same time, efforts will be made to implement rolling exploration and development in and around the old oil fields in a bid to find more geological reserves. This will help find 100 million tons of new geological reserves a year and boost the production capacity by two million tons. In addition, the region will accelerate the development of low-filtration, thick oil and shallow sea oil fields. China's crude oil consumption increases at an annual rate of six million to seven million tons.
