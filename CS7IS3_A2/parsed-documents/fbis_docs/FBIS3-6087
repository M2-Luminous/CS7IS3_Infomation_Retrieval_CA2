It is hoped that concrete steps will be taken to bring about the consolidation and retrenchment of U.S. military forces and facilities." The governor thanked Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, saying: "The fact that issues concerning the consolidation and retrenchment of U.S. military facilities in Okinawa were taken up at the highest level of consultations between Japan and the United States regarding security and other relevant affairs indicates a big step has been taken in resolving problems related to military bases, such as the return of U.S. military bases and prevention of damage caused by military bases." Governor Ota also expressed some expectations, adding: "As indicated in such developments as the recent visit to the United States by Ichiro Yoneyama, director general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the Japanese and U.S. Governments have come to understand the importance of military base issues and have thus decided to come to the negotiating table. It is very encouraging since this indicates that prospects are growing brighter toward bringing about a solution to our problems."
