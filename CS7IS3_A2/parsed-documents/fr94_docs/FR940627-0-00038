FR940627-0-00038 FR940627-0-00009 However, some pipelines continue to rely on contract or other information to break ties and determine to whom interruptible capacity is allocated. But even for these pipelines, the current regulations may not capture the appropriate information used to allocate interruptible capacity. The current regulations only require the pipelines to maintain information about the service request date, while some pipelines use other dates or other information for allocation of interruptible capacity, such as the contract execution date, the date gas is first shipped under a contract, rate schedule, transportation type, or other rankings. 54 Some pipelines rely on similar contract information in allocating firm capacity during curtailments. 54 For examples of the variety of information used, see ANR Pipeline Company, Second Rev. Vol No. 1, Original Sheet No. 118, General Terms and Conditions, Section 9.2 (date of agreement and request for service date); Koch Gateway Pipeline Company, Fifth Rev. Vol No. 1, Second Sub. Orig. Sheet Nos. 1806 & 1807, General Terms and Conditions, Section 11.4(c)(3) (request for service date and lowest transportation type); Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Sixth Rev. Vol. No. 1, Original Sheet No. 237, General Terms and Conditions, Section 5.7(c)(1)(ii) (request for service date); Northwest Pipeline Corporation, Third Rev. Vol No. 1, Original Sheet Nos. 219&hyph;221, General Terms and Conditions, Section 12 (contract execution date, request for service date, or date gas first tendered, if gas not tendered within 15 days of applicable date); Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, First Rev. Vol. No. 1, Original Sheet No. 243, General Terms and Conditions, Section 8.9 (rate schedule and service request date); Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Original Sheet No. 317, General Terms and Conditions, Section 5 (supply and market rankings). Accordingly, the Commission will revise the regulations to better fit the current need for contract information and to reduce the reporting burden on the pipelines. Those pipelines that continue to rely upon contract execution dates, service request dates, or other data to allocate firm or interruptible capacity must maintain (for both affiliate and non-affiliate shippers) a log of those contract dates or other information used to allocate capacity. 55 55 This log will consist of shipper name (including a designation whether the shipper is a local distribution company, an interstate pipeline, an intrastate pipeline, an end-user, a producer, or a marketer), the shipper's affiliation with the pipeline, contract number, and the relevant dates or other data used for capacity allocation. The other data, for example, may include rate schedule, transportation type, or other ranking criteria used to establish service priority. The pipelines must post on their EBBs the current relevant capacity allocation data for their affiliates. 56 This posting is equivalent to the current requirement to post transportation request information, and will enable shippers to monitor the pipelines' allocation of capacity to their affiliates. The posting of the information must conform with the requirements applicable to pipelines' EBBs as required in ยง284.8(b)(4). 57 The pipelines also must provide the full capacity allocation log (for affiliates and non-affiliates) to the Commission upon request, within a reasonable time and must make it available pursuant to the Commission's discovery procedures, 18 CFR, Part 385, Subpart D. 58 56 As contracts expire or allocation data is revised, the pipelines should remove the outdated data from the EBB posting. The pipelines, however, are still required to maintain the historical data for three years so it can be provided to the Commission if needed. 57 The requirements for EBB access to this information are discussed at the text accompanying note 65, infra. 58 In the Commission's EBB standard-making proceeding in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, the industry Working Groups proposed to develop an Index of Purchasers to reflect firm and interruptible contract information. The Commission found this proposal had significant merit and directed the industry to work to develop a final proposal by September 30, 1994. See Order No. 563&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles, at 31,047. Ultimately, when the Index of Purchasers is developed, the contract information required here could be included in the Index. The Commission is deleting the requirements to post complaints and tariff waivers. If a complaint is not handled by the pipeline to the satisfaction of the complaining party, the complainant can bring the matter to the Commission either through the Commission's Enforcement Task Force hotline or the Commission's formal complaint procedures. In addition, if shippers have questions about tariff waivers, the ability to obtain such information under former Standard L (new Standard K) is sufficient. Indicated Parties support continuation of the current requirement to disclose the maximum daily quantity of gas to be transported under a contract and contend the requirement should be expanded to include the receipt and delivery points under the contract. The Commission, however, does not find that continued disclosure of this information is necessary. Information on maximum daily quantities under each contract is already available for all shippers in the initial reports that pipelines must file under Part 284. 59 Such information does not appear so critical to capacity allocation that a duplicative reporting requirement for affiliate transactions should be imposed. 60 59 18 CFR 284.106. 60 The same information also would be provided under the Index of Purchasers proposal in the EBB rulemaking proceeding.
