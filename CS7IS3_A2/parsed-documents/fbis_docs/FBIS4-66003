The foreign minister also says that he is pessimistic about the future of negotiations between UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] and the Luanda government: [Begin Barroso recording] There was an extraordinary international investment in Angola; however, if the Angolans themselves or part of them want to continue the war, we cannot avoid it. We continue searching for a solution and continue encouraging both sides to make an effort and be more flexible. While there was somewhat more optimistic news in the past few days, we continue to be rather pessimistic about a global, definite solution being found for the Angolan problem.
