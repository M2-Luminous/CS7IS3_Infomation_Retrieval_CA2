Unemployment will, however, remain at peak levels at the same time. On Wednesday [16 February] the Finance Ministry published a forecast that claims Finland is climbing out of the recession. The recovery is, however, very unevenly distributed: Industrial production and exports will continue their vigorous growth, but, at the same time, domestic consumer spending will continue to decrease while unemployment will increase. "The economy stabilized during last year, and the turn toward growth is now under way. This does not mean that the recession is over, however. The situation in some spheres of the domestic markets will get even worse," says Sixten Korkman, director of the Finance Ministry's Department of National Economy, as he presented the forecast. The price competitiveness of Finnish industry is so good at the moment that exports this year are more than one-tenth higher than last year. The Finance Ministry is also predicting that demand for imports from Finland's most important trade partners will begin to rise and that export prices will increase by about 6 percent. The outward condition of the national economy will improve remarkably this year when the balance of trade, which measures the difference between currency gains and losses in foreign trade, will rise to a surplus as high as 12 billion markkas. Last year, Finland's net foreign debt rose by 37 billion markkas, to approximately equal 60 percent of the GNP. According to the ministry, this rise was caused primarily by changes in currency exchange rates, that is, by the weakening of the markka against other currencies. The trade deficit actually increased the debt by only 5.5 billion markkas. Now the net foreign debt is shrinking. The ministry is predicting a 16-billion-markka surplus in the balance of trade. The Finance Ministry predicts that industrial investments will show a marked increase this year. This is explained by the fact that firms involved in exports will modernize their equipment and establish more production capacity. On domestic markets, investments will continue to decrease. Investments by the public sector, that is primarily by the state and communities, will still decrease this year, according to the Finance Ministry. The weak link in the entire national economy is consumer spending, which the Finance Ministry estimates will decrease 2.5 percent this year. The biggest decrease in consumer spending will be in goods and services related to foreign travel. This will decrease by more than one-tenth from last year's levels. The Finance Ministry believes that the "change in the economic atmosphere" will cause people to cut back on savings this year. This will not, however, greatly increase consumer spending, since real disposable income for households will decrease further by 4 percent due to higher taxes. According to the ministry, "the forecast for most service industries is continued difficult times, due to lethargic demand and weak profitability." According to the forecast, private sector services will still increase by 1 percent. All in all, the sum of the values of all produced goods and services, the GNP, will increase about 2 percent this year when compared to last year. Next year the GNP will increase by 5 percent, according to the ministry's forecast. [passage omitted] The rise in consumer prices, in other words, inflation, will continue to be very low in Finland. Public-sector spending, as compared to the GNP, will decrease from more than 63 percent to 61 percent. This is partly due to the growth in the GNP, and another cause is the cuts in public sector spending.
