FR940426-1-00126 FR940426-1-00015 Subsequent to the Commission's adoption of rules mandating this schedule, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, ``Accounting for Contingencies,'' (``SFAS 5'') which requires the disclosure of guarantees of indebtedness of others. A separate schedule should be unnecessary for issuers complying with SFAS 5. Under SFAS 5 disclosure should include a description of the issuer and class of securities guaranteed, the total amount guaranteed and outstanding, the nature of the guarantee, and any defaults by the issuer of the securities guaranteed. Comment is requested regarding whether it is necessary or appropriate for the Commission to specify by rule the particular disclosures related to guaranteed securities that must be furnished, and, if so, what items of disclosure would be appropriate and sufficient. B. Additional Schedules Proposed To Be Eliminated for both Foreign and Domestic Issuers 1. Short Term Borrowings Registrants, other than bank holding companies, 46 are required to furnish a schedule of short-term borrowings. 47 The schedule discloses the maximum outstanding during the year, average outstanding during the year, and weighted average interest rate during the period. Issuers have reported that the preparation of this information can be costly and burdensome for many registrants. For example, registrants with decentralized management of short-term borrowings incur significant cost to accumulate and obtain an audit of the maximum borrowing amount outstanding during a fiscal year. Furthermore, some registrants have indicated that the only practicable manner to determine the weighted average interest rate for the year is to base the calculation on borrowings outstanding at each month-end, but this measure may be of little value and potentially confusing in some circumstances. Also, differing currency exchange rates and rates of inflation may reduce the usefulness of the mathematical sums and weighted averages necessary for this schedule. 46 Bank holding companies must furnish information concerning short-term borrowings pursuant to Industry Guide 3 and Item 101 of Regulation S&hyph;K. See 17 CFR 229.801 and 229.101. 47 See 17 CFR 210.12&hyph;10. Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate the requirement for the schedule and require instead financial statement disclosure of the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding as of each of the dates for which balance sheets are presented. This calculation, already currently furnished by many companies should reduce the cost of compliance and still provide relevant information concerning the registrant's historical and near-term cost of capital. Disclosure of interest rates embedded in balance sheet date borrowing, as proposed to be required, accompanied by the disclosures concerning the registrant's liquidity and capital resources that are required in the MD&A would appear to be sufficiently informational to permit elimination of the short term borrowing schedule. The proposal to eliminate the requirement for the ยง210.12&hyph;10 schedule and the proposed new requirement for average interest rates as of the balance sheet date does not extend to investment companies. Because investment companies' liquidity needs are different from those of other registrants, borrowings for such purposes as redemptions and investments may change over a much shorter period. The Commission proposes to amend Regulation S&hyph;X by eliminating the ยง210.12&hyph;10 schedule of short term borrowings from ยง210.6&hyph;10 and adding a requirement to ยง210.6&hyph;07.3. Although required outside the financial statements for certain registrants, the Commission believes disclosure, in footnotes or elsewhere in the financial statements, of the average debt outstanding and the weighted average interest rate for all borrowings during the period is appropriate. 48 48 For example, the table required by item 3(b) of Form N&hyph;1A requires the average debt outstanding during each of the last ten fiscal years. Financial statements used in conjunction with that tabular data need not repeat that data. Comment is requested regarding whether any data called for by the schedule should be retained, and whether the proposed amendment to obtain disclosure of the weighted average balance sheet borrowing rate in financial statements provides relevant material information and is necessary or appropriate. 2. Supplementary Income Statement Information Commercial and industrial companies are required to furnish a schedule of supplementary income statement information, if specified income statement items exceed 1% of revenues. 49 These items include: maintenance and repairs; depreciation and amortization of the cost of intangible assets, preoperating costs and similar deferred costs; taxes other than payroll; royalties; or advertising costs. 49 See 17 CFR 210.12&hyph;11. As a result of the AICPA's issuance of a Statement of Position 93&hyph;7, 50 disclosure of the amount of total advertising costs expensed in each period is now a generally accepted requirement for purposes of annual financial statements. Although other income statement items referenced by this schedule may not be disclosed on an ongoing basis by registrants, discussion of discretionary expenses and other items, quantified to the extent practicable, may be necessary in the company's MD&A in order to explain material trends and uncertainties that affected operating results, liquidity or financial condition of the registrant, or which may be reasonably likely to affect future results, liquidity or financial condition. 51 Given that the MD&A requirements applicable to both domestic and foreign issuers should result in disclosure of material aspects of the items that would be reported in the schedule, the proposed rules no longer require the income statement item schedule. For example, a reduced level of maintenance expenditures in the current period as compared to the prior period should be discussed if it materially affected trends depicted in the financial statements or is reasonably likely to have an effect on operations, expenditures or trends therein in future periods. 50 Statement of Position 93&hyph;7, ``Reporting on Advertising Costs,'' December 29, 1993. Prepared by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 51 See Financial Reporting Release 36 [FR 501]. Comment is requested regarding the need to require disclosure of any of the income statement amounts currently required to be scheduled, and, if a requirement should be retained, whether the disclosure should be made in the financial statements or in a financial schedule as presently required. Comments on Financial Statement Schedules In addition to the comments requested above, comment is requested regarding whether any of the schedules or information therein proposed to be eliminated should be retained as a financial statement schedule or included as part of the primary financial statements, or whether other financial information schedules, not addressed by the proposed rules, should be eliminated or modified and the reason why a particular schedule should be eliminated or modified.
