Is the treaty that bad? [Abu-Zayyad] The texts of the treaty themselves are not bad. There are too many restrictions of Palestinian authority. But those supporting the agreement have stressed that this is the first time that representatives of the Zionist ideology have accepted a withdrawal. Palestinians have always considered Zionist ideology as being expansionist. And this is the first time that Palestinians have part of the authority. [Voykowitsch] What danger comes from the opponents of the agreement, the radicals, such as Hamas, and the groups in Damascus? [Abu-Zayyad] A number of unfair conditions have been imposed on the Palestinians in the peace process, starting with regulations determining which Palestinians shall be allowed to negotiate. This has resulted in many Palestinians feeling that the process as such is unfair, and thus any outcome is unfair. These critics will have a control function in the process. They will make sure that the negotiators do not make too many concessions and keep the interests and requirements of their people in mind. [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that even the role of the Hamas and the radical Palestinian groups in Damascus is a constructive one? [Abu-Zayyad] These groups are not opposed to peace, they have a supervisory role. They will not seek confrontation with the Palestinian police or the self-rule authorities. [Voykowitsch] The refugee problem is still unsolved. [Abu-Zayyad] We have to distinguish three groups of refugees: those of 1948, those of 1967, and those who left the territories with Israeli permission and were not allowed to return. The latter two -- that is nearly 800,000 people -- must be allowed to return immediately. Israel has no excuse for preventing this. The refugees of 1948 (who left regions that are Israeli territory today) have a basic right to return. We do, however, understand that Israel wants to remain a Jewish state and will, therefore, not allow these refugees to come back as this would mean losing the Jewish majority. We must base our negotiations on UN Resolution 194, which speaks of return or compensation. [Voykowitsch] Jerusalem is not on the official agenda before the second part of the peace process starts. But there are unofficial forums. What is the state of talks? [Abu-Zayyad] The Israelis annexed East Jerusalem in 1967. But for years they have been establishing new Jewish neighborhoods there and have built settlement belts around the city. This means they are changing their status, although UN resolutions demand that the status quo be maintained. The Israelis must be aware of this: No Palestinian, no Arab, no Islamic leader will conclude a comprehensive peace with Israel unless the Jerusalem question has been settled. [Voykowitsch] How are talks proceeding at the moment? [Abu-Zayyad] At the first meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin we brought up the East Jerusalem topic. On Rabin's suggestion a committee was formed, with each side delegating two representatives. I was one of them. But two months ago, the Israelis broke everything off. This means that the old regulations that were introduced by the Israelis last year apply. Under these, every Arab wanting to got to East Jerusalem from the territories needs a kind of visa. This way they are killing off our institutions in the city. Jerusalem is a time bomb, because the Israelis are lacking in sensitivity. They never think about the importance that the city has for Christians and Muslims. I can only hope that they will remember this in time. Otherwise there will be an explosion. For, whatever agreements we conclude, unless we can protect the rights of the Arabs in East Jerusalem, everything will collapse.
