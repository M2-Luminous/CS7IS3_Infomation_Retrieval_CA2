Institute Deputy Director Andrey Ivanov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS the following: "It is regrettable that the Chernobyl disaster and its aftermaths are taken as a standard of nuclear accidents. Events on a smaller scale are regarded as not serious." According to previous reports, the accident took place at a radiochemical factory of the Siberian combine located near the city of Tomsk-7 on April 6, 1993. A radioactive discharge into the air contaminated over 200 square kilometers. Institute specialists estimated the content of radionuclides in fresh water at villages which turned to be in the area of the radioactive fallout, in the air and soil. The permissible doze for the village of Georgiyevka situated next to Tomsk-7 was set at 0.15 rem (official norm -- 0.5 rem). However, specialists did not calculate possible after-effects of "hot particles," the effect of which on the human organism is unpredictable for the time being. Villagers have not been resettled from the dangerous zone. Funds appropriated by the federal budget to do away with the accident's aftermaths were not always used for this purpose. Additional financing of work entirely depends on the management of the chemical combine. Scholars are more optimistic about the radioecological situation in the Yenisey river basin. A chemical combine situated in the area of Krasnoyarsk had been discharging radioactive waste from uniflow nuclear piles into the river for over 30 years. As a result, it contaminated water, bottom sediments, biological objects and flood-lands situated at a considerable distance from the combine. Direct discharge was stopped in autumn 1992. However, the bottom and flood-lands contaminated with long-lived radionuclides will be for long sources of secondary radioactive pollution of the river. It is heartening, the deputy director noted, that the content of short-and medium-lived nuclides in water sharply dropped after discharges were stopped. Regrettably, the content of long-lived cesium-137, cobalt-60 and europeum-152 and -154 virtually did not change. The scientist noted that these nuclides remain a potential source for the Yenisey's contamination.
