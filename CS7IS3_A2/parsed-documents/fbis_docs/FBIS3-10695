Following the ceremony held at the Joint Telecommunications Complex [Contel] Satellite Control Center in Ixtapalapa, Secretary Gamboa spoke on the importance of the Solidaridad I satellite, which replaced Morelos I. [Gamboa] "I would say we will take an important step in productivity and efficiency, as demanded by Mexican society and the entire world. I am sure the finance, education, trade, and educational sectors will be better prepared, and they will be much more productive and competitive with the Solidaridad I satellite." He said the range of services offered by Solidaridad I will render every sector of the country more efficient, and he announced that the Solidaridad II satellite will be launched in October. [Gamboa] "I am very pleased that the Solidaridad I satellite will primarily help in social aspects which are needed by Mexico today -- in the education and rural telephone communications sectors." At the farewell ceremony for Morelos I, Mr. Andres Massieu, assistant secretary of communications and technological development at the SCT [Communications and Transportation Secretariat] spoke of a new generation of satellites. [Massieu] "It make it possible for us to meet the challenge of extending telephone service to rural areas with smaller, low cost telephone exchanges to meet the needs of communities that have less than 500 inhabitants, are scattered throughout the national territory, and have critical communication problems due to the country's geography." Roger Diaz de Cossio, special projects coordinator at the education secretariat, spoke of the high school television service that reaches more than 8,000 schools. [Diaz] "High school education through television is the only education service we offer the underprivileged and poor with a better quality than that of conventional services." He said this is an economic education model that makes it possible to provide a high school education to a town with 500 residents and a junior high school from which only 10 students graduate each year. He said states such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Durango, and Veracruz have three to five times more high schools using the television system than the conventional system. He said the high school television system is the only option to improve the service in Indian zones. He pointed out that only by expanding this service and attending the needs of elementary and junior high schools every year, will we allow the Mexican people to have a 10th grade education average. He said that 1994 will be an important year during which 10,000 parabolic antennas will be installed in high schools using the television system, and a digital system will be used to transmit and receive the signals. Mr. Roberto Hernandez, chairman of the Mexican Banker's Association said: [Hernandez] "The government thus reaffirms its firm determination to guarantee that telecommunications will become a powerful catalyst for the competitive spirit our economy needs." The ceremony was also attended by Telecomm [Telecommunications of Mexico] General Director Carlos (Neri Teran), as well as businessmen and Televisa representatives.
