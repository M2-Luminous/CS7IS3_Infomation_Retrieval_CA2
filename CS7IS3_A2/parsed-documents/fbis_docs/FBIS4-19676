This may be the most appropriate time for Greek diplomacy to show its flexibility by opening up the road to an overall agreement that will definitively settle the problem. The tactic of negotiating in phases is now counterproductive and disadvantageous for our country. Prime Minister Papandreou should dare to get involved in the substantive negotiations over their name, even if it is not assured that such negotiations will end in the complete abolition of the term "Macedonia." It is obvious that if he avoids this, it will result in the "de facto" acceptance of the complete international acceptance of the current name "Republic of Macedonia." Even if this is not a crime of omission, it would still be a crime. Before the embargo, imposing preliminary conditions was meaningful. Now that the embargo was been imposed though, the balance has drastically changed in Athens' favor. As long as the embargo is being strictly implemented, Greece will have every interest in having a dialogue on the name, for it can aim for a package agreement. First of all, Greece will make the best impression because it will appear to be compromising and pliable regarding the process, without even having to make a compromise. In the international arena, anyone who makes conditions for beginning talks is fighting the battle of impressions from a disadvantageous position. If Athens accepts the resumption of a dialogue, the dilemma will be Skopje's. It will either refuse and thus be the target of pressure, or it will begin talks under the disadvantage of the embargo. The embargo will put pressure on them, not only on the secondary issues such as the flag and constitution, but also on the main issue of the name. What is indispensable to the nation is to search for a name that will reflect reality and not affect either side. One such solution could be the name Slavomadeconian for the nationality, and Slavomacedonia for the country. It is the only way to achieve the famous "de-Skopjenization" acceptably, with no one coming out the loser.
