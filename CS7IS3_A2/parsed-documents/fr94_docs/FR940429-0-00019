FR940429-0-00019 FR940429-0-00008 Classification The FRFA prepared for this rule concluded that it could have significant effects on a substantial number of small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions with limited resources). A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for this action is available (see ADDRESSES ). This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 22, 1994. Rolland A. Schmitten, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR parts 672 and 675 are amended as follows: PART 672_GROUNDFISH OF THE GULF OF ALASKA 1. The authority citation for part 672 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. In §672.27, the first sentence of paragraph (a) and paragraphs (b), (c)(1)(ii)(D) and (c)(1)(iii)(C) and (D) are revised and paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(E), (c)(1)(iii)(E), (c)(1)(iii)(F), (c)(1)(iv) and (c)(1)(v) are added to read as follows: §672.27 Observers. (a) Observer Plan. The operator of a fishing vessel subject to 50 CFR parts 672 and 675, and the manager of a shoreside processing facility that receives groundfish from a vessel subject to 50 CFR parts 672 and 675, must comply with the Observer Plan. *␣*␣* (b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow observers to collect Alaska fisheries data deemed by the Regional Director to be necessary and appropriate for research, management, and compliance monitoring of fisheries for groundfish, as defined at §672.2 and §675.2 of this chapter, or for other purposes consistent with the Marine Mammal Protection Act. (c) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (ii) *␣*␣* (D) Fishing trip means the time period that starts on the day when fishing gear is first deployed and ends on the day the vessel offloads groundfish, returns to an Alaskan port, or leaves the EEZ off Alaska and adjacent waters of the State of Alaska, and during which one or more fishing days, as defined in this section, occur. (E) Fishing day means a 24-hour period, from 0001 A.l.t. through 2400 A.l.t., in which fishing gear is retrieved and groundfish, defined at §672.2 or §675.2 of this chapter, are retained. Days during which a vessel only delivers unsorted codends to a processor are not fishing days. (iii) *␣*␣* (C) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel 125 feet (38.1 meters) in length overall or longer must carry a NMFS-certified observer at all times while fishing for groundfish, except for a vessel fishing for groundfish with pot gear as provided for in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(F) of this section. (D) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 meters) length overall but less than 125 feet (38.1 meters) length overall must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessel participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel that participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish in a calendar quarter must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip during that calendar quarter for each of the groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (F) of this section in which the vessel participates. (E) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel fishing with hook-and-line gear that is required to carry an observer under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(D) of this section must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska during each calendar quarter in which the vessel participates in a directed fishery for groundfish in the Eastern Regulatory Area. (F) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 meters) length overall fishing with pot gear must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessel participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. Each vessel that participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish using pot gear must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip during a calendar quarter for each of the groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (F) of this section in which it participates.
