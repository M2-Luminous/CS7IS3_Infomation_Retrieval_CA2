In recent years the European economy has lost a lot of ground in the technologies of the future. Japan's leadership in the high-tech sector seems almost unstoppable, and a similar lag in genetic and biotechnology compared with the USA is also taking shape. While the European share of the world market in high technology was still around 25% in 1970, today it is less than 20%. In contrast, during the same period of time, Japanese companies have increased their share from 15% to 25%. It is therefore not astonishing that the number of Japanese patent registrations in the USA today is greater than those of all the countries of the European Union put together. Does this mean we are on our way to second class status in technology? That is surely an exaggeration. European industry is still the world market leader in many areas, and no other industrial region has at its disposal such a highly developed industrial culture. But it cannot be overlooked that the trump cards of the past such as steel, automobiles, and chemistry are no longer, and new ones are not in sight. This leads to the question of where the new jobs will come from which are so urgently needed to compensate for the increasingly rapid dismantling of jobs in the old industries. In this situation it is not enough just to appeal to European businesses and demand of them greater efforts in research to make European industry competitive. The most important thing is the creation of a climate favorable toward innovation, since throughout the European Union a whole series of complicated administrative and procedural provisions prevent private investments in the area of research. Therefore, it is completely understandable that increasingly more European firms are moving their research activities to countries where there are no such limitations. There is a peculiar ambivalence in the public debate. On the one hand, the decline in jobs and growing unemployment are loudly lamented. On the other hand, technological innovations are resisted, and researchers are discouraged from translating the results of their work into competitive products. Those attitudes are not very compatible, but the political strength is lacking to expose the obvious contradictions and develop strategies which point to the future. Here we just talk too many things to death without thinking about the economic consequences. We have to support technology and research policies in Europe more strongly than we have in the past. Our competitors on the world market are fully aware of the importance of federal policies on technology and research. While, for example, in 1991 the total expenditure for research and development in the European Union was only 2.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the EU, the USA and Japan spent around 2.8% and 3.5% of their GDP to fund research and development. The amount of money spent is not in itself decisive in the results which are achieved. But it would be a mistake to deny any connection between investment capital and demonstrable success. Therefore, with the Fourth General Program for Research and Technology we want first of all to strengthen the technological competency of the European economy. The continuing increase in the share of research expenditures within the Union's total budget indicates what importance we place on policies for research and technology--incidentally, in contrast to the member states which are more likely to be cutting back their research budgets as a whole. There is a fateful tendency, especially in times of economic crisis, to use a great deal of money to support old industries which are no longer competitive. How many new jobs could have been created in recent years in Germany if the billions used for coal had been invested in research? Today this money is gone, without an end in sight to the coal subsidies--on the contrary. On 1 January 1994, the coal pfennig will actually be increased. An estimated 6.1 billion German marks will then be being spent just to preserve unprofitable German coal mining. We can certainly not improve the position of research in Germany in this way. With the Fourth General Program we are gathering all the research efforts of the Union together in a single program, where we have to concentrate on fewer lines of research because of the relatively smaller share of our resources to all public research resources. This does not mean that we primarily want to support large individual projects as we did in the past. This action was not successful, as the example of the high-definition television shows. We are rather concentrating on supporting generic technologies. These are technologies which have an important overlapping effect on various branches of industry. So the first area of activity for implementing programs for research, technological development, and demonstration forms the main focus of the program. The total budget for this area is to be around 17 billion German marks, the 7.5 billion mark bulk of which will go to support new information and communications technologies, and 2.5 billion marks will go to support industrial technologies. The Fourth General Program for Research and Technology carries through an important change in the paradigm. While, previously, individual technologies were specifically promoted, especially those from which large companies profited, the emphasis now is on technologies which overlap multiple fields. This requires a different sort of implementation. The goal is no longer to identify tomorrow's winner, which due to the increasingly greater market dynamics and the increasingly swifter decline of technological competence, is also no longer possible. The point is much more to encourage technological innovations which conform with pubic priorities, innovations which make an effective contribution to strengthening the competitiveness of European industry. One important focus must lie in the development of environmentally sound products and production processes as well as of intelligent transportation and communications systems. There can be no doubt that these are important problems for the future whose solution will be of decisive significance for competitiveness. Until now we have just been lacking comprehensive technological approaches which link strategically important goals with appropriate technological means in the solution of problems. Our research activity will continue to be concentrated on the economically pre-competitive stage. We thereby take into account the demand from trade and industry itself which wants to avoid a distorting effect on competition as much as possible through market-oriented research. Yet research may not limit itself to basic research if it is supposed to lead to quickly practical results. It must become by and large "closer to the market", since it is only with new products and new production processes which reach the market quickly that we can maintain the competitiveness of the European economy. We can no longer afford to be world leaders in basic research while leaving it to our competitors in the world market to bring the results of our research to the marketplace. We are only wasting our resources by doing this. We first need stronger networking to develop new manufacturing processes or to deal with public tasks more efficiently with the most modern information technologies. The new conceptualization of our support for research thus fundamentally concerns the development of "networks of excellence" among industry, science, and end-users, so that more and more information in word, picture, and sound can be exchanged with ever increasing speed and accuracy. The common priorities for research must be determined in close dialog with business and industry and above all must contribute to the purposeful dissemination of the results of research. The small and mid-sized businesses in particular will also profit from this, companies which often do not have sufficient means at their disposal to participate directly in our research plans. Only in this way can we make a contribution to reducing structural unemployment. European policies on research and technology are making an important contribution to the structural industrial change in the Union. They cannot, however, bring it about alone. It first depends on society's ability to make a systemic change. Still, modern policies on research and technology can contribute in substantial measure to keeping jobs which are endangered and recovering those already lost. However, it is decisive here that the goals of our policies are shared by the majority of our citizens. For this we need information and solutions which are free of taboos. That is the prime task of the state in a highly developed industrial society.
