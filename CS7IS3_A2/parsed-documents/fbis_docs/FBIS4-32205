Thus, they propose that secondary education in the Romanian language should be organized and operate in every village, town, and municipality of the country. Entrance examinations, as well as all graduation examinations of every kind of educational institutions should be held solely in Romanian, while ethnic minorities should be granted, in the domain of education, the same rights as the Romanian ethnic minority is granted in Hungary, and the same rights as ethnic minorities are granted in Western democracies, that is, rights as stipulated by the relevant international regulations. These proposals were worked out during a meeting of the UVR National Steering Committee, which was held on 18 June in the town of Lugoj, says the message faxed to us by Zeno Opris, chairman of the UVR.
