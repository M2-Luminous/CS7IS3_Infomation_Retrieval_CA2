"We hope they will be freed in the next few days," a Chinese diplomat said. "The Yemeni Government is working hard for their release." The three were kidnapped Saturday morning while working on a road between Hija, 127 kilometers (75 miles) north of Sanaa and Ma'rib, 173 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, embassy officials said. Yemeni sources meanwhile said the Chinese were kidnapped by three people wanted by the police for various murders. There were no details on what the kidnappers wanted and where they were holding the technicians. The three were working under the terms of a Yemen-Chinese cooperation accord. In the 1980s China helped the former north Yemen build several roads, including one between Sanaa and Hija. The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a road through their region.
