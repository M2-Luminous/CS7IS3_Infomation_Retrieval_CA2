The ultimate goal to obtain his own volkstaat [homeland] is indispensable; it's just a question of how to attain it. From this point of departure participation in the election has got nothing to do with the acceptance of the 1993 constitution, nor with the legitimacy of the new government. Whoever the government may be, the presence of Afrikaners in the elected structures will be to claim their volkstaat and to make use of every means to achieve their goal. More or less 2.8-million Afrikaners would not be wise to rely on power or numbers alone. Blacks in South Africa outnumber them by more than 80 percent; unfortunately for both they occupied the same regions in the country. For the Afrikaner, in order to claim a volkstaat of their own, they should become the indisputable majority in the region where they intend to substantiate their claim. That is not possible before April 27, the day of the election, and, therefore, every opportunity should be taken and all power and knowledge should be applied to bring it about. During that time the Afrikaners should consolidate their interests within the new South Africa, insist on their claim for a volkstaat to be recognised and accommodated in the constitution in an irreversible way. But there is real doubt the transitional constitution does not provide for that. Political scientists De Villiers and Sindane say: "A unitary system of government has only one power centre and all sub-national units exist at the behest of the centre. The central government can delegate powers to the sub-national units -- regions, states or provinces -- and can take these back at will. It can dissolve the sub-national units and create new boundaries or new units. Resource allocation as well as budgeting is centrally done. The logic for the establishment of a unitary system is different from that of a federal system." In a full page analysis of what is called "the final hurdle" in BUSINESS DAY (March 3), a group of concerned business people concentrates on the two real issues: the powers of the provinces are inadequate; the central government can override all provincial powers. It says: under the new constitution and despite the most recent concessions, the central government can override the social welfare policy of a province. The central government can override a province that allows private hospitals. Provinces cannot determine their own trading hours for shops or regular street traders. Provinces have far less regional powers than Punjab in India or Sarawk in Malaysia or New South Wales in Australia or Ontario in Canada or Texas in the United States. On the other hand, the ANC [African National Congress] will easily win the central election and will have all the central power. In regions they win their regional policies can be identical to their central polices. Therefore we appeal to the ANC/National Party to agree to the following changes: increase provincial powers meaningfully. Remove central control over these powers, and safeguard these changes effectively. For the Afrikaner that is what it is all about. To enter into a new dispensation without such changes is a risk to our national life. Therefore demands for the change of the constitution is still hampering the election and it may even cause a deadlock. The concession made by the Freedom Front to register provincially for the election is a gesture of willingness towards the government/ANC. This was in reaction to a gesture by the ANC/government adding a new principle authorising the constitutional assembly "to include in the new constitutional text provision for communities sharing a common cultural and language heritage to exercise a recognised form of internal self-determination should it be proved that there is substantial support in such a community for such self-determination." But even this addition does not guarantee a volkstaat because it is still possible for the winning party to practically override all efforts of self-determination in the regions and even declare the whole country as one province. The deadlock between the parties has led to the request for international mediation. It is my belief that we need the mediation of a number of objective experts acceptable for the different parties. The success of mediation has been proved in a number of crucial situations all over the world and it must be applied in our situation. If all the obstacles are eliminated and the Afrikaners need for a volkstaat is recognised, there should be no reason why they, as members of the Freedom Alliance, would not take part in the election. When that happens there is enough reason to believe that the Freedom Alliance may become the second strongest power in South African politics. The Afrikaners can begin immediately to plan and develop their volkstaat and other members of Freedom Alliance should be accommodated in a real federation according to their will.
