Needless to say, the announcement is an important event which will exert a favorable influence not only on U.S.-Vietnamese relations but also on the situation in Indochina as a whole. In recent years, Vietnam has done a host of work searching for U.S. soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam war. It can be stated with certainty that after the lifting of trade embargo, Hanoi will more actively cooperate with Washington in solving this issue which is rather sensitive to the American people. Another factor in lifting the trade embargo is economics. U.S. business circles have estimated that their losses in Vietnam resulting from the trade embargo amount to $700-800 million annually. It is true that U.S. companies are allowed to do business in Vietnam, but this is only in partnership with companies of other countries. Such business restrictions can, of course, limit the profits of U.S. businessmen. According to experts' estimates, Vietnam is one of the few Southeast Asian countries with the best potential for economic cooperation. Undoubtedly, Vietnam is also an indispensable springboard for economic cooperation with other countries on the Indochinese peninsula. The lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam will also exert a favorable influence on restoring U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic relations and political contacts. Washington has decided to set up a liaison office in Hanoi, and it can be converted into a diplomatic mission in the future. What is noteworthy is that the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam has also activated the campaign in the United States to end the trade embargo on its neighbor, Cuba. Many mass organizations and business representatives have taken part in the campaign. U.S. businessmen are dissatisfied over being deprived of the opportunity to invest in Cuba while their competitors from Europe and Latin America are actively exploring markets in Cuba. As time passes, the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba will likely become a more heated issue.
