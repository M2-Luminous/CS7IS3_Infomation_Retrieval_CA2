FBIS4-7415 "dreas083_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 South Korea Supreme Court Rejects Appeal by U.S. Soldier Supreme Court Rejects Appeal by U.S. Soldier SK2904093194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0925 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904093194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by a 22-year-old American soldier charged with murdering a Korean bar girl, confirming the original sentence of 15 years in prison. The high court found Pvt. Kenneth Markle guilty of intentional murder and dismissed his plea of self-defense in view of the circumstances surrounding the murder. As soon as it receives the ruling, the Justice Ministry will ask the delivery of the convict from the U.S. Forces Korea in accordance with the Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) to put him in a juvenile prison in Chonan. Currently three American soldiers are confined in Chonan prison. The U.S. side can reject Korean Government requests to claim soldiers, civilian employees in the military or their dependents accused of a criminal offense on the ground of "sympathetic consideration" provision of the SOFA but must comply with the requests when they are found guilty in a court of law. The Korean prosecution originally sought to put Markle under its custody in view of the cruelty and inhumanness of his murder of Yun Kum-i in October 1992, but it had to indict him without physical detention since the American forces refused to turn him over in accordance with the provision. He is currently detained at a U.S. base here.
