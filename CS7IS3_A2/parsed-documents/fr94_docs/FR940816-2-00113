The complete Application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. ITT Hartford, formerly ITT Hartford Life Insurance Corporation, is domiciled in the State of Wisconsin, and was incorporated on January 9, 1956. ITT Hartford is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing both individual and group life insurance and annuities in all states of the United States (except New York) and in the District of Columbia. 2. On June 13, 1994, the Board of Directors of ITT Hartford passed a corporate resolution establishing the Separate Account under Connecticut law. On June 23, 1994, the Separate Account registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. The Contracts to be issued by the Separate Account will be offered for sale by HESCO, the designated principal underwriter for the Contracts. HESCO is a broker-dealer registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 3. The Contract Owner has the right to allocate purchase payments to several sub-accounts of the Separate Account, each of which invests in a corresponding series of Dean Witter Select Dimensions Investment Series, an open-end diversified investment company. A Contract Owner also may allocate purchase payments to ITT Hartford's Fixed Account. The Contract offers a death benefit that is applicable prior to the annuity commencement date as well as four annuity options, including an annuity payable during the lifetime of the annuitant. 4. The Contract Owner will not pay a sales charge at the time of a premium payment, although a contingent deferred sales charge may be assessed against Contract values upon surrender. The length of time from receipt of a premium payment to the time of surrender determines the contingent deferred sales charge. Specifically, the contingent deferred sales charge equals 6% of a premium payment surrendered in the payment's first year, 6% during the second year, 5% during the third year, 5% during the fourth year, 4% during the fifth year, 3% during the sixth year, 2% during the seventh year, and 0% for all older premium payments. 5. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract Owner may make a partial surrender of Contract values of up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the requested withdrawal) without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge. After the seventh Contract year, the Contract Owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender without the application of the contingent deferred sales charge. 6. Each Contract anniversary, ITT Hartford will deduct a $30 maintenance fee from each Contract Owner's Contract value to reimburse it for expenses relating to administration and maintenance of the Contract and the sub-accounts of the Separate Account. There is no annual maintenance fee with respect to Contracts with more than $50,000 of Contract value on the Contract anniversary. In addition, ITT Hartford will make a daily charge at the rate of .15% per annum against the assets of the Separate Account during both the accumulation and annuity phases of the Contracts for administration expenses. Neither of these charges may be increased during the life of the Contracts. Total revenues from all administrative charges under the Contracts are not expected to exceed ITT Hartford's average expected costs of administering the Contracts.
