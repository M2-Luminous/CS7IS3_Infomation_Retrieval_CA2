Extract From Russian Premier's Speech at 20 May Meeting With Leaders of Industrial, Construction, and Transport Enterprises and Organizations"] [Text] Today the root of all problems is the lack of specific mechanisms for economic regulation designed to stimulate vital market forces, create a competitive environment, overcome the sales crisis, and solve payment defaults. Marking time is akin to death now. We must make far more rapid progress to develop and fine-tune the necessary regulators in order to keep even what we have already achieved. That is the government's main cause for concern and anguish in the foreseeable future. In this connection we have prepared a whole series of draft statutory documents -- in the form of presidential edicts and government decrees -- designed to bolster the priorities of the policy of accord that have been discussed today. They all stem directly from the president's instructions on tackling the urgent problems of economic reform. To be brief, the purpose and substance of these instructions boils down to a single formula: Transformations of the Russian economy should be geared to the national manufacturer of goods and services, his interests must be protected, and his initiative given free rein. The first set of measures that have been outlined concern the prompt and full payment into the budget of taxes and other mandatory payments, strengthening payment discipline in the national economy, and stepping up tax policy. What am I talking about? Primarily that taxpayers' liability for observance of tax legislation is enhanced. It is envisaged that they will provide tax organs without fail with regular information about their bank accounts and banks will report on enterprises opening accounts. This is to ensure fuller monitoring of enterprises' financial position and stop a number of widespread means of tax evasion. A procedure will be established governing the mandatory use of enterprise funds in deposit and hard-currency accounts to meet commitments to budgets and other creditors and to pay wages. This will make it possible to considerably reduce the amount of payment defaults and speed up payment even if enterprises do not have money in their main accounts. What is more, in order to ease tension in funding enterprises' priority needs, including wages, during a temporary shortage of cash, they will be granted the right to obtain funds from banks amounting to no more than 5 percent of average daily receipts in their settlement accounts. In order to attract foreign investments it is intended to exempt enterprises with sizeable foreign investments from the payment of profit tax into the federal budget for three years. And over the subsequent two years the tax will be levied at a reduced rate. We are also proposing to even out the terms of value added taxation [VAT] on Russian and imported goods and impose tough restrictions on the range of goods liable to VAT at a reduced rate. The question of surmounting sizeable wage differentials that are not justified by real labor input and results is extremely topical and it is no exaggeration to say that it concerns everyone today. This problem has become highly social and sometimes takes on a political slant. I must say that the government is planning to submit draft legislative acts authorizing restrictions on the growth of funds used for consumption in respect of enterprises with high wage levels allowing for the rate of inflation. I want to stress that the prohibitive measures will by no means apply to all enterprises. Those which are increasing production will receive definite concessions. The Statute on the Procedure for the Sale of Debtor Enterprises that has been drafted considerably furthers the reform of state enterprises. This statute extends to all insolvent enterprises in state and municipal ownership. I recently signed a government decree "On Certain Measures To Implement the Legislation on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises." It introduces criteria for deciding insolvency. The Federal Administration for Bankruptcy Cases is obliged prior to 1 July 1994 to begin producing a list of insolvent enterprises. Now let me say a few words about what will be done in the foreign economic sphere. We are planning to considerably reduce export customs duties on goods that hold a leading place in the structure of Russian exports -- oil and petroleum products, gas, electricity, aluminum, pulp -- and to abolish export quotas and licenses. No program, no matter how good, will work on its own. We have taken strict control of fulfilling the action plan to implement the first phase of the Government Program and the main provisions of the president's message to the Federal Assembly. For all the malfunctions and mistakes, for all the attempts to hamper things, two years of reform have not been wasted. Russia can already be said to have its own way of entering the market and its own Russian model for development.
