[end recording] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Foreign Minister, how do you view Mr. Qian's visit to Iran and what issues are likely to be discussed between you and your Chinese counterpart? [Velayati] In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Mr. Qian Qichen is my old friend and has been the Foreign Minister of China since a long time ago. During last few years he paid one official visit to our country, and this is the second official visit which he has paid to our country on the basis of my invitation; and we are going to talk about the bilateral and also international issues. You know that after the Islamic revolution we have promoted our relations with China in different fields. And also as far as the international affairs are concerned, we have had very close cooperation during the last years, especially in the United Nations and other international organizations. Recently in Jakarta, China was accepted as an observer in the Nonaligned Movement. So, not only at the United Nations, but also in the Nonaligned Movement we cooperate together. Iran and China as two important Asian countries can play a very important role for peace and tranquillity in this part of the world. [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording] Regional issues, including the Palestinian question, are among the most crucial topics which the two sides said they will take into serious consideration. The Chinese foreign minister stated his country strongly condemns the massacre of Muslim Palestinians by the Zionist soldiers in the town of Hebron in the occupied land. As for the uproar by the West on human rights in China, Mr. Qian Qichen said: China does not allow any foreign country to interfere in its internal affairs, adding that his country acts on the basis of China's judicial laws and system, not on the basis of the criteria favored by the West. At the end of the press conference, the two foreign ministers emphasized joint participation in the international meetings and gatherings, and hoped that Iran and China would adopt further common policies towards regional and global affairs. Iran and China have long enjoyed most friendly mutual relations. Mr. Qian's visit, however, is viewed as an affair to further activate the two countries' bilateral cooperation concerning regional and international issues.
