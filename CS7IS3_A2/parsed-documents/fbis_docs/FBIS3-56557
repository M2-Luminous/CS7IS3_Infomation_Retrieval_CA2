In his opinion, the visit by the U.S. President is an important event both for the United States and Russia, and for Europe and all the republics of the former Soviet Union. "I an grateful to Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton and also to NATO for the attention paid to Georgia," he stressed. Touching upon the results of the second round of the Geneva talks on settling the conflict in Abkhazia, the head of state noted that a feasible minimum was achieved in Geneva. "A great deal will depend on the resolution of the UN Security Council that, in our opinion, should envisage guarantees for implementing the commitments," Shevardnadze said. What is meant, in particular, is the participation of the peacekeeping forces under the aegis of the United States, of observers, and of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The Georgian leader thinks that the consistent continuation of the UN policy in resolving the conflict will speed up the process of establishing peace in Abkhazia, taking into account the positive role of Russia and the interests of the United States, France, Britain, and other countries.
