Here is a report from our correspondent Doina Saiciuc. [Begin Saiciuc recording] The issue of the Bosnian conflict was brought up at this news conference, in the wake of the latest reactions of the North Atlantic Alliance. Journalists asked Spokesman Mircea Geoana to present Romania's comments on the latest developments. Before relaying his statement, I would like to emphasize that another indication of the Romanian diplomacy's initiative in the region is that an agreement has been reached in principle for Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic to pay an imminent visit to Bucharest, a visit that the Romanian side is looking forward to with great interest. As I said before, Mircea Geoana, spokesman of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented on the situation in Bosnia, which reiterated Romania's position. [Geoana] Everybody knows of the actions undertaken by NATO in Gorazde, following a decision made by the UN secretary general in this respect and in accordance with certain known UN Security Council resolutions. You are familiar with the position promoted by Romania, that the main goal and the only way to solve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is through the determination of all sides to engage in political dialogue and reach a lasting and substantial negotiated solution to the conflict in that region. It is obvious that the main thing now is to bring all the sides back to the negotiating table and to ensure their cooperation. We are firmly convinced that this is the only possible solution. At the same time, we believe that the existence of certain UN Security Council resolutions and the prevalence of certain realities in the field should not be neglected when analyses are made and decisions are taken by all the sides involved in the conflict. I particularly refer to the Gorazde town area and the latest developments of yesterday and today. Therefore, we continue firmly to advocate a political and negotiated solution there and we are striving, to the best of our rather modest possibilities, to contribute to such a solution. We are keenly waiting to see and seriously examine the impact of these actions and of the official positions of various important capitals on the progress of the negotiations. [end recording]
