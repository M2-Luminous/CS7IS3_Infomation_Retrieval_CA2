United States, 18 CIT XX , Slip Op. 94&hyph;60 (April 14, 1994) ( Hosiden I ), the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) affirmed the International Trade Commission's (ITC) amended determination on remand that there is no material injury to the U.S. industry from imports of electroluminescent (EL) flat panel displays and display glass therefor (FPDs) from Japan. In accordance with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Timken Co. v. United States, 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ( Timken ), the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a Notice of Court Decision in the Federal Register on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23690, May 6, 1994) stating that The Department will continue to order the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise and that ``[i]f the case is not appealed, or is affirmed on appeal, then the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs will be revoked.'' 59 FR at 23690. On May 10, 1994, Sharp Corporation filed with the CIT a Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment requesting that the CIT order the Department to take four specific actions to carry out the CIT's April 14, 1994, Order. On August 12, 1994, the CIT issued a Memorandum and Order granting Sharp Corporation's Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment. Hosiden Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 94&hyph;128, August 12, 1994 ( Hosiden II ). This notice is published in accordance with the CIT's August 12, 1994, Order and amends the Department's May 6, 1994, Notice of Court Decision. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Diminich or Richard Rimlinger, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 26, 1991, the ITC determined that a U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of EL FPDs from Japan (56 FR 43937, Sept. 5, 1991). On September 4, 1991, the Department published an antidumping duty order on EL FPDs (56 FR 43741, September 4, 1991). The ITC determination was appealed to the CIT by exporters of FPDs. Sharp Corporation obtained a preliminary injunction, dated January 20, 1994 (Preliminary Injunction Order), enjoining liquidation of entries of EL FPDs entered after February 21, 1991, the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value (56 FR 7008, February 21, 1991). The CIT remanded the determination to the ITC to reconsider its injury determination, and on March 8, 1993, the ITC determined on remand that no U.S. industry was being materially injured by reason of imports of EL FPDs. This remand was affirmed by the CIT on April 14, 1994 in Hosiden I. The Department published a Timken notice on May 6, 1994, stating that the Department will continue to order the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise and that ``[i]f the case is not appealed, or is affirmed on appeal, then the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs will be revoked.'' 59 FR at 23690. On May 10, 1994, Sharp Corporation filed with the CIT a Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment objecting to the steps taken by the Department in its May 6, 1994 Federal Register notice to enforce the CIT's April 14, 1994 Order and requesting that the CIT order the Department to: (1) Terminate the collection of cash deposits for estimated antidumping duties on EL FPDs; (2) suspend liquidation of entries of EL FPDs; (3) refrain from imposing any further obligation on any party involved in any administrative review by the Department relating to EL FPDs; and (4) execute all documents and take all necessary actions to effectuate a revocation of the antidumping duty order. On August 12, 1994, the CIT issued a Memorandum and Order granting Sharp Corporation's Motion for Writ of Mandamus to Enforce Judgment. Hosiden II , Slip. Op. 94&hyph;128. Pursuant to the CIT's August 12, 1994 Order, we are hereby amending the Department's May 6, 1994, Notice of Court Decision and revoking the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs from Japan. Actions Pursuant to Writ of Mandamus Pursuant to Hosiden II, the Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) to cease collection of cash deposits on entities of EL FPDs as of the date of publication of this Order and instruct Customs to release any bonds and to refund cash deposits. The Department will further instruct Customs to suspend the liquidation of entries of EL FPDs effective on entries made on or after February 21, 1991. The Department will take no further action with respect to any administrative review under section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675, relating to EL FPDs. Finally, the Department hereby revokes the antidumping duty order on EL FPDs from Japan (56 FR 43741, September 4, 1991), which revocation shall be effective February 21, 1991, the date of the Department's publication in the Federal Register of the preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value in this case. Dated: August 19, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21043 Filed 8&hyph;23&hyph;94; 9:24 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
