"This happened immediately after the abolition of Article 6 of the constitution at that time--the one that affirmed the CPSU's monopoly of power." "A multiparty system is coming, and we must anticipate events," was what, in effect, M. Gorbachev said at a meeting of the Politburo. "We ourselves must create the first alternative party, but one that is manageable." The choice of candidates for the role of leader was entrusted to the KGB at that time. And it, as always, was up to the job--it found within its active reserve (there is such a concept!) a person with the rank of captain and a name that is now widely known. It was at that time that the name of the party was thought up also: Liberal Democratic. This appeared to be a real find: After all, the world "liberal" had long been compromised with us. Two weeks later the new party was officially registered. It was the first registered political party in the country--the CPSU, as we all know, had never undergone this procedure, and the party of Russian Communists was registered much later under a somewhat different name.... I shall describe this in my next book, which will be called "There Once Was a Communist Party." The book that has just been published, "The Tbilisi Fracture, or Bloody Sunday 1989," carries numerous photographs and documents of those now quite far-off days. Is it not belated? After all, so many events have rolled by since then, one after the other. Since Tbilisi there have been other "fractures" also--the Dniester fracture, for example. And the development of the situation in Georgia itself, the calamitous situation into which it (and not just it) was plunged with the discovery of independence--does not all this influence the evaluation of the events of 1989? Questions of roughly this nature were put to the author. And the answer was given: It is precisely the fact that much is catastrophically being rapidly "forgotten" and that archives are disappearing before our eyes (the archives of the Georgian KGB disappeared this way under Gamsakhurdia) that compels the obligatory recording of what happened. The book's main job is not to judge but to bear witness as objectively as possible. The well-known General Rodionov, for example, appears in the book as a far from unambivalent personality: The author does not forget to mention that at the time of the Afghan war he "fell into disfavor with his superiors because of his refusal to shoot peaceful inhabitants" and that, upon acquaintance, "he makes a strong impression with his education, breeding, and intellect." And alongside this--"a striking commitment to orthodox communist views and an incomprehension and rejection of change".... And is there not a most important and most topical historical lesson in the fate of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the very mechanism of the conversion of a man of letters, intellectual, and civil rights advocate into a dictator and autocrat? Or the fate of his antipode, Eduard Shevardnadze, who has heaped on himself at the most difficult moment responsibility for the fate of Georgia and its people and who has found himself hostage to the current situation to a large extent? "My abiding aspiration is to maintain professionalism and preserve myself as a scholar," Anatoliy Sobchak said.
