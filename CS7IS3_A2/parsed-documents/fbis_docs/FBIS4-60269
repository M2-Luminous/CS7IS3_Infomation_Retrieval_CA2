Palestinian Council Member Furayh Abu-Middayn says that crises were expected to crop up in the course of the negotiations, but if Israel seeks to limit the autonomy to the Gaza boundaries, it should say so candidly, rather than continue to come up with new pretexts. Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the real danger to the peace process does not lie in Yasir 'Arafat's remarks, but rather in Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's actions. Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the Supreme Civilian Coordination Committee, told Qol Yisra'el correspondent Mark Weiss that Israel has posed preconditions for the resumption of negotiations that the PLO repudiates.
