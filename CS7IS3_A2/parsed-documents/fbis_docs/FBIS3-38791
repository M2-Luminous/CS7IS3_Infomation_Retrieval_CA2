The letter was handed to the two sides today. In his letter, Butrus-Ghali calls on Kliridhis and Denktas to participate in intense proximity talks in late February to work out an agreement on a limited number of significant points regarding ways to implement the measures concerning Varosha and the Nicosia Airport. The letter mentions that Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, will come to Cyprus during the preliminary phase of the talks and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, will then take over. The letter adds that Feissel will meet Kliridhis and Denktas on Monday [7 February] to determine the crucial points. Correspondent Kostandinos Yenaris reports on the letter: [Yenaris] The UN secretary general's letter was handed to the two sides today in Nicosia, but the contents were not publicized. CyBC reveals, however, the full text of the letter, in which the UN secretary general says he is satisfied because the two sides accepted the confidence-building measures package as is. Butrus-Ghali stresses the significance of working out ways to implement the measures within two months at the most, so as to utilize fully the positive atmosphere that will be created when the talks begin. In order to reach an agreement, Butrus-Ghali calls on both sides to approach the talks in a constructive spirit, bearing in mind the following four points: First, neither side should try to secure a political advantage from the talks or demand that the other make political concessions. Second, both sides should respect fully the confidence-building measures as described in the UN secretary general's report. Third, an agreement should be fully implemented as soon as it is reached with no delays or interventions from either side. Fourth, the goal of the measures is to facilitate swift progress toward an overall Cyprus solution, not substitute for it. Based on these four points, the UN secretary general calls on both sides to begin intense negotiations with his representatives in Nicosia in late February to reach an agreement on a limited number of points regarding ways to implement the confidence-building measures. The letter adds that Clark will come to Cyprus for the beginning of the talks, which will continue with Feissel's participation. Feissel will hold talks with the two sides to determine these crucial points. [passage omitted] [Announcer] According to CyBC information, despite assurances by Feissel and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, that something like this will not happen, the Greek Cypriot side expects that during Feissel's contacts the Turkish Cypriot side will again attempt to raise the issue of redefining the part of Varosha that will be placed under UN control. Denktas will insist on not including the northern part of the fenced-off area, replacing it with area of equivalent size in the south. Our information is that in this case, the Greek Cypriot side will not agree to even discuss the issue.
