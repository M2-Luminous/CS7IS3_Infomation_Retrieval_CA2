FBIS4-33596 "drlat110_n_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-110 Daily Report 29 May 1994 Chile President Eduardo Frei Interviewed President Eduardo Frei Interviewed PY0806031894 Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 29 May 94 pp D1, D18-D20 PY0806031894 Santiago EL MERCURIO Spanish BFN [Interview with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle by correspondent Raquel Correa; place and date not given -- passages between italics are editorial commentary] [Text] President Frei says he is "at easy and relaxed" despite his turbulent first two months in government. He was even accused of being "frivolous," something no one would have ever thought of him. [Frei] If I go out, people say I am "marketing." If I do not go out, they will say I am living in a capsule. [Correa] Which of these two evils do you prefer? [Frei] I prefer frivolity to isolation. He smiles He looks very young in the solemn halls of La Moneda Palace, but he has the dignity proper of a head of state. The difference begins with his formal treatment of people. The Frei of "the new times" little resembles the old Frei. He stresses: [Frei] I am the same person I have always been. Some people criticize him because he goes to see his soccer team (The "U" Universidad de Chile) play, and he answers: [Frei] What do they expect? I have gone to watch soccer matches all my life. Why would I stop now? He was also criticized while being treated at a clinic, while he was president-elect, for coming to the window wearing pajamas with his wife. [Frei] Had I been operated on four years ago, nobody would have cared. But I was president-elect and a lot of reporters started gathering in the street outside. I came out to greet them so they could see that I was alright, that I did not have cancer or anything else serious. [Correa] And the controversial picture of a shoe-polisher at your feet? [Frei] I have had my shoes polished in the streets my entire life. The only difference is that this time they took a picture. Frei says with the logic of the civil engineer he is. I do not prepare shows. The shoe-polisher event happened because it was a day of public audiences and there were photographers around. He says nothing has really bothered him since he came to power. He sleeps seven or eight hours every night and half an hour after lunch in the bedroom beside his office. Then he walks out renewed. [Correa] Did the Stange [Carabineros Chief Rodolfo Stange] affair disturb your sleep? [Frei] Not at all. The teachers' strike did not keep him awake either. [Correa] Are you annoyed by criticism? What about the criticism from the opposition and from the coalition? Do you dismiss it or do you study it? [Frei] It depends. If it is made in good faith, I receive it well. I do not like negative criticism. I do not even consider it. I think about criticism based on a valid point. I ponder and analyze myself a lot. [Correa] Do you think your popularity has increased or decreased since you came to power? [Frei] I do not know. All I know is that I have been warmly received everywhere I go. [Correa] Are you getting used to being president? [Frei] It is a lot of work he replies with grace but I enjoy working. [Correa] Did you say working with former President Augusto Pinochet? [Frei] No. He understands the joke immediately and smiles. [Correa] What is the best thing about being president? [Frei] First, I have the opportunity to do things, solve problems; second, I enjoy people's support. In a more personal area, I like to rest at the Vina del Mar presidential residence. Besides, the palace brings to my mind many memories. Memories of my father when he was president, when I was dating Martita. [Correa] What do you resent the most? [Frei] The lack of time for myself. I must work 12, 14, 16 hours. [Correa] Are you paid well? [Frei] It would embarrass me to show you my paycheck. If I tell you how much I make people will say I am "marketing." [Correa] How much? [Frei] Seven hundred forty eight thousand pesos, after deductions. Grade one level. [Correa] You also receive expenses and representation allowances... [Frei] Yes. Here all expenditures are considered expenses. We have a budget for the presidency and all expenditures are considered expenses. This should be changed and we should have a current account. This matter of expenses is absurd. [Correa] Some people have compared your wife to Hillary Clinton. How do you think Martita Frei is doing as the first lady? [Frei] She is a very dedicated worker, she is working hard with new ideas, new projects. I believe the people value her contribution at the institutions over which she presides? [Correa] Have you felt the loneliness that comes with power? [Frei] Very little. In my position one has to deal with sudden developments all the time. My intercom is always open and the ministers all call me at any time. In the beginning, one tends to get too involved in the details but soon enough one realizes that one must focus on the essence. I hardly have any time to be alone and sometimes one needs some quiet time alone to read, to think, to ponder, to rest. [Correa] Would you say that this administration is still going through a break-in period? [Frei] A very important goal was reached on 21 May. From the very beginning we set ourselves very specific objectives, among them poverty as our first priority. We now have a well coordinated inter-ministerial team. [Correa] Was that the job of the Planning and Coordination Ministry? [Frei] Poverty is a multisector issue. This week, we started the National Poverty Commission. We also assumed a firm position regarding ethical standards and honesty, so this commission is working very effectively. [Correa] Do you believe commissions guarantee honesty? [Frei] No... Honesty can be guaranteed through a set of proposals which the commission is preparing. These proposals call for legal and administrative changes. The commission will establish regulations on incompatible activities and disqualifying circumstances. The commission has representatives from all branches of government: the chairman of the Senate, the chairman of the Supreme Court, the comptroller general, the State Defense Council. This issue has received international support and we have been asked to bring it up at the Ibero-American Summit which will take place in Miami in December. [Correa] So the break-in period is over? [Frei] That is up to the people to judge. We have set our priorities and have done so considering historical circumstances. Our actions have been well received by the people. [Correa] Members of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] have been complaining that your message to Congress, your so-called "navigation chart" was better received by the opposition than by your own supporters. [Frei] This is a groundless complaint. The presidential message to Congress outlined at least 16 bills already being processed and some 50 other initiatives that will be launched over the next 18 months. I would say that the break-in period is over. But the period was necessary. In any human endeavor, one must get the team together, get the people involved, establish trust and loyalty. [Correa] Is the CPPD loyal to you? [Frei] It has to be. During my electoral campaign I talked a great deal about the lack of loyalty my father had to endure. Perhaps the enormous number of votes I received was due to my steadfast loyalty to President Aylwin's administration. [Correa] Your father tried to carry out a "revolution in freedom;" while your predecessor Patricio Aylwin proposed a government for "national reconciliation." What is the slogan of your administration? [Frei] I would like my administration to be remembered for its struggle against poverty and marginalization. On a broader scale, I would like to take advantage of this historic opportunity Chile has to further its development. [Correa] Critics from within the administration and the opposition have been saying that your administration has no set course of action, nor leadership. They say it is obvious that you have no political experience. What is your answer? [Frei] What is the point of defending myself? Let the people be the judges. We have established certain goals and deadlines for the 70 days prior to our message to Congress which contains a set of definitions. [Correa] Do you think your government has wasted 70 days...? [Frei] I do not think the country has lost 70 days. We could review each sector separately... For example, Codelco [Copper Corporation]. In what state was it when we came to government? What is its situation now? We submitted a draft bill to Congress to modernize the most important Chilean enterprise, to make it more efficient. By eliminating the operations management in Santiago, Codelco has already changed radically. The mining district managers are now the top managers of the respective enterprises. In less than 70 days, we submitted to Congress a draft bill heading in the right direction. This week he continues we closed a deal that will entail an investment of more than $1 million. In the public works sector, we have called for bids for two or three significant projects and other important ones will be called soon. We progressed in the fields of poverty, health, and regionalization. We will double regional investments. We have tackled the vital Arica and Magallanes problems because we do not avoid our problems... We have decidedly progressed in the privatization project. [Correa] Are you talking about LAN [Chilean National Airline], and the electricity company...? [Frei] Obviously. The problems affecting LAN, Northern Electricity Company, and State Maritime Enterprise have been solved. We will continue on this path. [Copper] Everything except the privatization of Codelco? [Frei] We believe Codelco's four most important mining districts should remain in the state's hands. [Correa] What about Colbun-Machicura? [Frei] We might privatize it. Enterprises that are not monopolies and which need great investments, which the state cannot afford, might be privatized. For example, in the health sector, Chile currently spends 4 or 5 percent of its GDP but, do you know how much we invest in the health sector? Eighty million dollars. Should I invest $40 million to get Empremar on its feet again? No. The private sector must do that. But he continues, drinking a glass of mineral water no one should expect the government to solve in just 70 days problems that have existed for more than 70 years, like the coal mining sector. No one can expect us to solve the health and education problems in 70 days. We are identifying the great problems that need to be solved. It would have been very easy for us to say: In the education field let us submit a draft bill to Congress referring to subsidies and easy problems, without tackling the core of the problem. We must tackle the core of the problem in the education field or we will remain an underdeveloped country. We must increase teaching hours. [Correa] Will the reform of the Teachers Statutes include the elimination of the clause by which teachers cannot be replaced? [Frei] We do not want to dismiss teachers. We want to expand the teaching hours, which means we need more teachers. But they must be redistributed. Changes are feasible through dialogue. [Correa] The teachers maintain the government did not consult them before submitting the draft bill to Congress... [Frei] They wanted a private dialogue first and this is what we did. We never interrupted the dialogue. But, definitely, no one can say that in these 70 past days, we have not tackled crucial problems. [Correa] People believe you are distant regarding important problems. You never publicly stated your opinion regarding Stange, the teachers problem, the negotiations over the minimum salary... [Frei] We work as a team and are constantly evaluating. The president makes the decisions and this is what I have been doing. If I had not been involved in the important issues, I would have not signed the draft bill regarding the Teacher's Statutes. I have been involved in the main decisions. As for publicly disclosing decisions, I am not the government spokesman. I am here to work and make decisions with a true national meaning. What did I do on my first visit to Concepcion? I acknowledged the coal miners' problem. Do not tell me I have been aloof. We are negotiating, working on the subject and will make a series of proposals. The same goes for Arica. Obviously, economic issues are dealt with through permanent contact with the finance minister. [Correa] You said you would assess the public servants 180 days after you came to power. Will you change any ministers? [Frei] When I said that I referred to all public servants, so why should some ministers not be replaced? [Correa] And will they be removed? [Frei] I have been putting together an excellent team. I am very pleased with it, but it goes without saying that the post of minister entails the president of the Republic's trust. Ministers stay in their posts as long as they have the president's confidence. [Correa] Your political team has come under fire on charges that it is not a real team, that it is not well-structured, that there are internal struggles. Do you believe it is a matter of time or is there a problem of incompatibility of temperaments? [Frei] Whenever there is a new administration, there is obviously a period of adjustment. So far, we have been engaged in that. The important thing is that there is loyalty, coherence, and respect. We have had to confront difficult situations, but I am convinced the people will become aware of the political team's worth. [Correa] Who is your "right-hand man"? [Frei] Right-hand man? he asks, somewhat surprised. [Correa] The interior minister, the minister secretary general of the Presidency, or the defense minister ...? [Frei] It is said that I am closer to this one or that one ... I have been a friend of Defense Minister Edmundo Perez since I was seven ... When one is president, the relationship with one's aides goes beyond the realm of personal friendships. I get on well with all of them ... There is no "right-hand man," rather a working team ... Each ministry has its specific function. People are always willing to create differences ... In the beginning, it was said: "The president makes mistakes." It was then said: "It is not the president, it is his aides who make mistakes." I do not believe in those things. We are working as a team, which was reflected in the 21 May state of the nation address. Obviously one can make mistakes. [Correa] And yet, what mistakes are you willing to acknowledge? The "Stange Case" for example? [Frei] In that case, I made a decision, period. I assume my responsibility as chief of the team, as president of the Republic. [Correa] Would you have acted the same way if Pinochet had been the affected party? [Frei] I do not work on hypotheses. [Correa] When Aylwin assumed office as president, he requested Pinochet's resignation, why did you not do the same? Are you pleased with having him as the commander in chief? [Frei] I reiterate that this is not a personal issue. Power has an impersonal stamp. I swore allegiance to the Constitution and the law and I shall abide by them. We do not have the necessary quorum to change that situation and we have an excellent relationship with the commanders in chief. We are currently working on major definitions for the future that will benefit the country. [Correa] And yet, would you rather Gen. Pinochet went? [Frei] This is not a matter of indulging oneself to something one wants. I am here to command the nation. [Correa] Why was the issue of human rights conspicuously absent from the state of the union address? [Frei] I mentioned it twice during my speech. [Correa] Do you believe, as Aylwin said at La Sorbonne University, that what happened concerning human rights under the military regime was the worst tragedy that this country had ever had to endure? [Frei] Before becoming president, I said I would not comment on what others said. Least of all will I comment on what former President Aylwin said now that I am in the driver's seat. Everyone may voice his own personal views. [Correa] And yet, from a personal standpoint, do you not believe this was Chile's worst tragedy ...? [Frei] I was elected president to govern the country with my eyes set on the 21st century. My political and historical judgment on those events are public knowledge. I have voiced them on many occasions. The issue of human rights is not closed. Great strides were made under the previous administration. The courts are at present dealing with those lawsuits and we will endorse their judgment on those cases. [Correa] Would you propose that the country forgets about it once and for all? [Frei] We have never talked about closing the issue. [Correa] Do you believe that only one person is responsible for Codelco's [Copper Corporation's] loss of $270 million? [Frei] I believe no one can be solely responsible for anything in a company as large as Codelco. Right now, we are doing everything possible to make sure it does not happen again. [Correa] What do you think about the constitutional charges against former Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley? [Frei] I believe the charges against Foxley and against Hales [Alejandro Hales, mining minister under the Aylwin administration], are essentially political. It is not my place to pass judgment on the powers of other branches of government. I can say, however, that I know them both, and they are very honest and committed to public service. [Correa] Is Foxley your candidate for president of the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]? [Frei] I have no candidates. [Correa] You have not, however, ceased to be an active PDC member. Are you going to vote? [Frei] I have said that I was not prepared to comply with the responsibilities and duties of active members. It is not my place to do so. Most probably, I will not vote at all. I am interested only in the unity of the party. I would not he smiles do anything at all that could hurt the party. All I want is for the party electoral process to develop democratically, so that we can have a strong party loyal to the administration. [Correa] How would you explain to a foreigner that the Chilean president is unable to dismiss the chief of police? [Frei] This is how things are. In 1988, we accepted the fact that we would be returning to democracy within a legal framework in order to make whatever constitutional changes necessary once we took over. In any democratic country in the world, the president has the power to appoint or replace the chief of police. This issue has not been resolved yet. We did, however, swear to obey the Constitution and the laws. [Correa] How can you explain to any human being the fact that you are not even trying to change these laws that you believe to be undemocratic? [Frei] We do not have the majority in Congress to do so. To send a bill to this effect would be, at this stage, a formal gesture. Not even in the Chamber of Deputies do we have the majority necessary to make this constitutional amendment. At this stage we have decided to aim at two large reforms: modernizing Congress, and reorganizing municipalities nationwide. [Correa] As president of the nation, what is your position on the inability to remove the commanders in chief of the Armed Forces services? [Frei] I believe it to be essential for a democratic president to have the power to appoint and remove the commanders in chief of the Armed Forces services. [Correa] Do you mean to say that if during your term in office you never obtain the required congressional majority in Congress, you will not send the bills to reform the Constitution to Congress? [Frei] These issues will undergo substantial changes in 1997. I believe they should be debated calmly. As of that date, the commanders in chief will stay in office four years. [Correa] What about the designated senators? [Frei] This issue is part of the modernization of Congress. Let us discuss this issue now, not in 1997 when many people will want the president to appoint the senators he is entitled to by law. Is that what we want? It is neither proper nor democratic. [Frei] If no amendment eliminating designated senators is passed, will you appoint the ones you are entitled to? [Correa] If I am faced with this situation, yes, I will. I do not believe, however, that it would be the right thing to do. [Correa] Does this mean, Mr. President, that you want to do away with the positions of designated senators before 1997? [Frei] No. I want the positions eliminated in 1997. It will take time, however, to get the electoral reform approved. It is better to begin now and do things calmly. [Correa] Under these circumstances, would you say that Chile is enjoying full democracy, or is it still in transition? [Frei] We are obviously enjoying full democracy, even though there are some constitutional issues, like the ones I mentioned, that need to be resolved. Our main issue nowadays is something else: How can we improve the democratic system for the future? [Correa] Would you contend that the president of the Republic is the highest authority in Chile when he cannot remove the Armed Forces commanders in chief? [Frei] The Armed Forces are carrying out an absolutely professional task, which is respectful of the sovereign power that has been legitimately established. I have an excellent and very smooth relationship with the Armed Forces. For us, to put an end to the irremovability of the commanders in chief is a matter of principle, but given the present state of affairs the current situation is absolutely normal. [Correa] What is your opinion of the fact that Army officers who are facing charges of human rights violations are still on active duty? [Frei] Legal actions are bound to conclude, and one has to respect the courts' judgment. That is the role of the courts. [Correa] And yet what is your opinion of the fact that officers who are being prosecuted are still on active duty? [Frei] It is always difficult to prejudge if one does not have a thorough knowledge of the lawsuits. The important thing is that those legal actions take place, and that a sentence be passed, and that the people realize that there is an independent branch of government (the judiciary) and an administration that respects it. [Correa] It has been said that you left the Stange issue in the hands of the defense minister, your fellow party member Edmundo Perez Yoma, because you do not trust Interior Minister German Correa because he is a Socialist, and this something the Armed Forces abhors. [Frei] Look, when I decided to appoint German Correa I was perfectly aware that I was going to endure difficulties and complications. [Correa] Do you believe it was a mistake to appoint him? [Frei] No, quite the contrary. As time goes by, I am more and more convinced that it was not a mistake. No one is banned from any posts in Chile. We are talking about the future, not the past. I give German Correa my wholehearted support for his loyalty and his work as interior minister. I am very happy with him, and if I had to appoint a cabinet, I would designate him again to the Interior Ministry. [Correa] Why are you hiding him, then? [Frei] I am not hiding him at all. Quite the contrary, he enjoys my full support. He has worked very effectively regarding Carabineros operations... It seems that the issue of the security of citizens, an issue that was so much discussed, has been forgotten in the country, whereas previously it was insistently demanded... It is obvious that there are people that are shooting on both sides of the line. This is like a political terrorism based on rumors. This is bad for the country and for democracy. I am very happy with the work German Correa is doing. [Correa] Based on analyses and opinions on the issue, we can deduce there is widespread consensus that the government mishandled the Stange situation. Do you believe this criticism is correct? [Frei] Let us review the situation. sighs First of all, the situation concerning Gen. Stange is not the responsibility of this administration. It is a process that started in 1985 when three professionals were slain. The entire country is aware of how the incidents developed. The court case is over; Carabineros members have been sentenced by the courts. Second, we uphold the Constitution and the law. The president is not empowered to change the Carabineros commander. Third, there is the organizational issue. We believe the Carabineros are not part of the Armed Forces; and therefore they should not be under Defense Ministry jurisdiction. In fact, operationally the Carabineros today fall under Interior Ministry jurisdiction. The Interior Ministry is in charge of safeguarding the citizens' security; and therefore everything concerning the Carabineros should be handled by the Interior Ministry. Everything pertaining to security lies with the Interior Ministry, but with no authority because administratively the Carabineros fall under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. That is how the situation stands. [Correa] If you could turn the clock back, would you again ask Gen. Stange to retire despite the fact that the law does not empower you to force him to go? [Frei] I asked him to make a gesture, and I would do it again. [Correa] Don't you think it was a mistake to make such a request if it depended solely on his willingness? [Frei] When you occupy the president's chair, you have to make decisions. Gestures are also very important. [Correa] Who advised you to make this request? [Frei] I assume full responsibility in this regard. I am the president of the Republic, and I discussed the issue directly with Gen. Stange. The easiest thing to do would have been to entrust this task to someone else, but as a government leader I assume full responsibility. [Correa] You mentioned moral reasons. Do you feel your authority as a ruler has been undermined? [Frei] Absolutely not. I am not empowered to do this, but for the sake of the integrity of institutions and for the good of the government, I did the proper thing. [Correa] Honestly speaking, do you trust Stange? [Frei] This is not a personal problem. I am fulfilling my role as president of the Republic, and he as done the same as Carabineros director general. Each one, in compliance with the responsibilities established in the Constitution and the law, makes his own decisions. [Correa] My question was whether or not you trust Stange? [Frei] I refer to the official government statements. [Correa] Do you think he seriously failed in his military duties? [Frei] That has to be determined by the courts. [Correa] If this has to be determined by the courts, why then was Stange asked to resign before the courts issued a verdict? [Frei] Because it entailed a court case that has lasted nine years; for the sake of good government; for the sake of the integrity of the Carabineros. [Correa] Based on these words, we can conclude that Stange does not enjoy your trust and that he seriously failed in his duties. [Frei] I did not say that. Everything is stated clearly in the official government statement. [Correa] If the courts declare him innocent, do you still think he should retire? [Frei] I cannot comment on a theory, only on facts. What has been said suffices. The entire country is well aware of my position on this issue. There are no more comments to make on the issue. [Correa] Specifically, how will this issue be resolved? Will it be indefinitely postponed? [Frei] We will try to reach a consensus. [Correa] Why did you leave out the paragraph on Gen. Stange from your 21 May address? [Frei] Because it was 80 pages long and I only read 40. I decided which paragraphs were worthy of reading. [Correa] Have you decided on a solution to this problem or will you continue to improvise? [Frei] No, everything regarding the Carabineros has already been said. [Correa] What has your administration decided regarding Chile joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South] [Frei] Our international economic policy is based on an open regionalism. We are interested in achieving Latin American integration. This is why in the past few years we have concentrated our efforts on achieving bilateral agreements, but in today's world there are other realities, such as NAFTA, APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], and the European Union. Today, Mercosur is one of the most dynamic groups in Latin America. Chile has sharply increased its exports to Latin America; almost two-thirds of our manufactured export goods go to the Latin American market. Within this context, Argentina and Brazil are our main partners. Trade between Chile and Mercosur members has increased more than five-fold in the last six or seven years. Moreover, Mercosur is negotiating with the EU; therefore, we cannot be left out of this market. [Correa] Mr. President, what is the meaning of all this? That Chile will join Mercosur? [Frei] We have not proposed joining Mercosur. We will propose the establishment of free trade zone within the framework of this regionalization opened between Chile and Mercosur. We are very interested in this, and we believe it is an issue of utmost importance. We are drafting a proposal to be submitted at the Cartagena de Indias Ibero-American Summit to be held next month, based on these terms. I will attend the Rio Group meeting that will be held in September, and in December we will be meeting with President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas. Moreover, there is also the trip to Jakarta, where Chile will be admitted to APEC. We obviously want to play a preponderant role at the regional level. Latin American integration plays a fundamental part in Chilean foreign policy. [Correa] Is joining NAFTA a government priority? [Frei] Chile exports almost one-third of its GDP; it cannot be absent from big markets. Our presence in APEC; the start of formal negotiations with the United States to achieve a free trade agreement; and our relation with the EU and regional markets are the guidelines of our foreign economic policy. Within this framework, we believe it is essential to consolidate our integrationist position in Latin America. We are part of this region; they are our neighbors. It is our culture. They receive two-thirds of our manufactured exports. Individually, our countries have little to say before large economic groups -- APEC, EU, and NAFTA -- therefore inasmuch as we can consolidate a free trade region and all the multinational initiatives in which Chile takes part, I believe we are treading on the right path. [Correa] Does the government plan to achieve bilateral agreements with those Latin American countries with which there are not any, such as Ecuador and Brazil? [Frei] This is very important. Our experiences with those countries with which we have signed bilateral agreements have been extraordinarily successful. We can cite Mexico, and particularly Argentina, where Chilean investments total $1 billion; there are also binational undertakings such as the oil pipeline dedicated by President Menem and President Aylwin; and a gas pipeline project that will demand a significant investment. We have just undertaken studies to build a tunnel that will demand significant investment from our two countries. All this goes to prove that bilateral agreements work. This does not mean we are overlooking multilateral agreements. This is why we are members of the Rio Group; why we want to establish a free trade region within the framework of Mercosur; and why we are members of Latin American Integration Association. [Correa] Chilean agriculture is worried about Chile's possible membership in NAFTA. [Frei] A country like ours cannot be absent from these great opportunities. We will achieve this safeguarding national interests; we will see whether we will only join a free trade agreement or also join NAFTA. This will be decided in the next stage. Negotiations are just starting. I believe this will be very beneficial for Chile in the long term, as we are an exporting country. President Clinton will be announcing within the next three or four months what countries the United States can achieve these kind of agreements with. Only then will negotiations be undertaken prior to congressional approval. All interested parties -- and of course agriculture -- will be represented in these negotiations. [Correa] You hope to lower the inflation rate to one digit. On a scale of one to nine, which digit? Frei laughs. [Frei] As we engineers like to say: leaning more toward zero and he draws a descending arrow on a pad of paper. In view of the current national economic situation, we are interested in basically maintaining a macroeconomic balance. Everything that has been achieved, with so much effort, will be safeguarded fiercely. There are corporate interests. It is our duty to maintain this balance. Inflation, among them, is an important factor because it has a great impact on wage and salary earners. The country can be certain that we will be inflexible in this regard. [Correa] In your message, you estimated an 11 percent inflation rate for 1994. Do you believe it is necessary to extend the economic adjustment process? [Frei] I believe that the economic adjustment process is almost completed. This is why we hope to achieve an average annual economic growth of 5.5 percent during my administration. [Correa] It will be 3.4 percent this year. [Frei] Four to 4.5 percent. We will be quite inflexible regarding fiscal expenses. We will not be pressured by any national group. Balances will be maintained; we will struggle to achieve a low inflation rate. To overcome poverty, we must develop and grow. There is no other way. The entire country is aware of the economic conditions in which we inherited the country; that an economic adjustment was implemented; and that all the figures are showing that the economic adjustment period is ending. We have been extremely careful regarding government spending, and we will continue to be so. [Correa] Mr. President, the only way to curb inflation is to lower fiscal spending, which in the previous administration totaled an average of 7.5 percent while economic growth totalled 6.5 percent. [Frei] We will be inflexible regarding taxes, monetary matters, inflation, and fiscal spending,, too. The country cannot spend more than the GDP. We will maintain a fiscal balance; there will be no deficit. [Correa] What measures will be implemented if inflation is not curbed? [Frei] All the ones that are necessary to achieve a one-digit inflation rate within a prudent period of time.
