At the state Great Hural sitting, which was held yesterday from 6 PM up to 2 AM today, besides lawmakers present were the Mongolian president, the head of the president's administration, the president's adviser on national security issues, the head of the parliament chancellery, two of its deputy heads, the head of the parliament press service, and the head of the state security service. Besides the findings of the working group, submitted was to the parliament a strictly secret material on the scent of the checkup work containing, seemingly, some concrete data and facts, and also a statement of the lawmakers from the opposition in the Parliament A. Ganbaatar, T. Elbegdorj, who worked in this group [sentence as received]. The findings of the working group, which carried out the checkup work from 28 December up to 12 January at the State Security Central Department and the Central Police Department and which was set up on the initiative of the Parliament opposition, contain a conclusion that the statement made by the former head of the counterintelligence service about involvement of the State Great Hural Chairman N. Bagabandi, the Parliament Vice Chairman J. Gombojab, and the Prime Minister P. Jasray in bribery and abuse of powers is groundless and not confirmed. In this document appeared are for the first time also names of the state Great Hural member, leader of the biggest oppositional party Mongolian National Democratic Party [MNDP] D. Ganbold, the [words indistinct] member, and member of the MNDP S. Zorig. But, as it is pointed out in the findings, also materials concerning D. Ganbold and S. Zorig did not confirm their participation in abuse of powers. In the statement made by the lawmakers from the Parliament opposition A. Ganbaatar and T. Elbegdorj there is a disagreement with the findings of the working group on the grounds that the group has not given any assessment to a sudden removal of the head of the State Security Service and has not stated reasons for that. On the other hand, as it is said in the statement, despite the presence of serious data and materials, concerning the Parliament head, the deputy head and the prime minister, the working group deviated from giving a true assessment, and what is more was guided by concealment and intercession in its actions. At the end of the first day of hearing the working group the head of the Mongolian State P. Ochirbat has taken a floor. He expressed his position on this issue. As it was decided to continue consideration of the findings of the working group in Parliament next week, close of the State Great Hural autumn session was also postponed.
