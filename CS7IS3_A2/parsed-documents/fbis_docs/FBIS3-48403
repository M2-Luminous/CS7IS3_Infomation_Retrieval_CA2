An official who refused to be identified said that the PLO is expected to set up an interim committee soon to receive financial aid from the world for the rehabilitation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho. Seoul expressed its will to support rehabilitation of the autonomous region at multilateral talks in Washington Oct. 2-3 last year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu attended the talks co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. The talks were the first international ones held to handle the aid program since Israel and the PLO signed a peace accord in Washington early last September. "We are unable to discuss the aid program as no recipient body has yet been set up by the PLO," the official said. But inter-ministerial consultations are under way on the methods of financial aid to the PLO following the establishment of a recipient body, he said. He said he is quite sure that the aid program will be discussed bilaterally with the PLO, not international bodies or Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned his Korean counterpart Han to support the rehabilitation of the autonomous region of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, shortly after the signing of the peace accord. It is expected that the government will extend soft loans from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF). The EDCF is a government-managed fund for developing nations. But other officials did not rule out that nonrefundable aid would also be delivered although in small amounts. The United States has projected collecting contributions through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. At present, no country has extended aid to PLO for the same reason as Korea and also because of the uncertainty of the Middle East peace. PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat also expressed hope for assistance from South Korea in a recent interview with KBS [Korea Broadcasting System]. 'Arafat is familiar with North Korean leaders, having visited Pyongyang several times. South Korea has no formal diplomatic ties with the PLO but has already recognized its identity.
