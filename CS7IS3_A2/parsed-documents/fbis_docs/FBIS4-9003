According to Mr. Videnov, the positive thing about the decision was that it clearly stated it set no precedent and should not be repeated. BSP deputy floor leader Nikolay Kamov voiced his concern over statements made by representatives of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) which, according to Mr. Kamov, did not rule out the possibility for once again taking this decision. "The SDS refuse to firmly state that they are against the passage of foreign military troops via Bulgaria's territory," Mr. Videnov also said. According to him, it is dangerous for this country to think that a series of single acts leave its stand unchanged. If approached again with this request, we are most likely to again say "yes," the BSP leader said. According to Mr. Videnov, the great powers now see the conflict in former Yugoslavia as a global, religious-based one. The processes in the Balkans cannot be a concern for the great powers only. Serbia-Montenegro is not hostile to Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and this (that Macedonia's security is jeopardized) is a myth certain political forces in Bulgaria have created to justify their actions, according to the BSP leader. The Socialists have not yet taken an official stand on the decision of the Russian Duma to demand lifting of the Yugo-embargo, Klara Marinova of the BSP told the news conference.
