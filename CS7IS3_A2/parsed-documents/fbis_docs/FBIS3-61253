F. Nietzsche: "Thus Spoke Zarathustra." The problems of Belarus today have been mixed in to the domestic political sphere. The republic's population is suffering from higher prices, impoverishment and unemployment, a sharp rise in crime, and a loss of future prospects. Because of the difficulties of daily life, public opinion remains actually indifferent to questions of foreign policy. Yet we cannot allow ourselves to be indifferent to international activity. The taxpayer has the right to know about the effectiveness of the utilization of funds spent for conducting the state's foreign political activity. How It All Began Foreign policy, like policy in general, in civilized countries is formed by a fairly narrow group of people. They include political figures of a certain level and the so-called analyst-experts who develop various political concepts. In Belarus, which is just starting out on the bumpy path of development of civilization, the situation with the development of a political course is much simpler and hence also sadder. A lack of professionalism does not play last fiddle in the political orchestra of the Republic of Belarus. This disease has affected many power structures of our country as well as, unfortunately, one of the key organs of state administration--the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many critical shots have been taken at this department recently. And Petr Kravchanka, chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has ended up at the center of the target. And in general this is understandable. It is the leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who is largely responsible for both foreign policy and the republic's image in the international arena. Therefore when analyzing the foreign policy of independent Belarus, the author of these lines automatically has to look at the image of the minister of foreign affairs. To be fair, it should be noted that Kravchanka's first steps in the post of leader of the foreign political department deserved all possible praise: It was necessary to begin under the conditions of the existence of the USSR when the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was nothing more than a branch of the Union one. In these circumstances, which were so unfavorable for the establishment of national independence, the only correct line of foreign political behavior was selected--cultural-national. "Native Tongue," the propaganda of Belarusian culture, the development of ties with the Belarusian diaspora--all this could not fail to evoke the sympathies of the republic's intelligentsia. For a certain amount of time Petr Kravchanka was able to charm even the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front who, in general, cannot be suspected of having great love for the so-called party nomenklatura. I would also like to point out another of the minister's positive characteristics--his consistent behavior. Certain of his opponents understand this quality as an adherence to methods and forms of party leadership. But the author sees it as "devotion to ideals," in the long list of which one can note ideals of a culturalogical direction. Veteran Belarusian diplomats and the intelligentsia will understand well how three years ago the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was turned into something like a private investigation bureau, all of whose workers day and night, with or without technical means, looked all over the world for the notorious "cross of Yefrasinya of Polotsk." These searches continue to this day, although with less enthusiasm. While giving the great Belarusian sacred object and the need to return it to the homeland their due, it still should be noted that searches for national treasures that have disappeared abroad should be handled, apparently, by the Ministry of Culture and the corresponding authorized organs. And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may exert a certain diplomatic influence but certainly not usurp the entire process. But we will not get into an analysis of the causes of the "cultural fever" that gripped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs abroad for two epochs. A sufficient number of interesting articles have been devoted to this topic. Let us turn to the less-studied aspects of our state's foreign political activity. Forgotten Initiative One of the methods of fighting for peace is to fight for the creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons. A couple of years ago Minister P. Kravchanka put forth an initiative to create a nuclear-free zone from the Baltic to the Black Sea. But no further steps were taken to add details and real content to this initiative. The problem of a "Ukrainian Chernobyl" remains. Moreover, it recently acquired a new quality--our southern neighbors decided to continue to operate their nuclear reactor. And what can be said about the condition in which nuclear weapons are kept in Ukraine today! This is how our initiative, long forgotten by everyone, has been realized. While the citizens were thinking about the problem of doing without nuclear weapons, they were told that Belarus had submitted a proposal for mediation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. A moment later we are already becoming the initiators of regulation of the conflict in the Dniester region. The latter, naturally, was resolved without even our minimal participation. As for Nagorno-Karabakh, here at the diplomatic level our side has done nothing and is doing nothing. The minister has not taken a single trip to either Armenia or Azerbaijan. They have all been longer--to Western Europe and America. Apparently Belarus needed the intermediary mission more than the Transcaucasus did. The only result of our activity for regulating conflicts has been that the government has allotted money for the reconstruction of a number of facilities in the former building of the CPSU Gorkom [city committee] (now, Ministry of Foreign Affairs) for an international group of observers. But the intermediary group moved to Rome without even registering in our country. Memorial Markers Are All Right, But... The activity of Belarus in the United Nations is evoking a multitude of complaints. Naturally, one is reminded of the related work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the past three years in this area--A. [as published] Kravchanka's appearance in the United Nations in an ethnic shirt. This surrealistic episode, incidentally, can be included among the minister's cultural predilections. The next session of the UN General Assembly (the minister of foreign affairs headed this delegation as well) was marked by the fact that the contribution of Belarus to the United Nations was increased by $2 million. We will now pay three times more than Hungary, twice as much as Greece, and 1.5 times more than the 800 million put up by India. Without analyzing the reasons for adopting this decision, one can say merely that it will lead to a 1.5-fold increase in the republic's contributions to other international organizations, which are based on the existing scale of contributions to the UN: the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization), UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), the International Labor Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization), and dozens of other international organizations and hundreds of various conventions and joint expert and consultative groups. The leader of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prefers to remain silent about these facts. Therefore we will most likely not learn the truth about the contribution of the long-suffering Belarus to the budget of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe either. All we know is that it exceeded the contribution of Portugal and Ireland, whose economic potential is not likely to be very far below that of our country. And if perhaps these figures still do not strike terror in us, as more institutions of European cooperation appear, Belarus' contribution will strike a painful blow to our pocketbooks, which are practically empty to begin with. Belarus' sharp increase in expenditures on multilateral diplomacy is occurring under conditions of a terrible economic crisis, which has struck literally all branches of the republic national economy. A curious comparison can be made with the People's Republic of China. A country with more than a billion population and the most rapid rates of economic growth in the world (about 12 percent annually), each year it contrives to reduce its contribution to the budget of the United Nations. After the increase of the contribution of Belarus and the regular reduction of China's contribution, we have almost caught up with this superpower in terms of the volume of hard currency payments for maintaining international bureaucrats. Is there really no logic in diplomacy? There is logic. It lies in the varying degree of effectiveness of diplomatic efforts of various countries. At the last session of the UN General Assembly Belarus submitted its candidacy for the Security Council. It lost to the Czech Republic. Now we will not appear on the lists of candidates for this position before the next millennium. Although if we had been able to really evaluate our capabilities and gain the support of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, at the next elections in two years our chances of obtaining a position on the Security Council would have looked much better. Another fact related to the selection procedure is confusing. After the first round of votes it was clear that the Czech Republic would make it onto the Security Council. In this case the states that garnered the fewest votes in the first round, as a rule, remove their candidacies for the next vote, as if making a gentlemanly gesture. Belarus did not do this. We know how it ended--the Czech Republic was selected. But let us be tolerant. Today's diplomacy is mainly multilateral diplomacy. In the international arena questions are decided to an ever increasing degree in informal discussions with the participation of several diplomats at the same time. Having only one foreign language, Russian, the minister of foreign affairs apparently sometimes experiences certain difficulties in communicating with representatives of other countries. Therefore some of the aforementioned blunders are partially the result of objective difficulties related to the problem of understanding. But there are also blunders that have nothing to do with understanding.... Strange as it may be, the Czechs did not put up their memorial plaques to Karel Capek and Jaroslav Gasek throughout all of Europe, but they were still selected for the Security Council. But, putting up signs all over the world and calling this foreign policy, we speak with the Italians about Frantsisk Skorina and his plaque in Padua, we engage in conversation with the Poles about Manyushko, and with the Japanese--about the need to immortalize the memory of Gashkevich. It is finally time to stop asking the entire world the eternal question: "Do you respect me?" A Time To Gather Up Stones For the foreign affairs ministers of the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and also the Czech Republic the imperative of foreign policy has been problems of the economy and particularly questions of international trade. The author of these lines is not surprised by the fact that the first question raised in the international arena by leading politicians of the West and East is the defense of their interests in negotiations within the framework of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). It seems that the main foreign political task for Belarus is to provide favorable external conditions for carrying out economic modernization. But, observing the activity of the leader of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one could get the impression that all of our problems related to this were solved long ago and we can allow ourselves to work on....questions of culture. The situation is quite the opposite. Antidumping legislation is continuing to work against us in the European Community. That is, we are considered to be a country with subsidized production (like the former USSR and now Russia). In other words, we continue to be seen as a state that receives oil, gas, and metal raw material at discounted prices. And therefore, unlike the Baltic states, we are taxed to such an extent that it actually blocks off our access to the European market. In both domestic and foreign policy there is a certain tactic of behavior to which certain figures in the highest echelons of power resort from time to time. This tactic is as old as the hills, but even today it continues to produce certain political points. The main thing is to come up with a slogan or introduce an initiative and then, without following up on what has been said, immediately switch to other initiatives or historic programs. Realizing the idea is much more complicated than merely discussing it. But it is the realization of what has been earmarked that increases the state's prestige in the international arena. Anything else merely undermines faith in the country's foreign political commitments. There was a time when we threw stones. But sooner or later the time will come when we have to gather them--take responsibility for the promises we have made. From the editorial staff. The facts contained in the published article show that Petr Kravchanka and the ministry he heads sometimes work on problems outside their purview. Moreover, instead of the expected aid, the republic itself is making considerable unjustified expenditures. Therefore it is impossible to understand why the activity of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet attracted the fixed attention of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Council. At the present time SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA intends to publish a series of articles devoted to an analysis of the foreign policy of the Republic of Belarus in the most important regions of the world.
