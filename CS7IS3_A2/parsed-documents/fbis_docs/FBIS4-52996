Stating that various forms of activities supporting the just cause of the Palestinian people and expressing solidarity with it will take place in Korea during the week, NODONG SINMUN says: The Korean people have consistently supported the Palestinian people's struggle for retaking the lost territories and restoring their legitimate national rights. The agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho signed between Palestine and Israel on May 4 was a fruition of the Palestinian people's patient efforts. If the Palestinian issue is to be finally resolved, Israel must completely withdraw from the occupied lands. The master of the Palestinian issue is the Palestinian people themselves. The Korean people hope that the agreement will serve as a foundation for the founding of an independent state. MINJU CHOSON declares that the Korean people will as ever fully support the just cause of the Palestinian people.
