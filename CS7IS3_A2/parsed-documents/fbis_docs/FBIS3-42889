He spoke yesterday at a press conference on the occasion of the refusal of the Ministry of Justice of Russia to register his front's charter. Assessing this kind of reaction by the state organ as "genocide against Russian thought and the Russian right to a world outlook and a political position," Vasilyev continued his tirade directed at V.V.Zh. He called absolutely groundless the suppositions that Pamyat and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] are united. In his opinion, this Liberal Democrat preaches ideas of national socialism, and his militaristic statements set the Russian people against other people and states. The statement that the Russian boot will be washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean is political adventurism, if not political provocation. The Pamyat leader said that V.V.Zh. "likes to call himself a Russian and speak in behalf of the Russian people. But it is necessary to be honest and not hide his nationality."
