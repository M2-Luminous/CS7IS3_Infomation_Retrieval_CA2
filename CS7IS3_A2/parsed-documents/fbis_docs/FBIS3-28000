Most coalition partners agreed to back a proposal by the Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6 trillion yen with a 4 percentage point raise in the tax rate to 7 percent, the officials said. However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan] [SDPJ], the largest of the seven coalition members, balked at the proposal to balance an expected revenue shortfall from the tax cuts with an increase in the tax, imposed on sales of most goods and services in Japan, they said. The coalition partners also expressed support for a Finance Ministry proposal to legislate a provision that would oblige the government to raise the consumption tax after a moratorium of one year, they said. The SDP voiced its objections to the proposal. The SDP has many opponents of the consumption tax as it bolstered its parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an anticonsumption tax platform. The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to persuade the SDP to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said. The coalition tussle has intensified nine days before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President Bill Clinton. Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton. The non-SDP coalition partners are trying to alleviate the SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to change the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from "consumption tax," the officials said. As the coalition's political schedule obliges it to adopt a comprehensive stimulative package by Thursday, Hosokawa may have to use his leadership to decide on the tax hike even at the risk of antagonizing the SDP, they said. Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a meeting of coalition leaders, "The SDP will absolutely not tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax." However, other coalition partners are calling for the raise to be implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election expected in the summer of 1995. Meanwhile, Hosokawa may step up cooperation with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party in working out the details of the economic package aimed at balancing the income tax cut with the consumption tax raise, even if it alienates the socialists, coalition sources said. Hosokawa, in a meeting earlier in the day with LDP President Yohei Kono, asked for an opportunity to hold consultations after flying back from Washington, the sources said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "It is quite natural for the premier who represents the coalition and the LDP president who leads the main opposition party to hold consultations over crucial issues whenever necessary." However, Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co- leader of the No. 2 ruling party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), expressed displeasure with the Hosokawa-Kono meeting. An SDP official warned the prime minister against approaching the LDP, saying the implications of the day's meeting with Kono were "different from ceremonial talks between the LDP and SDP when we were in opposition." The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "I suspect that Hosokawa and Takemura are now in favor of severing ties with Shinseito and the SDP, if it helps form an alliance with the LDP." After wrapping up the eleventh-hour compromise on political reform last Friday, Hosokawa told a news conference in an apparently conciliatory tone he had long sought a meeting talk with Kono.
