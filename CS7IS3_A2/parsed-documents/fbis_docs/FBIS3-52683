It has become the talk of the public and the intellectuals, overshadowing all other regional and international issues. The question that is being asked in every house is who killed or kidnapped Mansur al-Kikhya? [passage omitted] The question is: Did Libya kill or kidnap Mansur al-Kikhya? At first glance, we can say yes on the basis that the Libyan regime has a vital interest in the disappearance of al-Kikhya. But after scrutinizing the situation, we find ourselves facing various possibilities. First of all, it is illogical that Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or one of his agencies would resort to this criminal act at this specific time, when the international crisis against Libya is boiling and reaching its peak and while al-Qadhdhafi is trying hard to acquit his country of the Lockerbie incident. If we say that al-Qadhdhafi did it, after realizing that the U.S. Administration saw al-Kihya as a suitable substitute to take power and succeed al-Qadhdhafi in Libya, would it be illogical for al-Qadhdhafi to sacrifice his relations with Egypt? Al-Qadhdhafi has wagered on these relations even at the expense of disagreeing with some of his comrades in the Revolution Command Council. He has worked to cultivate these relations despite the regional events that have come between Egypt and Libya. I personally believe that al-Qadhdhafi was not ready to sacrifice his relations with Egypt, and particularly with President Mubarak, by kidnapping a Libyan opposition figure who has only his tongue and a pen. Even if we agree that al-Qadhdhafi had decided to sacrifice his relations with Egypt and President Mubarak and did this deed, how could al-Kikhya have been smuggled out amid the strict security measures on the border between the two countries? Could al-Kikhya have been kidnapped from his hotel so easily and without an uproar or shouts for help? In the midst of conflicting reports, we have forgotten to discuss the real beneficiary of the disappearance of al-Kikhya, particularly in Egyptian territory. We have forgotten Israel and the United States. Both countries have a common interest in striking at the Egyptian-Libyan relations, which have stood fast despite the strong winds blowing on them over the past few years. If we concede from the start that the United States is using all means to subjugate Libya and that one of the basic methods to do this is to tighten the suffocating blockade on it and if we agree that Egypt with its status, prestige, and common border with Libya still represents a support for the Jamahiriyah, why shouldn't the United States fabricate an incident that would force the regime in Egypt to sever its relations with Libya, at the least, or push it into war to overthrow the Libyan regime, in the most extreme case. The experience in Somalia was a lesson for the United States. The U.S. air bombardment of Iraq did not succeed in overthrowing President Saddam Husayn's regime. Only a ground war or an internal coups could change the situation. But because the United States does not want to dispatch its troops to a new swamp, their solution was to find another state that would do the job for it--especially since the United States has failed to change the regime through military coups. Certainly, the United States could only use Egypt, which, because of the size and equipment of its forces and its strategic location, could achieve what others could not. In addition, this would serve the U.S. and Israeli goals of starting a war among the sons of the nation to ultimately serve the Zionist aims. I also believe that the search recently focused on finding a justification, especially after al-Qadhdhafi refused to relinquish his country's sovereignty and decided not to turn over the Lockerbie suspects. The justification was Egypt's dignity. The Americans decided on a plan to kidnap al-Kikhya from Egyptian territory and to accuse the Libyan regime of doing the kidnaping. This would provoke the people to condemn the perpetrators of this act and then matters would escalate. In fact, a state of resentment has spread among the masses, especially since some newspapers have jumped to conclusions and have started leveling accusations at the Libyan regime, demanding that it be disciplined and that Egypt's squandered dignity be avenged. Thus the situation remains the same. Matters continue to escalate. Despite the Libyan denial and the Egyptian Government's belief that Libya is not behind this crime, some people remain determined to fan the fire and involve themselves in the scenario of the hellish U.S. game. [passage omitted] Thus, we must warn against falling into this new trap, this wicked plan that is aimed at igniting the fire of war between the Arab people in Egypt and Libya. This is an abominable crime into which we must not be pushed. We must force those who are playing with the country's national security to stop and realize that the eruption of war under the pretext of disciplining al-Qadhdhafi is the U.S.-Zionist plan. Despite all this, we call on the government to spare no effort in searching for the Libyan opposition figure and to remove the ambiguity surrounding his disappearance.
