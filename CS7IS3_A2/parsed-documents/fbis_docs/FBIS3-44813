According to the latest statistics, the city approved 3,752 foreign-funded enterprises in 1993, with promised and direct investment hitting 10.387 billion U.S. dollars and 6.28 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. The figure is more than the total for the previous 14 years. It is also reported that there was an increase in the number of well-known, trans-national companies undertaking large projects during the year, indicating their firm confidence in the enhanced investment environment. Last year 202 projects involving real estate and infrastructure, and funded with over 10 million U.S. dollars were started, compared to only 44 in the previous two years. Among the big names were included America's Motorola Inc. and Mars Inc., Japan's Matsushita Electrical Works Ltd, Australia's Cadbury Schweppes Plc., and others from Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan. Meanwhile, considerable investment was directed to tertiary industry. Among the newly approved foreign-funded firms, 33 percent are in this field, compared with only 7.3 percent in 1992. Experts attribute the trend to the city's ambitious plan to become a financial, tourism and commercial center. In addition, 696 firms solely invested by overseas businessmen to the tune of 340 million U.S. dollars, opened in Beijing last year, covering sectors such as electronics, clothing, medicines, foodstuffs, furniture and communications.
