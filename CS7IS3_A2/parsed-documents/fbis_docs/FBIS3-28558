In discussing ways to organize funds for state infrastructure projects, the Finance, Trade, Industry, and Energy, and Transportation Ministries agreed with the Economic Planning Board (EPB) on approving foreign investment to some extent by revising the foreign capital inducement act. Putting up funds for infrastructure ventures would not mean that foreigners could exercise management rights, a senior EPB official said, adding that their participation would be limited to joining a local consortium or buying small stakes. In addition, when launching a joint venture with private companies, public corporations can supply no more than 50 percent of financing and are deprived of voting rights so as to fully guarantee private management.
