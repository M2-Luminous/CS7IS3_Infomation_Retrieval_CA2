The document caused disagreements at a February 3 government presidium meeting. Nazarchuk said at a news briefing that Russia's agrarian sector had this year received a credit of only 270 Bn rubles at 213 percent interest. Altogether the sector is to receive under the government resolution "five trillion rubles instead of the six trillion necessary to carry through the spring sowing and end the wintering of the livestock," he said. The agroindustrial complex demanded a credit of 14 to 15 Tn rubles for this year, and those were the figures indicated in the original version of the resolution, Nazarchuk said. But in the version signed on Tuesday all the figures are much lower, he said. Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy, chairman of the Agrarian Policy Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of the legislature, in this connection expressed skepticism about "the hopes of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food to produce 85 Mn tonnes of grain this year" (Russia produced 100 Mn tonnes last year and 106 Mn tonnes in 1992). He does not expect this year's harvest to top 60 or 70 Mn tonnes, "which would last Russia 180 to 200 days, and then it will be living on doles." Zvolinskiy said Federation Council deputies might propose a vote of confidence in the government if it did not change its agricultural policy.
