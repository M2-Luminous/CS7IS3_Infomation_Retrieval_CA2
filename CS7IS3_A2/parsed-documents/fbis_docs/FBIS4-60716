FBIS4-60716 "drnes103_n_94003" FBIS-NES-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 LEBANON Al-Dirani Abduction Prompts Further Reaction Al-Dirani Abduction Prompts Further Reaction Group Denies Holding Arad JN2605185594 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1710 GMT 26 May 94 JN2605185594 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Text] Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today rejected the idea of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali mediating the issue of Israel's kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, the official in charge of the Believers Resistance. Buwayz said the UN secretary general's role is to obtain the release of the Lebanese citizen. Our correspondent in Beirut, Antoine Constantine, interviewed 'Ali al-Husayni, one of the senior officials in the Believers Resistance in Lebanon, and asked him about his opinion concerning the Lebanese Government's stand on al-Dirani's kidnapping and the possibility of exchanging him for Israeli pilot Ron Arad. [Begin al-Husayni recording] This is positive talk. We support what the Lebanese Government has said [words indistinct] brother Abu-'Ali al-Dirani, the UN secretary general, who is entrusted with an international organization which takes care of the entire world, should not compare and should not equate between the victim and the aggressor. I believe that just saying that we should carry out negotiations on al-Dirani and Ron Arad greatly harms the United Nations because Ron Arad bombed the people here, and was arrested on Lebanese soil, while Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was defending his land. Another thing is that Abu-'Ali al-Dirani has no information about Ron Arad. Butrus Ghali knows this. He previously carried out mediation and directly and indirectly contacted the Believers Resistance, and others, concerning the Ron Arad issue. At the time, he was informed [word indistinct] one of the UN envoys that we have nothing to do with this and we do not have him. Had Ron Arad been with the Believers Resistance, we -- I regret to use this expression -- but a man who struggles against Israel, for us, is worth all the Israelis. There is no doubt that we would have exchanged him because to us the individual is more important than anything else. The talk by the UN secretary general that he is ready to carry out a mediation shows he has colluded with the Israelis in the kidnapping operation. [end recording]
