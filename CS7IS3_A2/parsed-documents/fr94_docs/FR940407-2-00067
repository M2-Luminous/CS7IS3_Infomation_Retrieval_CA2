FR940407-2-00067 FR940407-2-00036 The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until June 1, 1994. Copies of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF permit program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on June 1, 1994, at the Elderly Nutrition Center, Eagle Butte, South Dakota, 57625. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period or any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's program. EPA will make a final determination on whether or not to approve the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's program and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF Criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that approval of the Tribal MSWLF permit program will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority: This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005 and 4010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6949a. Dated: March 31, 1994. Jack W. McGraw, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8358 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
