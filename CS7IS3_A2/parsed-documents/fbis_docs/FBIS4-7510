Do the more frequent breaches on the lines of contact come from uncontrolled groups, or are new hotbeds of conflict being generated systematically? Is the focus of the crisis being shifted as a part of that Serbian plan, so that one day there is a crisis in the eastern, the next in the western, and the day after that in the southern sector of the UNPA [UN Protected Area]? Does that mean that the recent more frequent military breaches and fierce skirmishes in Lika, for example, were incited by those in Knin who are carrying out the policy of the Belgrade strategists on behalf of priority political considerations and to give a signal to the international community, to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], and to the United States, which has finally become more actively involved in resolving the drama of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia? There is no doubt that the answers are affirmative to this entire string of questions. Knin, which has been very much shaken politically, is today stopping at nothing in its attempts to prove that world guarantees concerning reintegration of the UNPA into the constitutional system of Croatia "are not realistic," which is evidenced, according to them, by the frequent firefights with the Croatian Army [HV] in the border areas of the UNPA. The resoluteness of Milan Martic, newly elected president of the self-proclaimed "krajina," in proving that "life is no longer possible with the Croats in a joint state," is confirmed by the constant production of breaches. Many analysts do not even preclude the possibility that in a subsequent development of the situation unfavorable for Martic the krajina Serbs will encourage a general conflict with the Croatian Army, which the international community would have to stop because of the firepower on both sides, the devastation and numerous casualties, and according to the formula of the Vance Plan, the status quo would be cemented in place, which would postpone integration of the UNPA. Such a possibility would be the last step for the Serbian side in maintaining the status quo, and thereby its authority in the UNPA. War Hysteria Why are the rural Serbs in Croatia deciding on such radical changes at a time when the Serbian policy of normalization of relations with Croatia has been officially proclaimed? For several reasons. First of all, because of the U.S. initiative and normalization of relations between Croats and Muslims and because of the future federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the confederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. That is, it is well-known that if Croatia accepts confederation with the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it also gets firm guarantees of recovery of its occupied areas. This is certainly not at all to the liking of the krajina Serbs, who are already announcing that the "krajina" will be annexed to the Srpska republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thereafter also to parent Serbia, if the Croats and Muslims agree on confederation. As a matter of fact, the merger of the rebellious Croatian Serbs with their Bosnian fellow countrymen is for them only a matter of protocol in view of the high level of linkage there has been up to now with the Bosnian Serbs and the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. As a matter of fact, for a long time now the self-proclaimed "krajina" has been in a military, monetary, news, intelligence, and administrative alliance with the Srpska republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with Serbia. To illustrate, let us mention only the appearance of the newly printed identity card that is in effect at the moment in Knin. Beneath the title which reads "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" it says "Serbian republic Krajina," and after that "Knin Ministry of Internal Affairs." That inclusion of the self-proclaimed Serbian state in Croatia to that of the Bosnian Serbs is actually the last card which Martic and company can play. With the possible military support of the Bosnian Serbs, their position would be considerably strengthened, and that would certainly cancel a possible Croatian (Muslim) military solution and contribute to an extension of the status quo. Keeping the people in a state of war hysteria, that tried-and-true tactic of the Knin leaders, is counterproductive in the long run, and its first adverse consequences are already obvious--large-scale abandonment of the area of the "krajina" and departure for Serbia. Martic is, of course, aware of that, but so is Belgrade, and so the option of "linking up all the Serbian lands" is new spiritual food for the impoverished Serbian population. An End to All the Games There have been many breaches in the less than two months of Martic's "presidency," and they have been exceedingly unfavorable for him. The crisis over the Sava bridge between Stara Gradiska and Bosanska Gradiska, first the Serbian taking of the bridge, the possibility of a conflict with the UNPROFOR, and then the withdrawal, which the media moderated by speaking of "joint control," or again the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, sent a clear message to Martic that there are to be no more games with the international forces. The downing of the Udbina Hawks belonging to the "1st Squadron of the Air Force of the Army of the Serbian republic Krajina" in the sky over Novi Travnik and Bosanski Petrovac was a new slap in the face to the "sheriff of Knin," who has been unsuccessfully concealing the redness of his cheek from his own media public. From the public which so far has never been officially informed that the downed planes were those which in the past months have been rending the sky with low-altitude passes over Knin, presumably demonstrating both to the people of Knin and also to the UNPROFOR, the strength and spirit of the "krajina army." An army from whose command its chief until yesterday, General Mile Novakovic, has literally been removed. And Major General Milan Celeketic, born in Vojvodina, has been appointed to take his place; whether with the blessing or by the order of Belgrade it makes no difference at all! Alongside the dismissals from the top military leadership, Martic has also been punishing every form of liberalism concerning relations with the legal Croatian authorities. That is best confirmed by the case of Dzakula and Ecimovic. Martic is bringing up new units to the lines of demarcation with the Croatian Army to replace the old ones. Units from the eastern sector are coming to the southern sector, the command personnel are being replaced with those from Bosnia or even Serbia. The military negotiators are not being given any broad authority, and Martic is applying Milosevic's tried-and-true tactics of increasing the size of police forces on which one can count, because he is aware that slightly less than half of the electorate voted against him. That is why the war hysteria is being maintained with new breaches, and he has been successfully gagging his opponents. The Media Offensive New (old) crisis points are dots being added every little while on the map of Croatia. The hospital in Vinkovci is being hit from Ceric, just recently renamed Srbac, a place not far from Vinkovci. The extensive area of Perusic, Gospic, Licki Osik, and Otocac is being shelled from the area of Lika under Serbian control. Although we do not have official confirmation of possible skirmishes in the Lika part of the theater (the HV, the UNPROFOR, for example), the krajina media offensive, which has been talking about violent skirmishes between the HV and Serbian forces "west of Korenica," is indicative. Referring to Kozjan as a battlefield where fierce skirmishes took place over several days, the Serbian side obviously wants internationalization of this report, which for the present has not been verified. Knin "state television" has even published a report, which could not be verified, that Croatian forces held Novi Licki Osik (renamed Teslingrad) for three days, and then withdrew. Regardless of the authenticity of these reports, their purpose is to create an international public opinion that would oppose reintegration of the UNPA into the constitutional system of Croatia, and would portray Croatia as the attacker. If we add to that the (Serbian) firing of light antiaircraft SAM missiles on the Spanish transport plane in the general area of Plaski (a city under Serbian control) and its forced landing at the airfield on Krk, and the Serbian accusation of the Croatian side for the attack on the aircraft, the contribution to the new Knin strategy for intensifying the crisis is quite convincing. A New Cooling of Relations How will the new "krajina tactics" of a programmed escalation of the conflict affect Croato-Serbian relations? Certainly adversely, because the signing of the long-awaited complete truce seems further away than it did a month ago. As is already well-known, a cease-fire is a first step toward establishment of a political dialogue between Zagreb and Knin. But recent events have not only put symbolic distance between Zagreb and Knin, they have also postponed the entire process of normalization between Zagreb and Belgrade. The obvious halt in the process of warming relations between Croatia and the FRY is also indicated by the unfulfilled promises made during last month's visit by Zeljko Simic to Zagreb. It was agreed that offices in Belgrade and Zagreb would be opened by the end of February. So far, nothing has come of the announced reestablishment of telephone lines, and few people believe any longer in the opening of the limited-access highway, announced so optimistically for 15 March, when Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister, is supposed to visit Belgrade. Thus, new barricades in Croato-Serbian relations have again been set up in Knin. And that, in the opinion of many, is the reaction of the Belgrade headquarters and its Knin branch office to the Washington ink with which the agreement between Croats and Muslims was signed. We soon will see what are the next moves envisaged by Slobodan Milosevic. Nevertheless, one thing is predictable. He certainly will not sacrifice his pawn, Martic, in the foreseeable future.
