The fulfilment of the 2.250 million rupees contract was suspended after the United States accused Russia of violating the regime of control over the transfer of rocket technologies. In the opinion of the American side, India could use the Russian engines for launching its ballistic missiles. In December 1993 a delegation of Glavkosmos held talks with the representatives of ISRO, during which a new version of the agreement was worked out. It has been sent for approval to the Russian Government. In the opinion of Glavkosmos experts, there is now hope that this version will be approved because ``both politically and economically it is advantageous to Russia and does not violate the terms of the control regime.'' Glavkosmos has already received over 1 billion rupees from the ISRO and is planning on account of the remaining part of the contract to transfer to India two take-off rocket blocks and equipment for their operation. India, in turn, guarantees Glavkosmos specialists access to the places of assembly, testing and launching of its rockets with mounted Russian engines.
