"The defense industry is of strategic importance to national security and sovereignty, and, hence, the state should take charge of it and be responsible for it to a greater extent than in the case of remaining branches of the economy." After two years of preparations and one year of actual work, the restructuring of the defense industry is being focused on resolving four principal problems: defining the sector; conversion--i.e., retooling from military to civilian production; changes in ownership; and financial restructuring. Initially, the problem was the marked shrinkage of markets in the East owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the biggest customer for Polish arms (e.g., for 80 percent of the output of the aviation industry) and the general recession in this country and in the world, extending also to this industry. An additional constraint was the marked expansion of the list of UN-embargoed arms shipments by the previous governments, in accordance with the expectations of Western political and economic partners, which necessitated markedly reducing output down to the level merely meeting the needs of national security and defense and the forecast export possibilities. These objectives are being met, both quantitatively and in terms of range of output, by 31 arms-manufacturing enterprises. Previously, as many as 82 enterprises operated in that branch, even though most of them were suppliers manufacturing, in addition to civilian products, components ordered by makers of finished arms products. On the recommendation of the minister of industry and trade, the Council of Ministers has classified only 31 enterprises as belonging in the defense industry. Safeguarding national security requires maintaining in peacetime, as well, the arms-manufacturing capacity needed in times of war. But every unutilized machine or production bay means an added expense to the plant. Attempts to solve this problem in peacetime indicate that the best solution is conversion--that is, retooling from military to civilian production. The restructuring program, which encompasses such conversion, envisages that special [defense] production should account for not more than 30-40 percent of the output of each plant belonging in the defense industry. The general market principles of free--that is, public--privatization [of state enterprises] that the Ministry of Ownership Transformations is following normally restrict the state's ability to control it, and this conflicts with the strategic importance of the defense industry to national security and sovereignty. Therefore, the Council of Ministers has decided to expand the list of enterprises affected by the Law on the Ownership Transformations of Certain State Enterprises of Special Importance to the State Sector by adding to that list defense-industry enterprises. This means that responsibility for ownership transformations in the defense industry will be assumed by the minister of industry and trade. The need for financial restructuring is due to the so-called nonculpable, in many cases, arrears in payments owed by arms enterprises. Their financial restructuring is to be carried out so as to exploit the opportunities afforded by the Law on the Financial Restructuring of Enterprises and Banks and the Commercial Law Code, with bank agreement proceedings to be followed in the former case and composition agreement proceedings in the latter. At present, the economic situation of defense-industry plants is, according to Deputy Minister Czerwinski, on the whole satisfactory compared with that of other industries. Some 15 or so defense enterprises have achieved full financial liquidity, and, at 10 others, gross earnings already are beginning to exceed expenses. All defense-industry enterprises will be operating in the black by the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996. Bank-agreement proceedings will greatly contribute to that outcome. The present situation of the enterprises is burdened by the mistakes made not only by the government but also by their management. Minister Czerwinski cited the example of an enterprise that, on the order of its director, dispatched an entire trainload of equipment to Russia on 31 December 1992-- that is, in a year when everybody already knew by April that the Russians were welshing--and not a hair on the director's head was touched. Of the $260 million owed by the Russians, so far one-half could be recovered from them in the form of so-called financial clearing. Last year we did not pay for equipment shipments and repair work done by Russians, and the related negotiations are still in progress, though this conflicts with the principle of placing all orders with Polish enterprises. Of the 4 trillion zlotys [Z] allocated for purchases by the Ministry of National Defense, Z500 billion was earmarked for the acquisition of armaments precisely from Russia. The minister of industry and trade selected from among the directors of the 31 Polish defense-industry enterprises four persons, whom he appointed as his representatives commissioned to establish four holding companies and, subsequently, a consortium, with the object of coordinating promotional and growth policies in the defense industry. Instead of formalizing mutual cooperation, the group of aviation enterprises resolved to appoint a council of directors from that branch, along with commissions and working groups for marketing, R&D work, coproduction, etc. The sole bank to support restructuring programs in the arms industry is Polska Kasa Opieki (PKO), Inc. To this day, the principal problem facing any enterprise is how to finance its operations in the event that it receives a big contract, a big order. Considerations of national security and the like dictated authorizing only one bank to be involved. An additional problem is the need to finance so-called export credits, and the PKO, Inc. is ready to handle this matter. Responding to many questions of reporters, Minister Czerwinski expatiated upon, for example, the problem of privatizing arms plants. The method is very simple. At Nowa Deba, Radom, and Lucznik plants, separate departments were set up for so-called joint ventures, with the participation of foreign investors, in isolation from other departments of these plants. In speaking of restructuring at enterprises, Minister Czerwinski explained that accomplishing it hinges on their management; the Ministry of Industry and Trade merely oversees these operations as the parent agency. He, the minister, would like to bring about a situation in which the enterprise directors would know what they want and ask of the ministry merely permission to invite a foreign partner to a joint venture concerning a discrete plant department. The ministry is incapable of handling the restructuring of discrete plants; that is a task that was entrusted to the plant directors. The problem is only the proper selection of executive personnel.
