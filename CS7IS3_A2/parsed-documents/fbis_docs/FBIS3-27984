A Commerce Ministry source said M.R. Napthon Thongyai of the Commercial Counsellor's Office in Washington wrote to the US State Department opposing the $5-million sale. Under a special assistance programme, the payment period will be 30 years with a grace period of seven years at no interest. Last November, the US sold 35,000 tons of rice worth $10 million to the African nation under the same programme that did not adversely impact the Thai rice market because that sale was of a lower-quality rice, the source said. Cote d'Ivoire imported 200,400 tons of rice from Thailand in 1992 and anticipates imports of 215,000 tons this year.
