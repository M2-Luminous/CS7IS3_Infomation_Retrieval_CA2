Commenting on the development of the peace process in the Middle East following the vicious massacre of Hebron last month, the Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH cited statements made recently by the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and a high-ranking Israeli general and said the statements made it clear that Israel does not sincerely interest in peace and talking about peace is just for local consumption and for wasting time. [passage omitted] For its part, 'UKAZ, also published in Jeddah, expressed surprise on the American latest positions on the peace process in the Middle East and said the American stand would not remove obstacles that hinder realisation of a peaceful settlement. The paper criticized the U.S. attempts to prevent the Security Council from making a resolution to denounce the massacre of Hebron. It also deplored a statement attributed to President Clinton recently on the status of al-Quds [Jerusalem] as an insult for the Arab and Moslim people. The paper cited the importance of an international protection for the residents of the occupied lands before making any breakthrough in peace talks. [passage omitted]
