[Dahlan] The Security Committee is part of the negotiating Palestinian delegation, which is divided into Civilian Affairs and Security Committees. The Security Committee is responsible for many issues. There are many personal opinions on the concept of the Taba talks Security Committee. However, the Security Committee discusses several important topics in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The first issue is the crossings, the second is the borders of the Jericho area, the third is the settlements and the areas in the Gaza Strip. There is also the security of roads and communication lines, the Palestinian security movements, and the security of the movements of the Israeli settlers on Palestinian roads and the mechanism of coordinating this matter between us and the Israeli police. These are the most important issues that were mentioned in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]. [Abu-Sumayyah] It has been reported in the Israeli media that a coordination agreement has been reached between the Israeli and Palestinian security bodies. Can you tell us about that? [Dahlan] First of all, it is the Israeli side which always raises the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian coordination or rather the Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. This is a serious issue. They are well aware that it creates confusion among the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territory. So far, there are no issues agreed on between us and the Israelis. Even in the DOP, there is no agreement or substantive progress in security matters that I have already mentioned. Some Israeli papers have reported that progress has been made or a security coordination agreement reached between the Palestinian and Israeli security bodies. I would like to say that this is a sheer lie. There is no official or unofficial coordination between us and the Israeli security. We do not expect that in the near future there will be coordination on the concept of security coordination between us and the Israelis. However, there are measures that require coordination between us and the Israelis, matters related to the implementation of the DOP. For instance, the issue of the Palestinian police force, its tasks and duties, its measures, crossing into or out of Israeli areas, crossing into or out of the border crossing points. These are interconnected issues which have something to do with coordinating measures related to the police. They are also related to security measures but these are matters for the future. So far, the issue has not been discussed. This matter is discussed between us and the Israelis in the Taba negotiations and within the issue of crossings. How the Palestinians from the West Bank inhabitants can enter. This is one point. The second is how the inhabitants of Gaza and Jericho can enter. The recent clamor was created by the Israeli side and the Israeli media. This is being done in a systematic, carefully planned manner because they are perfectly aware of the seriousness of portraying the issue of Palestinian-Israeli security coordination at this stage as a fact. This is part of the psychological war launched by the Israelis to benefit from confusing us as a Palestinian side to the negotiations. To the Palestinian mind, the issue of security coordination or cooperation is very difficult to digest. Moreover, the question of acceptance and coordination between us and the Israelis does not exist. We cannot forget that we spent many years in jail. Our people suffered many years of occupation. But the Israelis raised this issue in a carefully thought out manner. They disseminated these false statements. A statement was issued in my name in one of the Israelis papers in which I was quoted as saying that there was security coordination between the Israeli and Palestinian security bodies. This was denied and the denial was circulated among the Palestinian centers to clarify the picture and avoid entering into the Israeli labyrinth which will hinder our progress in the negotiations. [Abu-Sumayyah] Speaking about the crossings issue, which is a basic security issue, what is the latest in this regard? [Dahlan] Discussion of the crossings issue is revolving in circles and is subject to various opinions. We hope a breakthrough will be realized in the crossings issue. The Israeli side wants to supervise the crossings from the administrative and security viewpoints. We also want administrative and security supervision. We would like to reach a compromise on this issue because this portrays the image of the Palestinian authority. We want the Palestinian citizen to know that a change has been effected in his life, that a Palestinian policeman is meeting him, that a Palestinian policeman is taking care of his administrative papers. We do not want the Palestinian citizens to face humiliation and oppression as has been the case in the past. At least we want coordination in all administrative matters that the Palestinians need on the crossing points in addition to some aspects of security measures, entry and departure as well as other issues that require coordination between us and the Israeli side. However, the Israeli side has so far been insisting on a comprehensive security and administrative supervision of the crossings. Our position is clear and instructions by the brother president ['Arafat] on this issue are very clear. I do not think that any Palestinian will accept less than we are presenting at the negotiations table. [Abu-Sumayyah] Last question. It has been reported recently that Israel links the question of releasing Palestinian detainees with the question of an amnesty by the Palestinians concerning collaborators with the Israeli authorities. What do you say to that? [Dahlan] This question is also connected with the security coordination which was reported in the Israeli papers. This issue prompted the Israeli side to disseminate a fabricated statement attributed to me on the coordination issue. At that time I dealt with the collaborators. We said that the families and children of collaborators are Palestinians and we will take care of them from the social and financial viewpoints and will treat them just like other Palestinians. However, the issue of collaborators has always been and will continue to be a very sensitive subject for us. We are still adhering to our stand that this issue provokes our people. We will revise the issue of the agents. Those who deserve to remain among the Palestinians will be welcomed and we will ask the Israeli side to solve the problems related to those who do not deserve that. Let them take them to their areas, in the same way the Netherlands treated such people. [Abu-Sumayyah] Thank you very much.
