[Begin de Greiff recording] Senator Kerry's opinions are not only false but also very offensive. I believe they not only offend me but the country as well. [end recording] The prosecutor has also said the government should clarify to the senator his serious errors of assessment. [Begin de Greiff recording] We have kept informed the government institutions that cooperate with us on this issue. The prosecutor general has been present at all those meetings; thus, there has been no secret meeting. [end recording] The prosecutor explained once again his position regarding the legalization of drugs and the negotiations with the alleged Cali Cartel drug lords. [Begin de Greiff recording] This started a long time before the alleged meetings, which, according to Senator Kerry, were held clandestinely; thus, this gentleman is totally mistaken, and I believe Colombia should protest his statements. [end recording] Prosecutor de Greiff sent a long document to Senator Kerry yesterday pointing out the conceptual and formal mistakes which, in his opinion, the senator made.
