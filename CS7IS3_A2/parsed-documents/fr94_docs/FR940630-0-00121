FR940630-0-00121 FR940630-0-00036 (ii) Award. (A) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based upon the lowest price, the contract shall be awarded to the qualified section 3 business concern with the lowest responsive quotation, if it is reasonable and no more than 10 percent higher than the quotation of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source. If no responsive quotation by a qualified section 3 business concern is within 10 percent of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source, the award shall be made to the source with the lowest quotation. (B) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based on factors other than price, a request for quotations shall be issued by developing the particulars of the solicitation, including a rating system for the assignment of points to evaluate the merits of each quotation. The solicitation shall identify all factors to be considered, including price or cost. The rating system shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available rating points to be set aside for the provision of preference for section 3 business concerns. The purchase order shall be awarded to the responsible firm whose quotation is the most advantageous, considering price and all other factors specified in the rating system. (2) Procurement by sealed bids (Invitations for Bids). Preference in the award of section 3 covered contracts that are awarded under a sealed bid (IFB) process may be provided as follows: (i) Bids shall be solicited from all businesses (section 3 business concerns, and non-section 3 business concerns). An award shall be made to the qualified section 3 business concern with the highest priority ranking and with the lowest responsive bid if that bid_ (A) is within the maximum total contract price established in the contracting party's budget for the specific project for which bids are being taken, and (B) is not more than ``X'' higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any responsible bidder. ``X'' is determined as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1x=lesser of: When the lowest responsive bid is less than $100,000 10% of that bid or $9,000. When the lowest responsive bid is: At least $100,000, but less than $200,000 9% of that bid, or $16,000. At least $200,000, but less than $300,000 8% of that bid, or $21,000. At least $300,000, but less than $400,000 7% of that bid, or $24,000. At least $400,000, but less than $500,000 6% of that bid, or $25,000. At least $500,000, but less than $1 million 5% of that bid, or $40,000. At least $1 million, but less than $2 million 4% of that bid, or $60,000. At least $2 million, but less than $4 million 3% of that bid, or $80,000. At least $4 million, but less than $7 million 2% of that bid, or $105,000. $7 million or more 11/2% of the lowest responsive bid, with no dollar limit. (ii) If no responsive bid by a section 3 business concern meets the requirements of paragraph (2)(i) of this section, the contract shall be awarded to a responsible bidder with the lowest responsive bid. (3) Procurement under the competitive proposals method of procurement (Request for Proposals (RFP)). (i) For contracts and subcontracts awarded under the competitive proposals method of procurement (24 CFR 85.36(d)(3)), a Request for Proposals (RFP) shall identify all evaluation factors (and their relative importance) to be used to rate proposals. (ii) One of the evaluation factors shall address both the preference for section 3 business concerns and the acceptability of the strategy for meeting the greatest extent feasible requirement (section 3 strategy), as disclosed in proposals submitted by all business concerns (section 3 and non-section 3 business concerns). This factor shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available points to be set aside for the evaluation of these two components. (iii) The component of this evaluation factor designed to address the preference for section 3 business concerns must establish a preference for these business concerns in the order of priority ranking as described in 24 CFR 135.36. (iv) With respect to the second component (the acceptability of the section 3 strategy), the RFP shall require the disclosure of the contractor's section 3 strategy to comply with the section 3 training and employment preference, or contracting preference, or both, if applicable. A determination of the contractor's responsibility will include the submission of an acceptable section 3 strategy. The contract award shall be made to the responsible firm (either section 3 or non-section 3 business concern) whose proposal is determined most advantageous, considering price and all other factors specified in the RFP.
