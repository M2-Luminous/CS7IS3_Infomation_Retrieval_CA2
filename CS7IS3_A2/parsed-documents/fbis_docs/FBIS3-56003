National Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, who took part in the discussions, said the session mainly centered around economic cooperation and U.S. assistance to Russian reform, including financing and closer contactes with the interantaional financial organisations. According to Lobov, Yeltsin spoke in detail about positive shifts and stressed that a slackening of pace is out of the question. Bill Clinton said the United States is set to render maximum support to Russian reform and said his country should extend more active support to Russia in the social sphere. Discussions are scheduled to resume on Friday morning after the tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will work towards "the historic agreement to make the world a safer place with fewer nuclear weapons". As Presdient Clinton put it on Thursday morning. Later today, Clinton will join President Yeltsin for private dinner in Novo-Ogarevo, the Russian president's dacha.
