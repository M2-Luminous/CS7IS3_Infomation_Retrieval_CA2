FR940513-0-00151 FR940513-0-00034 For catalogs not distributed to consumers for making purchases for personal use or consumption by individuals, the disclosures need not comply with the format provisions of ยง305.11(e)(1)(B), but must only be disclosed clearly and conspicuously. The Commission also agrees with OR DOE's recommendation that, in cases in which the same disclosure applies to entire categories of products in the catalog, it is only necessary for the required disclosure to be made once on each page on which such products appear. Accordingly, the labeling rules allow this accommodation. See ยง305.14(d)(1) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. The Rule also requires that, if manufacturers make operating cost claims in catalogs, they disclose, clearly and conspicuously, the assumptions (unit cost of electricity, usage period, purchase price, etc .) that were used. See ยง305.14(d)(2) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 7. Disclosures in Point-of-Sale Printed Materials In the NPR, ACEEE suggested that the required disclosures for residential purchasers be disclosed on point-of-sale materials as well as on packages. 156 The Commission proposed that, as one option for disclosures for lamps sold in bulk without individual packages, manufacturers be required to include the prescribed information in written materials in shipping cartons and retailers be required to disclose it at point of sale. 157 This proposal was based on EPCA, which authorizes the Commission to require disclosure, in written materials displayed or distributed at point of sale, of any information required on labels. 42 U.S.C. 6294(c)(4) (1988). In the ``Questions for Comment'' section of the NPR, the Commission solicited comment on the appropriateness of point-of-sale requirements. 158 156 58 FR at 60154. 157 Id. at 60155. 158 Id. at 60159. The comments were divided on whether the Commission should require disclosures in point-of-sale materials for general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps. ACEEE consistently recommended that the Commission require disclosure of annual operating and life-cycle cost information in point-of-sale materials. 159 Although initially neutral on this point, NEMA ultimately opposed mandatory disclosures at point of sale in favor of a requirement that manufacturers be required to disclose only the assumptions upon which any voluntary point-of-sale disclosures are based. 160 GE stated that, if the Commission wished to provide additional information explaining the meaning and use of the lumens-per-watt energy index disclosure, the method most suited for such disclosures is in point-of-sale materials. 161 LBL suggested that the Commission either prescribe the assumptions upon which operating cost disclosures are based (such as cost of electricity and hours of use) or, at least, require that manufacturers disclose whatever assumptions they use in point-of-sale materials. 162 Osram supported the disclosure of operating costs only at point of sale and recommended that the Commission prescribe specific cost and use assumptions for those disclosures. 163 Home Depot and SCS recommended that the Commission issue no requirements relating to point-of-sale disclosures, but that it allow such disclosures voluntarily. 164 159 ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3&hyph;4, (Tr.), 169, 188, 201, (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 1. ACEEE recommended charts disclosing several lumens-per-watt efficiencies cross-referenced to various operating costs based on different unit costs for electricity. LBL appeared to support this approach, but recommended disclosing different wattages in place of lumens per watt. LRC (Tr.), 188&hyph;189. 160 Initial neutrality: NEMA, G&hyph;3, 40&hyph;42, 47. Later opposition: NEMA (Tr.), 190&hyph;192, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 14, 26. 161 GE (Ans.), G&hyph;2, 1. 162 LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 1, 4. 163 Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2. 164 Home Depot, GG&hyph;5, 2 (Tr.), 196. The Commission has determined not to mandate particular disclosures at the point of sale (other than the disclosures on packaging). The Commission's requirements for disclosures on packages and in catalogs will provide purchasers of general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps with information sufficient to enable them to select the most energy efficient lamps to fill their lighting needs. Several comments suggested that the Commission also require disclosure of energy cost information, or at least specify the bases ( i.e. , the unit energy cost and usage patterns) on which any voluntarily made energy cost claims are calculated. The Commission declines to do so, for the same reasons the Commission determined not to require disclosure of energy cost information on packaging or to prescribe the assumptions on which voluntary energy cost information is provided. The Commission has concluded, however, that it is important that consumers be made aware of the assumptions on which any energy cost claims on packaging or in point-of-sale written materials are based. Therefore, the final labeling rules require that the assumptions (unit cost of electricity, purchase price, hours of use, patterns of use, etc .) on which any voluntary claims about energy operating cost are made be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in connection with such claims on packaging or in point-of-sale written materials. 165 See ยง305.11(a)(2) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 165 See Part IV.C.2.b, above.
