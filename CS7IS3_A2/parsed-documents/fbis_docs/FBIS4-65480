The council will be constituted by both active and retired military officers, diplomats, experts in international affairs, and university professors. The establishment of the Defense Council is envisioned in a bill that will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval. According to information our newspaper has received, the council's exclusive responsibility will be planning the ministry's strategy, not only in times of crisis, but also under normal circumstances. The council will also elaborate proposals on weapons issues. Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis is seeking the agreement of all political parties. To this end, he will soon invite to the ministry the various party representatives, who will present their views on the council's field of competence and the choice of council members. The same bill, which aims at giving a more civilian configuration to the ministry of defense, creates the position of secretary general, which will be occupied by a civilian. If the bill is approved by the Chamber of Deputies under its present form, it will be the second time that a secretariat general is established at the Ministry of Defense. The first time was in 1985, but the position did not function properly because the responsibilities of the secretary general were constantly clashing with those of the chief of the general staff. Finally, the bill envisions the upgrading of the role of the chief of the general staff, who would henceforth play the role of a "field marshal," since his responsibilities would include the coordination of the three branches of the service in wartime as well as in peacetime.
