Including, therefore, the rapprochement negotiated by the United States between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims. At least, this is what Serbian Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic claims. "We give the initiative credit, and we give the United States credit for coming up with it. However, we would like to obtain more information from them. Guarantees that the initiative is based on genuine peace, and on a just, balanced solution." "The absence of war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims, the fruit of U.S. mediation, already constitutes the beginning of a political solution between them. However, the third party, the Bosnian Serbs, were not consulted. That is the weak point of the initiative. The war involves all three factions, yet a solution is being sought through bilateral talks," Minister Jovanovic said. "There is nothing unnatural in this rapprochement," according to the minister, who arrived in Brussels yesterday. Belgrade is giving the initiative the benefit of the doubt. "If the intention behind it is serious, then hats off to it; but if it is merely a prelude to an alliance against the third party, then it will not work," he said. Jovanovic pointed out that peace has been on the horizon for a long time. The blueprint is enshrined in the preliminary agreements that were thrashed out by the European Union (EU) in negotiations in Geneva. "The third parties are calling for peace. They want a political solution. But which one? That remains up in the air, because the fate of the three communities in Bosnia does not lie entirely in their own hands. Foreign forces are becoming more and more in evidence in the Balkans," warned the minister. The Muslims, in particular, are bending to such influence, he said a little later. Who did he mean by "foreign forces"? The United States, among others, it would seem, who have taken the initiative away from the EU. "But also the Turks, Iranians, Saudi Arabia, all those who finance the Muslims and back them in pursuing the idea of a unified Bosnia," he said. The Bosnian Serbs have good intentions, emphasized Jovanovic. They are prepared to live in a loose union of three republics [losse Bosnische unie van drie republieken], but they cannot go any further than that. On top of this, they are demanding guarantees and clarity. For instance, what form will that confederation with Croatia take? Link Jovanovic replied negative when asked whether Bosnia might not become some form of link in the long term, the beginning of another new, loose, "Yugoslavia-type structure." "After everything that has happened, that is difficult to imagine," he said. Slovenians, Croats, and Muslims are afflicted with a kind of "anti-Yugoslavia" syndrome, stoked up by anti-Serbian propaganda from abroad. The problem lies with them, not Yugoslavia. The minister also sees progress being made in Croatia concerning the problem affecting a part of the Serbian minority that declared its own independent state, the "Serbian republic of Krajina." The Croatian Serbs are due to start negotiations in Zagreb on Tuesday. "I expect them to come up with a positive result," Jovanovic said. That solution will probably have to be approached in stages. "First of all, the hostilities must be brought to an end. Then, life must be allowed to return to normal again. Only when all that has been achieved can we proceed to the third, and most difficult, phase, i.e., embarking on political negotiations." The minister did not wish to speculate as to how the final outcome might look. "The result will have to be one achieved on the basis of a genuine consensus," he said. Does the question of the Albanian majority in the Serbian province of Kosovo not threaten to rear its ugly head as soon as the situation in Croatia and Bosnia has stabilized? "That is a pipe dream of those who like fishing in troubled waters," Jovanovic said. "Kosovo is a different problem, one which has nothing to do with the Yugoslav crisis. Anyone who seeks to create an artificial link between that crisis and Kosovo is merely seeking to blackmail Yugoslavia and Serbia," he argued. "Kosovo is a classic problem of a national minority striving for separatism. The problem has to be solved accordingly. A national minority has no right to its own state. Anyone who tolerates that is playing with fire. Because that would mean that the same principle could be applied in a number of other regions of Europe," he concluded.
