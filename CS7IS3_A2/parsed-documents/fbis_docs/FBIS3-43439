Andrew Trench has details: ANC Transkei media officer Nat Serache confirms the contents of a scathingly critical ANC report which reveals the organization in the homeland is in a mess. The report is of a visit to Transkei by ANC Deputy Secretary General Jacob in September and October 1993. The report reveals an ANC mired by organizational ineptitude, a lack of administration, and describes a leadership fraught with rival factions. The report warns that if the ANC's problems in Transkei are not sorted out, it could face a disaster in the elections. Serache also confirms that last month drastic action was taken to solve the problems. At the organization's regional congress all but one of the top officials were ousted by delegates. Serache says the new leaders are trying to pull the ANC back on track, but he concedes they have their work cut out for them.
