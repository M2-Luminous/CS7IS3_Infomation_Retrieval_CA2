Li Zhiqiang, director of the department, said the severe drought since last December has threatened 1.53 million ha of wheat fields and made spring seeding difficult for 2.53 million ha of farmland. And the situation is worsening, Li said. The director said there have been only two poor drizzles over the past three months, dropping a scant three to four mm of rain. In 1993, the province received 474 mm in precipitation, which is 12 percent less than in normal years, the director said. According to Li, the province's big reservoirs now contain 1.2 million cubic m of water, of which only half is actually available, while small reservoirs in the western area had dried up even before winter came. Even Baiyangdian, the biggest lake in North China, is now only 45 cm away from totally drying up, as it was before 1988, the director said. The director noted that the sustained drought has had a critical impact on the supply of underground water. He said the water table in northern and central Hebei has dropped one m from that of the same period last year. In a few places, it has dropped more than three m [meters]. Li said water shortage has always been a great adverse factor in economic development of the province. Some industrial projects have been made impossible, rich resources can not be developed, and the biological environment is worsening. Li said seven million people in the province are drinking high-fluorine water and two million people are suffering from fluorine poisoning. 600,000 people in the mountainous western area face water shortages. Li said the central and provincial governments are taking emergency measures to fight against the drought, which has caused more outcries for the diversion of Chang Jiang River water to North China.
