The officials said the report focuses on reorganization of 92 government-backed corporations and administrative reforms of local governments. The document did not name those corporations to be abolished or consolidated, they said. The officials said the report stressed the need for the government to push ahead with reform measures at both central and local administration levels to line up public support for tax reforms -- specifically a hike in the consumption tax rate which now stands at 3.0 percent. The panel laid down five principles for a thorough review of government-backed corporations within fiscal 1994 to map out a reorganization plan in the early part of fiscal 1995, the officials said. The principles call for corporations that have attained their goals to be abolished or scaled down and for those which are unproductive to be reorganized, they said. The report stopped short of proposing consolidation of six ministries and agencies, including the Construction, Transport and Agriculture Ministries and three agencies, saying simply that the government should take a positive step on the matter, the officials said. The report called for restructuring of local governments to reduce personnel and promote efficiency, they said.
