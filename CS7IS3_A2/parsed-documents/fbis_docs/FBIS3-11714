Iglesias met with Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia to discuss the matter. [Begin Iglesias recording] An established mechanism was implemented, but it seems that the delay caused some problems, as the fruit could have spoiled. But there were no serious problems at all, nor any violations of the mechanisms of the economic supplementation agreement. [end recording] Iglesias could not determine the specific problem, as there was no technical explanation. He was told that labels written in English had been the origin of the problem, and that Argentine officials rejected them as they must all be written in Spanish. [Begin Iglesias recording] Yes, this issue was discussed. The economic supplementation agreement provides norms for quality, quantity, and containers. But the quality of the fruit was not mentioned at all. [end recording] When asked if he could assure that this problem would not jeopardize the economic supplementation agreement, he said: [Begin Iglesias recording] On the contrary, it is working better than ever, and there is no major problem that could prevent it from being implemented. I think this mechanism shows that problems are solved within 48 hours, as has happened with other cases. Argentina is also concerned about the possible dumping of flour, a situation that is regarded as incorrect. It seems that some sectors are claiming that Argentina is distorting the economic supplementation agreement mechanism. I have asked Buenos Aires for more information. I do not think this position is correct. [end recording] Iglesias concluded by saying that this case of trucks loaded with fruit had been resolved, but that they would be on constant alert about the situation. Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, in turn, told the Argentine ambassador that the problems that fruit exporters were experiencing in Argentina could lead to possible actions that could hamper bilateral commercial development. Garcia met with Iglesias, with whom he discussed other major issues. [Begin Garcia recording] We also analyzed the need to review the economic supplementation agreement agreed upon by Chile and Argentina taking into account the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, agreements. This year all Mercosur member countries will have to maintain equal treatment of third countries, and this obviously could lead to changes in the bilateral agreements with Argentina. We have already agreed to begin talks so as to avoid surprises that the changes in reciprocities demanded by Mercosur could imply for our bilateral agreement. [end recording] As for the specific problems, Garcia said that Iglesias suggested that the quality standards required of Chilean exporters do not imply any discrimination, as these must also be observed by local producers and other foreign partners. Concerning the trucks loaded with fruit, Garcia told Iglesias that the problem was caused by the shortage of employees in Chilean customs, which compelled exporters to take their products to other zones. This entailed a delay of three days, which for economic reasons they could not tolerate. Garcia noted the need to prevent mutually harmful actions. [Begin Garcia recording] This hampers the full development of the trade agreement. Iglesias completely agreed that we had to avoid at any cost this type of situation, and act in keeping with our common decision. [end recording] Garcia concluded by saying that Iglesias was not fully aware of the incident, and promised to soon try to determine the causes.
