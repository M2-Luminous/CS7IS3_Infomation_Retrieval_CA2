Sources close to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and the top military commands told CLARIN there is "some surprise" over the official invitation made by the British Government to a minister who has not been installed yet. When Eduardo Frei is inaugurated in Chile in March, Perez Yoma, who is one of the future president's right-hand men, will replace current Defense Minister Patricio Rojas. The sources said it is unusual for a minister-designate to be officially invited by London. The sources also said that the extension of Perez Yoma's visit to London, which is a seven-day visit that ends on 2 February, "is somehow improper." In contrast to such an extensive visit, it should be recalled that the future Chilean minister was in Argentina for only a brief time, a protocol visit. Perez Yoma also held high-level meetings in London, including a meeting with British Secretary of State for Defense Malcolm Rifkind and top military officials. The sources added that Perez Yoma was also in Parliament, visited military units, and gave a lecture in Canning House that was attended by the main economic groups linked to arms production. The Defense Ministry sources took note of Perez Yoma's comments in public during his tour. Analysts close to Camilion detected that, in general, Perez Yoma gave "known points of view" on Chilean foreign policy and put emphasis on some economic aspects such as the Chilean desire to join NAFTA, the free trade agreement sponsored by the United States. Such concern by the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces over the Chilean minister-designate's visit reveals that the consequences of Chilean behavior during the 1982 Malvinas war and the differences over the border conflicts with Chile still prevail. The sources indicated, however, that the latest meetings with Chilean Foreign Minister Patricio Rojas within the framework of the joint declaration signed by Presidents Carlos Menem and Patricio Aylwin in 1990 contributed to strengthening relations between the two countries in the military field. The sources also linked Perez Yoma's long visit to England with the recent visit to the Malvinas by five Chilean congressmen. On their way to the Malvinas, the Chilean congressmen stopped in the Lago del Desierto region, which is under international arbitration as a result of a border conflict between Argentina and Chile.
