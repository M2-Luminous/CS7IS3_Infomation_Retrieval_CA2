We acknowledge that after the GATT's Uruguay Round we have achieved a certain progress, but it is not enough. Therefore, from now on we will redouble efforts in order to obtain other advantages with less subsidies and a freer and more clear-cut agricultural trade. And we are optimistic because we are now in a better position than when the Uruguay Round began." With these words Australian Bob McMullan, president of the Cairns Group, summed up what was accomplished at the 14th meeting, which closed on 20 May in Montevideo after two days of debates. Answering a battery of questions after he made the final declaration known, McMullan was able to explain future objectives: "We want free competition. The market does not matter as long as the principles of free and fair trade are respected. We are not attacking competition; we are defending it while pushing for a world without trade barriers." McMullan, who is minister of trade and administrative services for his country, flatly denied Australia obtained benefits from Europe while the GATT negotiations were being held, and he indicated that the Cairns Group will evaluate the types of dumping that some nations carry out. "We are not referees," he said, "but we will be ready to revise every type of unfair practice that is carried out in order to be able to fight it." The Canadian and Argentine representatives were obliged to speak due to the sale of Canadian wheat to Brazil that is an Argentine concern. The Canadian representative [not further identified] said: "The price of our wheat is the same as other market prices. We do not carry out unfair trade and there is nothing irregular or illegal in our procedures." Argentine Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola said: "The Cairns Group is not a referee that has to decide bilateral situations, and we have not come here to ask for explanations. What we have proposed is that from now on the group will study the dumping situations, and then it will fight them if it considers them unfair." Asked about this point, Uruguayan Agriculture and Fishing Minister Pedro Saravia stated that from now on, the Cairns Group must look into matters that could influence free trade in the future, such as the social aspects of labor and environmental topics. Regarding the group's functioning, it will continue its annual meetings, and it has been agreed that the next meeting of ministers will be held in the Philippines in May or June 1995, "although if circumstances demand it, we will meet before that date," McMullan said. It has been agreed that from now on some of the countries will have the responsibility of closely following some matters and they will draft reports to submit to the other countries. In this respect, Argentina will evaluate matters pertaining to dumping, Chile will do the same regarding world trade in fruit and vegetables, the Philippines will evaluate the fishing industry, and Australia will look into the matter of agricultural subsidies and try to evaluate them in precise terms.
