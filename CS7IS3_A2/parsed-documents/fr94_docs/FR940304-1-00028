FR940304-1-00028 FR940304-1-00007 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Canadair Limited: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;213&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 series airplanes, serial numbers 7003 through 7026 inclusive, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the loss of stall warning protection on the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, modify the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring, in accordance with Canadair Regional Jet Alert Service Bulletin A601R&hyph;34&hyph;028, Revision `A,' dated October 22, 1993. (b) Prior to further flight after accomplishment of the modification required by paragraph (a) of this AD, revise the Normal Procedures section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) by inserting the following into the AFM as facing page 04&hyph;20&hyph;13 <FAA> to advise the flight crew that a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must be accomplished as a ``Before Start'' item. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD into the AFM. ``Change step (4) within paragraph E, Before Start, to read as follows: (4) EFIS_Checked and Set Check that no annunciations are displayed on EFIS EFIS slip/skid indications_Normal Indications of a one-half (1/2) symbol width lateral deviation should be interpreted as an AHRS failure. Note One-half (1/2) symbol width displacement corresponds to approximately one-half displacement on a conventional inclinometer. EFIS_Set for Departure'' Note 1: Insertion of Canadair Regional Jet Airplane Flight Manual CSP A&hyph;012, Temporary Revision RJ/26, dated October 21, 1993, in the Normal Procedures section of the AFM is an acceptable method of compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this AD. (c) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the stall protection computer (SPC), in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York ACO, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on February 28, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
