Among the problems is the return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield on Okinawa as a result of scaling down the size of U.S. Forces in Japan. This was disclosed by several government sources. The accord was reached because the United States has indicated its positive position on resolving problems. It was also disclosed that the United States has indicated its intention to return the 190-acre Yomitan auxiliary airfield in particular. If the working group should make any progress in its consultations, it is most likely that some of the U.S. bases will be returned in the near future. This is a hope that the residents of Okinawa Prefecture have cherished for a long time. The pending issues related to U.S. military bases on Okinawa are: 1) return of the Naha naval port; 2) return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield; 3) suspension of live-firing exercises across Prefectural Highway Route 104. Taking into account the fact that the Okinawa residents have strong hope for settling the above-mentioned three problems, the Japanese Government has repeatedly requested the United States to resolve them on various occasions, such as the Japan-U.S. defense chiefs talks. The United States has indicated its understanding in principle. However, for various reasons, no accord has been reached. For example, the United States is concerned that the accord may affect its military training. However, officials concerned from the diplomatic and defense authorities of both Japan and the United States met recently to talk about measures for settling these problems. As a result, they unanimously reached the decision that the Yomitan auxiliary airfield may be returned to Japan. And they agreed in principle to form a working group to work out concrete measures to settle these issues in the future. The formation of this working group is scheduled to be announced as an official agreement as early as by the end of May. The group is expected to be composed of Japanese officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency and also American officials from the U.S. Embassy in Japan and the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan. With the purpose of eventually returning the Yomitan auxiliary airfield, the working group will study specific issues that the United States has requested. For example, the U.S. communication facilities should be maintained, and another site for parachuting exercises should be secured to replace the original airfield. Moreover, it was decided that the group will also study measures to have the Naha naval port returned and live-firing exercises across Prefectural Highway Route 104 suspended. Thus, following the return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield, there is a possibility that the other two pending issues may be settled in the future.
