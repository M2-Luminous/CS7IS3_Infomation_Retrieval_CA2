During a recess, President Leonid Kravchuk and government members toured the Kremenchug Association for Production of Trucks. Having viewed the models on display -- which included heavy tractors, new models of small and medium-sized cars, and microbuses -- Leonid Kravchuk answered questions from Ukrainian journalists: [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] These trucks represent a technological priority for Ukraine. Is there any hope that we will drive this beautiful vehicle into the European market? [Kravchuk] There are a lot of economic problems right now. There are still a lot of cry babies in Ukraine. However, there are people who, in difficult conditions -- I do not want to say that it is easy for them -- find ways to resolve such problems, which could not be found even in the time that is now being regretted by many. Here we have been shown model cars. If one wants, one will find ways to resolve the most difficult problems at the most difficult times. If one does not want, one will nod at somebody else. One can nod at the government, the president, a manager, and the administration -- there are many to nod at. However, this will not advance matters. Therefore, we are discussing a very important question at the Cabinet of Ministers today -- a program for restructuring industry. Without this, there will be no market, no development of our industry. We are to determine our goals, and what we have to help attain these goals -- resources, people, technologies, raw materials, etc., etc. If we implement this restructuring according to market principles or some other... [Kravchuk pauses] Today, it is clearly determined that this should be only the market. Of course, there should be state control over the transition to [passage indistinct]. Market mechanisms work for everyone. A plant, its manager, and its administration work under market conditions; find contracts with foreign and domestic firms; work for Ukraine, for the realization of production both in Ukraine and abroad. I just want... [pauses] We have just seen, and invited you so that you can say to the people: Good people, stop crying and look for ways out of these problems. True, these problems are not the same in every branch; they are different. However, there are different ways of resolving them. We appeal; we simply believe that there is no other path for Ukraine -- one must look for ways out of our problems. [passage omitted]
