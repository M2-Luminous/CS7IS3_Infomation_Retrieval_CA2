The 1994 budget bill is the largest in Panama's fiscal history, and it is the last bill to be presented by President Guillermo Endara's administration. Adhering to the constitutional principle and mandate of having a balanced budget, the consolidated general budget amounts to 3.9034 billion balboas in both revenues and expenditures. Contrary to what occurred with the 1993 budget, the assembly managed to approve the 1994 budget before ending the current period of sessions, which will end today in a formal ceremony headed by Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino. The legislators discussed the bill's acceptability in the final debates. Legislators Gabriel Arosemena of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] and Gerardo Gonzalez of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] were the budget bill's staunchest opponents. Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, said the 1994 budget was based on an agreement with the legislative branch, adding that this helped expedite its approval. Cardenas stressed that state budgets are never large enough to cover all of the needs of each and every sector. In general terms, the 1994 budget has two sections: 1) a financial section, which gives figures for estimated income and spending targets for the different government offices; and 2) a rules section, which outlines those procedures that will regulate the operational aspect of the budget cycle. According to the budget, the central government has operational expenses amounting to 1.5933 billion balboas and total investments worth some 843.1 million. The central government's current income is estimated at 1.4158 billion balboas, while its capital income is estimated at 512.8 million balboas. Of the 512.8 million balboas in 1994 estimated capital income, some 324.3 million will come from loans from international credit organizations. Another 84.6 million balboas will come from the sale of state properties, the Bayano Cement Co., and buildings in the Colon Free Zone. The budget assigns 843.1 million balboas to investments. In this area, those sectors that will benefit most are education with 48.5 million balboas, health with 96.1 million, and housing with 61.8 million. In terms of debt service, the budget includes 631.8 million balboas to be used to pay both foreign and domestic creditors. The budget includes 348.3 million balboas for foreign debt payments, 283.5 million to cancel the domestic debt, 347.7 million for interest payments, and 284.1 million for amortization.
