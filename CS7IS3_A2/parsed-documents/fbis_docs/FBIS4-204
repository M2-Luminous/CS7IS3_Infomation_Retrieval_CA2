It is the CDA, Angolan Democratic Confederation. The party, which is still making arrangements for registration with the Supreme Tribunal, has said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] cannot be the only political parties in the country. Gaspar Neto, chairman of the CDA's constituent commission, felt indignant when he said: [Begin Neto recording] The Angolan problem will not be resolved by only those two political forces. [end recording] Gaspar Neto is a man of few words but feels distressed with the crisis that has brought the country to its knees. He did not announce an immediate solution to the country's problems, but said nobody should be in power for ever. [Begin Neto recording] Parties cannot aspire to power the moment they come into being. We will learn from Angolan and international experiences. At the right moment we will disclose to Angola and the world the CDA's plans to gain power. [end recording]
