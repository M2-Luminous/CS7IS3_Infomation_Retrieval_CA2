In the course of the preelection campaign we will not deceive voters with fairy tales about "democratic capitalism," the myths about miracles of a market economy, radical reforms, or the wonder-working possibilities offered by "doctrines of European social-democracy" and triumphant entry into Europe through Romania. All this is beyond the field of real possibilities available in present-day Moldova, it is no more than just piquant imagination or simply political smoke and mirrors. We appeal to the historical memory, historical experience, and historical wisdom of the people of Moldova who were placed by hostile political forces in a very difficult socioeconomic position, in a situation calling for selection of the forms and content of the future social order. Society can function effectively only on a basis of common values. Their loss, eradication, or weakening always signals the downfall of statehood, destruction of society and its disintegration. That is why representatives of our bloc, having acquired the trust of voters, shall do everything possible in order to realize the main, triune task. First Preserve and develop historically formed common values of our society--peace and harmony among nationalities, territorial integrity, fraternal cooperation between people of various nationalities, national, public ownership of land and natural resources, principal branches of industry and agricultural production, and wisely centralized management of the national economic complex, as well as mutual cooperation with all fraternal republics of the former USSR. The Moldovan language is the most important common value and everything possible must be done for its voluntary assimilation by all citizens of Moldova. Bilingualism, particularly in the cities, with widespread utilization of the Russian language, which is spoken by virtually all persons living in Moldova, is no less of a common value. The worker, the person engaged in socially useful labor in spheres of material and spiritual production and the very sphere of labor itself definitely remain a common value. Thoughtless and hasty reforms in that sphere on the basis of neocapitalist ideas would be a crime. The history of Moldova, including its Soviet period, which is characterized by tumultuous historically unprecedented tempos of socioeconomic development and creation of industrial and agricultural complexes, development of its science, and educational and public health systems as well as culture, is and will continue to be an undiminished common value. Second Restore and develop those common values that were forfeited in an unsubstantiated manner and primarily ones such as full universal employment with no unemployment which is so demeaning to human dignity, which now has not been known by entire generations of workers, guaranteed employment for all graduates of schools, trade schools, and secondary and higher educational establishments, mandatory and effective social protection of pensioners, children, young people, families with many children, and invalids, free education and medical services, legal protection, a state program of housing construction and provision of housing, representation of all social groups in legislative organs at all levels, public control of executive power, and election of judges in people's courts and people's assessors. It is necessary to restore the youth policy which existed for many years, a system of public organizations for children and youth supported by the state and labor collectives, which posses exceptional historical experience in public education of the growing generation. Unfortunately common values that were lost in many aspects include the most important one--that of equal rights. All citizens of the republic must enjoy an equal status in all vitally important situations, in all spheres of life regulated by law. Representatives of our future bloc do not want restoration of features inherent in nomenclature totalitarianism. They will strive only for the restoration of social justice and will not permit rejection of a single one of the social achievements accumulated by workers over the years of struggle for their rights. Third Promote in every possible way the creation of new common values affecting long-range development of society as well as consolidation of traditional and evolving forms of social interaction. This consists of a mixed economy with state control of its commanding summits in the implementation and interaction of state, municipal, collective, shareholder, leasing, private and other forms of ownership; their protection against manipulation by antisocial forces and the bureaucracy; free privatization of housing; creation of an ecologically comfortable living and production environment; a common search for a new meaning of life; ideological and political variety; priority of individual freedom without the nationalization of the spirit and a dictatorship of the majority; search for new forms of state building and collective responsibility for the future; creation of a social base for new forms of domestic socially significant entrepreneurship; establishment of a new level of economic and geopolitical consciousness of the people making the process of sovereignization of Moldova irreversible. We invite all those who support the established political task to unify their efforts under a slogan expressing the quintessential basis of contemporary social values of our society: "Civil harmony, national equality, social justice."
