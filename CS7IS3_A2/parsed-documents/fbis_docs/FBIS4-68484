Cherkesov to republic assembly of representatives of Balkar society on 23 March 1994: "Unity of the Republic, Interethnic Accord, and Creative Labor Are the Foundation of the Renewal and Development of the Balkar People"] [Text] Esteemed Comrades! Literally two weeks have passed from that moment when, with the participation of representatives of the regions, we marked a sorrowful date in our republic--the 50th anniversary of the violent expulsion of the Balkar people. A lot was said about this barbarous action and its consequences at meetings, rallies, reports, and speeches, and in the mass media. Recalling the past, thinking about the fate of their much-suffering people, about their present and future, and seeing the faces that know hard times so well, the representatives spoke with special warmth, frequently with tears in their eyes, about what helped them to endure, survive, and overcome all the difficulties and adversities, about the friendship and fraternity of the people, and about the need to strengthen unity and affirm an atmosphere of mutual understanding, trust, and benevolence. In fact, there was a detailed analysis in those days of the half-century path of the Balkar people, lessons were drawn from history, losses, successes and achievements and existing problems were shown, and the work being done for their rehabilitation was elaborated in detail. The participants in the mournful measures, the Balkar population and residents of the republic, accepted with great satisfaction the appeal of the edict of President of the Russian Federation Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and the edict of President of Kabardino-Balkaria Valeriy Mukhamedovich Kokov directed at restoring historical justice and eliminating the consequences of the criminal deportation. The apology given to the Balkar people by the head of the Russian state for the arbitrariness and lawlessness committed against them made a great impression on everyone. Thus, pressing problems are being resolved logically, and questions that disturb the people are being removed one by one. A significant step has been taken toward meeting the expectations of the people, and good possibilities have been opened up for their revival and development. It would seem that everything is moving along normally and that there is no reason for anxiety. Nevertheless we are compelled today, putting aside important matters, to meet here together in order to look into the situation that is developing and discuss a number of extremely serious questions that are truly fateful for our people. You know that the mass media recently carried speeches and statements by O.Y. Beppayev, acting chairman of the National Council of the Balkar people, that flabbergasted and discouraged the residents of the republic and created tension and alarm. You read these pearls, and you are amazed. It simply cannot be believed that they came from a military person who occupied rather high posts in the army, who has seen hatred, malice, blood, tears, and death, and who knows the price of rash, impulsive words and actions. It is offensive and bitter that such views and approaches are professed by a person of whom all of us were proud, whom we so warmly received in the republic, and whom we respected precisely for his dedication to the ideas of peace, friendship, and harmony. But just what did happen? What is the reason for the metamorphosis that occurred? This can only be guessed. Well, in the meantime we must state with regret that Beppayev's utterances exude a peremptoriness, unsubstantiation, boundless ambition, and irresponsibility. These revelations, if they can be called such, have one purpose--to undermine trust in the authority structures, inflame unhealthy passions, and destabilize the situation. I am confident that nothing is likely to result from this. However, let us analyze everything without haste and in an orderly manner. Some members of the National Council frequently like to present themselves as the only spokesmen of the interests of the Balkar people and their genuine supporters and benefactors. In addition, continuous attempts are made to confuse the issue, to convince the uninitiated that the state organs are idle and sit with their hands folded, but they do not sleep for many nights and are working to the limit of their strength. In this connection I consider it necessary to inform you once more how the work on rehabilitation is proceeding, what has already been done, and what remains to be done. I want to emphasize especially that since the very first days the law of the Russian Federation was published on this question, all the difficult problems associated with its implementation have been consistently at the center of daily attention of the president and the government. Believe me, nothing is done that simply. Each step, every item in one or another adopted document requires a lot of strength, nerves, and time. Of course, no one thinks about this. It is impossible not to talk about the fact that on all questions of rehabilitation the Balkar people are moving ahead of all repressed people. And this is the great service performed by V.M. Kokov. He displays unusual stability and persistence, and uses all his influence and authority to resolve the indicated problems. Thank you for this, Valeriy Mukhamedovich! One of the key directions of the activity of the government for rehabilitation of the Balkar people is work to overcome the socioeconomic backwardness of the mountain population centers and economies and the creation of the necessary conditions for their normal development. With this aim, at the initiative of the Cabinet of Ministers of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic], the Government of the Russian Federation adopted a directive on 6 August 1991 outlining a complex of measures to expand housing and sociocultural construction and strengthen the material-technical base of the agrarian sector. I do not want to tire you with figures and facts, especially since we have written and talked about this more than once. Nevertheless, some of them should be cited. To implement the program developed for 1991, 10.2 million rubles [R] were allocated, for 1992--R199 million. The question arises: Where did this money go specifically? I reply. For the construction of a club in the village of Babugent, the reconstruction of a children's sports school in the village of Kendelen, a kindergarten, a boiler house, and a sewage treatment plant in the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, gas installation and the development of projects for the supply of gas to the settlements of Kendelen, Bylym, Zhankhoteko, and Verkhnyaya Zhemtala. Owing to those resources, construction of housing was also conducted in the village of Khasanya, the village of Verkhnyaya Zhemtala, an out-patient clinic in the village of Gerpegezh, a hospital and a kindergarten in the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, and a gas supply network and roads for kolkhozes and sovkhozes. More than R1.5 million in appropriations was allocated from the budget of the Russian Federation last year to finance programs for the development of mountainous population centers and socioeconomic support of the Balkar people. The resources in question were directed at strengthening the material-technical base of facilities in public education, health services, and cultural, municipal, and housing construction. If anyone is interested, it is also possible to give specific addresses, but such a listing will take a lot of time. I will say only that some of these resources went to the creation of the feature film "Journey to the Edge of Life," which recounts the bitter years of banishment of the Balkar people, the "Book of Recollections," the preparation of a Balkar encyclopedia, the construction of mosques in the settlements of Bylym, Khasanya, and Babugent, and memorials to the victims of genocide and those who died in wars. In the first quarter of 1994, R820 million was received to pay off credit indebtedness for the past year on construction projects in the mountainous population centers. These resources were earmarked for the construction of hospitals and clubs in the village of Khasanya, a sports complex in the village of Kendelen, the acquisition of mill equipment and a bakery in the village of Kich-malka, a relay station in the village of Khushto-Syrt, a fruit storage facility in Yanikoy, and the reconstruction of the Kashkhatau cannery. If we are talking about the outlook, according to the Decree of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation "On Socioeconomic Support of the Balkar People," there are plans for the erection of a large number of installations of production and sociocultural significance. For these purposes it is planned to construct a Kashkhatau brick plant, expand enterprises of the Elbrusstroy building industry combine, the marshalling yard in the village of Babugent, the lime shop and red lead shop in the village of Khabaz, a number of shops for the output of small wall blocks, untreated tile, and joiners' articles. Special attention is being given to ensure the employment of the able-bodied population and the creation of additional jobs. It is planned to build a plant for the production of consumer commodities in the village of Kendelen, folk art enterprises in Kashkhatau, Kendelen, Bezengi, Khabaz, and Khushto-Syrt. It is proposed to start development of mining of mineral deposits--bentonite, hot springs, and gold. It is planned to restore the settlements of Guba-santy, Ozen, Glashevo, Uskhur, Chelmas, Kyzgen, and others. Social rehabilitation has exceptionally important significance in the complex of measures for restoration of justice. Serious work has also been done on this area. Pensions from 1 March 1991 have been recalculated for all who went through the tragedy of the forced expulsion. In fixing pensions for citizens who were subjected to repression, the time they spent in special settlements (places of exile) is tripled. An increase has also been implemented in the scale of pensions for age for each year of work, taking into account periods stipulated in the Law of the RSFSR "On State Pensions in the RSFSR." There is also progress in cultural rehabilitation. At present two Balkar professional state artistic collectives are operating in the republic: the Dramatic Theater imeni Kaysyn Kuliyev and the folklore-ethnographic ensemble Balkaria. The mastery of these collectives is growing from year to year. They make us happy, give us true esthetic pleasure, and have gained popularity and love and recognition not only in Kabardino-Balkaria but also far beyond its borders. A Balkar theatrical studio has been opened in the North Caucasus Institute of Arts to train artistic personnel. Children desiring to learn the art of the national dance have the opportunity to visit the studio while the ensemble Balkaria is there. All told, about 400 persons of the Balkar nationality are studying in training institutions of culture in the Kabardino-Balkar Republic. Music schools are operating in the settlement of Kashkhatau, the villages of Babugent, Verkhnyaya Balkaria, Kendelen, and Yanikoy. Measures are also being taken to satisfy the requests of the Balkar population for press products. The republic newspaper ZAMAN and the journals MINGI-TAU and NYUR are now being published here. Pages in the Balkar language are issued periodically in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH and in the city and rayon newspapers GORNYATSKAYA SLAVA, GOLOS CHEGEMA, and TRUDOVAYA SLAVA. The total circulation of books published in the Balkar language in 1993 was about 60,000 copies. The proportion of these publications in the republic according to titles today is 32 percent, and in volume, 28 percent. The quality of programs of television and radio broadcasting in the Balkar language has improved and the number of hours increased. A powerful impetus is given to all this work by the Edict of President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin "On Measures for Rehabilitation of the Balkar People and State Support for Their Revival and Development." This document obligates the appropriate organs in the near future to adopt a complex of additional measures for the political, social, and spiritual revival of the Balkar people. It addresses the problems and return to the motherland of our countrymen from Central Asia and Kazakhstan, grants persons from among repressed peoples new benefits in pension support, and allocates resources for a lump-sum allowance to persons of Balkar nationality who were subjected to illegal resettlement and their families, including children who were born in special settlement places. Incidentally, this question is being examined in the Ministry of Finance of Russia, and we hope that it will be decided favorably. As for the R1 billion coming from the budget of the Russian Federation for these purposes, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic authorized the Ministry of Social Protection of the Population in a month's time to pay out a lump-sum allowance of R500,000 each to rehabilitated persons of Balkar nationality over 80 years of age, and also to participants in the Great Patriotic War, regardless of age. The edict of President of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic V.M. Kokov of 8 March 1994 is truly historic. Its great significance is determined by the fact that this document, if it is supported by our parliament, will perhaps resolve the most severe problems that have been the subject of speculation for a long time. It addresses the renaming of Sovetskiy Rayon to Cherkesskiy Rayon, the restoration of Elbrusskiy Rayon, and the creation of a bicameral parliament, one of whose chambers would be formed on a parity basis. We are convinced that the implementation of this edict will not encroach on anyone's interests and rights and that it will not harm anyone. As V.M. Kokov emphasized at a recent news conference, it is dictated by the aspirations to put an end to confrontation, to cut the ground from under all kinds of extremists, and to ensure peace and accord in our republic. As we see, a lot is being done to restore justice. I will say more: A unique opportunity exists at present for genuine revival and development of the Balkar people. It must be taken advantage of. Peace-loving and kind by nature, they are interested in civic peace, stability, and tranquility in the republic, and in creative labor. However, judging by some publications, this does not please individual figures. They need discord, intrigues, rallies, and congresses in order to remain afloat and be visible. How else can one explain the harsh and deliberately confrontational speeches of S.U. Beppayev. Is it really not blasphemous to call the mournful rally near the railroad station square and the meeting of the public "a shameful spectacle" and "a stagnant party aktiv." On what grounds does the general declare that he is supported by almost all the Balkar people? Who empowered him to speak in their behalf, who gave him the right to try to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the leaders of the republic. It is rather paradoxical that a person who has lived for just a short time in Kabardino-Balkaria allows himself to make such statements. Indeed, it will become known to the general that the peoples of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, including the Balkar people, voted for the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and voted rather energetically for the election of the president and the prime minister of the republic to the Federal Assembly. This means that the Balkar people trust the leadership of the republic, approve and support its program of actions, and share its position and views on fundamental questions. Esteemed Comrades! Today the leaders of rayons, cities, villages, and settlements, deputies, members of the government, the scientific and artistic intelligentsia, in other words the pick of the nation, have assembled in this hall. We are the sons and daughters of our long-suffering Balkar people. And to us, of course, its fate is not a matter of indifference. If this is so, we cannot today pretend that nothing is happening, remain silent, and live according to the principle "it is no concern of mine," or "we will see what will come out of this." To our great regret, some of our comrades, people who work in responsible posts, are not showing themselves to be fighters, they are passive, they temporize, they want to be good for everyone. This unquestionably does not become them. The writers, poets, artists, painters, and scientists have not made their weighty utterances yet. We must put the question today in a tough way--it is time to take a position and to find in yourself the courage to talk about this frankly. You cannot sit immorally on two chairs. After all, we are not talking about something petty and personal. We are talking about reputation, honor, dignity, about destiny, specifically about the fate of the people. This is the question: Either they will follow the path of peace, accord, creativity, cooperation, and progress, or they will be doomed to new suffering and deprivation. Is it really not clear to us that hotheads and figures who are inclined to be extremists have an excessive desire to destroy that which was created over many decades and centuries, that they want to reduce to naught the tangible results achieved in recent years through joint efforts in the rehabilitation and creation of pleasant conditions for the socioeconomic and cultural development of the Balkar people? Is it really possible to look at all of this calmly? Is it really permissible to remain silent and, what is more, to assent to it? No, we must, we are bound to give a decisive rebuff to those (and it is a small group of people) who are pushing the people to the abyss, those who in their unseemly affairs are trying to hide behind their name. Our duty is to explain to the people, especially to the youth, who is who, who is trying to do what, and to what the aggressive speeches, vanity, and excessive ambition of individual politicians may lead. We have to do everything to ensure that people believe us and follow us, not those who are excessively suspicious, offended, woolgathering, and irresponsible leaders--impostors. There is no need to talk about what difficult times our country is experiencing now. And, alas, it seems there is no ray of hope. This year also promises us little. It is already becoming clearer and clearer to a large number of both politicians and ordinary citizens that confrontation, opposition, scandals, and fighting are ruinous, and that they threaten the existence of the state itself. The only salvation is to strengthen legality and law and order. This truth is urgent in an even greater degree for our country. We can no longer in any way spend precious time, forces, and energy on explaining relations and on fruitless discussions and arguments. It is necessary for all of us now to work on the economy. How to stop the decrease in standard of living of the population and the reduction in production, how to achieve the stable operation of enterprises of all forms of ownership, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and individual farms, what must be done so that people have jobs and receive wages on time, so that they can walk the streets without fear, teach and rear their children in peace, and look to tomorrow without fear--this is what we have to think about, it is toward this that the efforts of state organs and public associations, and all of us together, should be directed. Only together will we be able to resolve these problems. No one will be able to pull out of the crisis, out of the poverty and need, by acting alone. This really is what the experience of the republics of the former USSR, now sovereign states, and the sad fate of even such giants as Ukraine tells us. We have outlined great plans, including on the development of mountainous population centers, mountain farms, and full rehabilitation of the Balkar people. We are fully resolved to bring this work to its logical conclusion. Let no one hinder us. The majority of the Balkar people always was and is for the integrity of the republic. Separatist slogans and appeals are foreign to it. The people associate their present and future, their dreams and hopes, their successes and achievements with their own united and indivisible Kabardino-Balkaria, with friendship and fraternity with Kabardin, Russian, and other peoples who live in the republic. They realize deeply that the unity of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, interethnic accord, and creative labor are the basis and indispensable condition for revival, development, and prosperity. No one will be able to deceive the Balkar people, confuse them, or force them to change the traditions and precepts of their forefathers. I thank you for your attention.
