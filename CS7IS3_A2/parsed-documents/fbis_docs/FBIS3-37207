The 30-minute conversation of the two ministers centered around the Partnership for Peace programme. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said on Monday, the Russian Defence Ministry fully supports the programme, but views differ on how the programme should be implemented, with each country insisting on its own viewpoint. Pavel Grachev told the British secretary of state that an instrument should be worked out for joining the programme of Partnership for Peace. An intermediate plan is needed for this, under which European countries would join political alliances by region or bilaterally with the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe playing the dominant role.
