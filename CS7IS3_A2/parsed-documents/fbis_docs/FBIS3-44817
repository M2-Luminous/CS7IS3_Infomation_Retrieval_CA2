Comrade Wang Qun presided over the forum. Qian Fenyong and Zhang Zuocai attended the forum. Responsible persons of democratic parties and of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and nonparty personages talked and aired their views freely on the policy decisions mentioned in the report on the main subject to be discussed at the forthcoming eighth plenary session of the fifth regional party committee. In a harmonious atmosphere, Comrade Wang Qun and the participants jointly discussed the issues of common concern. He said in his speech: United front work is one of the magic weapons of our party. We should develop it in a better manner. This is a strategic issue, not a technical one. We must promote the political advantage of multiparty cooperation, the wisdom of various democratic parties and the information advantage, pool the wisdom and efforts of all, work with one heart and one mind and successfully carry out the work of the autonomous region. In his summing-up speech, Comrade Wang Qun noted: Next year is a crucial year. The implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee has indicated that our country has entered a new stage in carrying out the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. After 15 years of reform and opening up our region, like other places in the country, it has achieved tremendous achievements in all fields of work. The 15 years of practice has proven that reform and opening up is our sole correct choice. In the coming year, we must try it and go ahead daringly and expand the degree of reform. It is not realistic to stop halfway or retreat or slow down our pace in reform. The only thing we should do is to unswervingly accelerate reform and development and to rapidly and thoroughly change the planned economic system into the socialist market economic system. This is a road of development and a bright one, representing the fundamental interests of the people of various nationalities. We have conditions and certainty of doing our work well. But we should also recognize the problems and difficulties. Because reform in the banking, financial, taxation, pricing and foreign trade aspects will inevitably involve the adjustment of interests in various aspects and some unfair distribution methods formed in the past. Perhaps, it may also arouse ideological problems of one kind or another and some related issues concerning the reform strength. Therefore, we hope that comrades of various democratic parties will make common efforts, do a good job in propaganda and guidance, use the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee to unify the thinking of people of various nationalities and various democratic parties, keep eyes on long-term interests, the interests of the whole and the fundamental interests, properly handle the relations of reform, development and stability and do a good job in ideological work and promoting unity. Wang Qun pointed out: Opposing corruption, promoting honesty and accelerating reform should be united. If we fail to do a good job in fighting corruption and promoting honesty, reform and opening up will be unable to successfully carry out. In addition to striving for achieving expected results in the anticorruption struggle, we should also make long-term and unremitting efforts to grasp this work. In the complicated anticorruption struggle, we must be soberly minded, solve problems according to their merits, seek truth from facts and grasp this work in a down-to-earth manner. It is hoped that all democratic parties will give help and supervision to this work. Comrade Wang Qun also called for efforts to fully absorb the opinions of the people and make revisions on the report concerning the main subject to be discussed at the forthcoming eighth plenary session of the fifth regional party committee. At the same time, the problems on the purchase of cars, subjectivism, overlapping construction reflected by the participants at the forum should be made known in the form of issuing bulletins so that they can be rapidly solved. Wang Chongwen, Chen Jie and Xu Bonian, vice chairmen of the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also attended the forum.
