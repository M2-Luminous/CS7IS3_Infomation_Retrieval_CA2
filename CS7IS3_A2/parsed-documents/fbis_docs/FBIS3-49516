Our editor Jana Zemanova is at Hrzan Palace. [Zemanova] The meeting behind closed doors between the Czech and Slovak Prime Ministers Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar is drawing to an end in Hrzan Palace. It is a part of today's series of bilateral talks on security and further cooperation between Visegrad countries at prime ministerial level. During the previous meeting between Czech Prime Minister Klaus and his Polish counterpart Waldemar Pawlak, the two politicians explained to each other a certain tension which was generated by Prague's individualist attitude to the acceptance of the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan. This is how Klaus described this situation: [Begin Klaus recording] I think that relations are not as tense as it would appear from some media headlines. We have a whole number of projects we would like to execute together. These projects should be directed at practical forms of Czech-Polish contacts and cooperation. I think that our views on this point were completely identical. [end recording] [Zemanova] What is important is that the two prime ministers jointly emphasized the willingness to continue to cooperate and to meet for further talks as soon as possible. According to Pawlak, economic cooperation will have priority in future relations between the Czech Republic and Poland. After all, this can be documented by the presence at the talks of Czech Economics Minister Karel Dyba.
