Following those of his colleague Luchin, although unlike him not resorting to a hunger strike, Zorkin's rights as a constitutional judge were restored. The decision was made at a closed meeting of the judges by seven votes to three. Thus the Constitutional Court, which under the well-known presidential edicts was, as it were, put into suspended animation at least until the new constitution came into force, has woken up like a long-dormant volcano. Its first decision was an emphatic reminder of the existence in the Russian state of another pole of political opinion, which was merely temporarily pushed into the background by the elections to the Federal Assembly and their rather surprising results. In the fall, after Boris Yeltsin issued Edict No. 1400, the Constitutional Court was possibly too hasty in taking the view that this edict was to be categorically rejected as anticonstitutional. This in turn played a part in escalating the confrontation between the branches of power, and probably to a certain extent provoked the White House into attempting to resolve the conflict by force. During this period a draft document terminating the Constitutional Court judges' powers in one form or another was discussed in presidential circles. However, having given preference to democratic elections and to putting the constitutional draft to a referendum rather than introducing temporary direct presidential rule, Yeltsin was unable within the framework of this logic to contemplate the abolition of the Constitutional Court in addition to the elimination of Soviet power. For their part the judges made a compromise, effectively declaring their decision on Edict No. 1400 erroneous and, like wise chess players, offering the figure of ex-Chairman Zorkin "as a sacrifice." As a result of this gambit the Constitutional Court judges gained not only a necessary breathing space but also very strong positions regarding the new constitution. Under it the Constitutional Court, in particular, decides cases concerning whether both federal laws passed by the Federal Assembly and normative presidential edicts and government decrees conform to the Constitution, and also interprets the Constitution. It follows from the Constitution's transitional provisions that all 13 Constitutional Court judges, elected under the old procedure for protecting the old constitution, in their former capacity and without any losses "move" with their lifelong powers to a new "constitutional field" (to use the ex-chairman's favorite expression). Another six judges, who must be appointed by the Federation Council after being proposed by the president, will have to be co-opted onto the collegium in addition to the 13 existing judges. Possible candidates are already being proposed in political and legal circles. Understandably, both organs of power involved in the appointments will try to fill the six vacant posts with people on whom they can rely in the future. But the Constitutional Court judges, without waiting to be "diluted" in this way, are hurrying to take measures to secure their own independence. Internal questions concerning the Constitutional Court's life are affected only in form by the decision to restore Zorkin's powers in connection with his cessation of active involvement in politics, which impedes the exercise of a judge's functions, and by the similar decision regarding Luchin not long before this. Essentially the judges, anticipating the question which they have not yet been asked aloud by the organs of the legislative, executive, and presidential branches, have declared that they are once again ready to adopt an active political position in the existing balance between the branches. All the indications are that this position will be an extremely inconvenient one for the president, which is evident from the fact that Zorkin, to whom Yeltsin has a widely known "political allergy" (mutual), has had his powers restored, and this is especially so in the absence of Vitruk, an acting chairman most loyal to Yeltsin. The Constitutional Court's decision can be regarded both as a reaction to the defeat of the presidential team (or of the teams acceptable to him) in the 12 December elections and as a symptom of the weakening of Yeltsin's positions regarding other poles of political opinion, including the government. The Constitutional Court, while no longer cunning in the sense that it says it will keep completely aloof from the country's political life, is again becoming an important and effective factor (like an ambuscade force) in Russian politics. At the moment it is difficult to say whether this will help to improve it. Maybe it would be no bad thing if the Constitutional Court did not start repeating its previous mistakes and lapsing into its own power ambitions but served as an effective brake, henceforth cautioning Russian politicians against excessively sudden movements and going too far.
