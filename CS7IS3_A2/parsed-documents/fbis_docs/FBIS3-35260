Their dissatisfaction is based not only on Hamas' lack of seriousness in coordinating with the other factions in political and organizational contexts, but also on its militant activities inside the occupied territories in general, and the Gaza Strip in particular. According to information made available to AL-DUSTUR on the atmosphere at the meetings of the alliance forces in Damascus, the doubts of these forces have risen to a level where they do not hesitate to ask a suspicious question; namely: What does Hamas wish to achieve with its policy, which seeks to impose Hamas as a custodian of the other members of the alliance -- the same members that suffered from Fatah's custodianship within the framework of the PLO? AL-DUSTUR telephoned sources close to the central command of the alliance forces in Damascus. These sources told AL-DUSTUR that Hamas is trying to polish its image and deliberately seeks to complicate the dialogue with the other factions in the alliance. It wants to avoid dialogue on one substantial issue -- Hamas' attempts to appoint itself an alternative to Fatah in the new alliance, as well as an alternative to the PLO. These moves are rejected by the other nine factions of the new alliance, which sought, and still seek, to hold a dialogue with Hamas. They want a dialogue in order to establish a political platform for their movement and create flexibility on the basis of participation, not through Hamas' political tutelage. These sources said the recent meetings in Damascus on Saturday [19 February] and Sunday went beyond the standard and did not conceal the worries of some factions over Hamas' rejected intentions. They raised the issue very frankly and confronted Hamas representatives, who tried to evade and refute these allegations, stressing that they do not wish to impose hegemony or become an alternative to the PLO. A close source to the alliance said the position of Hamas representatives reminds one of the Egyptian proverb "I hear what you say, I like it; but when I see your action, I wonder." A source who is very close to the alliance command explains why he used that proverb. He said Hamas is undermining the two most important tracks for the alliance. Hamas refused to establish a unified command for the intifadah inside the occupied territories, which would be open to all Palestinian forces opposing the Oslo agreement signed by the PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993 and to every Palestinian who believes in the intifadah as the means to realize the Palestinian people's national rights. The source said that the second issue is that Hamas rejected a matter already agreed upon; namely, mobilizing the Palestinian people and the forces that oppose the agreement through people's conferences. These conferences would lead to a general Palestinian people's congress of representatives from Palestinian groups, as nominated by the people's conferences. The source said that although the Palestinian people are coordinating to face the occupation and are working through the intifadah with unprecedented coordination, Hamas is of the opinion that coordination is better than establishing a leadership center for the alliance. Hamas also proposes people's rallies instead of organized people's conferences. These conferences will lead to the formation of a political framework for the alliance. The Palestinian people have lost any interest in speech rallies. The same official, who did not want to be identified, said that the independent and historical Palestinian leaderships that reject the Oslo agreement and want the alliance to appear as an organized Palestinian opposition political force have expressed indignation because four months have been lost in a "dialogue of the deaf" among the alliance forces. Four months have gone by without reaching an organized framework within which the Palestinian forces that oppose the Oslo agreement and which believe that the intifadah is the only way to respond to this agreement can be grouped. Hamas wants to remind the Palestinian people, political forces, and organizations who have lost interest in the PLO's method of domination, of the old methods of Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organization, which used to impose itself on the other Palestinian groups that formed the PLO. While describing relations among the alliance's forces as cold and paralyzed, the official said that the only agreement was to effect a joint approach toward certain Arab and Islamic states. He said that the Hamas representatives in the alliance leadership denied any knowledge that Hamas groups on the Gaza Strip abducted, tortured, and killed a Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] youth in Khan Yunus and claimed that their policies are based on noninterference in the internal affairs of others. A DFLP official in Amman told us that reports available to him confirm that a group from Hamas is behind the Khan Yunus killing and that there are more than 15 youth abduction cases in Gaza over the past two weeks of which nine youths were killed. Our sources in Damascus say that the question of the lack of law and order in Gaza took four hours of discussion in the alliance meetings. The killing of the DFLP member prompted the formation of a committee to investigate the killing under Talal Naji of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine--General Command with the membership of DFLP and Hamas representatives.
