The letter's full text is as follows: "The Standing Committee of the NPC of the People's Republic of China: Five years have elapsed since the democracy movement took place in 1989. As the citizens of the Republic who took an active part in the movement in the capacity of young students, we have never forgotten it, because we firmly believe that the movement has played an incalculable role in propelling history forward. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the democracy movement of 1989, by exercising the political rights of citizens according to law, we openly express the following three strong appeals to the NPC Standing Committee, the supreme power organ of the state: 1. Reappraising the democracy movement of 1989. It was a patriotic democratic movement of the whole people with young students as the mainstay. During the movement, we always adhered to the principle of "peace, reason, and nonviolence." We deem it unjust for the government to determine the nature of the movement as "a disturbance and counterrevolutionary insurrection," and it must be reappraised as soon as possible. 2. Releasing all those who have been locked up until now because of the 4 June incident. 3. Giving special care and allowance to members of the bereaved families in the 4 June incident and properly solving the livelihood problem of those who were put in prison for their part in the 4 June incident and have now returned to society. We maintain: The 4 June incident has formed an unavoidable "knot [jie 4815]" in the development of the Chinese nation's history. At a time when the drive for reform and opening up to the outside world has entered a crucial stage, like the government, we hope for a stable social environment. Moreover, solving the problem of 4 June incident and untying the "knot" in the people's hearts will help alleviate social contradictions, promote social stability, build the democratic legal system, and promote social progress. We sincerely hope that the government will boldly take this wise step by setting the interests of the nation and the future of the state above everything else. It is our request that Standing Committee members will consider the above proposals." The seven former student movement leaders who signed the letter were Wang Dan, Ma Shaofang, Zhai Weimin, Shao Jiang, Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang, and Guo Haifeng. As the letter was sent on the evening of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident, this event is thus very sensitive.
