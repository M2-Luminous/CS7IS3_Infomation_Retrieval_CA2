Meeting the press in Moscow on Thursday, he spoke in favor of preserving the new tariffs on food as a means to create a civilized market and safeguard the interests of domestic commodity producers. He reported that the cabinet had sent 1 trillion rubles to farms for the spring sowing and would provide more credits as of early April. This year's state allocations for agriculture will total 5 trillion rubles. Khlystun argued that since funds for agriculture had been set aside "very late," there had been delays with the acquisition of spare parts, fuel and lubricants, and pesticides. "The situation regarding sowing is alarming but not desperate," the minister said.
