I think today could serve to prove Salvadorans want to live in peace and democracy. We have surpassed our expectations. Voter turnout was high. Although the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] will give the figures, the turnout was high, with a few exceptions. The people's participation was truly unexpected, and the results have been categorical. Without daring to give figures, I would like to say the people voted intelligently. They know and see the link that existed between the situation and violence we had before and how peace was achieved and how we are gradually achieving social and economic recovery. There has to be justice for all, because we undoubtedly have to realize our priority is to work for the neediest. With their vote, they are now saying this is the right course. They have entrusted the majority of the municipalities and the assembly seats, the Presidency and the vice presidency to an administration such as the one we have had during these five years. There are no loses here; that is very important for you to note. The only winner is the Salvadoran people. Just as we gained with peace, we are gaining with democracy. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Merino] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] is receiving a mandate from the people, freely expressed at the polls. The people who will enforce it have great talent and experience. Their honesty has already been proved, meaning that vote was not wasted but will serve to improve our country. [Reporter] Can you affirm you have won? [Merino] (?I know), but the TSE will give the figures. It is now clear the people voted for ARENA, for El Salvador. Let me say [words indistinct] from the east, I was in the east, San Miguel in particular. I visited several centers there. The behavior is the same. The proportions are holding up. For their own interest, there are some who would like to wait until the decimal figures are out. The signals are clear, however, [words indistinct] The TSE has to announce the figures. The interest of many people who were kind to visit us.... [pauses] And it is good foreign observers came, because that also helps the country's economy. ARENA got twice the votes the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] did. These things are important. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the complaints have not been long in coming. The FMLN has already complained regarding certain irregularities that prevented a large turnout. [Merino] I just told some reporters from another news medium the FMLN leadership must review or rethink its remarks. If there was one thing we had too much of today in all polls, it was FMLN people with their vests and pins. They were there watching at the voting tables. A Democratic Convergence member belongs to the TSE. To say there was fraud amounts to not trusting their own people who worked the whole day and their voters who spent the whole day at the voting places.
