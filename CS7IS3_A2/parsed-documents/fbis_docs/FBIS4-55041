FBIS4-55041 "dreeu090_d_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-090 Daily Report 10 May 1994 SLOVAKIA Right-Wing Groups Respond to KDH Offer Right-Wing Groups Respond to KDH Offer AU0905083694 AU0905083694 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 4 May on page 1 publishes a 300-word statement issued by the Standing Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI) in response to the offer advanced by the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) to "right-wing groupings and personalities with similar political views" to participate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections on the KDH slate of candidates. The KDH offer, and unification of Slovak right-wing parties in general, are also the subject of an 800-word interview with Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDS)-New Alternative, by Alena Gottweisova in Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 4 May on page 2. The interview, the place and date of which are not given, is published under the headline "Options of a Joint Course of Action." The SKOI statement welcomes the KDH offer as an opportunity to unite "civic and Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." It states: "We receive with satisfaction the KDH's opening toward civic democratic forces, which we understand as a historic step toward overcoming mutual differences and toward the actual amalgamation of Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." Referring to the fragmentation of the right-wing vote in the 1992 elections, the SKOI statement proclaims that "the mistakes of the year 1992 must not be repeated" and calls on "all civic democratic forces that want to share in the KDH's and SKOI's common work to follow our path of unification of civic and Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." Cernak's reaction to the KDH offer is more reserved. The relevant passage in the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview reads: [Gottweisova] ``The unification of right-wing forces is the topic of the day. Representatives of the KDH, Democratic Party (DS), the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS), the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, and the NDS have agreed to cooperate. One option foresees the formation of a single entity, the other option is represented by KDH's offer to reserve places for representatives of other parties on its own slate of candidates. Which option is more promising, in your opinion?'' [Cernak] "It is premature to say which option would be better. During the meeting of parties of the right center we noted that all of them are interested in cooperation. Unfortunately, some subsequent statements did not quite confirm this readiness. The KDH has put forward its idea, I and my party colleagues will prepare other possible alternatives. We have to realize that we would suffer terrible defeat in the eyes of the Slovak public if we kept meeting for two months, kept proclaiming that we want to cooperate, and, ultimately, failed to agree on the form of this cooperation. That would be the worst possible alternative. Creating a single entity is unrealistic, however, in my opinion because, in view of differences in programs, the liberally oriented DEUS cannot merge with the KDH. We can proceed jointly in a coalition bloc or establish a grouping within the framework of the center and right center. I am an advocate of joint course of action by the widest possible current, which is why I would prefer the formation of a coalition bloc, within the framework of which those five entities, plus, possibly, a sixth one, would nominate their candidates. We would be able to expect a relatively good result in that case. The voter can, moreover, influence the result by means of preferential votes. I would therefore accept, for example, a procedure with a single slate of candidates whereby, in the event of electoral success, he who gets the largest number of preferential votes would form the government. This option does not seem to be feasible, however, in view of certain antagonisms existing among individual parties." Asked about the "sixth potential partner," Cernak says that he was thinking of the Christian Social Union (KSU), which has reportedly abandoned the idea of cooperating with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and "has left the door open for talks with other political entities." Cernak concedes, however, that the presence of the KSU in such a right-wing bloc might deter some potential right-wing voters.
