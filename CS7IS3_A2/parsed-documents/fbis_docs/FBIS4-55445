Why was there such a need just at that moment to present the prospects of Polish foreign policy? [Olechowski] This is a traditional annual address, which just happened to take place recently. It should really have taken place a month or a month and a half ago, but the political calendar in Poland is such that governments usually change in late fall, so that is why all the annual plans are published more or less in the middle of the year. We will have to think whether we should not change the budget calendar, and other things, just as is the case in other countries in the world where political calendars are such that, for example, the budget year begins on 1 April or 1 June. We have such a custom that annual plans, plans for a particular year, are announced around the spring season. [Correspondent] Foreign Minister, what are the basic aims of our foreign policy, and what do we want to achieve in the very near future? [Olechowski] I spoke about this for 45 minutes in the Sejm this week so I can only briefly say that the aims are all classic ones. First, we want to live in a more secure world. In this respect, our foreign policy is undoubtedly a very essential tool in social actions. Second, we want to live better and better, in the widest meaning of this word, so we can develop in an unrestrained manner when we have the best possible conditions for it. Third, I think that each of us wants to have free contact with foreigners, to travel abroad, and to host foreigners here. These are also the tasks of foreign policy. [Correspondent] There is a marked orientation of Polish foreign policy toward the West, but, having said that, we should not forget about the orientation toward the East. [Olechowski] Orientation toward the West ensues from the fact that we feel connected, as it were, with that family of nations. It is there that our religion came from, it is there that our alphabet, civilization, and so on came from. Therefore, we feel we have ties to that part of the world. On the other hand, as long as there are West and East, because these directions can be blurred, the final, long-term, and most important aim would be that Europe become one whole, unified, and that there be no clear differences as we have today. We want to, and should, keep contacts with the East in every situation because you cannot not have contacts with your neighbors. This would immediately create a very dangerous situation. These relations can be closer or more distant ones, depending on how the neighbors behave, but we have to have some relations. We always have to offer solutions, proposals that we want to have good relations with them and be friends. We have formulated such an offer, and such an offer has been accepted. There was an exchange of substantive, matter-of-fact letters between myself and [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev, and now we have achieved a certain program of cooperation between two neighbors, two important countries for regional policy. On the other hand, we disagree with how Europe should be built. We agree on the view that its final appearance should be undivided, but we see a way to achieve this differently. [Correspondent] Poland is full of expectations of the West: We count heavily on Western help in both the economic and the political spheres. However, the past teaches us that such expectations often fail. Don't we have a similar situation now? Certain moves by Western politicians prove that they do not always understand our fears and our interests. [Olechowski] To be polemical, in what way does the past say that we cannot count on this help? [Correspondent] The year 1939, for instance. [Olechowski] Perhaps there is a closer one. To be sure, we did not get $10,000 each in cash, preferably not into a bank account but in cash. But we did get, after the change of system and the undertaking of the difficulties of transformation, assistance that was significant, assistance in the stabilization of the zloty--$1 billion is no mean sum. The taxpayers there decided that this must be (?supported). We have also received significant assistance if we calculate over these past five years, and if we add up all the money that has been received from the group of the 24 most industrialized states, we would also get several billion. Also pay attention, please, to the fact that this money, these World Bank, IMF credits, could have gone elsewhere. After all, everyone in the world needs them, and there are very many countries that would wish to receive them. But they were directed to us. So, there was also a decision to be favorable. Finally, take a look at a matter as follows: We often say that the Europeam Union is protectionist, that it does not admit our goods. We are offended at this; however, without negating the fact that it is not sufficiently open, our exports there have grown over the past few years in stunning fashion. If they did not wish to admit these goods, really, then they would after all not admit them. So, this is also not so. It cannot be permitted to say that this is a closed world, that this is a world that does not want to help us, to allude to 1939--about which I also wish to say that, in the end, we won that war. So, it was also not the case that no one came with assistance. We will soon be marking the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Rising, and we remember. We nonetheless have in our living thoughts the people who helped us here, the states that helped and the people who died helping the Poles. So, we often simplify. We ought not to do this. [Correspondent] It is worthwhile, when speaking with you, to (?return to) Polish matters. Lately, we have had signals that there is no [word indistinct] in looking at Polish foreign policy through the basic centers of power. [Olechowski] I do not perceive this that way beccause, please note, if any policy at all in Poland enjoys consensus, it is precisely foreign policy. I have eloquent proof of this. I have three times presented reports in the Sejm that required a vote. Two were adopted unanimously, and one had just a little opposition. So, please show me another area of policy--that is, another minister--who has attained such a result. This is not my character trait, just the fact that we all agree about these main aims. We, however, speak with different voices, and we often say various things that resound in different ways. But this does not mean that there is some sort of chaos here. Where is the chaos, and where is the lack of coherence and coordination, particularly in such concrete, day-to-day activities? We are aware of this. Ministerial politics flourished and flourish in Poland. Everyone cultivates his own little patch. That is in part perhaps the charm of our government. When one considers it a little, the Council of Ministers is a conference agreeing the views of the different ministries, and not a (word indistinct) that acts in one direction. But that is how it is conceived in essence, on principle, by the legislators. Here we propose to the government the undertaking of certain activities that will strengthen the coordinating role of the minister of foreign affairs.
