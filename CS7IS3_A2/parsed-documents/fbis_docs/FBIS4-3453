Addressing a national conference on market circulation that closed in this city of Fujian Province yesterday, Wang Yiping, secretary-general of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said that the government will also try to effectively regulate supplies of and demand for commodities vital to the national economy and the people's livelihood. These commodities include grain, cotton, cooking oil, sugar, meat, vegetables, chemical fertilizers, rolled steel and refined oil, he told the delegates from all over the country. He described market regulation as "essential" to China's steady economic growth and the success of various reforms. "We should control market prices by economic means and through monetary policies, guide market demand and achieve a balance between total supply and demand," he said. To this end, it is necessary to institute a material reserve system at the central and local levels, he noted. The system at the central level is intended to regulate the relationship between total supply and demand. The system at the local level is designed to regulate the supply-demand relationship in local markets in order to keep prices stable. Furthermore, it is imperative to introduce a risk-related fund system for important commodities, Wang said. The Chinese Government plans to institute a grain risk-related fund system and plans to establish risk-related funds for meat, vegetables and other non-staple foodstuffs, he said. "Only by establishing such funds, will we be able to promote protection of production after price decontrol, effectively regulate the market and prevent steep ups and downs in production and markets," he said. Wang Yiping also urged efforts to use both domestic and foreign markets for macro-economic controls in China, with the emphasis on coordinating the country's export policies. He said that imports and exports are playing an increasingly significant role in regulating the market, as a result of the introduction of a market-oriented foreign exchange system, the reform of the foreign trade system and the gearing of the Chinese market to the global market. It is, therefore, necessary to coordinate the country's policies regarding the import and export of major consumer goods and capital goods, and use taxation and tariffs to regulate the amount of import and export goods, he said. The Chinese Government has also decided to introduce a market monitoring system, he said. Specifically, a nationwide information network will be set up to forecast and oversee production, marketing, storage and changes in the prices of major consumer goods and capital goods in order to make market regulation more effective, he added.
