The inspection team will inspect Henan's environmental protection law enforcement work. Yesterday morning, provincial and Zhengzhou City leaders, including Li Changchun, Fan Qinchen, Zhong Lisheng, Zhang Honghua, and others, briefed the inspection team on Henan's environmental protection work, discussed with the team problems pertaining to the work, and expressed the hope that the state will provide more assistance to Henan in environmental protection. After listening to reports made by the Henan leaders, State Councillor Song Jian pointed out: Pollution in the Huaihe valley has already reached an alarming level. If we fail to take effective measures to solve this problem, some tributaries of the Huaihe will soon turn into drainage canals. Having basically solved the problem of food and clothing for the vast majority of the people living along the Huaihe, we should now start making every possible effort to help and guide the masses in the area to free themselves from a dirty environment. Economic development should never harm the environment; rather, it should protect the environment. We should work harder, redouble our efforts, strive to raise the region's social, economic, and environmental efficiencies, gradually formulate and enact stricter environmental protection laws, and ensure that all environmental protection laws are implemented to the letter so as to raise the work of harnessing the Huaihe to a new level. Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun said: As Henan is the source of the Huaihe, the Henan comrades should adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people and make energetic efforts to further the work of harnessing the Huaihe. Comrade Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairman of the NPC Environment and Resources Committee, along with comrades in charge of more than 10 state ministries and commissions, also listened to the reports made by the Henan leaders. Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Li Changchun, Zhang Deguang, Zhang Honghua, and other provincial and Zhengzhou City leaders, Song Jian and his entourage inspected a project built for the purpose of harnessing the Qingshuihe [Qingshui Lake] and visited Baixian Joint-stock Company Ltd. and Zhongyuan Pharmaceutical Factory. At the factory, Comrade Song Jian wrote: "Protect the Environment To Benefit This and Coming Generations!"
