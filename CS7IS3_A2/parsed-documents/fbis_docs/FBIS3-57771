An Amnesty International report had once again shown that human rights were still not being respected in Turkey. The report spoke of mass executions, torture, and attacks on the Kurdish population. "Turkey is not a traditional purchaser of arms from Belgium," Urbain answered soothingly. "In so far as licences were still granted for the delivery of arms, ammunition, and military equipment to Turkey, it concerns very limited amounts." Since Turkey was not on the embargo list, and no EC country was prepared to announce an embargo, at that time Urbain regarded it as "not opportune to suspend or withdraw the current export licences, which as mentioned are very modest." Strictly speaking, Urbain's reasoning is correct. Earlier that year the EC had decided to not announce an arms embargo against Turkey. In exchange the Turkish government promised to henceforth respect human rights. The documents now in the possession of DE MORGEN prove that minister Urbain may have been right regarding the number of new arms export licences. But in 1991 and 1992 Turkey was a big customer of the Belgian arms manufacturers. The quantities supplied at that time can scarcely be described as "limited" and "modest." On 20 May 1991 five army transport planes left Zaventem airport for Turkey carrying a consignment of military vehicles and arms of Belgian origin. In total they weighed 97 tonnes. Two days later five army transport planes again left with a similar destination and a load weighing 118 tonnes. Another two days later saw the departure of five army planes carrying a total of 115 tonnes of military vehicles and arms; on 28 May five of the same aircraft again departed with a total of 115 tonnes. (On 20 May 1991, on the very first day of this series of deliveries, Foreign Affairs Ministers Claes was minimizing arms exports to Turkey: "This year only one export licence was granted for a batch of ammunition worth 12 million Belgian francs [BFr]," Claes said. "As for the future, I want to point out that companies do not always inform my department about projects which are still under negotiation, so that I cannot give any accurate information about possible orders which are still in the pipeline.") This overview does not take into account smaller shipments which were transported by Sabena or Turkish Airlines: 238 kg of pistols (on 9 February 1991), 154 kg of arms (1 May 1991), 17 kg of pistols (3 July 1991), 335 kg of arms (14 December 1991), 501 kg of arms (12 February 1992), 266 kg of pistols (14 March 1992), 2,733 kg of ammunition (25 April 1992), 246 kg of arms (1 August 1992), 207 kg of arms (19 September 1992), 120 kg of arms (3 October 1992), 154 kg of arms (21 October 1992), 982 kg of arms (24 October 1992) and 907 kg of machine guns (11 November 1992). In addition there was a load of 265 cases of rifle grenades (around 6 tonnes) produced by Mecar [subsidiary of Allied Research Associates] which left Antwerp by ship for Turkey on 29 January 1991. Finally a ship left Zeebrugge for Turkey on 16 February 1991 loaded with 322 tonnes of Belgian-made projectiles. This means that in 1991-92 Turkey bought nearly 800 tonnes of arms in our country.
