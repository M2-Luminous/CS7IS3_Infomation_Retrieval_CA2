The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that in fact the Saudi ruler was expected to invite people to close ranks, urge Muslims to properly employ their potentials to counter enemies of Islam and, avoid discord. On the contrary, in his message King Fahd called on the U.S. President Bill Clinton to take further steps towards peace with the Zionist regime and voiced his country's readiness to cooperate with the U.S. Administration, Arab states and international bodies interested in the American-sponsored peace in the region. The Saudi ruler's message further proves the authenticity of the reports that the Zionist regime had threatened the Saudi Government it would be deprived of attending the Arab-Israel talks if `disavowal of unbelievers' rally were held in Mecca. King Fahd's message indicates to the fact that he wanted the Zionist regime and the U.S. keep their promise and enter Saudi Arabia into the dangerous game on the fate of the Muslim Palestinian nation, said the article. Fahd had called for the handing over of the three Iranian islands to the United Arab Emirates and claimed that the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council would support Abu Dhabi in Iran-UAE dispute. Elsewhere in his message, the article noted, Fahd tried to inculcate the idea that there were some disputes among Persian Gulf states with the aim to make hajj pilgrims believe that regional countries and nations are not able to reach understanding and therefore need some guardians. Turning to the role that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has played in the region, the editorial said that he would count on lackey governments to help the U.S. come out of the Middle East quagmire. Through preventing the `disavowal of unbelievers' rally, finalizing Gaza-Jericho accord and, creating a state of terror in Lebanon and occupied Palestine, Warren Christopher and his agents try to pretend that the Zionist regime hold the upper hand in the region, it said. By sowing discord among regional countries, the U.S. intends to prepare the ground for the emergence of a new source of tension in the region, said the editorial. The article regretted the fact that the lackey Arab front has rendered great assistance to materialization of Christopher's conspiracies, adding that King Fahd's message is the latest in the chain.
