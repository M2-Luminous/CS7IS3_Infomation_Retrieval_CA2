The briefing was given at the prime minister's official residence by Tsutomu Tanaka, administrative vice minister of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], and other top EPA officials. During the briefing, the prime minister expressed doubt about achieving the 2.4 percent growth target because the figure was much higher than the average 0.6 percent forecast by private research organizations. According to Tanaka, Hosokawa said: "Will this target really be attained?" The prime minister's concern stems from the fact that recent government economic forecasts have been far from the actual state of the economy, Tanaka said. It is very unusual for a prime minister to question the economic growth target which has been agreed upon by the EPA, the Finance Ministry, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Tanaka explained to the prime minister: "When the economy is flagging, private research organizations tend to calculate a low economic growth rate with a pessimistic view. This is why there are big gaps between the economic growth rate forecast by the government and those calculated by private organizations. A series of government pump-priming measures will bring about the desired effect this year and the economy will be put on the road to recovery." In this way, he stressed that it was possible to achieve the 2.4 percent target. According to Tanaka, the prime minister eventually accepted his explanation and said: "I understand."
