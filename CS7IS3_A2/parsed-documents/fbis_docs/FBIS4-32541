We conclude our series of discussions with political party leaders with an interview with Petar Gosev, the leader of the Democratic Party, a party which is a perennial topic of fierce discussions. Dirty Methods [Geroski] Mr. Gosev, do you think that with increasing frequency you have played the role of zealous critic rather than of a leader trying creatively to develop something new? [Gosev] Let me immediately say that that is not the way I think. I have heard this remark, especially by people in power and those around them. Such people can fabricate the most dirty things, spread them daily among the public using the dirtiest "social warfare" methods, while we must counter them with plans for the present and the future. They engage in black marketeering while accusing others. Their people are involved in illegal deals for which they blame others. Their people trade in import and export permits and compensation agreements; they grab housing and free shops, whereas we, or I personally, must counter them with "projects." They block the work of the parliament expecting that I or other members of the opposition will answer with projects which would unblock it. The members of the coalition held the highest possible positions in the government for decades, including the time when most of the foreign loans were "gobbled up," while accusing others of the same. They are applying cannibalistic and nepotistic methods in politics, while asking of me to be constructive. This reminds me of the time when a single party ruled: "Do not criticize, just offer suggestions and we, at the top, we shall see whether your suggestions are smart and whether we shall adopt them." What projects are needed in order to block black marketeering, corruption, the plunder of public capital, the daily violation of the Constitution and the laws, discrimination against the people, nepotism, and the fearful spreading of incompetence in government, assigning political commissars to the information media, increasing party involvement in the top police ranks, and so on, if not to enable those who are doing all of this (and not only this alone), making it possible, supporting it, or not preventing it, although this is their duty, while in power? [Geroski] When we speak of projects, we think of standards, of unemployment, of the retired, of health, schools.... [Gosev] Yes, I too think about them. However, the latter cannot be achieved without eliminating the former. Furthermore, on the basis of what rules of parliamentary democracy should the opposition draft projects for those in power and submit such projects to them, telling them, "here is a project, see what you can do about it while you keep on ruling!" On the other hand, very basic amendments aimed at correcting ordinary stupidities are simply rejected with grins of satisfaction. We do not intend to provide them on a daily basis with this type of "satisfaction." To the voters I speak of our realities, of what we would accomplish if we are in power. Furthermore, we shall present our electoral program which, with or without projects, will be directed at the voters and not at those currently in power. Gosev--Nationalist or Not? [Geroski] You consider yourselves a party of the political center. Today you are being described as a member of the national bloc, while others even describe you as a nationalistic party.... [Gosev] We are a party of the political center, and that is what we shall remain. Labels used by political competitors will change nothing. We have already seen this: If you are not with them, there must be something wrong with you. I hear labels such as "Gosev has gone to the right," "he has become a nationalist," or else "he has proclaimed a confused type of nationalism!" I am convinced that I am wherever the national and state interests of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] are. I am convinced that it is the other people who should think about where they stand. However, as was the case in the past, they will realize this later and, naturally, apply the greatest possible pressure to prove that they have always been in favor of what happened (if it was good) or against it (if it was bad). I read somewhere that a Russian philosopher wrote that there are two types of nationalism: zoological and creative. The first type encourages the irrational features of a people and leans toward intoxication, and inner triumph, and rejects criticism. The second not only allows criticism but provides it. It is not cut off from the trunk of the tree, rather it wants to enrich it with new meanings and fruit. In our country, there also are the so-called "anationals." They simply want to be merely citizens, members of a country, regardless of its name. They would like immediately to become citizens of the world. They want to live in the world as a global village. This is splendid. This may happen eventually. This may be the only formula that will save the world. Perhaps. I would like this too. I would like before that happens to practice the Olympic slogan, "We are one." But what about until then? On the one hand, there we are with the splendid humanistic slogan of "fraternity and unity," and on the other, there they are (with others among them as well) with their zoological nationalism. They would like to eliminate "our kind" or else tell us that we are one, but of their own kind, and take us over, either part of us or the entire "unrecruited" remainder of the Republic of Macedonia. Over the past 50 years, their practice of the otherwise splendid formula of "fraternity and unity" changed the demographic structure of Macedonia. The result today is expressed as follows: "Macedonia is not a unitarian state" or "it will not be a unitarian state." If such is the case, Macedonia will not be a state at all. This is worth thinking about, is it not? Everyone must see where he is: to the left, the right, in the center, or.... [Geroski] Those who try to estimate your electoral chances are unable to agree on whether you are "rallying" around you the voters disappointed by the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] or by the social democrats and the liberals. Are you indeed a party of the disappointed electorate? [Gosev] The way things are, and given the increased number of sympathizers of the DP [Democratic Party], I fear that we may become a disappointed country. Seriously speaking, your questions are not serious. Our answer to this is the following: Those who are in power do not need a new party, a new alternative. However, if you are waiting for a more specific answer, most of the present membership (about 11,000) consists of former members of the SKM [League of [Communists of Macedonia] or the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], the Liberal Party, or individuals who have never been members of any party. It is true that neither sympathizers nor members are satisfied with this type of government, for which reason I do not understand the meaning of your question about us being the party of the disappointed. [Geroski] What is Petar Gosev's view of the idea of a coalition with the VMRO-DPMNE? [Gosev] The elections in the 103rd district indicated that if the government does not form a coalition, it is bound to lose the elections. That is, actually, what happened and "rescued" the government from a defeat. In connection with our electoral tactics, we are considering what would be the best way to defeat the current coalition. The possibilities are obviously greater if the opposition parties (those of any significance) develop some kind of electoral cooperation. We have still not definitively determined how intensive such cooperation should be and the form it should adopt. Actually, we still have time to reach a final decision. Naturally, this also depends on the wishes and interests of the other opposition parties. [Geroski] Do you find an international understanding of your views, considering the international support given to the Gligorov regime? [Gosev] Interest in the DP is clearly increasing. An increasing number of foreign diplomats, representatives of foreign countries, and newsmen are interested in having discussions with us. We openly present our views, profoundly trusting that they are consistent with Macedonian state interests. So far, there have been no cases of misunderstanding. On the contrary, we have noted a high degree of accord and understanding, even in connection with our views concerning relations with Greece. In the case of Greece, although they dispute our own views sometimes, quite frequently they note the complexity of the situation and suggest a compromise with Greece, although confidentially they say that they are on our side. Conversion and Mimicry [Geroski] We assume that the current electoral theme adopted by you and your party will be one of so-called conversion: You are indeed a "refugee" from the SDSM, a person about whom it is being said that he "brought" Kiro Gligorov to Macedonia (and is now criticizing him), a person who formed a party with people who, until yesterday, fiercely criticized him. What is Petar Gosev's answer to this? [Gosev] This will not be our current theme. Many themes are much more important. Many among those who accuse us of conversion lack the moral right to do so. Specifically, the leaderships of the current coalition parties consist of the former SKM, and some of them incidentally, have had double the amount of "apprenticeship" in that party and have been for decades been part of the ruling team of the one-party system. They abandoned it, and now are once again together, struggling for power. I may be accused of conversion. I opposed the League of Communists platform and drafted a different platform long before they did, even while the country was still ruled by a single party. These people agreed with the new platform. Therefore, they too converted. However, looking at the way they work, the way they consider such conversion and the aspects on the basis of which they look at it, and considering the cadres which are promoting and revitalizing their platform, they once again aspire to be in power (the majority of them were, until the very last moment, against a market economy and pluralism, and against the state independence of Macedonia), and one could say that they did not convert but, as your respectable newspaper would say, they were not subject to a metamorphosis but remained like ideological dinosaurs and resorted merely to mimicry. My political credo and basic ideological line and system of basic values have been defined for quite some time. I did not avoid, naturally, making the necessary modifications. I separated myself from those who did not undertake any kind of ideological conversion (those who support the program of the League of Communists of 1950) or those whose ideology and system of values consist of remaining in power and ruling for the sake of fulfilling their personal objectives only. As to the fact that I have joined those who, until yesterday, attacked me fiercely, let me say the following: To be attacked by a political rival is one thing; but when you are being attacked secretly, like Brutus, by someone who thought of as a close supporter is an entirely different matter. I ask you to whom would you feel closer? For the latter, the people have suitable universally familiar sayings, I do not have to repeat them. My former political rivals, however, rarely resorted to attacking my personality. Frequently, they displayed greater respect for my activities and individualism, focusing their criticism on the old party along with its entire legacy of the past.
