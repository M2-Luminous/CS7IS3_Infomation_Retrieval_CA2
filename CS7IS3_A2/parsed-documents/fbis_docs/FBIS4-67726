All pregnant women were tested. No one knows who the infected women are. The tests were not provided with identification information. Around 65,000 tests were performed in all, the Public Health Institute disclosed in its publication. Professor Pauli Leinikki of the Public Health Institute's HIV laboratory considers the number of cases that were found surprisingly high. In his opinion it shows how important it is to have an HIV test when visiting a clinic. However a test where the mother's identity is disclosed cannot be made against her will. The AIDS situation in Finland is still the best in the western world, in the opinion of people at the Public Health Institute. According to preliminary reports only 56 new cases of HIV infection were recorded last year. That is clearly fewer than the year before.
