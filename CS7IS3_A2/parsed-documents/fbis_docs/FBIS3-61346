Although the names of those who wish to try it on two or three trampolines at the same time are known, an overwhelming majority of candidates have already chosen a design to their liking and in line with their potential, and are now enthusiastically demonstrating trial leaps to their colleagues in electoral blocs in order to capture the top positions on the qualifying list. As far as the designs are concerned, they are perfect. That is to say, each trampoline has been tailored to the needs of the designer himself. The trampoline of the nomenklatura, tall and made for the shortest leap without any particular swinging, was introduced especially for individuals with heavy behinds benumbed from sitting, to whom hopping into the chamber of the Supreme Council is like walking from their office to the room next door. Only in Galicia will there be trouble with this design: Because of a lack of materials, the trampoline was built on rotten supports, and the deputy careers of the few courageous members of the nomenklatura may come to an end under its rubble. The trampoline of the entrepreneurs is as simple as our economy. One of its ends is held by the sinews of labor collectives and the other by those of independent trade union organizations. Each candidate will choose the end to his taste. Before leaping, the catapulting mechanism should be well oiled. A group of disconcerted private owners and businessmen has nested somewhere in between the favorites of the labor collectives and the pets of the trade unions. The push in this place on the trampoline is going to be minimal whichever end is pulled--those who have trained may fly far enough.... The trampoline of the political parties is somewhat like its creators. It has three starting pads--left, center, and right. Some mechanisms of the trampoline remain a mystery to the designers themselves. The function of most parts changes daily. Since the parts are worn out due to the frequent change of aim, they have to be tied together by ropes or nailed down. Nobody can say with certainty which mechanisms hamper the leap and which give it an impetus. Perhaps all the mechanisms will be turned off at the same time for the elections, provided, of course, that the trampoline does not fall apart before then. Given the differences in leaping techniques and competitive tactics, each group of the candidates is training separately. POST-POSTUP intends to familiarize its readers with the peculiarities of this process. Entrepreneurs Three all-Ukrainian associations of entrepreneurs are getting ready to run. The USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] team appears the strongest among them. After Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov got together, the USPP has succeeded in bringing in some private businessmen, which will undoubtedly create for it a favorable reformist image and fill the coffers of the union with capital from businessmen. The clear-cut pro-Russian orientation of Leonid Kuchma, the new president of the USPP, makes the bloc reliable on the preelection menu of the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. The chances of candidates from the USPP bloc are estimated to be better than of those who went to other associations of entrepreneurs--the All-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs of Serhiy Babych and the Union of Private Owners and Entrepreneurs established with the participation of Volodymyr Lanovyy, the former deputy prime minister with the still untarnished reformist image. In combination, the Lanovyy and Babych blocs will offset the obvious superiority of the USPP somewhat. The disproportion would have been catastrophic had Lanovyy not secured support from the Oleksandr Mril free trade unions. This combination guarantees him fans during the duel with Kuchma: Both blocks are betting on the "labor collectives." The power over labor collectives which state directors from the USPP are easily retaining both through the "aktiv" of enterprises and thanks to resort vouchers, hospitals, and waiting lists for housing is counterbalanced by the independent trade unions from Lanovyy's bloc, which have painlessly reorganized their primary chapters into labor collectives. A "labor collective" cuts both ways. It is an ideal trampoline for the "director's man," where democratic trade unions do not exist. However, the labor collective is a director's headache in districts in which the free trade unions have grown in strength. Nonetheless, it is expected that Lanovyy's people will be successful in just 12 electoral districts populated mostly by miners, taking the deputy seats from the USPP. At least two intense clashes between USPP directors and trade union organizations are known--in Krivoy Rog and Pervomaysk, where Vasyl Yevtukhov, current deputy prime minister, and Mykola Surhay, current head of the State Committee for the Coal Industry, grasped with surprise that they will have a problem getting nominated by the labor collectives of miners, although they were not able to link this phenomenon, an unpleasant one for them, with their behavior during the miners' strikes. The main battles between the free trade unions and the director's tank are expected to break out in the Donbass, where Markulov's Liberals and the Labor Party will interfere with dividing up the election pie. It is hard to imagine a more fortuitous tactical combination than the alliance of the free trade unions and bankers from Praveks and Inko which has been devised by Lanovyy. Having grasped the futility of efforts to stand against the USPP alone, Lanovyy opted for the only possible line of behavior whose chances to be effective will improve by reason of a strike scheduled by the trade unions for 18 January. It is precisely 18 January that may advance Lanovyy to the center stage of Ukrainian politics. Parties The party life of the democrats is full of contradictions. Each one of them demonstrates devotion to the idea of a single bloc, while stressing at the same time that such a bloc is hardly possible. Some, dispensing with preelection agreements, have gone to look for greener pastures in districts prepared beforehand, maneuvering between the need to demonstrate adherence to the ideas of private enterprise and the temptation to scold the entrepreneurs before the voters, most of whom view businessmen as "thieves" and "speculators." It appears that participants in the center-right Council of Democratic Parties and Organizations of Ukraine, the creation of which was memorable at the last Rukh congress, are now more concerned about the division of funds from the diaspora; failure to apportion them is preventing the ultimate breakup of the council. Les Tanyuk said: "Many problems of the association are related to the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces]--an organization created to break up Rukh. The so-called All-People's Rukh of Larysa Skoryk, which is a direct alternative to People's Rukh, also emerged from the recesses of that organization. Many KNDS leaders believe that the democrats have reared a Mazepa out of Kravchuk. If people from the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] understand that they have been fooled, the array of national-democratic forces will possibly be broadened. Everything depends on the degree to which these forces distance themselves from the president. Painful disappointment awaits them otherwise." Of course, it is hard for Tanyuk to forget that some people from circles close to the KNDS were privy to his persecution as a "KGB agent," and also that the leader of the Republicans attacked Vyacheslav Chornovil on television right before the 1991 presidential elections. Larysa Skoryk, chairman of All-People's Rukh, does not believe in consolidation of the democrats for the elections. She calls the democrats' promises not to fight one another in electoral districts "declarations backed up nothing." Mrs. Skoryk asserts emotionally: "I am telling you that this will not happen. There will definitely be several candidates from various democratic groups per district, especially in Galicia." In view of the fact that the KNDS is used to paying attention to the reflections of Larysa Pavlivna, the paralysis of the council may be explained from this point of view, if no other. To skirt the "points of conflagration" in the council and free itself from the trouble of settling adversarial situations in the electoral districts, the leaders of Rukh appear to have found a quite mild outcome which, it appears, Oleksandr Kibza, an adviser of the department of political analysis of the organization, has been charged with releasing. He said: "We are planning to give regional organizations an opportunity to themselves decide which candidates to nominate and support." Old conflicts and misunderstandings are superimposed over the severe realities of the present day: It is hard for the center-rightists to come to a compromise in dividing up their traditional electorate in the western region (Galicia) and Kiev. Some observers believe that approximately seven candidates from the democrats will contend in the rural areas of Galicia for one mandate, and 15 candidates in the cities. In Kiev, out of 2,500 contenders for candidates which are expected to be registered by the electoral commissions of the capital city until 27 January, the center-right will "field" only 100. It is quite possible that some leaders of the center-right, having returned from a futile tour of Galicia, will compete among themselves in Kiev. Only Oles Shevchenko, who will run in Tarashcha, in the vicinity of Kiev, and Dmytro Pavlychko, who considers the area of Kanev to be the best jumping-off point, have given up the capital. Kiev has prepared a few more presents for the voters, which could also have been expected. Semen Yufa, chairman of the Merkuriy company, which is widely known in the capital city, will most likely be a candidate in Chervonoarmiyskyy Electoral District, in which Yuriy Kostenko won the previous election. So far, people willing to compete with him are not in evidence, just as there are none who want to try their luck in a game against Ivan Saliy. The "Podol wolf," who has organized his own Choice, not only draws on the favorable position of KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI but also impresses competitors with the directness of his drive for power, a directness which, in combination with the methods for persuading competitors, will be sufficient for Saliy to win with no opposition. The flight of the left wing of Ukrainian parties is not endangered by surprises. Although Yevhen Marmazov, deputy chairman of the Communist Party of Ukraine, says that "the Communists will not form a bloc with anyone, but all of us--the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Peasant Party--will help one another," his "other party comrades" consider the issue of creating a left bloc already resolved. People's Deputy Valentyn Trizna projects: "The time for the left bloc to gain power has now come. I think that it will win the elections." The possible "drain" of votes of the electorate by the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc causes a certain alarm among the "left." Nevertheless, the "left" do not avoid discussions with this bloc. A certain outline of anti-Kuchma theses in the electoral program of the Socialists may be found in the words of Oleksandr Moroz: "The panacea for all misfortunes--privatization--which was advocated by both the Fokin government and in particular the Kuchma cabinet, has fully discredited itself. They brought our society to the brink of catastrophe." However, such theses of the left are not the foundation of their electoral platform. Their leaders engage in anti-Rukh propaganda with energy worthy of a better cause. Yevhen Marmazov said: "The blockade of the Communist and Socialist Parties, of those who do not subscribe to the positions of Rukh, is real." Anticommunism remains the core of Rukh's propaganda. Chairman of People's Council Ivan Zayets said: "People are already beginning to understand that the system of power which is embodied and implemented by the procommunist forces is to blame for all these troubles." Both party leaders are much more reluctant to acknowledge a paradoxical situation whereby the nomenklatura succeeds in "swinging the pendulum" from the Communists to the Rukh people and the other way around while remaining in the shadows in the process. Marmazov said: "Perhaps Kravchuk is indeed trying to put the Communists and the Socialists at odds with the nationalists. However, I consider it more probable that they are not trying to put us at odds, they are simply isolating us." Ivan Zayets: "Indeed, the arrows which the democrats now shoot at the party of power ricochet in the direction of the Socialists and the Communists." However, the two antagonists recognize that the method of "swinging the pendulum" is a quite effective nomenklatura technique to ensure its victory in the elections. The Nomenklatura Changes in the structure of the nomenklatura indicate that Kravchuk's group has suffered a defeat at almost all its positions. This is significant for Ukraine not only because it is certainly the only country in the world in which elections of the executive authority are carried out by the executive authority itself, with the latter calling elections and forming electoral commissions, but mainly because the Electoral Law approved suits only the apparatchiks of the local councils--Plyushch's nomenklatura. This conclusion has become obvious following the adoption of the Electoral Law whose draft called for 50 percent of the members of the TsVk [Central Electoral Commission] and OVK [district electoral commissions] to be appointed at the hand of the president, whereas in the law, the appointment of TsVK and OVK members became the prerogative of the Supreme Council and local councils, that is, the "party" of the speaker. It was ultimately determined "who is who" after Ivan Plyushch stated at an all-Ukrainian meeting of representatives of the president that "the institution of local representatives of the president is ineffective." The intermediate results of the confrontation between the nomenklaturas of Plyushch and Kravchuk, the difference in whose territorial and clan backgrounds has been clear for a long time now, the imbalance which has developed in relations between them, as well as Kravchuk's open attempt to draw on the USPP and the unheard-of fiasco of his calculations indicate that his "party" has no chance of winning the elections. With the exception of the official FPU [Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine] and several groups in the KNDS and the VsRU [All-People's Rukh of Ukraine], virtually nobody supports the president's nomenklatura. And even this support appears ephemeral. The FPU, which is headed by Oleksandr Stoyan, a former adviser to the president, is being torn apart by internal contradictions; for different reasons, the Association of Trade Unions of the Lvov Area (headed by Rukh member Yaroslav Kendzyor) and the Association of Trade Unions of the Kharkov Area (led by the Socialist Viktor Chub) have expressed their disagreement with decisions of the council of the federation. If the FPU had a major influence on 20 million of its members, any opportunity for other political forces would be altogether out of the question. The activity of small propresidential political groups is generally restricted to the vigor of Larysa Pavlivna. Plyushch's nomenklatura has better insurance against a defeat in the elections than any other political force. Each point in the Electoral Law is a step toward the Supreme Council. The already mentioned infamous "labor collective" is the "horse" which is supposed to carry the nomenklatura people between the rock and the hard place--the desire to obtain loans and opposition to market-oriented transformations. The Electoral Law does not define the labor collective at all. Two other laws, the Constitution and the Code of Labor Law, provide either the ideological or the production-oriented definitions of the labor collective, and neither codifies the political role of the labor collective. Sick days, waiting lists for housing, allocation of mineral fertilizer, and the plowing of auxiliary plots are the best starting conditions for the "party of the nomenklatura." Even if a director, kolkhoz chairman, or commander of a military unit wishes to become a deputy before retirement, the law also envisions a soft "way out." Unlike the draft law, which envisioned that public servants may run "if they resign from their post no later than four months before the day the elections are held," in the law (Article 2, Point 5) this provision has magically changed--public servants "may be registered as contenders for candidacy if at the time of registration they submit to the district electoral commission a statement of consent to their dismissal from the position in the event of being elected people's deputies of Ukraine and a statement on the temporary suspension of official powers for the duration of the election campaign." Therefore, the law does not mention the resignation of a deputy before the beginning of the election campaign. If we disregard the touching desire of the current community of people's deputies to protect their director colleagues against the loss of their positions in the event of losing the election, the goal of this "innovation" in the law becomes more transparent: It is hard to imagine that any "young worker" will have the slightest desire to come out against the director at a conference of the labor collective. The director may return after failing at the elections. However, the resourcefulness of the nomenklatura is not limited solely to the nomination of candidates by labor collectives. Article 11 of the law regulates the boundaries of electoral districts. In keeping with the decree of the Central Electoral Commission, the average number of voters in a district should amount to 86,600. In keeping with the same law, deviations in the number of voters may not exceed 12 percent. However, if we analyze the Decree of the Central Electoral Commission, dated 17 December 1993, On Electoral Districts for the Election of People's Deputies of Ukraine, well over a hundred violations of the law may be found there. For example, Pivdennyy Electoral District in Kiev has 66,200 voters, Troyeshchinskiy District--108,600. In Sumy Oblast, Zaliznychnyy District has 112,400 voters, Trostyanetsky District--61,400; in Lugansk Oblast, Lisichanskiy District has 110,100 voters, Lutuginskiy District--62,300. Certainly, the gentlemen from the Central Electoral Commission do not know how to calculate 12 percent. Readers not privy to the secret are surprised: "What difference does it make?" However, try solving a riddle: Where in Kiev Oblast will Ivan Plyushch run--Belaya Tserkov, which has 99,400 voters, or Baryshevets, which has only 64,400 voters? You guessed it. On the other hand, in Galicia, where the nomenklatura has almost no chance of winning the elections, deviations in the number of voters do not exceed those specified in the law. "Trifles" such as "officials [word illegible] on consent to being relieved from positions in local self-government shall have no right to come out in support of a particular candidate, party, or electoral bloc" (Article 36 of the draft) have disappeared from the draft law. A very important section on financing the election campaign is also gone; its draft included many norms which did not allow abuse of the election campaign, in particular, the amount of 500 times the minimum wage as the personal electoral fund of a candidate for deputy, the procedure for remitting funds, and the refusal of candidates for deputy to accept "gifts." Out of a total of 15 points, only eight remain in Article 36; this is an excellent opportunity to compromise a person or, quite the opposite, make him a deputy. It was announced on an oblast TV program that a company, the dubious nature of whose capital is common knowledge in the region, had resolved to give one of the current progressive deputies of parliament a few tonnes of paper as a "gift." They said that the deputy lost his mind before he managed to announce his rejection of the "gift" on that same television; the people had the pleasure of listening to it between 2400 and 0100.... However, unrestricted financing for runoff elections, which promise to become the main point of the elections in view of the number of those eager to a get a taste of the deputy's life, became a particularly strong move on the part of the nomenklatura. Funding for the second round of elections is not regulated in any way. This gives those who have money a splendid opportunity to manipulate the elections, and the "party of power" has an opportunity to frustrate the runoff elections if democratic candidates get through to the second round. It would suffice to mount an "explanatory effort" among the masses, and elections will not be held. Finally, under the circumstances it is surprising that this parliament will operate on a professional basis. Nothing stood in the way of the nomenklatura using the need for an "inseparable bond with the masses" as an argument in favor of the right of a people's deputy to work in production. However, rumors about the number of supporters of combining the art of kitchen maid (on the principal job) with that of parliament member (during time off from the principal job) increasing catastrophically in the Supreme Council may yet come true in some masterpieces from the electoral kitchen.
