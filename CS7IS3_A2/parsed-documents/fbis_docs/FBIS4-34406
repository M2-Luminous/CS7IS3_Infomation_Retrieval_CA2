The barricades erected on Monday by demonstrators linked to the powerful Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) continue to paralyze central Ecuador, blocking all roads and highways and causing an increasing shortage of food and fuel. Prices have skyrocketed in practically all Ecuadoran cities over the last 48 hours following a government announcement that it would not open the roads by force. Monday's negotiation will reportedly be headed by the Ecuadoran president himself, liberal politician Sixto Duran-Ballen, in accordance with demands made by the Conaie leadership, which said the strike will not be lifted until the agrarian law, in effect since 13 June, is repealed. The law was approved 10 days earlier by the opposition-controlled Ecuadoran Congress. Conaie opposes the law because it guarantees ownership of land that is "fulfilling a social mission," thereby limiting the agrarian reform process that has been applied for the past three decades, a period during which, according to official figures, Ecuadoran agricultural production has dropped dramatically. Other Indian organizations support the agrarian law. The government, through Agriculture Minister Mariano Gonzalez, has already said that the "law is good and will be kept." Following the announcement of negotiations on Monday, however, the possibility of sending a reform bill to Congress has not been ruled out. The government has instructed the Army and the police force not to reopen roads as a means of avoiding confrontations, a decision criticized by farmers and other sectors as a sign of the "lack of government authority" and as "goodwill gestures that are absolutely useless." Conaie Spokeswoman Nina Pacari already announced that the roadblocks will not be removed until the Indians' demands are completely met, a position that will give them greater negotiating power before the government due to the increasingly difficult situation faced by the cities under siege.
