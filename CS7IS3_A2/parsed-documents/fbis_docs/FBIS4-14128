FBIS4-14128 "drnes082dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Statement Stresses Claim to Palestinian Land Hamas Statement Stresses Claim to Palestinian Land JN2604140194 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 26 Apr-2 May 94 p 8 JN2604140194 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Text] Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq's interview with AL-SABIL last week and the Political Bureau's 16 April statement sparked controversy among political circles. The news media misinterpreted both the interview and statement. Therefore, we deem it important to publish the following 21 April Hamas Political Bureau statement: In the light of the political concept presented by the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; in the light of the various official and media reactions to what was said; and in the light of the statements made by the U.S. secretary of state and officials in the enemy government and other states, Hamas would like to emphasize the following: 1. Escalation of the brave popular resistance and continuation of jihad and military operations against the occupying enemy will be maintained as long as the Zionist occupation of our blessed Palestinian land is continuing and until our usurped Palestinian soil has been fully liberated from the sea to the river. The Hamas Movement believes that the so-called settlement negotiations currently taking place between the PLO leadership and the Zionist enemy are doomed to failure because they are based on consecrating injustice, aggression, and occupation, and held under Zionist hegemony and arrogance and official Arab and Palestinian weakness. These negotiations are a submission and capitulation to the Zionist and U.S. terms and dictates and conflict with our patient people's will and struggling forces. Hamas also reiterates its clear rejection of the flimsy self-rule. 3. Hamas has presented its political concept through its Political Bureau's statement as well as the statements made by the head of the Political Bureau. These statements were unequivocally clear. However, some news media disseminated them in a mutilated and incomplete manner, suggesting that there is some sort of change in Hamas' policy, programs, and concept of the conflict with the occupying enemy. Some even went so far as to interpret the Movement's statements in their own way, claiming that Hamas proposes peace with the occupying Zionists, recognizes the usurping Zionist enemy, and similar wrong utterances and interpretations. 4. The Hamas Movement's concept as presented to the sons of our people and their struggling forces calls for: A. The unconditional withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. B. The dismantlement and removal of settlements and the evacuation of settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. C. General free legislative elections for the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories in order to enable them to elect their leadership and true representatives. Only this elected and legitimate leadership will be authorized to express our people's will and aspirations. It alone can decide all the subsequent steps of our conflict with the occupiers. 5. Hamas explained through the statements of the chairman of its Political Bureau that if the Hamas Movement and its political program win the confidence of our Palestinian people in general elections, Hamas will then express our people's will and implement its program for the sake of pooling our people's efforts and forces and unifying their ranks for the liberation of all of their territory and holy shrines. If the outcome of the elections is different, Hamas will then respect the opinion of the majority, adhere to their constants and programs, and seek to accomplish them and express their opinion with full freedom and vigor. 6. The above-mentioned statements did not include what some tried to circulate as a Hamas recognition of the usurping Zionist entity, acceptance of Security Council Resolution 242, or relinquishment of Hamas' program and genuine Islamic constants which consider Palestine an Islamic land which should not be ceded, relinquished, or bargained over. Finally, this is Hamas' concept, which was strongly and clearly presented from the position of its escalating jihad. It appeals to all the sons of our struggling Palestinian people and influential forces to rally around this political concept and join hands to implement it on the ground. The Hamas Movement, which expresses the people's will and the pulse of the living Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses, stresses that it will continue its jihad and valiant resistance of the unjust Zionist occupation, along with all the faithful sons of our people, on the path of victory and liberation.
