On Monday Konstantin Kukushkin, the 41-year old driver of our ambassador, was killed in a suburb of the Algerian capital. His wife Nadezhda and seven-year old daughter Irina had remained in Russia. The dead man was the fifth Russian citizen to have died in Algeria at the hands of Muslim fundamentalists in the past six months. The solemn tally was opened on 16 October last year, when Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Valezhnyy and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Orlov, instructors at an air defense school in Laghouat (400 km from the Algerian capital), were killed. Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Loshchilin was wounded on that occasion. In December the fundamentalists gunned down a Russian citizen who was permanently resident in Algeria. On 12 February this year V. Ovcharenko, a specialist working at a thermal electric power station, was killed. Now K. Kukushkin has died. Your ITAR-TASS correspondent has sent the details of this tragedy. Kukushkin went to the Algiers suburb to buy essential spares for the embassy's Lada cars. Having made the purchases he returned to his Toyota minibus which was in a parking bay. He got into the driver's seat and turned the ignition key. At that moment two gunmen suddenly appeared (some witnesses say there were three of them) and opened fire from revolvers aiming at Kukushkin's head. Two of the shots proved fatal. In the words of Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department, the Russian foreign policy department and "other relevant" departments are now working out a set of additional measures designed to protect Russia's interests and the security of our citizens in Algeria. Well, such measures are indeed necessary, but in my view they should have been worked out long ago. After all, the fundamentalists did not begin waging their war on the Algerian authorities just yesterday. To be fair, though, much has already been done. Since November 1993 over 1,500 people have been evacuated to Russia. The Algerians agreed to reinforce the protection of our institutions, and specialists have been transferred away from remote locations and housed together. On the other hand, in the conditions of what is essentially a civil war, no security measures can objectively guarantee the safety of our citizens 100 percent.
