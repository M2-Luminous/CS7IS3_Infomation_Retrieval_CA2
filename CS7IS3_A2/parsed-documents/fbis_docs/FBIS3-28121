The defection of the two, Hideo Den and Masao Kunihiro, who voted against the SDP when an upper house plenary session approved the government's package of political reform bills on Saturday, reduces the parliamentary group's membership from 73 to 71. The party has yet to decide how to deal with a group of other SDP members who rebelled against SDP policy during the vote and opposed the package. Also on Thursday, former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) upper house member Chinpei Nozue, now an independent, joined another parliamentary group composed of governing coalition members of the Japan New Party, Shinseito, and the Reform Coalition Party, increasing the group's membership from 26 to 27. Nozue's defection leaves the LDP with 95 members in the upper house.
