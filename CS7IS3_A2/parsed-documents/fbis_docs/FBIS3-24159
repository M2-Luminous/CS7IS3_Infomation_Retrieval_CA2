We are inspired by Lanovoy's economic program. But we also have our own view of Ukraine's development. The "Greens" advocate market-type reforms, the formation of private property, and the most rapid possible privatization. Moreover, our deputies in the parliament will speak out in favor of radical economic changes in Ukraine--this is our second task at the stage of building state sovereignty. We consider that economic advantage can be brought about only with ecological safety, and--therefore--our programmatic tasks comprise a solution of ecological problems by political methods. We have a special "fondness" for nuclear problems. The decree passed by the Supreme Council on 21 October with regard to continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Power Plant] and repealing the moratorium on putting new nuclear-power generating facilities into operation attests to the fact that not a single step toward restructuring the economy has been taken. The government presently in power has chosen the most dangerous method for satisfying the hypertrophied needs and desires of an ineffective economic system. We declare that the responsiblity for adopting decisions lies on all deputies, regardless of their party affiliations and declared views. The tragic experience of 1986 has taught Ukrainian leaders nothing. The Ukrainian state will be built, experience development, and then disappear from the face of the Earth, while the radioactive blot of plutonium will remain as a testimony to other places and states--a monument to the ignorance of a nation whose representatives we are. And so are the "Greens" not right to take such a stance with regard to nuclear problems? Our attitude toward nuclear weapons is as follows. We consider that nuclear weapons constitute a morally obsolete mode of settling world relations by violent methods. They simply must not be employed. And yet--at the same time--it is hard for the nuclear countries to give up their possession, whereas it is prestigious for non-nuclear countries to possess them. That is to say, to deprive them of having this type of weaponry in the very near future is quite problematical, regardless of any declarations to that effect. At the same time, however, the process of nuclear disarmament has been moved off dead center, and Ukraine's signing of the START Treaty bears witness to that. It is, undoubtedly, a serious step in the direction of our state's nuclear-free status. While advocating such a nuclear-free status, the "Greens" at the same time are fully aware of those problems which have arisen around this yearning. For dozens of years the Ukrainian people--just like all the peoples of the former USSR--worked for the military-industrial complex. As a result of the disintegration of the above-mentioned super-state, Ukraine did not inherit any of this. Having declared itself to be the rightful and legal successor of the USSR, Russia became the de facto heir to all the national wealth. And it is making an attempt to resolve its international obligations by means of the nuclear installations which have remained in Ukraine. It is exerting mad political pressure and distorting Ukraine's official position with regard to the problems of nuclear disarmament in the world community. Under such conditions the "greens" share in the idea that Ukraine must receive compensation for nuclear disarmament as well as guarantees from the nuclear countries. A failure to understand Ukraine's position on this matter, as well as attempts to exert political pressure from the Western countries for the purpose of solving their own security problems at the expense of a country which is beginning to build its own economy do not find support among Ukrainian "Greens." We have come out with an initiative to our foreign-relations departments regarding the discussion of the question of granting Ukraine the status of a permament member of the UN Security Council, as a status which is voluntarily renouncing nuclear weapons. This, to our way of thinking--together with granting the requests by the non-nuclear Germany and Japan to become members of the Security Council--could radically change the situation concerning the dominant concept of nuclear restraint, and it could begin a new phase in developing the world order. But, unfortunately, nobody has listened to us so far. Our party has negatively assessed the changes introduced by the Supreme Council with regard to universal military obligation and military service. The program for gradually professionalizing the Armed Services must provide as soon as possible for the introduction of an alternative type of military service, with guarantees of appropriate rights to all citizens of draftable age--a contractual system for those who have vocational or even professional training and are prepared to perform a term type of service. Spirituality has assumed a particular importance during the present-day period. The rearing and education of whole generations of persons as conscious atheists has facilitated today's manifestations of cynical cruelty, a debauchery of evil-doing, and a criminalization of society. A lack of spirituality is the basic reason for the decline of cultural standards, for the lowered self-esteem of citizens, and for the degradation of the masses. Having set itself the task of humanizing society, the PZU will cooperate with all organizations--whether religious or secular--taking advantage of our own potentials because, of course, we have a significant persentage of teachers and doctors. That is to say, we have a genuine people's intelligentsia, which can be used to form a new consciousness, a consciousness of ecology and of harmonizing the relations between human beings and nature. Our relations with other parties are as follows. Nowadays almost all parties declare their devotion to the ideas of centrism. Under such conditions all that we can do is to repeat the old "Green" slogan: "We are neither on the right or on the left; we are ahead of everybody." That is to say, under the Ukrainian conditions we are ahead of the center. During the period under review we have cooperated--sometimes quite constructively--with almost all the parties. We have not made enemies, but have rather won many friends. These include the Justice Party, with which we have conducted roundtables on topical questions and worked on an economic program for extricating ourselves from the present crisis. These friends also include the Ukrainian Republican Party, with which we have tried to assist Georgian refugees and with which we intend to conduct a Congress of the Political Parties of the Baltic and Black Sea Regions. These likewise include the PDVU [Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine] and the Social Democrats. with which we have cooperated in the movement entiled "New Ukraine." These also include the Constitutional Democrats and the Liberals, with which we have worked on the draft of the Constitutional Assembly.
