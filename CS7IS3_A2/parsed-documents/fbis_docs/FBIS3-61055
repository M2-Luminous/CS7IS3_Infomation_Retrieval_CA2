Golovko, deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy for shipbuilding and armament, under rubric "Armament and Equipment"] [Text] Since olden times Russian people have been connected with naval affairs and have been famed for the art of navigation. The Russian Navy always proudly sailed the waters of all the planet's seas and oceans. And the fact that we had an entire galaxy of innovative scientists who achieved major successes in naval shipbuilding and in creating naval ordnance largely contributed to this. The work of many of them--Ye. Nikonov, S. Dzhevetskiy, V. Yershov, A. Popov, P. Titov, E. Gulyayev, S. Makarov, M. Naletov, I. Bubnov, V. Pyatov--was known far beyond Russia's confines. Russians were pioneers in the development and combat employment of mine and torpedo ordnance. Our scientists also performed great services in the area of radio communications, hydrology, meteorology, cartography, oceanography, piloting and dead reckoning, nautical astronomy, deviation and so on. The traditions of Russian scientists, designers, and creators of combat equipment and naval ordnance were continued in Soviet times. Realization of the latest discoveries in the area of nuclear power engineering, electronics and rocket building permitted the Navy to become truly oceangoing and capable of combating a strong naval enemy. It was in this period the Navy acquired qualities of a long-range Navy and the capability of exerting substantial influence on the course and outcome of warfare in enormous ocean and even continental theaters of military operations. Any state's navy is intended for protecting its interests through naval warfare. Based on this, construction of the home fleet in all historical stages was dictated by an aggregate of factors determined by the disposition of military-political forces in the international arena, the nature and degree of the military threat, missions of ensuring state security stemming from this and, in addition, by established views on the Navy's role and place in the system of the country's Armed Forces and by the country's economic capacities. A scientific-technical direction of creating ships formed with consideration of the growth in combat capabilities of the probable enemy's naval forces and with consideration of conditions for Navy employment in light of general patterns of development of means and methods of naval warfare. A combatant ship is a concentration of complex, interrelated machinery, i.e., a unified system created on the basis of latest achievements of science and technology. Participants in its many-sided, complex process of creation are hundreds on thousands of scientists of different specialties, designers, and personnel of various types of enterprises, and they are navymen and organizers of shipbuilding production and of shipbuilding as a whole. The improvement in naval shipbuilding based on the latest scientific-technical achievements and foremost technologies has acquired especially great importance at the present time, when we began making reasonable sufficiency for defense and not the principle of a competition of strength the basis of Armed Forces organizational development. Therefore the nature of Russia's military doctrine of today envisages a substantial increase in qualitative parameters of armament and military equipment ensuring high combat readiness of our Armed Forces, including the Navy. USSR shipbuilding in the postwar period represented a powerful, involved complex of enterprises for scientific research, planning and design, shipbuilding, instrument making and machinebuilding that were capable of creating any classes of ships, vessels and naval facilities in close cooperation with enterprises of other sectors of industry. With full readiness of its capacities, the sector was capable of supporting an annual output as follows: - ships for the Navy as well as vessels and floating facilities for the national economy with an overall displacement up to 900,000-1,000,000 tonnes, including for export; - consumer goods amounting to around two billion rubles (1991 prices) overall. The status of Soviet shipbuilding basically corresponded to the world level with the exception of the production of electronics and individual set-making articles for vessels, which resulted from our lag in the area of an element base and in production of nonmetallic materials. It gave the USSR an opportunity to have a Navy with an overall tonnage of around four million (the United States now also has around four million) and a civilian fleet (not counting river transport vessels) with an overall deadweight of 24.3 million tonnes (the United States has 23.3 million). In connection with the USSR's disintegration and the political and economic reorganization going on in the Russian Federation, conditions have changed significantly for development and series deliveries of armament and military equipment. A need has arisen to shift production and development of their individual models, including also of set-making assemblies for their manufacture, from former USSR republics to Russian Federation territory. Cooperation of enterprises of defense sectors of industry continues to collapse due to the absence of a precise conversion program and nonallocation of sufficient funds to support production activity of remaining defense enterprises. The sharp limitation of their financing is leading to a reduction in military orders, curtailment of production, a drain of skilled cadres, and a changing specialization of enterprises. And where there still are military orders, the workers' pay is considerably below that of civilian production enterprises. For the very same reason, many Navy ranges and scientific research experimental bases created to support weapon test programs ended up outside the Russian Federation, while those on its territory need additional outfitting with ships and equipment for making path measurements (airborne, underwater) and performing capital construction (shops, berths, storage areas, laboratories, hotels, barracks). Around two-thirds of the overall potential of the former USSR shipbuilding industry now is concentrated on Russian territory. At the same time, the potential is substantially lower for individual kinds of production such as construction of large-tonnage ships and vessels; production of mines, torpedoes, antimine weapons, rolled plate and particularly special sections for shipbuilding; and production of ship gas-turbine plants and radar and sonar equipment. It should be noted that in order to retain the sector's vital capacity Russia requires a transition period lasting a minimum of 5-7 years, during which problems of cooperation must be resolved either by continuing mutual deliveries within the framework of the CIS or by bringing in exports from other countries or by creating Russia's own industries. A possible form of solving the problem seems to us to be bilateral and multilateral government agreements regulating mutual deliveries and the procedure for joint work within the CIS framework. As of today warships which require allocation of significant resources for a period up to 5-6 years for fitting out and which can support the employment in Russia alone of approximately 150,000 workers, including 60,000 highly skilled workers, are on the ways and at the outfitting quays of shipyards in varying degrees of readiness. Cutting up incomplete ships, especially among those on the ways, also requires great expenditures (including moral!) and cannot be performed quickly enough. In case of a refusal to complete the construction of ships, funds will be required for their recycling in amounts exceeding expenditures for fabrication. The situation at hand must be regarded as an emergency and a way out should be found in the shortest possible time. Before the beginning of the 1990's the USSR Navy included two ocean fleets (Northern and Pacific) and two fleets on inland seas (Baltic and Black Sea), as well as the Caspian Flotilla. The Navy order of battle included nuclear powered missile submarines, nuclear powered multipurpose submarines, diesel powered submarines, air-capable ships, cruisers, destroyers, large ASW ships, large patrol ships, small combatant ships, combatant craft of various design projects and support vessels for various purposes. At the present time its ship order of battle essentially has shifted completely to Russia's jurisdiction and now is the basis of the Russian Navy. At the same time the present Navy infrastructure differs substantially from the previous one. Above all this is caused by loss of a number of naval bases in the Baltic, Black and Caspian Sea. But problems facing the Russian Navy and its naval shipbuilding basically were inherited from previous times; moreover, they were exacerbated considerably as a result of the USSR's elimination. All these problems can be grouped along two lines. The first group of problems is insufficient development of fleet systems of basing, servicing and repair and the shortage of support ships and a floating logistic establishment. This is especially characteristic of the North and Far East in connection with difficulties of capital construction in these regions. The second group of problems is the high proportion of obsolete ships with reduced combat effectiveness in the Navy makeup, but which require the very same and in a number of cases even greater expenditures for keeping them in formation than for new ships. In examining the status of naval shipbuilding it is also necessary to consider the status of the civilian maritime and river fleet inasmuch as they are interrelated, since they are determined by activity of the country's unified shipbuilding complex. Therefore, it also seems advisable to make brief mention here of problems facing civilian shipbuilding, as the naval and civilian fleets are created in the same national economic sector. The USSR civilian fleet represented an involved complex, including vessels of various classes and for various purposes as well as ship repair yards, establishments and rather developed port facilities. As a result of partitioning of the civilian fleet, Russia was left with approximately 55 percent of cumulative deadweight tonnage of maritime transport vessels, a little over 60 percent of fishing industry fleet vessels, 30 percent of offshore oil and gas field supply vessels, and 12 of the 27 floating drilling units that were in the USSR. Russia's share of the overall number of former USSR ports today is 53 percent, but it is around 40 percent in cargo volume. This situation on the one hand demanded either conclusion of appropriate agreements on leasing or on joint use of ports or government decisions on constructing new ones, above all in the Baltic and Black Sea. On the other hand, an acute need arose for an accelerated buildup of Russia's civilian fleet tonnage. There is no other way to get out of the existing situation than on the basis of conversion of the shipbuilding industry. Thus, in building a concept for developing the Russian Navy under present conditions it is necessary to take into account such factors as quantitative and structural makeup of the now existing naval fleet; reality of a sharp reduction in appropriations for its construction and upkeep; a change in the world situation as a whole and in the Baltic and Black Sea in particular; the obviousness of the need for Russia to preserve the status of a naval power; and the insistent need for increasing civilian fleet construction rates. In considering the concept of the development of shipbuilding in Russia, one also should bear in mind that shipbuilding is capable of playing the role of a leading sector supporting progress of other sectors of industry and of the country's economy as a whole, as occurred in Japan and South Korea. In addition, Russia's shipbuilding has good chances to be one of the leaders in the world shipbuilding market since, first of all, its level of development in Russia is rather high; secondly, market capacity is sufficient and is around $300 billion for the near term (8-10 years); thirdly, shipbuilding today is shifting to third world countries, and competition with them is within Russia's capability even under today's conditions. An additional argument in this regard is the competitiveness of many of our ship classes with the possibility of their sale on the world market, as demonstrated recently at the IDEX-93 international exposition in Abu Dhabi. Thus, it should be stated that a reduction in the proportion of naval shipbuilding within the overall volume of Russian shipbuilding is a real fact, but it must be emphasized that maximum permissible replacement rates of military products with civilian products at yards of the shipbuilding sector should not exceed 15 percent per year. Otherwise this will lead to "locking up" ways with ships being built on them and to disintegration of labor collectives at these yards. Another question of state importance under present conditions is recycling of written-off ships, especially ships with nuclear power plants, which also requires appropriate capacities. Based on everything that has been said, the concept of development of Russian shipbuilding and arms under present conditions should, in our opinion, provide for the following: Mandatory fitting out of ships and vessels which are in a high degree of readiness, if only to free up capacities for civilian products, i.e., receiving permanent credits for financing their fitting out; licenses for selling a portion of fitted-out ships and vessels on the world market and for sale of secondary resources to direct the proceeds toward renovating shipbuilding and ship repair bases and support sectors; and financing of the program for recycling written-off ships and vessels. For its realization, in the first stage (over the next 3-5 years) we propose to fit out combatant ships and auxiliary vessels which are in various degrees of readiness. At the same time, work must be done to upgrade and renovate the fleet basing and repair infrastructure. In parallel, it is necessary to accomplish work of inspecting the available ship order of battle in order to clarify the status of each specific ship and determine prospects for her further use: Keep some in the order of battle, prepare others for modernization and support such modernization, and mothball still others or send them for recycling (to be written off). At the same time, within the scope of the new military doctrine and new missions facing the Russian Navy, we must not reduce rates of RDT&E and planning work to determine basic directions of Navy development for the future and to form a permanent sliding program of naval shipbuilding for the next 10-15 years. It is quite clear from the studies conducted that we cannot get by without creating new strategic missile submarine cruisers, nuclear and non-nuclear powered multipurpose submarines, aircraft carriers (or air-capable ships), multipurpose surface combatants of the destroyer, frigate and corvette types and mine countermeasures ships, as well as small combatants and new-generation floating logistic support ships and vessels. Today it is premature to speak of a specific appearance and standard types of the above ships. It is enormously more important to emphasize the problem of the need for intensifying test-design work to create weapons, armament and equipment of the future with an optimum combination of high specifications and performance characteristics and with resolution of problems of their standardization, unification, modernization capability, and maintainability. This means that the scale of research and test-design work should not be reduced. Moreover, under present conditions this must be given even more attention than before. Prospects of domestic naval shipbuilding are linked closely with successes and achievements of S&T progress. Its interests lie not only in the area of solving applied S&T problems, but extend to a wide range of basic research in various directions. Therefore naval shipbuilding plans must rely on results of fulfillment of major comprehensive and specific state research and scientific, planning and technological work. The history of domestic naval shipbuilding has shown repeatedly that "ups" and "downs" in the process of constructing ships and vessels had a pernicious effect on the Navy's status for decades. To the contrary, construction of the Fleet requires "monotonous continuity," and this is possible in part with observance of a number of basic conditions, the principal ones of which are long-range (for 10-15 years), specific program planning and stable (with consideration of inflation), continuous financing of the fulfillment of this program. But loss of achievements of our naval shipbuilding may bring broader and deeper consequences than simply a temporary loss of existing military-strategic or political-economic parities in naval armaments. Thus, on the eve of its tricentennial, Russian naval shipbuilding is faced with solving serious new problems. The difficulty of this solution is determined by many political, economic and social factors. But we always must remember our forefathers' behest--"let there be maritime vessels"--and in the situation that is taking shape find real ways to maintain Russia's naval might at a level worthy of a Great Sea Power.
