The State Department follows a different policy from that of the CIA and the Pentagon." Explaining his position, Pellumbi said that "the U.S. State Department initially favored the fall of the communist system as well as the technical support and democratization of Albania. At the same time, there are U.S. military interests in the Balkans and Europe that are separate and are expressed by the Pentagon." Pellumbi also pointed out that "Albania is being strengthened by the United States more militarily than economically. However, this causes concern to the other Balkan states. The Socialist Party has supported from the very beginning that since we participate in the `Partnership for Peace' we should tell the people the whole truth." According to the Socialist Party vice chairman, "no permission can be given to U.S. spy planes to use Albania as a base for their flights over the former Yugoslavia unless the Albanian people are informed in advance, unless some referendum is held to tell them the pros and cons of such a decision." However, Pellumbi expressed his optimism that "recently the State Department's stand has been more positive, their statements are more objective. They give us to understand that they will defend the forces that are based on the people. The U.S. Embassy in Tirana has until now been unreservedly supporting the policy of [Albanian President Sali] Berisha. However, I think that with the arrival of the new ambassador in Tirana in September, the situations will improve." Pellumbi's position on the relations between the Berisha regime and Europe was interesting. He noted that "the biggest problem facing the Albanian Government is its relations with Europe. "Europe calls the Tirana government the `Berisha regime.' With the escalation of tension he applies to Greek-Albanian relations, Berisha wants to tell Europe `look, here are our country's stability and security in danger and you are dealing with human rights and democracy.'"
