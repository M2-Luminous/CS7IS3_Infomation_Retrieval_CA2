FBIS4-48548 "drafr099_b_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 EAST AFRICA Uganda Southern Areas Termed `Disaster' Southern Areas Termed `Disaster' EA2205161894 Kampala Radio Uganda Network in English 1000 GMT 22 May 94 EA2205161894 Kampala Radio Uganda Network English BFN [Text] In light of the grave and dangerous situation created by the large numbers of dead bodies which have been floating in Lake Victoria from River Kagera as a result of the conflict in Rwanda, the Uganda Government has declared part of Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala to be a disaster area. The government statement issued in Kampala this morning says: The government has undertaken and will continue to carry out measures to combat the effect of this disaster. It says the extent and scope of the measures will be announced from time to time by the relevant organs of government. The statement said, Uganda Government is extremely concerned about the large numbers of dead bodies which have been floating in Lake Victoria from River Kagera as a result of the tragic conflict in Rwanda. Sources estimate the number of dead bodies washed ashore into various parts of Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala Districts to be around 10,000, while other sources estimate the number to be as high as four times that figure. The statement adds that the government has noted with appreciation the efforts already put in by various individuals and institutions such as the World Lutheran Federation and the U.S. Agency for International Development, to combat the effect of the disaster. Given the magnitude of the problem however, the statement adds that the government wishes to appeal to the international community to supplement the efforts of the Ugandans in order to arrest the situation. The government also calls upon the warring factions in Rwanda to observe the fundamental rules of civilized conduct by giving their dead a proper burial in their country instead of dumping them into Kagera River. The Uganda Government, the statement concludes, expects that agents of the UN system, currently deployed in Rwanda, will impress this upon the authorities concerned. [Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania External Service in English at 0400 GMT on 22 May in a similar report adds: "More than 600 bodies of Rwandans washed into the Uganda side of Lake Victoria were buried in two mass graves in Uganda this week. The state-run daily NEW VISION reported that the dead victims of ethnic massacres and fighting between government troops and rebels in the past six weeks were buried on on 18 May at Kyebe, about 210 km southwest of Kampala.] ["NEW VISION said authorities were still trying to drag out more bodies from the lake and the Kagera River which flows into Uganda and forms the border between Tanzania and Rwanda.] ["Ugandan authorities earlier issued a warning against drinking unboiled water or eating fish from Lake Victoria, the world's largest freshwater lake."]
