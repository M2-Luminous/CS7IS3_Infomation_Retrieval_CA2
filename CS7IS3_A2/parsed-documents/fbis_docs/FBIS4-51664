Excessive exports are the cause of Japan's trade surplus. As Professor Kishimoto argues, a nation with a bulging trade surplus virtually invites excessive imports, in the end becoming completely dependent on imports to maintain its standard of living. Excessive Export Threshold I believe that Japan's bloated trade surplus is caused by excessive exports, and that any plan to reduce this surplus must include export restraints. This assertion applies not only to our trade surplus with the United States but with Europe as well. Two objections arise immediately. How exactly are exports "excessive"? In comparison to what? And if these "excessive" exports were to be curbed, would it not put an end to the continuing expansion of world trade? Let me respond. First, the argument that exports are "excessive" in comparison to imports assumes that exports should be largely counterbalanced by imports. I nstead of addressing the relative problem of whether exports are too high or imports too low, I believe that we should arrive at a judgment based on a more fundamental standard. I propose the following standard: Japanese exports should not be allowed to threaten the existence of key industries in our trading partners. If, for example, the viability of the U.S. automotive industry were threatened by exports of Japanese automobiles, I would argue that these exports were excessive. Here we are not simply talking about a mere loss of market share, but a threat to the very existence of an entire industry. It is only natural that such exports generate strong opposition from threatened industries in our trading partners. Exports soared because Japanese industry long enjoyed comparative advantages in terms of quality and price. For this reason, I believe that the problem is not a matter of exports being too high or too low. Based on my proposed standard, however, I would conclude that Japanese exports are indeed excessive. I will explain why in a moment. As for the second objection, the argument that world trade would constrict if Japan were to curb exports is based on the inflated assumption that Japan is somehow the engine of global trade expansion. In fact, world trade would probably grow faster if Japan were to make way for other nations to expand. My ideas have been described as "autistic." In other words, I have been accused of adopting an extremely passive attitude, bowing sheepishly and waiting for the problem to pass us by. My detractors charge that I have failed to address the issue of economic development. I believe they are mistaken. It would be great if there were latitude for an expansion in world trade. However, there will be no room for growth until Japan ends its overbearing presence in the world economy. Import Expansion Argument Wrong I am opposed to the argument that Japan is importing too little, which is another way of saying that if Japan only imported more it would reduce its overall trade surplus. Our huge bilateral trade surplus with the United States is the result of the fact that exports to the United States far exceed imports from the United States. U.S. imports of Japanese manufactured goods surpass our imports of U.S. manufactured goods by an even greater margin. In per capita terms, however, U.S. imports of Japanese products and Japanese imports of U.S. products are roughly even. If one were to insist that bilateral trade between the United States and Japan be balanced, we would have to consume nearly twice as many U.S. imported goods per capita in monetary terms than vice versa. That would be virtually impossible to achieve. Because the break-even point has been attained on a per capita basis, I have a hunch that imports have reached a ceiling. At the conclusion of the most recent round of comprehensive trade talks between the United States and Japan, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Joan Spero issued a terse statement. She said that Japan spent only 3.1 percent of its GNP on imports of manufactured goods, less than half the G-7 average of 6.6 percent (excluding Japan). This level, she insisted, was unacceptable to the United States. However, in addition to manufactured goods Japan purchases large amounts of agricultural produce from the United States, including wheat, soybeans, meat, and citrus fruits. Japan has only 30 percent self-sufficiency in these foodstuffs. If Japan were to attempt to meet Ms. Spero's demands, it would have to purchase more agricultural products in addition to manufactured goods. In order to reach bilateral trade parity, Japanese purchases of U.S. products would have to increase by more than double the current level. Thus, we have the argument that Japan cannot stimulate domestic consumption enough to meet American demands. If imports were increased to these levels, domestic consumption would fall. If I were to purchase a foreign automobile, a domestic automobile would not be sold. Domestic demand would therefore decrease. In other words, I believe that we have reached a stage at which boosting imports and stimulating domestic demand is a zero sum game. Economic theory, moreover, instructs us that increased imports do not necessarily lead to decreased surpluses. This assertion is validated by empirical laws and historical experience. If Japan attempts to expand imports beyond what is currently possible, domestic demand for certain products will fall. This will force manufacturers to attempt to sell these unsold products overseas . Thus, exports will rise. In the end, this mechanism may lead to an even larger trade surplus. Because Japan is resource-poor, it has to import raw materials and energy. In order to import these essentials, it has to earn foreign exchange by exporting. As has often been stated in the past, this is no doubt how Japan developed as a modern nation. However, Japan currently earns far more foreign exchange through exports than it needs. This is what I mean by "excessive" exports. As a result of excessive exports, we now face the problem of excessive imports. Take, for example, the recent uproar over the rice issue. Although Japan is small, the lands from the Kanto plain southward are some of the best in the world for paddy-field rice cultivation. However, these lands are not being used to grow rice. Instead, we have attempted to cultivate rice in the less suitable colder regions of Tohoku and Hokkaido where yields are lower. Now, we are forced to consider purchasing foreign rice. However, to purchase this foreign rice we need to earn foreign exchange through exports. If Japan were to become self-sufficient in rice by growing more of it in the temperate regions of the country, we would not have to earn as much foreign exchange. Thus, we would be able to construct a more harmonious global trading order. Surplus Utility Theory Wrong Last year, the following argument became popular among influential economists and bureaucrats: "The Japanese current account surplus is caused by the fact that domestic savings far exceed investments; thus the idea that the Japanese ma rket is closed to outsiders is macroeconomically incorrect." These economists and bureaucrats advocate a long-term "surplus utility theory." I believe this theory is wrong. The economic behavior of households and companies takes into account a variety of factors. When economists base their calculations on categories called "savings" and "investments," the result is that Japan has an excessive savings rate. The implication is that an economic mechanism exists which determines that Japan has an excessive savings rate. When economists base their calculations on categories called "imports" and "exports," the result is that Japan has an excessive current account surplus. These results are believed to be produced by the same economic mechanism. However, this does not mean that it has been theoretically established that the so-called excessive savings rate is the cause of the current account surplus. Even if a cause-and-effect relationship did exist, couldn't we ignore it altogether and just reduce our trade surplus? A trade surplus is not always desirable, even in the case of Japan. Currently, Japan is amassing dollars and dollar-denominated assets as part of its trade surplus. As the yen appreciates on account of this surplus, these accumulated dollar-denominated assets gradually lose value. This extremely inefficient process feeds on itself. Currently, Japan has a huge trade surplus with the world. Practically every nation has a trade deficit with Japan. These nations, overburdened by this trade deficit with Japan, are drained of foreign exchange. In other words, they are deprived of purchasing power. The United States, guarantor of the world's dominant currency, issues paper dollars to finance its trade deficit with Japan. This action naturally produces global inflation. Japan continues year after year to amass huge trade surpluses. This causes severe disruptions of the world economy. For the sake of the world economy, this must come to an end. The pros and cons of a trade surplus have been discussed at length elsewhere. It has been argued that the trade surplus and current account surplus are reinvested in the world economy, increasing global financial liquidity. This argument resembles the surplus utility theory. Unfortunately, it inverts the cause and effect relationship. While a decrease in global financial liquidity is certainly undesirable, so is Japanese domination of global finances. If Japanese behavior creates a liquidity shortage, it is naturally up to Japan to provide financing. However, we should not accept the notion that if Japan breaks the bones of its trading partners it ought to play a role in mending them. What I am saying is different from criticizing the Japanese government for encouraging exports to the United States through unfair practices such as subsidies and dumping, and for restricting imports through tariff and nontariff barriers. The United States is to blame for its own trade deficit. Japan accounts for only half of the U.S. trade deficit with the world. Nevertheless, I believe that we should still consider ways to reduce our bilateral trade surplus with the United States for our own sake. The huge overall U.S. trade deficit is the result of a significant deterioration in its bilateral balance of payments with most of its trading partners. It would be a mistake to attribute the problem exclusively to Japan. Curbing Exports In reducing Japan's surplus, it will be necessary to curb exports. In order to curb exports, it will be necessary to curtail domestic industrial overcapacity. Industrial capacity was increased not to meet domestic demand but to export to overseas markets. This capacity was expanded to the point where it threatened the very existence of entire industries in these overseas markets. This overinvestment has placed Japan in a serious quandary. Unless they find a way to absorb more foreign manufactured goods, Japanese corporations will fail to recover their profitability. This is what caused the problem of excessive exports. The current industrial overcapacity was caused by the behavioral pattern of Japanese corporations which compete fiercely against each other for market share. At the root of the problem is a simple question: Why were some of these corporations still involved in manufacturing ? In the absence of a comprehensive corporate strategy, they merely pursued increased market share by default. The founders of these corporations were by nature goal-oriented. Over time, however, these corporations lost sight of practical business goals and production targets. They continued to manufacture out of force of habit, seeking merely to expand market share. Why then do these corporations continue to manufacture? At one time they were locked in a battle for survival, but as markets have matured they have settled into trench warfare. They take and retake the same stretch of terrain from each other. Even though they suffer from overinvestment in plant and equipment, Japanese corporations continue with business as usual. They become excited about every new innovative product they develop and invest heavily in it. But they have gone to extremes. A bit of soul-searching is in order. This kind of behavior is all too human. Instead of attempting to fix blame, we should be forgiving. My export restriction theory has come under attack with the onset of the recession. If the automobile industry were to curtail exports in the midst of a domestic slowdown, it is argued, automobile production capacity would be needlessly squandered. However, I do not believe this would necessarily be true. Export restriction, in fact, would be a means to prevent further economic deterioration. It can be argued, for example, that U.S. automobile manufacturers continue to suffer from the onslaught of Japanese automobile exports. In order to curtail automobile exports, the Japanese Government could use voluntary export restraints and export tariffs. A 100-percent export tariff would raise the price of Japanese cars in the United States, thus having the effect of curtailing exports. With a 100-percent export tariff, a car which retails for 1.3 million yen in Japan would sell for 2.6 million yen in the United States. The 1.3 million yen export tariff would be paid by American consumers, but would go to the Japanese Government. Let's say that sales of Japanese automobiles in the United States fell by 1 million units as a result of the 100-percent tariff. The Japanese automobile industry would sustain a big hit. However, those 1 million cars would, in effect, be purchased by the Japanese Government. In other words, the Japanese Government should use the export tariff revenue to place orders with Japanese automobile companies. The purchase of standard prod uction vehicles is one possibility, but the purchase of expensive special vehicles which cost several million yen is another. As I have mentioned in earlier proposals, Setagaya ward in Tokyo owns only two special vehicles for transporting the infirm and elderly. With my proposal we could realize a goal of 100 special vehicles per every several hundred thousand people. This is but one example of how we could convert exports into domestic demand. It is possible to convert excessive exports into domestic demand. In so doing, we could bring an economy suffering from reckless over-investment to a soft landing. Eve of U.S.-Japan Trade Reversal There is something else we should not forget. We are on the verge of a great reversal in U.S.-Japanese trade relations, even as our trade surplus with the United States reaches a record $150 billion dollars. This may seem paradoxical to many, but I was predicting this situation seven or eight years ago. The yen has continued to appreciate along with our expanding trade and current account surpluses. As a result, cheaper foreign goods are slowly changing consumer behavior in Japan. With the exception of some regions, imports have grown dramatically. If this pattern continues , Japan will soon become a "completely import dependent country" (CIDC). If this happens, the yen will begin to depreciate vis-a-vis the dollar because Japan will no longer be a net exporter. Manufactured goods will be purchased from offshore facilities owned by Japanese corporations, and almost all agricultural goods will be imported from abroad. When this occurs, currencies depreciate. Since CIDC's are profitable to global producers, CIDC currencies become cheaper. Thus, the Japanese currency will once again lose value. This is my scenario for the U.S.-Japan economic reversal. I have a hunch that we are too optimistic about import expansion. For example, many in the financial community believe that both our cost of living and standard of living will improve without wage increases because of cheap agricultural imports. With wage increases in check many expect a revival in Japanese competitiveness, but I think it is highly unlikely. It is because we are on the verge of a great reversal that the yen is so high. I believe there is a possibility of the dollar dropping below the 100-yen level to the 90-yen mark. This will intensify the outward migration of Japanese corporations. Until recently, Japan earned most of its foreign exchange from four industries: automobiles, consumer electronics, general machine tools, and steel. With the exception of a few product lines, most of these industries will move production offshore. The export industries which generated the huge surpluses will disappear from Japan. Dependence on agricultural imports, however, will continue. We are setting record trade surpluses because we are in the final stage as an exporter. However, the record trade surplus does not mean that Japan is strong. Japan's clay feet are already crumbling. Japan, however, still appears to be a giant because of these clay feet. Thus, Japan bashing has ironically become more intense. Japan is passing through a very paradoxical phase. In order to avoid this scenario, we must undertake "emergency evasive maneuvers." For example, consumers should make a clear "declaration of intent" to eat only Japanese rice except in times of emergency. It would then only be a matter of time before we reached self-sufficiency in rice. If the world thinks we are foolish for eating expensive Japanese rice instead of cheap American or Thai rice, we should remain unfazed. We should not base our purchasing decision exclusively on price. Industries continue to move offshore. If this trend continues unabated, it would be a tragedy. However, it may be too late to prevent even key industries from leaving. For this reason, we will have to develop new industries.
