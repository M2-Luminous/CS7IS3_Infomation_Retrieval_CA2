Commenting on the proposal to extend the powers of the parliament and the president for a second term Rybkin said that first people should feel the economy is being stabilized and life improved as a result of actions taken by the Federal Assembly (parliament - IF) and the government. The proposal to extend the president's and parliament's powers was put forward by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. Before leaving for Siberia and the Far East Rybkin answered questions during a press conference by phone organized by the Russian State Duma's press service and Interfax. Rybkin said that the legislative process must be seen to be working. He said if the work was properly carried out and the legislative bodies of at least two thirds of the federation's constituent members spoke for this, the chamber could discuss the postponement of elections. However, he added that it was unreasonable to speak on the postponement of elections in advance. Rybkin stressed that during his trips across Russian regions voters kept saying they were tired of elections. Commenting on the recommendation of the State Duma to suspend the president's anti-crime decree, Rybkin said the president had been asked not to enact the decree until a resolution on its implementation is adopted. Rybkin stressed that the decree was not simple and that its basic idea -- the fight against crime -- could not be rejected. Rybkin said he was sure that the decree would soon become law. He repeated that the State Duma had decided to set up a working group in order to draft the appropriate law with the participation of representatives of the president, the government, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office. When asked his opinion on proposals to declare direct presidential rule in the country, Rybkin said he doubted that Boris Yeltsin would introduce it and that the whole concept was inadmissible in a country trying to establish the rule of law.
