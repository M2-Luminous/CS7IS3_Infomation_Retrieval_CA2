All the signs indicate that this is the last act of the liberal parties' cooperation concluded before the elections. Laszlo Kover [head of the Fidesz parliamentary group] is at the microphone with Dora Adorjan: [Begin Kover recording] [Fidesz Presidium member] Janos Ader and I received Gabor Kuncze [head of the SZDSZ parliamentary group] and [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto, who, in the terms of the agreement with the SZDSZ, informed us that they have received a request from the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] to take part in the coalition discussions and that, as is known, they were given the mandate for this by the delegates' assembly. Apart from this, they inquired what would be Fidesz's possible reaction to a coalition invitation. To this we were able to reply by saying what we have already said, namely that we cannot reply to a nonexistent invitation. If an official request arrives from the MSZP, then the national board will satisfy the duties that devolve upon it from the statutes. It will discuss a possible invitation and decide on it. If the SZDSZ raises this issue at the talks with the MSZP -- incidentally, although it has the right to do this, it can only do so on its own behalf -- we have asked them that in any event they should do it in such a way that it should be clear that it is their opinion and that they are not conveying some kind of message.
