In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, he said this repulsive crime exemplifies the hatred felt by Zionists toward our Palestinian Arab people and confirms the impossibility of cohabitation with the invaders and killers who usurped Arab land and honor. He called for the intensification of the intifadah as the correct response to Zionist crimes and violations of Palestinian human rights. Hammudi urged dynamic Arab forces and the international community to condemn this appalling massacre and its imperialist backers, especially the U.S. Administration -- the Zionist entity's strategic ally. The blood of innocent martyrs is an offering for the redemption of Palestine from the abomination of the racist, hateful Zionist occupation, Hammudi said.
