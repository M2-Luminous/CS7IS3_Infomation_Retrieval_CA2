As is known, the work of this commission is headed by reform minister Liia H�anni, others attending were ministers Jaan Leetsaar, Kaido Kama and Andres Tarand. Those gathered listened to information about how land reform and ownership reform are coming along in the V�orumaa district. An overview was given by Tiit Soosaar, the new district elder of V�orumaa and Tiiu J�oe, head of the V�orumaa Land Office. There are more than 200 registered pieces of real estate in the V�orumaa district, making it one of the three leading districts in the republic. One could say that property returns in Vrumaa have been carried out successfully even though, by now, progress is coming to a halt, as it has everywhere else. People are no longer in a hurry to become landowners, because there is no profit in cultivating land, they are interested more in getting the land back or getting compensated for it. Not having a land assessment law, however, has brought all of this to a standstill. Jaan Leetsaar, minister of agriculture, told this reporter later, by way of a comment, that he is very much concerned about the situation faced at the time of spring plowing. There is no sense of security neither for those owning the land, nor for those currently using it. The minister thought that it was high time for the parish governments to assemble legally entitled owners and current users of land around a negotiating table and reach a peaceful agreement about land management. The bill of the cadastral law was also discussed by the commission. A review of it was presented by Valter Aasm�ae, one of the principal authors of the bill. Next week, all members of the government commission will give their opinions on the bill, whereupon it will be introduced to the ministries. Land Office advisor Toomas Kutti thought that the cadastral law could be passed by Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] in a month-and-a-half, at the earliest. The commission also talked about the bill for land assessment law, now in its second reading in Riigikogu. No changes were deemed necessary in that bill. At virtually all of the sessions of the government's land reform commission, there has been talk about people who are to carry out land and ownership reform--pointing out that there are not enough of them and those who are available do not have the necessary training. The agricultural school at Kehtna has been preparing people for this job and it also has a special curriculum for it. However, it is high time that both the agricultural and technical universities start training a new crop of reformers. The commission was also seeking ways to simplify the procedures for turning land and structures over to municipal ownership.
