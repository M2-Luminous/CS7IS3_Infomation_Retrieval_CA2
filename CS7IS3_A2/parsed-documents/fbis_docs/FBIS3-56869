The changes mean a switch from purely monetarist methods pursued by Yegor Gaydar in managing economy, however the government will not focus on boosting production by any means. "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will not permit its substitution by a fetishism of production", the prime minister told a press conference on Thursday. But he rejected rumours about the change of the strategic course. "I have to tell you that rumours that this Janaury the course (of reforms) is changing are incorrect. I state with all responsibility that this is not so", Chernomyrdin said. The presidential course towards a deep transformation of the Russian society "was, is and will be". "We have everything necessary for that and the main guarantors are the president and the Constitution", he added. But "we plan a correction in the course of reforms", he said and explained that the correction means a switch from purely monetarist instruments to other measures tested in many European countries. These measures envisage the creation of a true competition on the Russian market and in the economy between Russian and foreign producers. This signals "big openness of the russian economy to world economy", Chernomyrdin said. Artificial barriers on the way of foreign goods and capitals to Russia will be lifted, according to the prime minister. The government also plans to conclude general agreements with the trade unions and producers in order to curb inflation. The package of such measures is being drafted, he said. But the prime minister admitted that the rouble exchange rate might continue to fall. "This is an objective and inevitable process. The rate will change, we will not be able to stop it and we do not set such a task for ourselves", he said.
