It should be said that since the Socialist Party's European election flop, criticism has been raining down on him from all directions. Marie-Eve Malouine reports from Rue Solferino, where a meeting of the Socialist Party bureau is taking place: [Malouine] Michel Rocard is facing up to his responsibilities. The first secretary considers that he bears the major responsibility for the 12 June results. The Socialist leadership asked him to put a question mark over his candidacy in the presidential elections. He has agreed. It is the Socialists who will choose their candidate, but the time has not yet come. Anyone who so wishes can run, but these concessions made by Michel Rocard do not yet mean he is abdicating. The very serious failure in the European elections, the first secretary said, is an individual and collective failure for the party. Renewal of the Socialist Party is imperative, and Michel Rocard announced that he will be the one to oversee it. He is to make these proposals at the first national council meeting -- very likely on 19 June -- at which he will ask for a vote of confidence, a way of regaining a certain legitimacy. This is not the most difficult challenge, however, as Michel Rocard goes for double or nothing.
