According to the Federal Finance Ministry, the highest ever compensation had to be paid in 1993, owing to payment problems of several debtor countries. The Federal Government had to spend approximately 7.5 billion German marks [DM] to cover Hermes [credit insurance company] guarantees -- twice as much as in the record year, 1992. The Finance Ministry states in its confidential 1993 annual report that these expenditures compare with receipts of no more than DM2.9 billion. The report, which contains data on foreign and domestic trade and payments guarantees, illustrates that the serious financial situation will be further aggravated further for the Federal Government in the current year. An essential reason for this is the fact that the receipts from payments, the reflux of capital, and interest paid last year increased from DM1.1 billion (1992) to DM2.9 billion, which was attributable to unexpected high receipts from debt rescheduling agreements with Brazil and Russia. In this connection, the experts in the Federal Finance Ministry say, however, that this relatively favorable trend regarding receipts will not repeat itself in the foreseeable future, and that another deterioration of the ratio of receipts and expenses must be expected. Increasing Deficit The resultant deficit influencing the cash funds in the federal budget increased from DM1.95 billion in 1992 to approximately DM4.63 billion last year. If we only consider payments and the real reflux of capital (not including interest), the Federal Government's cash deficit even increased to DM5.7 billion. Of this amount, DM5.1 billion (DM2.3 billion in 1992) fell to Hermes, which, regarding liabilities, receipts, and expenses, constituted the largest share by far in foreign trade and payments guarantees. The deficit that has accumulated in this area since 1950 -- not including interest received and imputed interest paid -- reached the DM19-billion mark by the end of 1993. This accumulated loss from federal export guarantees currently compares with claims transferred to the Federal Government of DM27.2 billion in compensation payments to German exporters. However, according to the Finance Ministry, the volume of these claims can hardly be assessed realistically regarding the expected reflux. Depending on the extent to which such claims are realizable and on the development of the loss potential contained in the Federal Government's overall liabilities, the Federal Finance Ministry says that the question must be answered of whether the Hermes guarantees will be adequate over the long term, or whether another increase in payments must be considered. In any case, it is clear that high expenses for debt rescheduling and payments for political damage must also be expected in the future. Broken down by countries, the Federal Government's liabilities in 1993 clearly increased for Russia and China, whereas they declined in the case of Iran. Ranking at the top in 1993 of export deals guaranteed by Hermes in the past was the former USSR (with a volume of DM18.2 billion), followed by Iran with DM9.3 billion, and Brazil with DM8.9 billion. Ranking fourth, however, is the "new" Russia with approximately DM8.6 billion, which is above all attributable to the high pledges to cover exports from the new federal laender. Following are Iraq with DM7.2 billion, South Africa with DM6.1 billion, and China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Indonesia each with approximately DM5.5 billion. In the category of untied financial credits guaranteed by Bonn, it is again the former USSR that ranks first (approximately DM7.4 billion), followed by Poland with less than DM2 billion and Hungary with DM1.6 billion. In the group of German capital investment abroad, the former CSSR ranks first with DM1.2 billion, followed by the People's Republic of China with DM876 million and Hungary with DM769 million. The former USSR plays a relatively insignificant role here, accounting for no more than DM48 million. Nonetheless, the sum of all three categories (export deals, untied financial credits, and capital investment) makes the former USSR account for the largest overall liabilities of approximately DM25.6 billion, followed by Brazil (DM9.6 billion), Iran (DM9.4 billion), and the new Russia (DM8.6 billion). More Differentiated The Finance Ministry estimates the existing spending risk at approximately DM20.8 billion. While the credit standing of the successor states of the former USSR -- with the exception of the Baltic states -- has been assessed in the past as being more or less equal, Bonn is now increasingly taking different developments of the individual CIS republics into account and now defines the covering options for each country separately.
