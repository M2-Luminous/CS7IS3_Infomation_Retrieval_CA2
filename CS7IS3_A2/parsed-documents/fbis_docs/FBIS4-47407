Primary antigenemia, however, is known to precede seroconversion, a fact that makes the creation of test systems for determining HIV antigens desirable as a possible early diagnostic tool. Since monoclonal antibodies to viral proteins have high specificity and homogenicity, they are ideally suited just such test systems. The researchers here produced a total of 152 hybridomas whose monoclonal antibodies react in EIA with _b_-galactosidase-grafted recombinant proteins that are products of HIV-1 and HIV-2 gag and env genes. The list of hybridomas was narrowed down to 10 whose antibodies interact with a recombinant HIV antigen only. Three clones -- 24/13, 24/16, and 24/26 -- produced antibodies to the HIV-1 gag gene and reacted with natural viral proteins. The antibodies of 24/16 and 24/46 interacted with p24 only, whereas 24/13 interacted with p55 and seven polypeptides that were not fully processed products of the HIV-1 gag gene. In EIA, 24/46 interacted with both the HIV-1 antigen and the HIV-2 antigen. The three clones have different protein-binding sites. Two clones -- 41/23 and 41/128 -- produced antibodies to the protein product of the HIV-1 env gene. Five hybridomas -- 38/3, 38/8, 38/12, 38/15, and 38/17 -- produced antibodies to the HIV-2 env gene. Figures 2, references 11 (Western).
