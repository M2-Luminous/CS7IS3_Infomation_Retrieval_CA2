The Spanish General Luis Feliu is also the head of the Spanish contingent in former Yugoslavia. He will hand over to another general from our country, General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo. On the eve of the handover we contacted both military men. Good evening General Luis Feliu. [Feliu] Good evening. [Announcer] How has the conflict in Bosnia changed since you arrived on the scene a few months ago? [Feliu] Well, once again we are at a critical juncture. And I say once again because exactly when I took over, at the end of July, an important cease-fire agreement was signed by the three military leaders and it should have been enforced once the Geneva peace agreement was signed. And then, I chaired a series of meetings held at the level of seconds in command of the three military factions also to develop this cease-fire agreement. [passage omitted] Luckily, today there is a new glimmer of hope, an important glimmer of hope. There is no new cease-fire because theoretically the former one could still be enforced, but we do have reasons to hope for Sarajevo. There are beginnings of partial agreements on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry and this is important because it creates the conditions to reach -- maybe -- God willing -- a definitive peace agreement. The work of the blue helmets has always been constructive. But many can object that nothing has been gained, nothing concrete. But I would tell them two things if I may. One, just think what would have happened if the blue helmets had not been there, think what would have happened without the humanitarian aid and without our presence. And secondly, the blue helmets -- and this is very important -- did not come here to impose peace, not even to negotiate it. We have to render humanitarian aid possible and create conditions favorable to a peace agreement. [Announcer] So you made a positive assessment of the blue helmets' work. But do you agree with the criticisms made by some blue helmet commanders about how the UN forces lacked means to enforce international resolutions?. [Feliu] Well, as for the first part of the question, yes, I do made a positive assessment because it has been so. [passage omitted]. As for the criticisms, I say that first I do not normally comment on personal criticisms. And I do not think that I should criticize my immediate superior, in this case General Briquemont [passage omitted]. All of us would have liked to have more forces, or at least some more forces so as to be able to accomplish our missions better and avoid tiring or exhausting our units. [Announcer] As you mentioned you are leaving Bosnia at a crucial moment, now that NATO has set an ultimatum to those who are besieging Sarajevo. How well is the security of the blue helmets ensured -- specially those closer to Sarajevo -- in case of air strikes? [Feliu] No one can ensure -- and even less so in a war -- even though it is not our war, we are in a war -- 100 percent security. And the proof is that sadly our blue helmets have suffered casualties - and why not recall here the Spanish casualties. But I can say that all necessary precautions have been taken. If there were air attacks, they would be decided by the appropriate authorities and after an adequate analysis and examination, taking into account the situation. [Announcer] General Feliu, tomorrow you will be succeeded in Bosnia as deputy head of UNPROFOR and head of the Spanish contingent by General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo who is also on the line with us. General Leal, good evening. [Leal] Good evening. [Announcer] What advice has General Feliu given you? How do you feel as you take on this job? [Leal] Well, optimistic and full of good will. I have only been here for a couple of days. [passage omitted] [Announcer] General Leal, right now international attention is focussing on Sarajevo, but there are other, many other flash-points in the Bosnian war. Are the Spanish blue helmets in Mostar suffering from any kind of marginal risk because of the ultimatum in Sarajevo? [Leal] I do not think that there are any marginal or additional, risks for the Spanish contingent because of the ultimatum. All the measures have been taken to avoid these risks. [Announcer] So if there were to be possible reprisals because of air strikes, the reprisals would not reach the Spanish contingent? [Leal] I really do not think so. No, really not. [Announcer] Is it your opinion, General Leal, that the solution to the war in Bosnia is an international military action or should this be part of a diplomatic solution? [Leal] That is not a question I can answer particularly well. However, I believe that the solution to this war, like any other war, does not necessarily have to be military action. And I hope that it will be like that, for everyone's sake. There is always time to find a negotiated solution. [Announcer] General Jose Antonio Leal Castillo and General Luis Feliu, thank you for answering this phone call from Radio Nacional and good luck in your new jobs.
