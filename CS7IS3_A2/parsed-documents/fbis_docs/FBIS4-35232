In a report published today, citing arrivals from that area, the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that this massacre, in which an entire family of a mother and her five children were killed, was planned by two criminals; namely, Jabbar Faraman, who is called the minister of peshmerga affairs; and Shaykh Ja'far, a military commander in the so-called Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which is led by Jalal Talabani. This was part of a plan worked out by the traitor Talabani to liquidate the Kurds who are hostile to his treasonous political line and who reject his affiliation with the foreigners. Mas'ud Barzani still rejects Talabani's return from Damascus to his headquarters in Iraqi Kurdistan via the area of Bahdanyan [name as received] under Barzani's personal guarantee. Military confrontations between the groups of these two renegades are still raging in several areas of Iraqi Kurdistan.
