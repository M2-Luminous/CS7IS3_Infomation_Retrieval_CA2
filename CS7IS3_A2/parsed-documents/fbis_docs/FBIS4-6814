He quoted the army chief as saying that the war in Cambodia had been going on for more than 10 years and, if it continued, it would affect Thailand and the good relationship between Thailand and Cambodia. Col Phalangkun said the peace conference between the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge to be held next month at the behest of King Sihanouk was Cambodia's internal affairs. The Thai armed forces, he said, wanted peace restored in Cambodia. "The best way to bring about peace is to stop fighting and for all sides to reconcile," he said. First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo voiced support for King Sihanouk's peace initiative "because the policy of the Government and the Thai armed forces is to see peace and reconciliation being restored in Cambodia." He said he had told the Burapha Task Force on the eastern border to compile evidence of cross-border shelling and the flow of Cambodian refugees into Thailand. "We want the Cambodian refugees to speak out openly when they want to go home because previously we were always accused of forcing the Cambodians back," Lt-Gen Chettha said. About 100 more Cambodian refugees fled to the border of Ta Phraya district in Sa Kaeo Province on Friday night for fear of a Khmer Rouge attack on their village. The refugees from O Bai Chuan village, mostly women and children, were settled in a temple in Ban Non Mak Mun. One of the refugees, Mrs Chao, 68, told Thai police that they escaped because they heard that Khmer Rouge guerrillas would attack their village and would kill all men wearing army uniform.
