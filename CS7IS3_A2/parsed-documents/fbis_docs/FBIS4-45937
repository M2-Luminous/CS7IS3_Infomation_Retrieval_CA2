More than half of the Rs 355-crore programme, including construction of new plants on the sprawling 500-hectare NFC [Nuclear Fuel Complex] campus at Moula Ali near here, has been completed. With the commissioning of the new plants, the annual production of fuel bundles would be doubled to 32,000 annually by the end of 1995, the NFC chief executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, said. The NFC now produces 16,400 fuel bundles--the most critical components of reactors--besides zirconium alloy mill products. It supplies to the country's nine operating nuclear power plants, including two each at Tarapur, Narora, Kalpakkam and Kota and one at Kakrapara.
