Senior Lieutenant General Le Kha Phieu, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee attended. Evaluating the results of the two-year implementation of objectives and tasks set forth by the 13th province party organization congress, Comrade Nguyen Ba, member of the CPV Central Committee and secretary of the province party committee, said: Over the past two years, the socioeconomic situation in Nghe An has developed fairly comprehensively. The province's overall growth rate was relatively higher than in preceding years with an average agricultural growth rate of 6.15 percent. The province has basically been able to tackle its food grain issue. Its gross industrial output value in 1993 increased by 9.4 percent over 1992. Trade, support services, and foreign economic activities have undergone several changes for the better. The province's cultural, educational, public health, and sports activities as well as efforts to solve unemployment and to implement various social policies have showed great improvement. Livelihoods have become less difficult and are becoming stable. The face of various cities, towns, and rural areas has undergone rapid changes for the better. However, as a poor province, Nghe An's economic growth rate is still regarded as slow and much lower than the national average. In the years ahead, Nghe An must strive to improve its economic structure in the direction of gradually industrializing and modernizing various local economic sectors to achieve a rapid increase in the volume of marketable products. It must vigorously develop its trade and support service activities to considerably increase their share of the gross social product. It must develop education and public health, carry out the motto of eradicating hunger and reducing poverty, encourage the people to enrich themselves legally, and stabilize and improve the people's lives. The conference directed that the following targets be achieved by the province during the period ahead: -- agricultural output value must achieve an average annual increase of 6.2 percent in a bid to yield 820,000 to 850,000 tons of food grain. -- gross industrial output value must achieve an average annual increase of 14 percent. -- gross social product value must achieve an average annual increase of 7 percent. -- national revenue must achieve an average annual increase of 8 percent. Addressing the conference, Comrade Le Kha Phieu urged Nghe An to ascertain the strengths and advantages of each economic area in order to come up with effective investment measures to help achieve national socioeconomic development and to avoid being left behind compared with other localities nationwide.
