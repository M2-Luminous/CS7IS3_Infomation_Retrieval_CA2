"In my judgment," Perry said at a Pentagon news briefing, "there is no military crisis at this point between the United States and South Korea on one hand and North Korea on the other hand." He described the political situation in the Korean peninsula as "a very serious problem." "But we are pursuing that not with military options but with diplomatic options," Perry added. However, he claimed that "we will make and are making prudent and appropriate defensive precautions, but we will do them in a careful way." The United States has decided to move forward the deployment date of Patriot missiles in South Korea. The Patriots will be in South Korea and deployed in about a month. "Our rationale for moving the timing up was not because we thought there was an imminent danger," Perry explained, "but because we were concerned that with the way the political developments were going and that there might be a confrontation point or a crisis point later in the year." The secretary said the United States is monitoring this situation very carefully and consulting extensively with South Korea about any defensive measures needed. "If and when the United Nations decides to authorize sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Perry claimed, "at that time we will certainly want to increase the defensive measures." Perry announced that he will travel to South Korea next month to discuss "a number of short-term measures" that are being taken to improve the readiness of the 34,000 U.S. forces stationed in South Korea.
