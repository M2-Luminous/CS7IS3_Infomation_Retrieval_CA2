Yitzhaq Rabin claimed Syria has not yet made a strategic decision on peace. He accused the Lebanese Government of failing to provide security in the southern border areas. Rabin said Israel does not covet a single inch of the territories of Lebanon or Jordan, without mentioning the occupied Syrian Golan. He said he is ready to withdraw his forces from Lebanon if the Lebanese Government disarms the national resistance and provides security to the Israeli occupation forces for a trial period of six months. His third condition was merging the agent militias or South Lebanese Army, which was established by Israel, into the regular Lebanese Army and assigning the task of security in the south to them. The Israeli rulers have over the last two and half years of Washington talks failed to drag Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to partial, inequitable agreements as a result of the three countries' adherence to the principles of a just and comprehensive peace, the Security Council resolutions, and international law. In view of this evident failure, the Israeli rulers could do nothing but level accusations, intensify falsehoods, and reverse facts. Daily events refute Israeli officials' claims and condemn their double-standard policy. Syria presented objective and balanced proposals for peace in the Middle East at the sixth round. These proposals were discussed by the Syrian and Israeli delegations throughout the subsequent rounds. However, Israel evaded the Syrian paper because it called for full withdrawal from the Golan. Likewise, Lebanon has throughout the recent rounds sought to obtain an Israeli agreement to implement Security Council Resolution No. 425, but to no avail. Israel insisted on its well-known impossible conditions. Israel wants the Arabs to fully recognize it, to fully open their borders with it, to establish economic ties with it, and to sign treaties with it, but without committing itself to full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. In the same manner as it is talking about testing Lebanon's intentions, it is also talking about testing Syria's intentions. Testing Syrian intentions will continue for several years. As for Lebanon, Israel is looking forward to maintaining control of the south through its agents, to whom it is extending both salaries and weapons. It stipulates that those agents should be responsible for security in the south. All this will take place after disarming the national resistance and setting the stage for Israel's agents to do what they like in the various areas of the south. The situation is not different in the case of Jordan, for Israel stipulates that a peace treaty should be signed and ties be normalized before any commitment to the relevant UN resolutions is announced. Israel wants to drag the Arab parties participating in the peace process to partial, phased agreements that consecrate the Arabs' relinquishment of Security Council resolutions, the Madrid conference formula, and the principles of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, as it did with the Palestinian side. While such phased agreements will secure an Arab recognition of Israel and open the markets for its products, they do not secure an end to occupation or restoration of occupied Arab territories. The region will consequently be mortgaged to Israel's policies and expansionist schemes. Syria cannot be swayed by delusions nor can it barter the Security Council resolutions with ambiguous promises. Peace, in Syria's opinion, is possible immediately after Israel's withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the rest of the occupied territories, and after Israel's compliance with the Security Council resolutions. Syria firmly believes inequitable agreements are doomed to failure because they do not lead to a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. A firm and stable peace should secure justice, fairness, and equality. In other words, partial withdrawal cannot lead to peace. What is required is the dismantling of all settlements and the full departure of the occupation troops. Only then can the desired peace prevail in the Middle East.
