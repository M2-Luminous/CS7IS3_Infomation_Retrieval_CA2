Urging the members not to be misled by the vicious opposition propaganda about the Government's new economic policies, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and Commerce Minister Pranab Mukheriee maintained that the country's economic sovereignty would not be compromised at any cost. Interestingly, former Union Mimster N. D. Tiwari moved the economic resolution, which was seconded by Mr Mukherjee. Mr Tiwari emphasised that the economic reforms were meant to overcome challenges of the future particularly in the 21st century. Mr Tiwari said the economic reforms were not for improving the stock markets and the like but to give a push to socio economic policies envisaged by Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi. He had no doubt that India would be one of the big powers in the 21st century. "We will ensure that nobody can dictate to us." Mr Tiwari said one must be realistic about where the world was heading and these reforms were necessary for allround development and the uplift of the poor. In this context, he said China was also looking outwards and wanting to become a member of GATT as also Vietnam and Fidel Castro's Cuba. Mr Mukherjee attacked the Opposition accusing it of spreading misconception. Stoutly defending the Centre's decision to initiate steps to attract more foreign direct investment, he said these were required for higher growth. "Our economic reforms are not a pipe-dream", Mr Mukherjee said and lauded the middle path adopted by his Government. Dr Manmohan Singh made it clear that the Government was providing all possible encouragement to the public sector. He said they wanted the public sector to be profitable because these could be ploughed for the benefit of poorer sections in the rural areas. Dr Singh said the Government was committed not to retrench public sector employees while restructuring PSUs [public sector units]. "We will not allow the Indian working class to suffer." Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar charged the BJP with misleading the farmers on the GATT agreement even though the Opposition did not know about all the existing varieties of seeds.
