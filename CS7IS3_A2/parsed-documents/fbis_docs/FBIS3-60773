Rimando] [Text] Pagadian City -- At least 10 persons were blasted to death, while some 25 others were seriously wounded when a grenade believed hurled by members of the New People's Army (NPA) exploded in an overcrowded public market in Barangay [village] Bagumbang, Bonifacio town, Misamis Occidental at 2 p.m. yesterday. A sketchy police report received here said six died on the spot, while four others expired on the way to hospitals. The report identified only three of the fatalities. They were Inday Monteramos, Undo Saguin, and a certain "Dodong." The wounded were taken to government hospitals in Ozamiz City and Tangub City, some 40 and 25 kilometers, respectively, north of Bonifacio town. Misamis Occidental Representative Hilario Ramiro Jr., a resident of Ozamiz City, led government hospital staff in attending to the wounded, some of whom were given a 50/50 chance to survive.
