N. Voronin, Moscow Aviation Institute; UDC 621.3/535.2] [Abstract] A medical radio-tomograph is proposed. The tomograph is designed for active selective diagnostics in conjunction with frequent therapy of internal organs in the millimeter to decimeter wave range. Its functioning is based on combining the principles of selective holography with adaptive location. The methodology of microwave nonlinear tomography, based on methods of contrasting substances, a priory radio- testing and adaptive self-focusing of radio-illumination is described. A diagram of the radio-tomograph is provided and the algorithm of its functioning is also described. Implementation of the proposed scientific principles and engineering solutions would improve the spacial resolution, the contrast range, and the information content of radio-holograms; expand the spectrum of applications (biomedical diagnostics, selective analysis and thermal processing, non-invasive defectoscopy etc); and increase the diagnostic and therapeutic capacities of the radio-tomograph (additional diagnostic information, focused treatment or heating of the internal organs, etc).
