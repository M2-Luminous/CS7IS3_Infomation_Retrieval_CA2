A politician popular in the republic, in the recent past deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, today he is busy organizing the election campaign of his confederate in the Interregional Reform Bloc--Leonid Kuchma. Of course, in the event Kuchma wins, Hrynyov can count on a leading role in the new Kiev leadership. What ideology does the "Kuchma team" preach; what will its advent to power mean for Ukraine, for Russo-Ukrainian relations--this is the topic of our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent's interview with Volodymyr Hrynyov. [Hrynyov] Within a few months we will have to decide what kind of state we are building. I personally feel that we are at a "fork"--we can still slide back into the totalitarian past, or we can move toward a civilized society. The state that is currently being built, in my opinion, was "designed" extremely poorly. Especially unsuccessful was the system of interaction between the center and the regions. We, those who live in Ukraine, feel how strong regional instability is. The same may be said about the economic crisis. No matter what current acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahylskyy tells us, in reality production is declining, hidden unemployment flourishing, and social tension growing. In short, the economic situation differs a lot from the blissful appraisal. [Romm] Do you see the way out of the crisis? [Hrynyov] We need a centrist party. Which is precisely what we are setting up on the basis of our Interregional Reform Bloc. It would appear that the old parliament did everything possible to prevent political structuring: The law on elections does not envisage any party lists. But the process of precisely this kind of structuring is currently underway in the parliament. It reflects a public need--the peak of the "antiparty mood" is behind us; the time has come when people have accepted the idea of parties pursuing a certain ideology. Today the communist and socialist parties, as well as Rukh, show that there is no other way. [Romm] Since your confederate in the bloc is a presidential candidate, it is obvious that your party presents itself as a presidential party, is it not? [Hrynyov] A president who does not have a base in a certain political force does not have a chance of governing society. This is clear in the example of Leonid Kravchuk, who in his search for support jumps from Rukh to the socialists. One can also see it in the example of our government, which is in a "suspended state." Yes, our party thinks of itself as a presidential party; its program tasks are market reform of the Ukrainian economy (because we do not have a market); transition to an open civil society; and the creation of a multinational state with a federative lands structure. [Romm] You are frequently accused of being circumspect toward Moscow. [Hrynyov] Yes, Kuchma and I are being accused of betraying national interests. I am convinced, however, that an attempt to create some sort of a phenomenon of fast integration with Europe is precisely the way to lose our independence. For me, orientation toward Moscow is the only way to survive. If Ukraine now gives up the Eurasian market, within whose framework its economy may rise to a civilized level, this will represent a catastrophic failure of our foreign policy. It can be avoided only by aligning with Moscow--without groveling before it, of course. [Romm] How probable is it that Leonid Kuchma will win the next presidential elections? [Hrynyov] Kuchma currently has the best chance. As compared to the closest rival, Leonid Kravchuk--a five-to-three chance. But Kravchuk has been rather confidently gaining points lately. He is conducting a well-calculated election campaign. Our forecast is that these two candidates will undoubtedly make it to the second round, and almost neck to neck at that. [Romm] Are you sure that the elections will not be postponed? [Hrynyov] Parliament will not have enough muscle to vote against the elections. [Romm] How do you and your confederates in the Interregional Reform Bloc appraise the Crimean situation and the causes that brought it about? [Hrynyov] I already mentioned the degradation of our economy, a poorly chosen strategy for the organizational development of the state, imposing administrative models that are alien to the regions. All these factors caused the Crimean crisis. Although Russian politicians contributed their share to this issue as well. According to the Crimean constitution in its 1992 version, Crimea is a sovereign state and builds its relations with all states on the basis of treaties. It may sign such a treaty with Ukraine and remain part of it, as Tatarstan is in Russia. If the Crimean leadership, with popular support, goes all the way, though, in the best-case scenario the outcome will be secession, and in the worst--the blood of hundreds of thousands of people. In our opinion, the Crimean problem may be absorbed by the problem of Russo-Ukrainian rapprochement. Not too long ago a meeting of Russian and Ukrainian politicians took place in Kharkiv. We undertook to develop an ideology of strategic cooperation in time for the September meeting; it must be reflected in a joint document to be adopted by the governments of both countries. I stay in contact with the Crimean Government and I know that everybody there is aware of this: If Crimea remains in this suspended state for another half a year--with people being afraid to travel there and everything being extremely tense--this will be a fiasco for the Crimean authorities. Destabilization of the situation in the Crimea is not in the interests of either Ukraine or Russia; therefore, it will be supported from different sides. Crimea should become a bridge between our states, not a bone of contention.
