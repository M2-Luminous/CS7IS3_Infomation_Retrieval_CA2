The squeeze on corporate earnings will end only after consumption at the household level picks up, Susumu Taketomi, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, told reporters at the Japan National Press Club. Completion of corporate inventory adjustment, the first stage of economic recovery in the usual economic cycle, cannot take place in the absence of a recovery in personal spending, Taketomi added. Proposed income tax cuts are expected to expand the purchasing power of consumers, he said. Taketomi said the Japanese economy is in a crisis unprecedented since the end of World War II. It is suffering "three kinds of stagnancy" -- slack corporate capital spending, falling profits and near-zero real economic growth, he said. The current slump is different from past ones, which were overcome by cyclical economic forces, he said. "The current economy has been stalled in a big industrial adjustment wave under the heavy weight of excessive manpower and investment," he said. "The economy has been trapped in the Bermuda triangle, an area where many shipwrecks are said to have taken place due to a water level difference between the Pacific and the Atlantic." "Taking a great leap over this cross-section is necessary for Japan's economy to smoothly shift from high growth to stable growth," Taketomi said, noting the need not only for additional fiscal measures by the government but for more corporate efforts for industrial innovation. Taketomi said personal consumption could pick up in Japan if pent-up demand is stimulated, for example, by the launch of new products tailored to the varying needs of consumers. Despite the domestic recession, Japan's imports have risen recently because consumers are going for overseas products which are discounted heavily but still have a qualitative appeal. Demand could also emerge at any time because of the need to replace major durable goods like cars and televisions, he said. Taketomi refrained from guessing when Japan's economy will hit bottom. He limited himself to saying that recovery in nonmanufacturing sectors such as nonbank moneylenders and real estate will only come after that of makers and is unlikely to take place in 1994. Low productivity may stand out in nonmanufacturers when they are exposed to price-cutting competition under ongoing deregulation, he said.
