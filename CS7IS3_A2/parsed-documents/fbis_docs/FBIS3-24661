KOREA SOUTH KOREA: Press Sources Urge Patience in Dealing With North Korea SUMMARY: Two South Korean press reports warn that U.S. and ROK leaders would be making a "grave mistake" in thinking that the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks would lead to an agreement with North Korea, allowing the two Koreas to exchange special envoys and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct full-scale inspections of DPRK nuclear sites. Both press reports conclude that North Korea will not easily relinquish its "nuclear card" and that the United States and the ROK should not be too optimistic when dealing with the DPRK. According to the 2O January CHUNGANG ILBO, several Beijing-based diplomats of former Eastern Bloc nations and western analysts with a background on PRC and DPRK affairs believe that North Korea will hold on to its "nuclear card" as long as it is useful. These experts said the DPRK is "well aware that the nuclear issue is only the beginning," and once that is settled, the Clinton administration will just move on to the human rights issue, which will eventually lead up to Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. CHUNGANG's sources opined that North Korea will stand firm on the nuclear issue until the U.S. Government guarantees it will: 1) suspend Team Spirit, 2) refrain from imposing economic sanctions on North Korea, 3) re-establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK, 4) recognize and accept the current North Korean political structure, and 5) give aid to North Korea. CHUNGANG notes that a "high-ranking ROK Embassy official" in Beijing agrees with this assessment, and furthermore is of the opinion that since "the PRC leaders know what North Korea is after, they can only go so far in influencing and advising the North on the nuclear issue." The February WOLGAN CHOSON quotes Yi Tong-pok--an expert with 2O years of experience on North Korean affairs at the National Security Planning Board (NSP) and a special assistant to the NSP director until December 1993--who holds the view that the DPRK created the nuclear weapons program to sustain its political structure, in other words, to "keep the Kim dynasty alive." Yi also sys that North Korea will not give up its "nuclear card," unless it is a matter of life or death. Furthermore, he affirms, the North "cannot financially afford to start a war against the United States and South Korea at this time, or in the near future." He also states that the North is playing a waiting game, hoping that the "impatient" U.S. Government will "cave in" first. Fortunately, the U.S.-South Korean side has the advantage, because the North "can only buy so much time," given the state of its economy, Yi says. He further advises that approaching the North with only "carrots" would give the wrong signal, because this will be viewed as a "sign of weakness," whereas using "more sticks" might bring better results. Many experts believe that economic sanctions will not hurt North Korea since it has so little trade with other countries, but in Yi's opinion, the country will be "hurt badly" if the sanctions can effectively stop the flow of cash from the "Chochongnyon" (pro-North organization of Koreans in Japan). Yi goes on to say that continuing efforts to carry on a dialogue with the North to deter it from making or attempting to make nuclear weapons and to prevent it from "weakening or destroying" the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) are the "current tasks" of the U.S. Government. He believes that both the United States and South Korea must show that they do not fear North Korea and know how to cope with the situation, even if that country already has one or two nuclear weapons. As long as the United States shows patience in dealing with the DPRK, time is on its side, according to Yi. (AUTHOR: TOMPKINS.
