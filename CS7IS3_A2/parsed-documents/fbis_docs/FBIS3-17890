Last year the figure was around $2 Bn. In a Tuesday interview with Interfax Samoylov said that Russia did not lose the arms markets of the former Soviet Union and is ready to expand cooperation in this sphere with traditional partners: Arab countries, India, China, African and East European nations. According to Samoylov, the volume of sales has been falling due to the form of payments. Since 1991 Russia has been demanding immediate payment and has stopped giving credits to countries for importing its armaments. He said that last year the U.S. sold approximately the same amount of weapons at the same terms as Russia. "The $30 Bn volume of trade the Americans speak of is credited," he said. Samoylov added that the USSR offered credits for 7 to 40 years for the purchase of its weaponry. He also said that Russia lost between 10 and 15 billion dollars because of UN sanctions against its old partners: Libya and Iraq. He said Western states received compensation from the United Nations and the IMF for breaking off economic ties with the two countries. According to the head of Rosvooruzhenie, only Russia was left without compensation.
