FBIS3-61307 "jpusr005___94042" FBIS-USR-94-005 Document Type:JPRS Document Title: FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 26 January 1994 CENTRAL ASIA KAZAKHSTAN National Unity of Kazakhstan Union Program 944K0507A Almaty EKSPRESS-K in Russian No 212, 30 Oct 93 pp 4-5 944K0507A Almaty EKSPRESS-K Language: Russian Article Type:CSO ["Program of the National Unity of Kazakhstan Union"] [Text] The National Unity of Kazakhstan Union is a national movement operating within the framework of the constitution and laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan and uniting on a voluntary basis citizens of the Republic, regardless of national affiliation or religious belief. The SNEK [National Unity of Kazakhstan Union] advocates the creation of an open-type society, the building in Kazakhstan of a democratic state based on the rule of law, the formation of a social market economy, the creation of a genuine multiparty system, social partnership and civil harmony, political and internation stability, Kazakhstani patriotism, and mutual respect and tolerance and an increase in Kazakhstan's political authority in the world arena and its progress and prosperity. I. Purposes and Main Directions of Activity The Union's political tasks have been structured with regard for historical, national, and geographical factors of Kazakhstan. Actual social institutions like the family, blood relations, religion, and territorial structures influence political processes. A particular role in Kazakhstan is performed by the small size of the population, the sparse network of cities, and the low level of availability of transport. Millions of people, particularly in the countryside, are cut off from politics. The Union supports the mobilization of the political will of millions of our fellow citizens and their involvement in the sphere of assertive political activity based on the ideas of stability, reforms, and civil harmony. The Union advocates the creation of a grand political coalition in Kazakhstan in the transitional period. This coalition anticipates the surmounting of the confrontation between the government and the opposition. Whereas in stable democratic societies an active opposition is a condition of political balance, in such a transitional society as Kazakhstan constant opposition to the government could perform a negative role also. On the other hand, the opposition stands apart from the structures of state power. The Union proceeds from the fact that a political coalition is possible between equal political groups. Stability requires a more even distribution of power between the current machinery of state and the opposition parties and movements and close relations between them. The Union proposes as a principal method of the solution of contradictions in the political sphere the achievement of consensus and social accord. Regarding itself as a political organization of a centrist nature, the Union rejects extremes of left and right. We are opposed to a situation involving the social opposition of various forces, which has itself been brought about by the growing polarization of interests. We do not claim to substitute for some political parties or organizations. Party pluralism in a democratic society is essential. But we are talking about something else: a mechanism of assuaging conflicts and political contradictions in present-day Kazakhstan. We regard civic harmony as the unity of views of various political groups on specific political problems. It is obvious that there is some middle, central line of public thinking. This is a set of issues on which political groups are in accord. This mode of the solution of political problems is preferable to a solution merely by way of a simple arithmetical majority, which could, in turn, lead to regional conflicts. The opinion of political minorities cannot be ignored. Sooner or later, this leads to open conflict. In the sphere of the political arrangement of society the SNEK firmly supports the formation of a state based on the rule of law in the form of presidential rule. And this, in our view, is explicable. The experience of world history shows that in an era of socioeconomic and political crises and upheavals an objective need for an increase in the regulatory role of the state and a strengthening of the executive appears. Our young state is passing through such a period. An increase in the role and responsibility of the executive headed by the president in tackling tasks pertaining to an escape from the crisis and a strengthening of the vertical line of management are essential for the pursuit of a common policy and strict coordination. The SNEK advocates the speediest adoption of the Law "On Public Service," an increase in the responsibility of state officials and the mobility and efficiency of the work of the administrative machinery, and an improvement in the conditions and an enhancement of the prestige of managerial work. The Union considers the replacement of personnel and a reduction in the administrative machinery essential. The Union supports a strong legislature in the shape of a compact professional national parliament. The SNEK believes that the present parliament has done a great deal in the business of formation of an independent Kazakhstan and the provision of a legislative base for the reform policy. In the present times, which are complex and filled with anxiety for the future and concerns for a resolution of the most urgent problems, as in the immediate future also, for that matter, it is hardly possible to expect an increase in voter activity at the elections. This simultaneously calls very much in question the possibility of the efficient use at this time of the absolute-majority head-to-head system. One way or another, elections employing this system could always face the danger of failure. The use, on the other hand, of a relative-majority head-to-head system, whereby the elections are considered valid irrespective of the number of voters who have gone to the polls (although, obviously, a certain minimum percentage--approximately 35-40 percent, in our view, will have to be established, all the same) and the candidate is considered elected if more people have voted for him than for the other candidates (and some minimum threshold, 25 percent, for example, is necessary here also, what is more), is both far more applicable for our conditions and far more efficient. This system is applied equally well for the elections of both independent candidates and those who have been nominated by political parties and grassroots associations and affords an opportunity for elections to be held without runoffs and a second round of elections entailing a decline in voter activity and considerable material and financial outlays. As far, however, as the use at party-slate elections of the proportional system of determination of the results is concerned, it would seem entirely unsuitable in our situation. First, it is very hard to apply and would be comprehensible to far from everyone in the vast army of members of the electoral commissions. Confirmation of this are the repeated breakdowns at elections involving the use of this system by some of our former USSR brethren. Second, this system works well in a strongly politicized society with a highly developed party system, which we do not yet have nor will we have in the quite distant future even. Third, this system depersonalizes the elections to a certain extent, that is, the voter votes not for a specific personality but for a slate formed by a party, which, understandably, under the conditions of our democracy, which is in the development phase, can hardly be considered positive. Nor either, for that matter, can the proportional system's exclusion of the possibility of self-nomination for deputy. For this reason it is expedient at statewide-slate elections also to use the relative-majority head-to-head system, which makes it possible to quickly and efficiently chose two deputies from three candidates in practically all districts. It is with such an electoral system that the formation of a professional parliament of the Republic, whose creation, in the SNEK's opinion, is a most important factor of the development of parliamentarianism in Kazakhstan and an intensification of the democratic process in the Republic as a whole, becomes possible. The SNEK believes that a democratic state is inconceivable without an autonomous, united, and independent judiciary with its ramified system. The Union emphasizes here the need for the assurance of the court's independence of the executive, legislative, and local authorities, the irreplaceability of judges, and the electivity of the court. Legal proceedings should be oral, swift, and direct and ensure the equality of the parties. The SNEK believes also that they should ensure the equality before the court and the law of the individual, the citizen, and the state and legal protection of the rights and liberties of citizens against the unwarranted interference of the state. Each branch of power has its own particular authority enshrined by the constitution and does not duplicate or substitute for the other branches of power. The SNEK regards man as the highest value and advocates the economic, spiritual, and political freedom of the individual. The SNEK sees as the main task of the Kazakh state respect for, defense of, and the creation of the conditions for the realization in practice of the rights of man and citizen. The SNEK recognizes the principles proclaimed by the UN Charter determining basic human rights and enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan: recognition of the dignity inherent in all members of the human family and their equal and inalienable rights is the basis of liberty, justice, and general peace; these rights ensue from the dignity inherent in the human personality; recognition of the fact that, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of the free human personality enjoying civil and political liberty and freedom from fear and want may be realized only when the conditions are created whereby each may avail himself of his economic, social, and cultural rights in the same way as his civil and political rights. Human rights belong to each and everyone, regardless of civil affiliation and level of the material development of society. They are inalienable and sacrosanct. The SNEK maintains that a violation of human rights is always explained by political, not economic, factors. As distinct from civil rights, the extent of which is predetermined by the specific possibilities and development of society. II. Economic Platform In the transitional period the SNEK sees as the main task of its economic platform the adoption of effective measures to lead the economy of Kazakhstan out of the devastating economic crisis and the pursuit of an active policy for protecting against inflation the commodity producers and the entire population, for a halt to the decline in production and its subsequent upturn, and for the social protection of poor and needy citizens. The SNEK advocates the creation of a Kazakh model of economic development ensuing from the particular geopolitical location of Kazakhstan and the availability of a rich storehouse of natural resources and skilled and educated personnel potential. The Kazakhstan model of the economy should aspire to imbibe all that is most valuable contained in the experience of the economic reforms of other countries and take account primarily of the economic interests of the Republic. The SNEK believes that the raw material focus of our economy can and should benefit, not harm, the Republic and be the foundation of a restructuring of production in the direction of manufacturing industry. The SNEK advocates the fair privatization of state property excluding the alienation of various groups of the population of Kazakhstan from the basic producer goods on a racial, national, socio-class, property, territorial, or some other basis. The privatization process should provide for equal access to assets about to be privatized for all citizens of the Republic. The state and glasnost should be the guarantor of fair privatization. The Union regards corruption as a dangerous phenomenon for society and a crime. For this reason it supports an intensification of the fight against organized crime. With regard for the corresponding international agreements and recommendations pertaining to the fight against corruption it is essential to make immediate adjustments to the current legislative instruments to create more effective conditions of the organization of the work on uncovering, forestalling, and putting a stop to the activity of corrupt criminal groups. The Union advocates special laws making provision for concerted measures of the fight against these phenomena. It is essential also to extend the rights and strengthen the personnel composition of the law enforcement authorities and to contribute to an enhancement of its professional level. The SNEK believes that it is essential to consistently and resolutely fight against corruption in the sphere of privatization, against the notorious "grab-ization." The SNEK supports a policy of the utmost encouragement of private enterprise and small and medium-sized business. In order for the program of support for enterprise proclaimed by the government to be realized it is essential to reconsider the practice of privileged taxation and the allocation of loans for private enterprise. We need in this sphere to create propitious conditions for entrepreneurs for stimulating a growth of production and the productive accumulation and investment of capital in promising and socially significant sectors of production. We proceed from the priority of productive enterprise over commercial, speculative business and will further its development by all forces at our disposal. The SNEK proceeds from the fact that the present system of pricing is in need of radical revision. We will pursue a flexible and differentiated price policy. The SNEK believes that it is essential in respect to the public sector and monopoly enterprises and also energy producers to set strict limits on the growth of prices. An unchecked increase in the prices of their products leads to a growth of inflation and an increase in the price of all commodities. In the nonstate sector prices should be established freely, and the government may control prices here only with the aid of indirect levers: taxes, bank credit, and customs privileges and restrictions. In the sphere of finances, monetary circulation, and credit in the Republic a critical situation caused both by the general crisis of the economy and the ill-considered steps of the government has taken shape. In the financial and credit sphere the SNEK will in the transitional period unswervingly pursue a policy of a recovery of the financial system, a reduction in the budget deficit, the formation of a prudent and flexible tax system, liberalization of the banking system, and a recovery of monetary circulation. The SNEK believes that to achieve the said goal it is essential: to reform the tax system and to switch to a system of taxation providing for a transition from the fiscal to stimulatory focus of taxes. Tax policy should be stable and civilized with a broad base of taxation and favorable to the proprietors, producers, and the state and should be working to supplant the criminal circulation of cash and noncash transactions; to immediately reform the credit and banking system in the direction of the creation of most-favored status for enterprise. The banking system should provide for a flexible, differentiated credit policy, soft loans for the priority sectors, the funding of research developments, and the introduction of promising production engineering programs in the Republic's economy; to provide for the indexing of personal monetary savings held in savings banks and to raise the deposit interest rate to protect them against inflationary support [as published] and to attract investments in the economy; to protect the country's economic interests and safeguard its economic independence and security it is essential to perform preparatory work on the introduction of a national currency. The impossibility of an independent escape under the conditions of the postcommunist devastation and the collapse of interrepublic business relations from the most severe economic crisis prompted Kazakhstan to sign the treaty on the economic union of CIS countries and to stay within the ruble zone. The Union hopes that the treaty will serve as a foundation for new genuinely mutually profitable and equal economic relations and support the continued materialization of the country's independence in the interests of all Kazakhstanis. In the transitional period the state should render financial support only to the priority base sectors of production possessing high export potential and providing for the scientific and technical and technological updating of the entire economy. The SNEK is opposed to the atomization of government funds around various sectors and departments and supports their concentration and directed and rational use in the most limited number of priority sectors possible: the oil and gas complex, the agro-industrial complex, the conversion mechanical engineering complex, and utility systems. The Union consistently advocates the structural reorganization and accelerated technological renewal of material production. The SNEK sees as its task the pursuit of a structural and scientific and technological policy which makes it possible to accomplish a leap forward in technology and upgrade enterprises' hopelessly obsolete fixed capital to world standards. The SNEK is for the re-industrialization of industry in the promising areas reflecting the long-term conditions of the world market. The paramount task is the acceleration of investments in the manufacturing research-intensive sectors completing a production engineering cycle: mechanical engineering, petrochemical, electronics, and aerospace industry and instrument making. Kazakhstan has quite powerful scientific and technological groundwork in Aktau, Leninsk, Kurchatov, Stepnogorsk, and other industrial cities servicing the military-industrial complex. The SNEK is for conversion and the switch of the military-industrial complex to service of the Republic's economy, the formation on this basis of technology and science parks and engineering-research centers and the preservation and multiplication of the existing scientific and technological and personnel potential, preservation of the technopolises that have evolved, and the high moral and material status of the highly skilled engineering-technical personnel and specialists. The SNEK advocates the formation of a self-sufficient domestic market and reduced technological and commodity dependence on monopolists, which individual countries have become following the disintegration of the USSR as a result of the uneven location of the productive forces on the territory of the former Union republics. Integration in the world economy is a decisive condition of the creation of an efficiently operating economic system. For this reason the SNEK advocates in the sphere of foreign economic policy the continued simplification and liberalization of the conditions of the attraction of foreign capital to the economy of the Republic within limits determined by the interests of assurance of its economic security. In order for foreign capital to have an interest in investing in Kazakhstan's economy it is essential to create precise legal guarantees for the protection of foreign investments. III. Social Policy The SNEK advocates social partnership and the creation of the traditions and institutions of partner relations between the state and the citizen and employer and employee. The SNEK is for the resolution of problems that arise by way of civilized dialogue which prevents an increase in social tension. It is necessary to use the available potential of social policy itself for harmonization of the interests of different social groups. In addition, we consider necessary the creation of arbitral organizations which defend the interests of the contracting parties. The Union is for collective contracts and collective agreements concluded annually at all levels among the government, the employers, and the working people. The SNEK is for the enactment of the corresponding law. The entire system of social protection of the population at the present stage of the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan should be geared to a halt to the process of decline in people's living standard and the creation of the conditions for an upturn in the latter. For this the SNEK considers it essential to revise the entire state ideology of social protection and the attitude toward it as something secondary. The new model of social policy, which the SNEK will champion, presupposes implementation of the following measures: the balanced economic and social development of the cities and regions; the decisive surmounting of the residual principle of investment in the social sphere; substitution of the formulation of major priority strategic goals and the solution of fundamental social problems for the customary practice of "patching up holes" and "putting out social fires" (stoppages, strikes and so forth); the concentration of attention and resources on the solution of a limited number of questions reflecting society's "sore" points; renunciation of the overall impersonal format of the accomplishment of social tasks on a Republic scale and a differentiated approach to the social problems of town and country, different regions, small and large cities, and demographic and professional groups of the populace. The SNEK believes that the formation and realization in practice of a new model of social protection rejecting a leveling and residual approach to the problem as a general principle would be the basis on which the social orientation of the economy could be achieved. The SNEK is for a fundamental revision of the current principle, when the lot of the vast majority of the people has been uniform poverty, and a thin stratum of the elite which has monopolized the administration of social life has satisfied its social requirements at a relatively high level. We believe that it is essential to radically change the organizational structures and sources of funding of the nonproduction sphere (health care, education, pensions, and housing and municipal services) and to reform the system of distribution of income as a whole. Personal income should be regulated via the system of taxation and other economic regulators. The SNEK is for the development of diverse systems of insurance as supplementary channels of social protection. The SNEK believes that the number of "clients" of social assistance should be sharply narrowed thanks to the provision of all groups of the population with decent living conditions based on active economic behavior and the formation of an effective mechanism of social security and social insurance. The SNEK is for each person being accorded economic freedom of the individual and for the creation of incentives to labor for the economically active population. All channels of the stimulation of economic behavior and the encouragement of personal economic initiative should be engaged. The SNEK will support social safeguards in respect to unemployment and the creation of a national fund for assistance to the unemployed, the handicapped, the poor, and orphans. The SNEK proposes conversion of the system of social protection in the following areas: a ban on a freeze on wages for low-income categories of employees, the publicly funded categories primarily; the immediate introduction of an officially established poverty threshold determined by the minimum consumer basket and its regular indexation (with regard for the real rate of inflation, not less than quarterly); government guarantees of the social security of the citizen and the establishment of the strict specificity of social support, when it is channeled to those who cannot provide for themselves and their families; a streamlining of the system of social protection, the elimination of unjustified payments, and differentiation of the payable benefits; the creation of an integrated system of guarantees of social protection at all levels of the Republic, oblasts, rayons, enterprises, and plant outfits; a combination of the state system of social protection with mechanisms of social security at the enterprises; decentralization of the funding of social programs thanks to a shift in the center of gravity to nonstate structures and also to local organs of administration and the enterprises; compensation for loss of wages, pensions, allowances, and grants from inflation and an increase in the price of consumer goods and services which make up the subsistence minimum; the adoption of measures for the practical realization of and unswerving compliance with laws adopted previously: "On Indexation of Monetary Income With Regard for the Increase in the Price of Consumer Goods and Services," "On Protection of the Rights of Consumers," "On the Minimum Consumer Budget," and others; the introduction of indexation of the minimum wage; increased social assistance for needy citizens who have lost their jobs as a consequence of the reorganization of production and reductions in personnel; the accelerated development of the system of social safeguards in the sphere of the minimum wage, pensions, allowances, payments and benefits, and the right to work and free education and medical services. The Union recognizes the priority of the legitimate interests of the citizens over the interests of manufacturers and vendors. The SNEK believes that protection of the consumer against dangers to his life and health is an urgent task and advocates the implementation by the organs of state power and administration of efficient measures connected with the protection of the personal rights of the consumers in terms of their provision with high-quality commodities, jobs, and services. In the sphere of employment policy the SNEK will strive to minimize the level of unemployment thanks to the development of jobs and contribute to the employment of and support for employees laid off in the course of the structural reorganization of the economy and the transition to market relations. Particular attention will be paid to state programs of the employment and retraining of citizens laid off from their former jobs. This should, of course, be undertaken by the state with the assistance of a specially created network of courses of instruction, schools, and so forth. Provision should be made for tax and other privileges here for enterprises providing for the reorientation of laid-off employees and securing a growth of productivity. The SNEK will promote the organization of the vocational education of the youth, the creation of jobs for specialists, and privileges for them in the construction of housing and the priority promotion of enterprising people to elective production-management positions. It is essential to pay more attention to the social problems of the youth and to stimulate young people's entrepreneurial activity. The position of retirees has been distorted for many years. "Old people are held in respect with us everywhere"--this myth was taken to be the reality. The attitude toward them as dependents determined the fallaciousness of the direction of development of the pension system. The fact that the appointed pension is fixed and does not take account of the increase in the cost of living is a serious shortcoming. It is necessary, therefore, to index the pensions depending on the growth of the consumer price index and the increase in the minimum wage in the national economy. Provision should be made for the guaranteed purchase by retirees, mothers of large families, and so forth of dairy, meat, and bread products and baby food at fixed official prices. All the above-mentioned types of safeguards should be realized at all enterprises, regardless of forms of ownership. In addition, the SNEK considers essential the elaboration and adoption of a law guaranteeing social protection at private enterprises. The SNEK believes that government support for science, education, and culture is essential and that they should be accorded tax privileges. The opening of public and private educational institutions is encouraged. The Union advocates autonomy for the higher educational institutions and a broadening of the rights of student self-government. The SNEK is for a cardinal reform of education in the countryside, an increase in government appropriations for the development of the physical plant of the rural schools, and a rise in the professional level and prestige of the teacher. We believe that basic research should be funded by the state. The Union advocates the creation of conditions conducive to the dynamic progress of all branches of learning and the concentration of personnel and material and financial resources in the most promising areas designed to accelerate the achievement of economic and social aims and the spiritual development of society. IV. Nationality Policy The SNEK proceeds in its nationality policy from the fact that Kazakhstan represents a complex, multinational society. The experience of mononational countries does not work in our case, therefore. In all countries that have achieved independence the national movement has performed and will continue to perform a tremendous role. But two models of the defense of national interest are possible. The first is based on a radical and most rapid change in the balance of interests in favor of one's own nation, which is fraught with conflicts. The second is based on evolutionary development with the equality of all nationalities and ethnic groups and the achievement of harmony, with recognition of the fact that on certain issues the Kazakh nation, by virtue of the fact that Kazakhstan is the sole statehood for Kazakhs, has priority. Considering that ethnic social conflicts could be an impediment to the development of all nations, we opt for the second path of development. This means that the Union is opposed in principle to the substitution for one negative form of the political mobilization of the masses of another, that is, replacement of the "socialist" principle of mass support by the "national" principle and the substitution for class diktat of national diktat. The Union will seek the formation of the conditions for the unhindered realization of the creative potential of each nationality and ethnic group, the full-fledged development of their national cultures, language, customs, and traditions, the preservation and development of folklore, and support for the ethnical and rational principles in the systems of national education as a part of general pedagogics. The Union will struggle actively against all manifestations of national exclusiveness, nationalism, and chauvinism. The Union will not accept any forms of national enmity and is opposed to national-radical methods in policy and supports the resolution of internation, religious, and other contradictions and conflicts by measures based on mutual respect and national and religious tolerance. The SNEK is for observance of the rights of man, nations, and ethnic groups recognized by the world community and for national minorities being afforded equal opportunities for the preservation and development of ethnic, linguistic, and religious distinctiveness without any discrimination. The SNEK advocates state support for national-cultural centers-cum-organizational structures adequately expressing specific requirements of the nationalities constituting the people of Kazakhstan. National-cultural centers, in the SNEK's view, are concentrated forms of the expression of national distinctiveness and ethnic self-awareness and an important institution of the incipient civil society in polyethnic Kazakhstan making it possible to conduct a dialogue between the nations in a spirit of national mutual understanding and mutual respect. State support for the national-cultural centers is a principal method of development of the national cultures and contributes to the achievement of actual stability as an essential condition of the resolution of national and internation problems and the achievement of civic peace and internation harmony. The formation of real conditions for the full-fledged development of the national cultures of all nationalities of the Republic without exception ensuring the political stability of polyethnic Kazakhstan is the basis for the conception of Kazakh patriotism, a sense by the representatives of all nationalities of involvement in the historical destiny of their motherland--the Republic of Kazakhstan--and assertive action for its modernization and prosperity. The SNEK supports the state self-determination of the Kazakh nation and its continued infusion with real content, which is a most important factor of the consolidation of both the Kazakh nation itself and all of Kazakhstani society. The unity of the Kazakh people and their increased democratic potential in the political life of the Republic is not only their own concern but also that of the other nationalities of our country since the former's political, cultural, economic, and moral health as the biggest ethnic entity in the state is an important stabilizing factor in the integration of Kazakhstani society for the accomplishment of the tasks of the modernization of Kazakhstan and the building of a democratic society based on the rule of law. Internation solidarity with the Kazakh people and an understanding of their problems is important here also. On the other hand, the activity of the Kazakh people on the development of their statehood, language, and culture should be determined by the level of development of national duty, national obligation, and national conscience understood as a moral imperative before the other nationalities. Without moral responsibility and dignity the building of national statehood by the Kazakh people becomes national egotism transforming national statehood into an ethnocratic society, the result of which would be the irreversible disintegration of polyethnic Kazakhstan and the loss of national statehood itself. Such a thing is, of course, impermissible both from the standpoints of the essential interests of the Kazakh nation itself and of the other nationalities constituting the people of Kazakhstan. For this reason solidarity between the nationalities of Kazakhstani society should be a principle of community life and a most important factor of the integration of our polyethnic state given by history and the fatherland common to all of us. The SNEK believes that a practicable method of overcoming internation conflicts consists not of political confrontation, which could drag on for decades, but of entirely different mechanisms. The first consists of the creation of a new economic environment. Continued economic crisis would lead to a growth of political tension and increased unemployment, particularly among the youth. Without the creation of a strong private-enterprise sector it will be impossible to overcome the crisis on the labor market and ensure a sufficiently high level of unemployment. The second mechanism is the creation of the conditions for gradual cultural integration. The relationship of the main national community and the related national communities affiliated to it is at this stage in many aspects not at the "intercourse" level, when there is a mutual exchange of cultural content, but is characterized by the phase of the "circulation" of cultural content within each national culture. It is essential to achieve mutual integration. With the practically universal knowledge of Russian the integrating functions of Kazakh are manifestly insufficient. The SNEK views this problem from the viewpoint of integrating, unifying functions. The Kazakh language and culture should be a powerful factor of the integration of all Kazakhstanis. This would in itself do away with a mass of political problems. It is the strategic line to which our Union adheres. But we are emphatically opposed to bureaucratic arbitrary action implanting its methods of imposition of the Kazakh language without regard for the actual situation and by way of artificial acceleration. The third mechanism is connected with the prevention of internation conflicts. We are talking about a combination of three factors: a truly scientific study of national relations, the pressure of public opinion on these relations and mechanisms of the emergency response to internation conflicts. As distinct from the sham or emotional approach to internation problems in Kazakhstan, the Union is oriented toward the systematic dialogue of different groups and viewpoints, an objective analysis of the causes of internation conflicts, and the active use of the mass media not for inciting nationalism and chauvinism but for a constructive escape from the crisis situations. The Union is oriented also toward the objective coverage of internation relations in Kazakhstan on the part of foreign media. The SNEK is oriented toward cooperation with both national and foreign mass media for the curtailment of provocative and negative influences on the public consciousness in the plane of internation relations. V. Foreign Policy Reference Points The SNEK believes that the main purpose of foreign policy should be all-around support for international stability and Kazakhstan's security for the evolutionary development of domestic reforms. The SNEK supports the peace-making efforts of the Republic's leadership in respect to a settlement of conflicts in the CIS. The SNEK understands that the threat to peace today arises from local conflicts. For this reason the Union deems it necessary to find and adopt solutions before they have begun to escalate and involve third countries. For preventing an escalation of tension in Central Asia the SNEK advocates: a process of negotiations between states on problems that arise; states' freedom of choice of their particular path of political and socioeconomic development; unswerving observance of the principle of noninterference in one another's internal affairs; common sense in foreign policy. The SNEK believes that the Republic should continue to support the inviolability of borders and the right to the defense of sovereignty of each state, of new countries particularly. The diversion into a struggle for a recarving of borders, the tearing away of territories, and internal conflicts are not only causing enormous losses economically but also, which is far more tragic, numerous human casualties. A gradual normalization of relations based on simple and comprehensible principles would ensure the free development of all countries of the region. The SNEK supports Kazakhstan's breakthrough into the world community. Membership of the United Nations and other international organizations is creating the conditions for realization of the reforms. But we are opposed to imposition of development models on the Republic. We understand that principles that have been worked out over many centuries are not always applicable under qualitatively different conditions. No state and no society can become something new immediately. The SNEK is opposed to: a solution of international problems by the power method; a disregard for the interests of the developing and new states by the big powers; the use of force on international issues; interference in a state's internal affairs; the imposition of various models of development on the new states, however attractive they may be; wars bringing ruin and innumerable casualties. For the realization of these propositions in the sphere of foreign policy it is essential: to perform active work; understand that pressure could be fatal and just as harmful as a mistaken policy; to recognize and abide strictly by commitments that have been assumed and to display a prudent patience and understanding; to establish in relations the principle of observance of noninterference in one another's internal affairs; to devise an international system of the early detection of conflicts and of preventive diplomacy. For contacts between the democratic forces of various countries of the region the SNEK considers essential the extensive development of the cooperation of center parties and movements in the CIS. Today the policy of centrism is a foundation of a settlement of the domestic political situation and the stabilization of international relations. The exchange of experience, joint consultations, and the coordination of common efforts in support of reforms are an important supplement to the processes of democratization in all countries. The SNEK proposes the elaboration and discussion of a concept of the foreign policy and a concept of the defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan which include the following points: the foreign policy of Kazakhstan should ensure guarantees of international stability and internation accord for the pursuit of reform policy and the achievement of the Republic's economic independence; a policy of common sense in relations with our immediate neighbors and the pursuit of an active, pragmatic foreign policy aimed at the most extensive participation possible in the settlement of conflicts and the establishment of equal, mutually beneficial economic and political relations; assurance of the unity of domestic and foreign policy; mobilization of the efforts of economic policy for the country's incorporation in the international division of labor and an acceleration of economic innovations in the economic system of Kazakhstan; the use of participation in international organizations to attract the resources of other countries for a solution of domestic problems. Foreign policy is directly connected with the domestic situation. In this connection the SNEK believes that the assurance of domestic stability and security is a key component of the problem of national security. The SNEK considers it necessary to struggle to ensure that a threat to peace, our neighbors, and the people of Kazakhstan themselves not arise on our own territory. The SNEK believes that there should be a solution to our problems not so much thanks to assistance from outside as thanks to the mobilization of internal possibilities. Kazakhstan has a base sufficiently well prepared for the introduction of modern equipment and technology. But it is by no means necessary for this to follow the lead of some state or group of states. Kazakhstan should not have a one-sided foreign policy orientation. We have a single goal--peace and stability and cooperation between countries and peoples. Each state and each people should make their contribution to this process.
