FBIS4-960 "drafr076_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia LPC Leader Discounts Reported Demand for Council Seat LPC Leader Discounts Reported Demand for Council Seat AB1804192094 London BBC World Service in English 1515 GMT 18 Apr 94 AB1804192094 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The Liberian Peace Council [LPC] has become something of a thorn in the flesh of the Transitional Council which took power last month. The LPC was formed last year to oppose Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] faction, one of the three signatories to the Cotonou Peace Accord, and over the last few days there have been reports that the LPC is demanding a seat on the Transitional Council as a price for laying down its arms. Well, the LPC's leader, George Burly, is passing through Freetown at the moment. On the line, Robin White asked him exactly what their position was. [Begin recording] [Burly] Robin, we've made it categorically clear, unequivocally clear, that we have never sought any seat on the Transitional Government, the Transitional Council. We have never sought any seat and we have never requested for any seat on the council. It is not our desire. That's not our ambition. [White] So what is your ambition? What do you want? [Burly] The Liberian Peace Council is a resistance movement to the atrocities hit upon our people by the NPFL, and as a resistance movement we've ensured first of all that we stay alive. We have done that and we have done so successfully. We have done so to the extent where we now control or have managed to repel the NPFL from 60 percent of the landmass of Liberia, six counties. Let me tell you another thing. We have been told that we are no party to Cotonou and we wish to inform you and everyone else that while we may not be a party to Cotonou or any accord intended to broker peace in Liberia, we are a party to the Republic of Liberia and its interests. [White] So what kind of political solution do you want for Liberia yourself? [Burly] Robin, we would like to see a political configuration that would take into consideration the interests of all the parties, particularly our security. [White] So, you are looking for some kind of new government. [Burly] Whatever you wish to call it. We insist that there must be something that takes our security into consideration. [White] But surely the only way you can guarantee your security is to be in government in some shape or form. [Burly] Robin, there is a lot that one can do outside of government, you know that. [White] But what would guarantee your security then? [Burly] We made proposals to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-fire Monitoring Group] and we've made proposals to the UN, the people that are responsible for what should be happening on the ground. [White] And have you had any response? [Burly] Not as yet. [White] You claim that you control 60 percent of Liberia? [Burly] Robin, we control Sinoe, Maryland, Grand Gedeh, Grand Kru, Rivercess, and Grand Bassa counties, and more. [White] But Mr. Taylor claims to control 60 percent of Liberia. [Burly] Robin, that's Mr. Taylor's problem. [end recording]
