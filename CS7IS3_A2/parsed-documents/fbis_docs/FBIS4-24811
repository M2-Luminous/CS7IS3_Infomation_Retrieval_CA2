He said: It is expected that foreign capital will continue to flow into China, but a structural change in foreign investment will occur. For example, the investment in the real estate industry has begun to shift to the construction of lower-cost housing with slight profits and the reconstruction of the old urban districts. Large infrastructural projects in the fields of energy production and transportation will also attract more foreign investment. Ma Xiuhong said: In the course of developing the socialist market economy, China will gradually improve the relevant legislation in order to meet the needs of the market economy. The policy for using foreign funds will also be adjusted to a certain degree. However, the adjustments will make it more favorable to outside investors in the mainland. The current favorable policies for investment made by Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots on the mainland will not change. Ma Xiuhong said: In recent years, foreign investment in China's interior areas increased faster than that in the coastal areas. Although the base is low, foreign investment in the interior has great potential. It is completely possible to further heighten the speed of attracting foreign investment there. She said: Over the past two to three years, the amount of foreign investment attracted by China has increased rapidly. The number of contracts and agreements concerning foreign investment in China and the amounts of foreign investment actually made in China in 1992 all exceeded the total of the previous 13 years. Foreign investment again doubled in 1993 on the basis of that in 1992. By the end of 1993, there were more than 174,000 foreign-funded enterprises in mainland China, and their total investment reached $220 billion. The amount of foreign funds actually used by them reached $61.8 billion.
