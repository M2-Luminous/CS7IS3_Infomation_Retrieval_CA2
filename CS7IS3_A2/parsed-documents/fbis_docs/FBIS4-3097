Only the rigors of a market economy can help the industry out of its plight, Fu Zhihuan, Vice-Minister of Railways, said in Beijing recently. Most railway manufacturing plants are still managed by the dictates of a planned economic system, under which the government sets production quotas, buys products at prices it sets, and controls investment. So while the massive rail expansion now under way in China cries out for fast heavy-haul rolling stock, production plants are hamstrung by lack of capital and outdated techniques. To raise both the capacity and quality of rail cars, a modern enterprise system must be phased in by the China National Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Corp (Loric), which runs 35 plants and four research institutes and employs 270,000 people. By 1995, Loric intends to update its operation contract system with the ministry to expand production. Later it will be authorized to become a share holding company and manage State property. This in effect will make the 35 manufacturing and repair plants independent and responsible for State assets. Simultaneously, profound reforms will take place in the railway planning, pricing, investment, financing and wage systems. The ministry will continue cutting production quotas for vehicles so that in the near future all manufacturing orders will be through contracts. The industry now is far from being independent. Indeed, mandatory orders still account for 85 percent of its production value. The State will also relax its tight hold over prices of rolling stock so that in three to four years market forces will be the primary determinants of pricing. Prices for vehicle parts are expected to be freed this year, for passenger and freight cars, in 1995; and, for locomotives, 1997. There remains a big gap between prices paid by the State and prices set by the market. For example, the market price for a Dongfeng-4 diesel locomotive is 4.8 million yuan ($552.000) but the ministry will pay only 3.1 million yuan ($356,000). The system for deciding investments will also depart from arbitrary allocation by the State and rely more on market financing and self financing by enterprises. Fu cautioned that the industry must prepare for domestic and foreign challenges as it advances into the highly-competitive market place. Loric's decades-old monopoly over freight car production has become feeble, allowing a legion of competitors to squeeze into the manufacturing and repair businesses. The ministry plans to spend $10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) this year for new rail vehicles. In 1994 Loric will arrange the production of about 800 locomotives, 2,000 passenger cars and 32,500 freight cars. About 80 per cent of the new locomotives will be for large-haul service on trunk lines, primarily the Dongfeng-4 diesel and Shaoshan-4 electric models. For passenger cars the focus will be on the Model 25, which accommodates more travellers at higher speed and with more comfort than the obsolete Model 22, still the backbone of passenger service. Production of the Model 22 will be phased out by next year. Despite the shortage of capital and raw material, Loric last year built 670 diesel locomotives, 19 per cent more than in 1992; 220 electric locomotives, 10 per cent more; 1,850 passenger cars, 12 per cent more; and 29,000 freight cars, 34 per cent more.
