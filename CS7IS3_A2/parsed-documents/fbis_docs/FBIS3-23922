Much dispute was seen in Russia in 1993 as to whether or not to allow foreign bank capital into the country. As a result, those who support protection of the national banking system from foreign competitors managed to effect a temporary restriction on the sphere of activity of foreign bankers in Russia. Nonetheless, a number of banks that obtained licenses in 1993 have in fact begun operations. Little in Credits, Few Rubles, Few Resident Clients Of course, foreign banks in Russia have not yet moved as far ahead as they have in Poland and Hungary. But already the first few months of foreign bank activity in the country enable us to note certain "partialities" of bankers from abroad. First of all it must be said that because of the unfavorable economic situation and opposition from a certain segment of the Russian business community and establishment, the arrival of foreign banks in Russia is not proceeding very energetically. In particular, this is reflected in the extremely cautious approach Western banks are using in matters of investments and extension of credits to borrowers. In their first stage of operation virtually all foreign banks in Russia have concentrated on providing clearing-operations services for clients. Foreign banks are opening and managing current accounts, issuing cash currency, effecting international money transfers, opening letters of credit, performing deposit and conversion transactions, issuing guarantees, and providing consulting services to clients on capital investment matters. As a rule, payments within Russia are effected through a system of corresponding accounts opened in Russian banks. A comparison of terms for opening accounts and the amount of commission charged by foreign banks and their Russian colleagues shows that the foreign banks are trying to avoid standing out too much. Their rates are not very different from the rates of the leading Russian banks, although in a number of instances they exceed the latter. Bank Austria and BNP-Dresdner Bank (Rossija) have a "more democratic" look, for example. The bank Societe Generale Russie stands out somewhat--$1,000 to open an account, and a slight hint to the effect that small-scale clients need not apply. Nonresidents predominate as clients of the foreign banks. This is not just related to the temporary ban on servicing Russian firms and citizens. A particular feature of the strategy of a number of large-scale foreign banks is the fact that they are striving not so much to gain a local clientele as to "escort" their traditional clients, creating comfortable conditions for them to carry out their business in a new country (Societe Generale Russie) or facilitating the economic relations of a particular country with Russia (Bank of China in Russia). After obtaining an "offshore" license from the Central Bank, Bank Austria set as its goal from the very beginning the aim of "seizing" the money of foreign firms and citizens operating in Russia, not the money of residents of Russia. The ethnic composition of the clientele of foreign banks varies. Bank of China in Russia services Chinese firms or joint enterprises almost exclusively, with the participation of Chinese capital. The European banks are more "international." Only one-fifth of all the clients of Bank Austria constitute Austrian companies and citizens. Juridical persons predominate as clients of foreign banks. The explanation for this can also be found in the particular policy features of a number of banks (for example, the bank Societe Generale does not do "retail" banking business at all outside the borders of France). Foreign banks are presently performing transactions primarily in hard currency and they are in no hurry to initiate ruble transactions. However, 1994 promises to become a year of more intense activity on the part of foreign banks in Russia. First of all, during the course of the year at least another six banks will begin operations in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Secondly, it is expected that at mid-year the restrictions on foreign bank activity imposed by the 15 November 1993 presidential edict will be lifted. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will return frequently to the problem of the presence of foreign banks in the country. Bank Austria (Z-Landerbank Bank Austria AG) Bank Austria was the first foreign bank to obtain the right to open a branch in Russia (License No. 1). The branch began operations on 7 December 1992. Today 30 people work in the branch, of whom only two are foreigners. In essence, the branch is an offshore banking institution without the right to service residents of Russia. It operates exclusively with nonresidents. As of today, the bank's clientele numbers in the hundreds. Over half the clients of the Moscow branch of Bank Austria are firms (corporate customers), approximately one-third are physical persons (private customers), and about 20 percent are financial institutions. In the future it is possible that the circle of clients will be expanded by virtue of joint enterprises with the participation of Russian capital. The bank does not intend to carry on business with "pure" residents in the near future. The Moscow branch of Bank Austria carries out transactions in foreign currency exclusively. It is tied into the Reuters Dealing system and SWIFT system. The bank devotes special attention to cash currency transactions. Ready cash can be obtained at the Austrian bank itself or at the offices of Russian banks with which Bank Austria has concluded special agreements (specifically, in Moscow--with Tokobank, in St. Petersburg--with the bank St. Petersburg).

Telephone: (095) 956-30-00. Credit Lyonnais Russie Holder of Central Bank of Russia License No. 2. The bank's charter fund--20 million ECU (about $22.5 million). The founders of Credit Lyonnais Russie are Credit Lyonnais Europe (35 percent), Credit Lyonnais Belgique (30 percent), and Credit Lyonnais Global Banking (35 percent). The bank officially opened in December 1992 and began operations in July 1993. Presently the bank does business with juridical persons and Russian commercial banks (number of clients totals about 120). Private individuals comprise an insignificant portion of the clientele. Commission rates charged by the bank have been declared a commercial secret. In the words of bank officials, these are not published in either full or abbreviated form and are not taken out of the bank premises. Deposit rates are established for each specific instance by agreement with the client, depending on type of currency, amount of deposit, and term of deposit. Minimum amount of deposit is set at $50,000 (or its equivalent in any freely convertible currency). Bank address: 12 Nevskiy Prospekt, St. Petersburg. Telephone: (812) 210-31-00. BNP--Dresdner Bank (Rossija) The bank's founders are Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Dresdner Bank AG, each of which owns 50 percent of the capital. The bank opened 10 September 1993. It currently provides services to physical and juridical persons, residents, and nonresidents. Ruble accounts are opened only for subsequent conversion into hard currency. Client rubles are converted at the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange or within the bank. The charge for conversion at the currency exchange is 1 percent, but this may be reduced in certain instances (for major clients). Conversion inside the bank (according to unofficial information) costs the client 2 percent. The bank does not operate with cash rubles. Bank officials refused to provide information as to the exact number of clients. They noted, however, that the bank is not experiencing any shortage. The bank does virtually no business extending credits to clients. A client may be issued credit only under the guarantee of a Western bank, a deposit to a bank of the BNP-DB network against the extension of credit, or the guarantee of the parent company in the West (for affiliate structures of foreign companies in Russia).

Telephone: (812) 312-21-00. Societe Generale Russie A subsidiary bank of Societe Generale, Societe Generale Russie began operations on 8 November 1994 [as published]. Some 35 people work in the bank, including seven foreigners. Bank clients presently include about 10 major international companies in France, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States (names are not divulged). The bank does not currently provide services to residents. Societe Generale Russie is tied into the SWIFT system. In the spring the bank will move to a new office on Belinskaya Street, augment its staff, and expand its sphere of activity. It provides settlement-account servicing for clients and accepts deposits for terms of at least 30 days and amounts of at least $100,000 (the interest rate paid on deposits is somewhat lower than the LIBOR rate). Terms for the conduct of exchange transactions with cash and noncash currency are the subject of special agreements with clients.

Telephone: (095) 940-08-15. Bank of China (Bank of China in Russia) Bank of China in Russia is a branch bank of the state Chinese bank, Bank of China. In addition to Bank of China (75.4 percent of the charter fund), the shareholders of Bank of China in Russia are two Hong Kong banks--Sin Hua Bank Ltd. and Kincheng Banking Corp. (24.6 percent). Both these banks belong to the group Bank of China. The bank's charter fund amounts to $10 million. The bank obtained a license from the Central Bank in April 1993 and actually began operations in November of that year. About 20 persons are presently employed at the bank, most of whom are Chinese. By the end of January 1994 the bank had about 100 clients, of whom approximately half were physical persons--mainly Chinese residing in Russia. Chinese companies doing business in Russia and joint enterprises with the participation of Chinese capital also predominate among those clients comprising juridical persons. Soon the bank intends to expand its clientele and operate more intensively with Russian companies and citizens. Transactions involving cash currency are not yet very widespread. Interest is presently not being accrued in deposit accounts because of the unprofitability of banking operations. The bank has not yet officially begun transactions in Russian rubles. At the request of clients, however, the ruble proceeds of Chinese companies are converted to freely convertible currency. Bank of China in Russia is not yet tied into the SWIFT system, but it is linked with the extensive network of branches of Bank of China throughout the world. Commissions charged by Bank of China in Russia (as of 26 Jan 94) Type of transaction Cost of bank service Check-cashing From 0.1 to 0.5 percent, depending on the type of transaction (min $20; max $300) Documentary letters of credit From 0.125 to 0.15 percent, depending on the type of transaction (min $30; max $300) Transfers 0.1 percent (min $10; max $200) Guarantees From 0.25 to 0.5 percent for a term of up to three months (min $50) Note: Cost of a guarantee for a longer period of time or for a large amount is the subject of negotiations between the bank and the client Bank address: 6/1 Kadashevskaya Quay, Moscow. Telephone: (095) 230-02-15. Citibank T/O Moscow This is the last of the foreign banks to begin operations in Russia. Citibank T/O Moscow is a subsidiary bank of the very large American bank Citibank. An inaugural ceremony marked the opening of the bank on 14 January 1994. The directors of the Moscow Citibank have often stated their intention to include residents of Russia within their clientele, but the already mentioned presidential edict does not yet provide the bank such an opportunity. In the words of Citibank T/O Moscow representatives, the amount of bank commission is established for each specific instance during negotiations with the client. Bank address: 8/10 Gasheka Street, Moscow. Telephone: (095) 956-23-45. Several More Foreign Banks To Begin Operations in 1994 The group of strong foreign banks now operating in Russia will be joined in 1994 by another six or seven banks. The joint Russian-Turkish Yapi TOKO Bank will soon begin operations. ING Bank will open around April of this year, and Chase Manhattan Bank--in May. Also beginning operations in Russia in the spring is the bank Credit Suisse (bank officials were presently unable to give a more precise date). The time frames for opening ABN Amro Bank (the Netherlands), the Russian-Turkish bank in Moscow, and a branch of Postipankki OY (Finland) in St. Petersburg have not yet been determined.
