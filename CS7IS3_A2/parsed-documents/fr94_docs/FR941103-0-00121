FR941103-0-00121 FR941103-0-00016 (iii) Compliance test. Two test specimens of the material to be used in the manufacture of a cargo tank must be tested to failure in tension. The test specimens must be of the same thicknesses and joint configuration as the cargo tank, and joined by the same welding procedures. The test specimens may represent all the tanks that are made of the same materials and welding procedures, have the same joint configuration, and are made in the same facility within 6 months after the tests are completed. Before welding, the fit-up of the joints on the test specimens must represent production conditions that would result in the least joint strength. Evidence of joint fit-up and test results must be retained at the manufacturers' facility. (iv) Weld joint efficiency. The lower value of stress at failure attained in the two tensile test specimens shall be used to compute the efficiency of the joint as follows: Determine the failure ratio by dividing the stress at failure by the mechanical properties of the adjacent metal; this value, when multiplied by 0.75, is the design weld joint efficiency. (10) The requirements of paragraph UW&hyph;9(d), of Section VIII, Division 1, ASME Code do not apply. §178.346&hyph;2 [Amended] 26. In §178.346&hyph;2, the paragraph (a) designation is removed; the phrase ``DOT 406 cargo tanks'' is revised to read ``DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles''; and in Table II, the heading ``Rated capacity (gallons)'' in the first column is revised to read ``Cargo tank motor vehicle rated capacity (gallons)''. 27. In §178.346&hyph;10, the word ``and'' at the end of paragraph (b)(1) is removed, the period at the end of paragraph (b)(2) is removed and ``; and'' is added in its place, a new paragraph (b)(3) is added and paragraphs (c)( 1) and (d)(1) are revised to read as follows: §178.346&hyph;10 Pressure relief. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (3) Notwithstanding the requirements in §178.345&hyph;10(b), after August 31, 1996, each pressure relief valve must be able to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding one liter before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81, cited at §178.345&hyph;10(b)(3)(i), is an acceptable test procedure. (c) *␣*␣* (1) Notwithstanding the requirements in §178.345&hyph;10(d), the set pressure of each primary relief valve must be not less than 110 percent of the MAWP or 3.3 psig, whichever is greater, and not more than 138 percent of the MAWP. The valve must close at not less than the MAWP and remain closed at lower pressures. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (1) Notwithstanding the requirements in §178.345&hyph;10 (e) and (g), the primary pressure relief valve must have a venting capacity of at least 6,000 SCFH, rated at not greater than 125 percent of the tank test pressure and not greater than 3 psig above the MAWP. The venting capacity required in §178.345&hyph;10(e) may be rated at these same pressures. * * * * * 28. In §178.346&hyph;13, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows:
