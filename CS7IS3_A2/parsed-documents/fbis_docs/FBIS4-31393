However, there are some differences of views regarding the speed of this process. The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] are urging the reduction of state property to a minimum and, thus, they want to get rid of the state property as soon as possible. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] however, thinks that it is necessary to thoroughly consider the pace at which the state property is reduced. The MSZP also thinks that the number of factories, banks, and other enterprises owned by the state should be reduced to below the level set out by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. [passage omitted] On the Fate of Privatization Income: While the MSZP argues in favor of reviving enterprises, creating jobs, and covering the debts accumulated by state enterprises, the SZDSZ prefers quick privatization to "renewal and selling," but privatization to new owners capable of accumulating capital, of modernizing, and of saving jobs. On Economic Progress: There are differences of emphasis between the economic programs. Both parties say that, contrary to what the current government claims, the conditions for economic revival will have to be created now. Both parties see possibilities of a small economic growth around 1996, but this will hardly be noticeable in the people's standard of living. The first goal is to restore the upset economic balance and to halt the tremendous foreign economic deficit and the increase in the budget deficit. Both parties find it important to make use of the economic contacts with the European Union and to gain new markets. However, the MSZP thinks that Hungary will have little chance of a large-scale increase in exports because of the economic recession prevailing in the West and the internal market defense in the West. Therefore, the MSZP would like to regain the Eastern markets, the markets of the former Soviet member states. The MSZP admits that we can only think of barter trade because of the financial difficulties and lack of capital there. Because of the bad experiences of previous years, the SZDSZ does not agree with this idea. [passage omitted] On the Budget: According to the MSZP, the most important task is to halt state waste and avoid the unpredictable growth of our foreign and domestic debt. The goal of the MSZP is to reduce expenses, the deficit, and also the withdrawals first of all by reducing expenses on state administration and other low-efficiency expenses. The SZDSZ wants to reduce the budget deficit by streamlining the executive state apparatus, reforming the army, reducing management expenses, and cutting social payments to people who are not in need. On the Tax System: Both parties promise a stabilization of the tax system. The MSZP would try to achieve this by considerably reducing the corporation taxes, eliminating the taxes on forint and hard currency interest and the minimal tax, restoring the advantages of foreign investors, making investment incomes free of tax, and taxing property accumulation. Reducing the weight of income tax and increasing the role of consumer taxes also appears in their program. The SZDSZ: Investment tax benefits for Hungarian and foreign entrepreneurs; taking over wage costs from entrepreneurs who create jobs; restoring the contract tax of small entrepreneurs; increasing the role of local governments in taxation at the detriment of central withdrawals. [passage omitted] On Trade Unions: The SZDSZ does not regard as fortunate that the chairman of the largest trade union in the country is sitting in Parliament as a government party deputy. The SZDSZ thinks that this mixes up the role of employee interest representation with the task of the executive power. This is mostly a political difference of views between the two parties. According to the MSZP, the so-called tripartite talks between the trade unions and the government [government-employers-employees] are the guarantee that no essential decisions in the economic and social sphere are made without a broad consensus. [passage omitted] On Hungary's Neighbors: According to the MSZP, Hungary needs rapprochement and bilateral and regional cooperation with its neighbors. "We want to trade, rather than engage in litigations." The MSZP promises the confirmation of open borders and full assertion of national minority rights by international law, and they are urging the creation of an efficient international system of national minority protection. According to the SZDSZ, economic and political cooperation is the basic guarantee for Hungary's security. Bilateral agreements should guarantee (traversable) borders and the assertion of national minority rights. National minority protection goals should be formulated in which we can find partners among the international organizations and the majority democratic forces in our neighbors. On NATO and the European Union: The MSZP says that the conditions of joining the European Union must be created as soon as possible. Hungary's relations with NATO should be further developed, but NATO membership is not the only guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum should decide on joining both organizations. The SZDSZ says that we should not force a deadline for preparations for integration; instead, we should set out our own pace so that Hungary becomes suitable to join the Union as soon as possible. According to the SZDSZ, a broad social consensus must be achieved regarding the issue of integration. [passage omitted]
