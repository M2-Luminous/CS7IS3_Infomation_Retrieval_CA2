SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 113 contain Standard Requirements for evaluating veterinary biological products that are licensed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act of 1913, as amended by the Food Security Act of 1985. Veterinary biological products are defined as all viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics, antitoxins, vaccines, live microorganisms, killed microorganisms and antigenic or immunizing components of microorganisms intended for the use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of diseases of animals. In order to be licensed, veterinary biological products must be demonstrated to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. Purity and identity tests are performed by the licensee and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) on the Master Seed(s) and Master Cell Stock(s) used in the production of veterinary biological products. The licensee is also required to perform tests on the veterinary biological product following complete formulation for purity, safety, and potency as prescribed in a filed Outline of Production or Standard Requirements for the product in accordance with ยง113.5. The manufacturer's test results may be checked by NVSL personnel on biological product samples that the manufacturer is required to submit to NVSL in accordance with ยง113.3.
