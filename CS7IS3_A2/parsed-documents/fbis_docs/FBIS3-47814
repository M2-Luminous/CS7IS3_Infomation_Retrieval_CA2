The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and vice-president, Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, and officials concerned. The Korean alphabet created on the basis of the Sinji letters which had been used by Koreans for thousands of years was proclaimed in 1444. In his report at the meeting, Vice-premier of the Administration Council Chang Chol said the Korean alphabet is a set of national letters worthy of praise, which reflect the creative wisdom and resourcefulness of the Korean people, and a valuable asset and cultural heritage of the nation that holds a particular position in the development of written languages of the world. Turning to the advantages of the Korean alphabet, Chang Chol said it is scientific theoretically and orderly in structure and system, it fully reflects the characteristics and richness of the sound and easy to learn and write. "With the creation of the Korean alphabet, the Korean people came to have a means of writing suited to the national characteristics of the mother tongue and a powerful weapon in the cause of transforming nature and society," he said. He recalled that during their occupation of Korea in the past, the Japanese imperialists forced the Koreans to change their names to Japanese style and speak and write in Japanese in everyday life in order to obliterate the Korean language and letters as well as the Korean nation. "This was the most heinous crime never to be condoned and a beastly act without precedent in history," the reporter said. "Under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, darkness and illiteracy were dispelled, the anti-popular system of writing demolished and a new system of writing based on national independence established, so the Korean people, who were far removed from modern civilization, have become the true masters and users of the written and spoken languages," he said. "The idea and guidance of the great leader to develop the national language on the basis of chuche and improve it are being successfully carried forward by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il today." He said the treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to obliterate the mother tongue in league with the U.S. imperialists can never be pardoned because they are aimed at keeping the Korean nation divided into two forever. "In order to smash the moves to obliterate the national language on the part of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges in South Korea, all the Koreans who love the country and the nation must rise as one in the struggle to prevent a permanent division of the nation and achieve a unified development, be they in the North or in the South or overseas, be they communists or nationalists," stressed the reporter.
