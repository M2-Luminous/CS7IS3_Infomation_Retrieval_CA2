Syedin, professor and doctor of psychology, by unidentified correspondent; date and place not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] [Text] [Correspondent] Sergey Ivanovich, you have devoted your entire life to the armed forces, in particular to military psychology. In recent years you headed the military psychology faculty at the Humanitarian Academy of the Armed Forces. What prospects do you see for military psychology in particular, and the use of psychology in the armed forces in general, while major reforms are being carried out in the army? [Syedin] You cannot include military psychology among those sciences that make up the armed forces' methodological basis of construction. At the same time, we note that the armed forces cannot be built without military psychology. The historical experience of the Russian Army's development prior to 1917 indicates great attention was always paid to the mental state of servicemen. There was even a society of devotees of military affairs which published a magazine centered mainly on military psychology. Presently, every unit has a psychologist, as do formations and groups. However, in my opinion the problem of creating a social and psychological service, and of the psychological system as a whole, has not been completely solved. [Correspondent] Do the people who have been appointed as unit and formation psychologists fulfill the requirements in terms of their professional training? What is your opinion? [Syedin] In answering this question and discussing this issue, I would like to relate what the purely official understanding of a psychologist is. In my opinion, a military psychologist is an officer who occupies the position and who has a state-approved diploma as a psychologist. As it turns out, presently the positions of psychologists are occupied by people who do not fully meet these requirements. Personally, I have always supported the idea that any job should be done by a professional. The professional should know the results of his actions and work, and should predict its outcome. Much is presently being said and written about psychotropic weapons and making zombies out of people [zombirovaniye]. But these are still unresearched manifestations. I do not want to dispute it, but at the same time I would not like to see those who are professionally untrained dabbling in it. [Correspondent] Presently, a large number of young men, former servicemen or active duty servicemen who have experienced extreme situations or participated in combat, have accumulated in our armed forces and state in general. Could military psychologists organize some form of assistance, some form of psychotherapeutic rehabilitation, for them? Can something be done for them along these lines today? [Syedin] Our department has studied the experience of psychological rehabilitation abroad. The U.S. armed forces have a wealth of experience in this area. We know about the problems of Vietnam war veterans, and that there are 196 centers in the United States for the psychological rehabilitation of war veterans and their families. In our armed forces, and in associated public services such as various committees for the social defense of servicemen and members of their families, this kind of purpose-oriented work is not carried out. At the same time, practical work by the staff and teachers of our department shows that to a great extent military psychology, particularly the psychology of a humanitarian, is capable of doing achieving this.
