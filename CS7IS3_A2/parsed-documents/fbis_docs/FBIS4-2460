Addressing the annual session of the provincial people's congress that opened here yesterday, Jia said that Fujian's gross national product (GNP) -- the value of all goods and services produced -- shot up by 25.4 percent to nearly 96.8 billion yuan in 1993. As a result, Fujian had quadrupled its 1980 GNP by the end of 1993, seven years ahead of schedule, he said in his government work report. The governor also released the following figures to illustrate Fujian's economic achievements in 1993: -- Industrial output value climbed 48 percent to 149 billion yuan; -- Agricultural output value rose 11 percent to 39.5 billion yuan; -- Grain production reached 8.69 million tons; and -- 13 priority infrastructure projects were completed. He attributed Fujian's rapid economic growth to macro-economic control measures and efforts to optimize the industrial structure and improve economic returns. "Rapid economic growth has made it possible for Fujian residents to enjoy higher living standards," he said. In real terms, the per-capita income of urban residents rose by 6.8 percent to 2,605 yuan, and that of rural residents by seven percent to 1,211 yuan. Apartment buildings with a total floor space of five million sq m were completed last year, he said, adding that the floor space for urban residents rose to 10.8 sq m per person. On the whole, rural residents live in more spacious homes, with per-capita floor space rising to 22.4 sq m in 1993, he said. In a move to eliminate poverty, he said that the provincial authorities have decided to resettle 100,000 poverty-stricken residents in areas with good natural conditions and bright development prospects. These residents should be encouraged to move, on a voluntary basis, out of areas with harsh natural conditions, he said. The governor also spelled out the following major tasks for this year: -- Deepening reforms in order to speed up the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; -- Stabilizing grain production and expanding the rural economy; -- Improving economic returns in industrial production; -- Accelerating infrastructure construction; and -- Opening Fujian still wider to the outside world. "In introducing overseas funds, we should focus on the construction of harbors, power plants, airports, expressways, the expansion of basic industries and the farming sector and the upgrading of existing enterprises," he said. He promised to formulate flexible policies for overseas companies investing in these sectors. He also called for efforts to use more overseas funds in the financial, retail and tourism sectors. Fujian, on China's east coast facing the Taiwan Straits, should do all it can to increase its economic and trade exchanges with Taiwan, the governor said.
