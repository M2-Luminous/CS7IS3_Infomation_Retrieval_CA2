Changes in Republic's Government Imminent"] [Text] The measure of stability that has come to Azerbaijan after a prolonged period of power changes has begun to attract new economic partners to the republic. One piece of evidence of this is the signing in Baku the other day by Latvian Vice Premier Ojars Kehris and Azerbaijan Vice Premier Samed Sadykhov of an agreement on trade and economic relations between the two countries. In addition, Mr. Kehris signed with Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov a protocol on the establishment of diplomatic links. The Latvian vice premier announced after the ceremony that under the agreement on economic and trade cooperation, Azerbaijan would deliver to Latvia mainly fuel and petroleum products, and would receive vehicles, in particular locomotives, rail cars, and instruments. In the meantime, Azerbaijan's leadership has begun behind-the-scenes discussions about a coming reshuffle. It is not ruled out that Lala Gadzhiyeva, Azerbaijan's secretary of state, will be appointed the republic's ambassador to the United Nations in the near future. Lala Gadzhiyeva, doctor of medicine, took the office of secretary of state last summer after Geydar Aliyev came to power. Before that she lived and worked in Moscow, engaged in political activities, and was one of the authors of the scenario of Geydar Aliyev's return to power. She is still regarded as the current Azerbaijan president's right-hand person. The reason for such an influential figure quitting the political center stage were Lala Gadzhiyeva's bad relations with Prime Minister Surat Guseynov. Using all his influence, the latter demanded that Aliyev remove Gadzhiyeva from the office of secretary of state. Mrs. Gadzhiyeva tendered her resignation on 16 December but the president would not endorse it before he could find her a suitable position. The vacated position is contested by Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and Arifa Ragimzade, state counselor for administrative-territorial administration. Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned from a completely trustworthy source that this position will most probably be filled by Gasan Gasanov, who was prime minister under Ayaz Mutalibov and who even at that time did not hide his sympathy for Geydar Aliyev.
