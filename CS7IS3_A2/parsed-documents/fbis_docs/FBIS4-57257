Foreign Minister Celso Amorim discussed the issue with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and only budget, technical, and military logistical matters have yet to be resolved with the United Nations. Amorim said: [Begin recording] In any case, the UN secretary general again conveyed to me that he is interested. We are now discussing budget, technical, and even military logistical matters with the United Nations, i.e. whether we will be sending a battalion or a company. A battalion consists of 700 men, while a company consists of more than 200 men. We will probably be sending a battalion to Mozambique. [end recording] The cost of sending an Army battalion stands at approximately $40 million, which will be reimbursed by the United Nations.
