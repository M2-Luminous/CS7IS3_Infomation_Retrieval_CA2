Kecman: "Preparations to Build Road from Banja Luka to Cadjavica Via Manjaca: Half a Million Marks for Initial Work"] [Text]The Executive Committee of the SO [Serb Opstina] in Banja Luka has provided 500,000 German marks [DM] for the construction of a road which will shorten the trip to Knin by 60 km; the people of Manjaca enthusiastically welcomed around 300 engineers from the First Corps with 50 machines; petroleum, spare parts, and projects for shorter section provided. Banja Luka, 28 Apr--The Executive Committee of Banja Luka Opstina, at the suggestion of chairman Rajko Kasagic, has decided to pay DM500,000 to the fund for construction of a highway between Banja Luka and Cadjavica from the opstina budget, as the initial amount necessary for 50 machines and 300 soldiers from engineer units of the First Krajina Corps to carry out preparations and begin cutting the section from Kocic Han to Cadjavica, 15 km in length, over Easter. "The Executive Committee has provided this money to secure spare parts for machines, tires, batteries, and other necessary goods, so that the start will be successful. An adequate quantity of petroleum has also been acquired. Responsible for the acquisition of the petroleum are `Sinekop,' owned by Slavko Roguljic, PP `Djukic,' owned by Momo Djukic, and MP `Poljoeksport' in Banja Luka. The road should be completed by 21 September," read the announcement by Rajko Kasagic, who is also coordinator of the construction of this road, which will shorten the connection between Knin and Banja Luka by 60 km. Engineer Radoslav Brdjanin, minister for urban planning and construction, and part of the ministry in Banja Luka are providing project documentation for a shorter variant (in addition to the longer one to be built); completion of the shorter route, across the military firing range at Dobrnja, would shorten the Banja Luka section by more than 5 km. Engineers from the First Krajina Corps are already on site in Stricici, and the 300 soldiers are being provided for by hosts, including the president of the local community, Dragan Vulin, who says that the soldiers building the road will have everything they want because the people are finally getting the road promised to them back during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. "By connecting the town, by building small properties and dwellings in Manjaca, and through work in Banja Luka, we have the opportunity to move the city to Zmijanje and Manjaca," says Petar Savarevic from Stricici. Father Nikodin Cavic of Pervan feels that this road will bring the cultivated land of Manjaca to life, and with the industrious Krajinans it will become like the cultivated land of Sumadija. "From the production of healthy food, unlimited possibilities for raising cattle and meat packing, a return to old trades in a modern way, to the production of furniture, naturally in small workshops--cottage industries, as `Simpo' in Vranje is doing--and then possibilities for three swathes of grass a year and raising sheep like before the war, with this road this region has the opportunity to revive and become a significant factor for development in the republic of Srpska, because together with Lijevce Polje and the food producers there, food from Manjaca is the mainstay of development," says Father Cavic. Something that has not been done in the last 100 years, something about which Petar Kocic wrote, something that the authorities of the former SFRY and Bosnia-Herzegovina did not succeed in doing, something that neither Mamula nor Kadijevic succeeded in doing, but that they promised to do: It appears that this will now be corrected and that the Banja Luka-Cadjavica road (intersecting the Mrkonjic Grad-Kljuc road) will finally be built. It remains to be seen whether all this will be happen according to schedule, before the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, under the difficult conditions of sanctions and minimal production in an economy that has no market.
