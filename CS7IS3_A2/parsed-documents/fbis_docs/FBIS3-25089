Our reporter, Hassan Kia, who just returned from Buchanan, said he saw hundreds of returnees and escapees including women with their malnourished babies on their backs. Our reporter said most of those who spoke to him looked weary and hungry because of the many days of walking in the bushes to get to Buchanan from [name indistinct] and its surrounding villages. They told our reporter that for nights, they came under heavy firing from the two warring sides. Meanwhile, the Catholic Relief Service [CRS] has begun distributing emergency food ration to both the returnees and the escapees that are arriving in Buchanan and nearby towns. The employee of CRS catering for the influx said since yesterday, 100 bags of rice, vegetable oil, and beans have been distributed. Each family, he said, received 20 cups of rice for new arrival ration, while efforts were being made to absorb them into other areas for regular relief supplies.
