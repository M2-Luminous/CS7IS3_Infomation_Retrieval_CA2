The following is our report: I. Development of Shanghai's Commercial Shareholding Enterprises Shanghai is one of the cities with the largest number of enterprises piloting the shareholding system. At the end of May 1993, it had 63 shareholding enterprises, with 12.66 billion yuan in share capital. Of that, 13 were commercial shareholding enterprises, with 914 million yuan in share capital; they accounted for 20.6 percent and 7.2 percent of the municipality's total number of shareholding enterprises and total share capital, respectively. The development of Shanghai's pilot commercial shareholding enterprises can be divided into three stages: 1987-1990 marked the first stage. Yuyuan Shopping Mall Shareholding Co. Ltd. and New World Shareholding Trading Co. Ltd. were the municipality's first experimental points. Constrained by the internal and external conditions, besides converting the original assets into shares, Yuyuan only absorbed 1.3 million yuan in personal shares and New World absorbed only 390,000 yuan in legal person shares. The two enterprises only had 6.5 million and 6.94 million yuan, respectively, in share capital. Because of the lack of relevant policies and laws and regulations, there were many conflicts between the shareholding system and the original system, and adding the fact that people had different ideas about the system and because of inappropriate administrative intervention, it made the pilot project even more difficult, and for some time, no progress was made. The second stage began toward the end of 1990 and lasted until the first half of 1992. During this period, the State Council officially allowed Shanghai to pilot the system of issuing shares to the general public. China's first securities exchange opened in Shanghai. The municipal government introduced a series of policies and laws and regulations pertaining to the pilot shareholding system. In particular, Comrade Deng Xioaping's speech delivered during his South China tour further increased the people's consciousness about speeding up the reform. In the first six months of 1992, development began to gather momentum. Some large- and medium-sized commercial enterprises began to link the shareholding system to the vitalization of Shanghai's businesses and the goal of developing great circulation, big markets, and big business. The nation's two largest departments stores--Shanghai Number One Department Store and Shanghai Hualian Business Building--and the municipality's largest food store--Shanghai Number One Food Stores--proceeded to restructure their enterprises under the shareholding system. Yuyuan Shopping Mall Shareholding Co. Ltd. and 15 enterprises initiated a reorganization and set up the Yuyuan Tourist City Shareholding Company, Ltd. In March and April of 1992, New World Trading Company, Ltd. took over five small state-owned shops as determined by the district business commission and, upon expanding the scope of state-owned assets, successfully went public with their stock. In the first half of 1992, the municipal commercial system set up eight public-offering companies. They had total share capital of 487 million yuan and raised more than 1.6 billion yuan by issuing shares at a premium. The third stage began in the second half of 1992. After the State Restructuring of the Economic System Commission and other relevant departments promulgated a dozen or so laws and regulations pertaining to the shareholding experimental points, the pilot project's external conditions were further improved. In the first half of 1993, the municipal commercial system set up another five directional capital raising companies, among them, New Asia (Group) Shareholding Company, Ltd. had as much as 230 million yuan in share capital and was Shanghai's largest commercial shareholding enterprise. Because of the strong guiding role of the policies and laws and regulations, the organization and development of new shareholding enterprises took another big step toward standardization. Facts show that Shanghai's pilot commercial shareholding enterprises have produced clear results. The pilot enterprises have the initial mechanisms to make autonomous management decisions and take care of their own profits and losses, and they have quickened the pace of self-improvement and self-development. Enterprises sold shares and used the funds they raised first to transform and expand their original operating facilities and build new business outlets. They actively opened up new management territories and vigorously developed the export-oriented economy and in turn greatly increased their ability to compete in the market. They have had good economic results. If we look at enterprises' realized profits, from 1987 when Yuyuan Shopping Mall became a limited liability company until 1991, in four years' time, its profit had increased at an annual rate of 18 percent, and after reorganizing, its average profit increased 1.2 fold in 1992 and another 1.2 fold in the first six months of 1993 compared to the same period a year earlier. Number One Department Store and Hualian Business Building which converted to the shareholding system in 1992 saw their profits grow 23 percent that year compared to the previous year and another 51 percent and 68 percent, respectively, in the first half of 1993 compared to the same period a year earlier. Currently, six of the municipality's commercial shareholding companies are listed in the market. Their very promising future has attracted many investors. II. Current Conditions of the State's Equity Management in Shanghai's Shareholding Commercial Enterprises Of Shanghai's 63 shareholding enterprises, 37 were originally state-owned enterprises. The original state properties were converted to state-owned shares in the shareholding enterprises. The state owns 7.65 billion yuan's worth of stocks in the 37 enterprises, accounting for 70 percent of the share capital. Of the 13 commercial shareholding enterprises, 10 have state-owned stocks, and we looked into eight of those enterprises. The state owns 342 million yuan worth of shares in these eight enterprises, accounting for 49.9 percent of their share capital.

Ltd. Administration of State Properties Total 685.248 49.9 Below we will look at the state's equity management from three different perspectives: 1. Setup of the State's Equity Management In the process of reorganizing state-owned enterprises into shareholding enterprises, to protect the legal rights and privileges of state properties, the Municipal Administration of State Properties was put in charge of auditing the assessment of state properties to verify the assessed value of state properties and the number of state shares upon converting the assets to share capital. This was the basic task of state equity management. Prior to 1991, however, Shanghai did not have a specialized department to manage state properties, and therefore basically no one was looking after the state-owned shares in the shareholding enterprises. Yuyuan and New World, the two shareholding companies set up between 1987 and 1988, did not have their properties appraised properly during reorganization and only converted the book value of the state properties into state shares. Since the actual value of the state properties was higher than their book value, and since other shareholders had purchased shares based on face value, the state shares were compromised. In the first six months of 1992, these two shareholding companies underwent reorganization and three other state-owned enterprises--Number One Department Store, Hualian Business Building, and Number One Food Stores--also converted to the shareholding system. All five enterprises followed policies effective at that time to entrust specialized organs to appraise their assets. The assessed net asset values were all higher than the book value. The assessed net asset values of the two original shareholding companies were 39 percent and 33 percent, respectively, higher, and the other three state-owned enterprises' assets had appreciated 143 percent, 176 percent, and 71 percent respectively. Amid the assessed net asset value, the value of the intangible assets has appreciated the most, but the book value of the original enterprises' properties did not include intangible assets. The three state-owned enterprises' assessed net assets became the state's share capital and added to the shareholding companies' assets, but the state share capital was still based on the original book value of the assets, and the added value of the assessed net assets was used only as one of the bases for determining the price premium when issuing stocks. Enterprises did not readjust the book value, nor did they record the added net asset value in the capital accumulation fund. Only one enterprise readjusted the book value of the tangible assets and recorded that in the capital accumulation fund; however, intangible assets were still left out of the books. The above situation means the value of the state properties put into the shareholding companies is never fully recognized; the appreciated value of the state properties after the appraisal becomes the shareholding companies' unlisted assets. Similar problems also cropped up during the reorganization of Yuyuan and New World in 1992. When appraising and converting state properties in the course of setting up the three directional fund-raising companies in 1993, a new way of handling the financial issues had already been implemented: book value was readjusted according to the appraised value of the net assets. Among the net assets, the added values of the negotiable securities, long-term investments, and intangible assets were recorded in the capital accumulation fund; the remaining net assets were converted to state-owned share capital. The converted net assets as a percentage of all net assets were used as one of the bases for determining the price premium when issuing shares. This is a fairly standard approach. However, problems left behind by the way the five companies that went public in 1992 appraised and converted their original assets have yet to be addressed. 2. Exercising the State's Equity Rights This includes selecting representative for the state's equities, fulfilling the responsibilities, and restructuring the state's equity rights. Currently, the only organs representing the state's equity shares in Shanghai's shareholding companies are the original enterprise management departments and the administrations of state properties at the corresponding levels. The department in charge of enterprises has substantial power in deciding who represents the state's equity interests. It may consult the administrations of state properties or act independently on its own authority to choose the representatives. Some shareholding enterprises have one person assigned by the department in charge of enterprises and one by the administration of state properties to represent the state's interests, but the person assigned by the department in charge of enterprises is always the first representative who also serves as the company's board chairman. This in fact follows the old state-owned enterprise cadre management system. The department in charge only assigns someone to represent the state's equity interests as a means to control enterprises and does not actually exercise control over the equities, and as a result, a set of management systems necessary to make sure that the representatives are fulfilling their responsibilities--such as the systems of equity representative's work report and of supervision, examination, rewards and penalties--was never formulated. Moreover, some government officials serving on enterprises' boards of directors have created a new mechanism of commingling government and enterprises, which hampers the change in government functions and obstructs fair competition among enterprises. Another problem in the exercise of state equity rights is that state shares cannot be traded in the market. This method of freezing the state's equities hampers the readjustment of the industrial structure and makes it impossible for the state shareholders to make a profit by buying low and selling high. 3. Management of the State's Equity Profits According to current policies and laws and regulations, the municipal and district administrations of state properties should collect share dividends from the shareholding enterprises based on the number of state-owned shares. On the other hand, share dividends collected must be put into the municipality's and districts' separate budgets; however, the administrations of state properties acting as state shareholders have no independent right to determine the use of the share dividends, and in addition, neither the state shares nor the share income are transferrable, and therefore the administrations of state properties cannot reinvest and cannot generate a benign cycle of "input--output--reinvest," which seriously limit the propagation of state assets in shareholding enterprises. In June 1963 Number One Department Store decided to increase capital and bonus shares. Each bonus share was priced at six yuan, 2.9 yuan below the IPO price. Because the Municipal Administration of State Properties had no money to reinvest, it had to give up its right to buy additional shares, and as a result, the state's interest in the company fell by 10 percentage points, bringing losses to the state as shareholder.
