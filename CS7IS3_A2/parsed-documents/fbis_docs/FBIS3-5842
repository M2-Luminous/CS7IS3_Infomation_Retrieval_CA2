The ostensible reason given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is that the summit will be held during the House of Representatives' Budget Committee session, and "we cannot delay deliberations on the budget by sending three or four people to it." But it appears that ministries and agencies are actually reluctant to send their ministers because they think the summit might turn into an arena for Japan-bashing by other nations because of Japan's huge trade surplus. The job summit will be held in Detroit 14-15 March to discuss ways to deal with the seven nations' common problem of unemployment. From the United States, which is the host nation, seven cabinet members including President Bill Clinton and Vice President Alvin Gore will attend the summit. The six nations other than Japan have decided to send their finance ministers and labor ministers. Initially, the Japanese Government thought about sending its finance minister, labor minister, international trade and industry minister, and director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. It is now feared (according to a source in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]) that because Japan is the country with the lowest unemployment rate among the participating summit nations, it is likely the other nations will levy demands on Japan like those for market liberalization and expanded domestic demand. Furthermore, since the venue of the summit is the auto industry town of Detroit, "The United States will try to put pressure on Japan in connection with the suspended Japan-U.S. economic framework talks," according to these views. This means that if the MITI minister, who is in charge of negotiations in the auto sector, wants to participate in the summit, he must have something to offer. But MITI is in the process of hurriedly working on measures, and the minister cannot present something which is only half complete. The frank position of MITI is that its minister should not go there, if possible. The EPA, on the other hand, is worried that, "although our basic position is that we want to send our minister, if the MITI minister does not participate, then our minister will become the target of criticism instead." The Ministry of Finance has no intention of sending either its finance minister or deputy vice minister, and will send only a deputy chief of the International Finance Bureau. But there are also concerns (in the Foreign Ministry and the Labor Ministry) that if Japan does not send ministers to the summit, "it will only incite criticism against Japan." On 8 March, officials of the Labor Ministry were close to obtaining support from the Liberal Democratic Party [as published] on sending the labor minister to the United States. The Foreign Ministry itself says "there has been no final decision made," but it appears the best that will happen is to send one minister -- the labor minister.
