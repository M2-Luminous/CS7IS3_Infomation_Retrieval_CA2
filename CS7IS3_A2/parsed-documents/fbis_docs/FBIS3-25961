Ltd, located in northeast China's Jilin Province -- has expanded steadily thanks to joint efforts of the two sides and their good collaboration. This was stated by Claus Wolf, deputy general manager of the Sino-Germany automotive corporation, during a recent interview. The FAW-Volkswagenwert Automotive Co. Ltd. was established in February 1991, jointly funded by the First Automotive Works (FAW) of China and the world-renowned Volkswagenwert AG of Germany. Substantial progress has been gained ever since with modernized workshops towering over former vegetable plots and the number of employees expanding to more than 1,400 from merely six at the very beginning. Getta sedan cars produced by the joint venture have won much favor on the domestic market and total output topped 20,000 by the end of last year. Joint ventures are among the most difficult sort of enterprises to be managed well due to unavoidable differences in cultural and social backgrounds of working staff from both sides. But the employees of the two sides in FAW-Volkswagenwert have successfully overcome the cultural barrier, if it exist, and work together happily, according to deputy general manager Wolf. "We are heading toward a common goal, to make the corporation better and better," said Wolf. "This helps to remove misunderstandings and make us at home here." He deeply felt that both the Chinese and German sides have worked wholeheartedly for the success of the project. So far, total funds of the project have reached 7.86 billion yuan, with the Chinese side holding 60 percent and German side 40 percent, making it the country's largest auto joint venture. Collective responsibility system of a management committee under the board has been adopted in managing the whole corporation. The committee consists of three Chinese managers and two German managers. As a member of the committee, Wolf believe that the most important thing is to find the best way of working and cooperating. "We share one large office and try to hide nothing between one another. The three Chinese managers are all my good friends. I also feel happy working with the chairman of the corporation, Geng Zhaojie, whom I respect very much," he said. The joint venture has now adopted the policy of simultaneous development of construction, production and increased use of domestically-produced spare parts, according to Wolf. Plans have been drawn up for management and marketing to as far ahead as the year 2,000. Installation of ten-plus production lines has been completed and two of them are already in operation. While the sedan cars produced by the corporation are warmly welcomed by customers, efforts of hard-working staff are also highly appreciated. Talking about an award granted by the Chinese Government to him and meeting with Premier Li Peng, Wolf said politely and modesty: "It is not an award solely for myself, but for the joint efforts of us all." The 52-year-old deputy general manager, who has worked in China for almost a decade, is fully confident of the corporation's future. With the anticipated annual output of 300,000 sedan cars by the year 2000, the cooperation will be one of China's biggest car producing bases, Wolf said.
