The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said the Russian diplomats left between July and December. He said the spies had been discovered during an investigation by ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Senator Evans said the espionage did not constitute a security crisis of any kind or any significant rupture in relations with Russia. [Begin Evans recording] The kind of role they might have had in the past is not one that's appropriate to the new Russia, after the end of the Cold War. And there has of course been a very significant downgrading of the Russian espionage establishment since the end of the Cold War, and I think there's still a diplomatic purging of that kind of presence in embassies around the world: Australia's been no exception. But I repeat, we don't want to make any kind of major issue of this with the Russian Government, they are very cooperative. Once it was drawn to their attention as a result of the ASIO investigation that some inappropriate activities were occurring, then the issue was responsibly and satisfactorily resolved.
