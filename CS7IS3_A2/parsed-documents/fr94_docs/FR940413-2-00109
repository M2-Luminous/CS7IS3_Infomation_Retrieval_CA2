FR940413-2-00109 FR940413-2-00058 This amount is an increase of $7,273,000 above the appropriation for PY 1993. Each year since 1987, additional funds have been included to meet the demand for training and employment services to Special Agricultural Workers (SAWs) who became eligible for the program as a result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In addition, the reports of the House of Representatives and the Senate Committees on Appropriations on the Department of Labor's 1994 appropriations state that the committees expect the Department to continue the farmworker housing program. The Department concurs with this request. The allocation formula is being applied to $81,148,000. The remaining $4,428,000 of the PY 1994 section 402 appropriation is being held in the section 402 national account to fund the housing program ($3,000,000), the Hope, Arkansas, Migrant Rest Center ($300,000), and other training and technical assistance projects. Allocation Formula The $81,148,000 formula total was allocated according to the following formula: (1) $74,752,033 was allocated on a State-by-State basis. This is the same amount as was allocated for each State for PY 1993. This ensures programmatic stability by providing a funding base for each State at its PY 1993 level. (2) $6,395,967 was allocated on a State-by-State basis. Thirty percent of this portion of the appropriation was based on the relative numbers of migrant and seasonal farmworkers in each State, as shown by 1980 Census data; and 70 percent was based on the relative numbers of SAWs in each State, as shown by the most recent Immigration and Naturalization Service data. This provides an equitable distribution of the additional funds available for PY 1994 for programmatic needs generated by the SAW program. Formula Allocations in Out Years For Program Year 1995 and beyond, the Department intends to update the allocation formula to incorporate more current data on the farmworker population. To this end, in April 1994, a special task force was convened to explore options for revising the formula and its bases. Findings from this task force will be reflected in future notices of planning estimates. Signed at Washington, DC, this 6th day of April, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary of Labor.
