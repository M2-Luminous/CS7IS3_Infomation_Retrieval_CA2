The three countries had planned to hold the investigation in mid- January, but had to postpone the plan because of differences of opinion over cost sharing, they said. The problems were resolved recently. The area for investigation will be the East Sea off Hokkaido, where the Russian Far-East fleet said it dumped nuclear waste in October last year.
