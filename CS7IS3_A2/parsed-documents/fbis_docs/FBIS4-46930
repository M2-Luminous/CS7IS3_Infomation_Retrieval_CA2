A city ecological soviet was established for the purpose of coordinating environmental protection activity, and two environmental protection procuracies and a sanitary-ecological militia are working actively. A system of payments for discharges (disposal) of polluting substances into the surrounding natural environment has been introduced. A city off-budget ecology fund has been organized. Together with budget appropriations, resources of the ecological fund were expended on city environmental protection measures that were approved by the city ecological soviet and the permanent commission on questions of ecology and the protection of the health of the population; a radiological survey and a decontamination of polluted sectors were conducted; work was continued on improving the sanitary conditions of Lake Kaban and other reservoirs of the city; work is being done on the development of a comprehensive territorial environmental protection plan (TerKSOP) of the city of Kazan and the surrounding Kazan region, a plant TER [not further identified] has been developed on the utilization of everyday and industrial wastes, and work is being concluded on the construction of a unit to remove mercury from mercury lamps, etc. A long-range program to increase the ecological reliability of waterline-sewer networks and structures and of engineering structures for the protection of the city has been developed and approved, and a program for the ecological improvement of the storm water drainage system is in the developmental stage. All of this, together with the drop in the volume of production, made it possible in just the last year to reduce the discharges of harmful substances into the atmosphere by 12 percent, and into open reservoirs--by 15 percent.
