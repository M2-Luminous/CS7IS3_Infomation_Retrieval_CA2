The shares the 11 firms put in circulation will have a total face value of 169.85 million yuan ($19.523 million). Seven of the new companies are from Shanghai. They are: Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliance, Shanghai Jielong Industry, Shanghai Lingqiao Water Plant, Shanghai Commercial Real Estate Development, Shanghai Oriental Pearl, Shanghai No. 9 Department Store, and Shanghai SAIC [expansion unknown] Multiple Trading. The other four are Huanghe Machinery and Electrical from Xian, Shaanxi Province; the Chengdu People's Shopping Centre from Sichuan; the Harbin Tianer Industry from Heilongjiang; and Ningbo Chenghuangmiao from Zhejiang. Officials expect the value of new shares listed on the exchange in the first quarter of this year to be 1.48 billion yuan ($170.1 million). Meanwhile, the exchange has approved membership of four securities companies to its clearing system to make it more efficient. They are the Hunan and Dalian securities trading centres and the Guangdong Maoming and Gansu securities registering companies. So far, the clearing system has developed 103 member companies, 51 of which are Chinese. Meanwhile, Shenzhen Securities Exchange has decided to suspend the listing of new firms to reverse the bearish trend in the stock market. Many investors and analysts believe the problem is caused by the continued listing of new shares, which absorbs large amounts of capital, which causes share prices to slip. In another development, five securities companies from the provinces of Hubei, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Sichuan have recently gained membership of the Shenzhen Securities Exchange.
