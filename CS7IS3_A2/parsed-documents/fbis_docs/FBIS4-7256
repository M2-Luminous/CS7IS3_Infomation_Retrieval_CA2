FBIS4-7256 "dreas082_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 South Korea DP Urges Prosecution To Probe Sangmudae Scandal DP Urges Prosecution To Probe Sangmudae Scandal SK1904083294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0725 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK1904083294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) demanded Tuesday that the prosecution trace the whereabouts of a slush fund allegedly funnelled into the political arena by a contractor. The DP pressed its demand by presenting the financial records of Cho Ki-hyon, president of Chungwoo Construction Co., to the National Assembly. The DP's action came Tuesday afternoon as the Legislation and Judiciary Committee was forming a subcommittee to work out a schedule for parliamentary investigation of the "Sangmudae scandal." The opposition party's maneuver is expected to become a red-hot political issue pitting the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) against the DP as the ruling party maintains that tracing the money runs counter to the real-name financial system. A DP special committee probing the Sangmudae affair, chaired by Rep. Chong Tae-chol, told a press conference that spending records are listed in a suit against Cho, who has been indicted on charges of embezzlement. Calling it "a list of criminal activities," the committee presented a copy of the document to the National Assembly. It showed Cho had an alleged slush fund amounting to 22.7 billion won, with 18.9 billion won having been spent between November 1991 and December 1992. In addition, the DP said that Cho used 3.8 billion won for "business expenses" which, it claimed, could very well have been lobbying outlays for his company. Cho's Chungwoo Construction Co., along with Hyundai Construction Co., received a multi-billion-won order to relocate military facilities called "Sangmudae" from Kwangju city to its outskirts. The DP alleges that Cho created a slush fund out of money he received from the defense ministry and diverted a large part of it to the ruling camp during the 1992 presidential campaign. At Tuesday's press conference, the opposition party charged the prosecution with trying to cover up or minimize the scandal by not tracing the whereabouts of money spent by Cho. "If the prosecution has any intention to find out where checks issued from the slush fund have gone, there is no need for the National Assembly to undertake a parliamentary investigation," one committee member said. The DP has been under pressure from the ruling party to produce material evidence to substantiate its charges. Tuesday's presentation of a copy of Cho's financial transactions, therefore, was seen as the DP's answer to the DLP demand. If the prosecution refused to trace the checks, the opposition party could claim that the probe into Cho's slush fund had failed because of the uncooperative attitude of the DLP and the government.
