FR941207-0-00086 FR941207-0-00015 (b) petitions to dispense with formal hearings under §251.41 (b); and (c) objections to arbitrators under §251.4; 2. a date for the filing of direct cases by parties; 3. dates for discovery by the parties and for filing of discovery and evidentiary motions; 4. a date by which the Librarian will rule on discovery and evidentiary motions; and 5. a future date certain on which each identified controversy will be declared and the initiation of an arbitration proceeding will be published. Id . at 9. Copyright Owners recommend that ``scheduling should be done on a case-by-case basis reflecting the comments from the parties; the rules themselves should not contain particular time periods for filing deadlines.'' Id . Copyright Owners argue that statutory authority for the above-recommended procedures can be found in section 801(c) of the Copyright Act, which permits the Librarian ``before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel is convened, [to] make any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would apply to the proceedings conducted by such panel.'' Id. at 10. This provision, they argue, coupled with Chairman Hughes' expressed desire for precontroversy discovery, indicates the legislative intent to have a formal and organized precontroversy discovery period. Aside from satisfying legislative intent, Copyright Owners submit that their proposed plan offers advantages. Setting a date certain for declaration of controversies and commencement of arbitration in the scheduling order will give potential arbitrators sufficient advance notice to plan their schedules, thereby increasing the likelihood of their being able to serve. Id . at 11. Also, having the Librarian rule on prehearing discovery and other motions allows the parties to prepare their cases properly and permits the full 180-day period to be devoted to hearing, briefing, and decision on the merits. Id . at 12. We have carefully considered the views of the Copyright Owners with respect to precontroversy discovery, especially in light of their request that the CARPs conduct precontroversy discovery and our earlier proposal set forth in the NPRM. For reasons stated in the Interim Regulations, see 59 FR 23977, we do not believe that it is statutorily permissible to convene a CARP prior to the beginning of the 180-day arbitration period for the purposes of conducting precontroversy discovery. We reaffirm our decision that the CARPs cannot conduct or permit discovery prior to the beginning of the 180-day arbitration period. After considering the proposal of the Copyright Owners, however, we do think that it is appropriate that the Librarian of Congress and the Copyright Office conduct some precontroversy discovery. We are therefore adopting a precontroversy discovery procedure similar to that now being endorsed by the Copyright Owners and initially proposed in the NPRM. We therefore amend §251.45 of the rules to provide a procedure for conducting precontroversy discovery. New paragraph (b) directs the Librarian to designate a 45-day period for the conduct of precontroversy discovery. The Librarian shall designate the dates for the 45-day precontroversy discovery period on a case-by-case basis after receiving and reviewing comments on the existence of controversies and notices of intention to participate described in §251.45(a). During this time period, the parties will exchange their written direct cases and the Librarian will entertain motions and objections regarding discovery matters, motions and objections to dismiss any party's royalty claim, motions for declaratory rulings or for procedural or evidentiary rulings, petitions to dispense with formal hearings under §251.41(b), and objections to arbitrators under §251.4. As stated in the Interim Regulations, ``[w]e agree with the Copyright Owners that precontroversy discovery before the filing of written direct cases would not be productive.'' 59 FR 23977 (1994). The 45-day precontroversy discovery period therefore shall begin with an exchange of written direct cases among the parties to the proceeding. Each party must serve one complete copy of their written direct case on each of the parties to the proceeding no later than the first day of the 45-day period. At any time during the 45-day period, the parties may file their motions and objections with the Librarian. Objections to any and all motions will be due seven days after the filing date for motions. The 45-day designated period shall be the sole time for filing precontroversy motions and objections. Any motions and objections received prior to, or after, the 45-day period will be returned. The Librarian will rule on motions and objections after the 45-day period has ended and prior to the declaration of the existence of a controversy. However, motions for production of documents or to compel production of evidence should be ruled upon by the Librarian within five days of receipt of the motion so as to expedite the discovery process. In addition to the exchange of direct cases and the filing of motions and objections, the Librarian will set the date on which controversies will be declared. We agree with Copyright Owners that fixing a date certain for declaration of controversies and initiation of arbitration proceedings will allow potential arbitrators and participating parties to clear their schedules, as well as afford the participating parties more time to prepare their cases.
