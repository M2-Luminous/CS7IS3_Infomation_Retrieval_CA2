Hata, who is widely expected to be picked as a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, told reporters that the SDP should make a decision in order to maintain the coalition government. The SDP has threatened to secede from the coalition because of differences with other parties on tax reform and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected nuclear development program. Hata said some SDP members are making endeavors to keep the coalition together. He said the ruling parties should debate policies thoroughly, noting that such discussions would later help the new government. The coalition has failed to pick a successor to Hosokawa for nearly two weeks since Hosokawa announced his resignation on April 8.
