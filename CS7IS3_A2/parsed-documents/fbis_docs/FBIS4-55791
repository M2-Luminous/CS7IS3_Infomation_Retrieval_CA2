Here is Marrash Mirashi. [Mirashi] [passage omitted] The primary former heads of the communist nomenklatura were again gathered together, but this time not to give directives but to render account to Albanian justice. [passage omitted] After presenting the defendants and their counsels, they were asked whether they agreed with the judicial body or not. Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci and his client, defendant Ramiz Alia, did not agree with the judicial body, claiming that it is not of high stature and lacks experience. This was followed by other defendants and their counsels. Koci asked that the trial be suspended for defendant Alia. Their respective defense attorneys asked that the trial of defendants Zylyftar Ramizi and Veiz Haderi be set apart from the rest of the group, because they had been soldiers and cannot be judged by a civil court. They also asked for new witnesses. Defendant Alia requested that television broadcast the trial in full, saying: I have been head of state and the people should know what I have to say. In response, the chairman of the judicial body stressed that the media is free. The prosecutor was asked to change the security measures for defendant Simon Stefani. Later, the presentation of witnesses was held. There was a great number of witnesses, among whom were old state and party apparatus workers, dependents or colleagues of the defendants, but also people harmed by the activity of the defendants in this trial. The judicial body withdrew to make decisions on the demands put forward. Mr. Celiku, chairman of the judicial body, then took the floor. He found the aforementioned demands not based on law and rejected them. Prosecutor Neshat Thana read out an approximately 60-page indictment. Defendants Ramiz Alia, Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, and Rita Marko are facing charges of conspiring to misappropriate state property for a total amount of 2,883,502 leks and of the abuse of power, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental rights of citizens and financial damages amounting to 484,778 leks. Defendants Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai were charged with conspiring to abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental rights of citizens to the detriment of the lives of several persons, murders committed at the border, and violation of the equality of citizens through the creation of privileges. Aranit Cela and Rrapi Mino are charged with conspiring to abuse their positions, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental rights of citizens. Zylyftar Ramizi is charged with conspiring to abuse his position, resulting in the illegal violation of the fundamental rights of citizens to the detriment of people's lives. Veiz Haderi is charged with conspiring to abuse his position, resulting in humiliating acts against citizens detained or killed at the border. The indictment contained concrete examples of genocide, violence, and abuse. After the indictment was read, the chairman of the judicial body took the floor: [Begin recording] [Celiku] Did you hear the indictment? Did you understand it? What is your position on it? Do you accept it or not? [end recording] [Alia] The indictment? I do not accept it. [end recording] Just like the defendant Ramiz Alia, none of the other defendants or their counsels accepted the indictment. At the end of today's trial hearing, the order in which the defendants would be questioned was decided. The chairman of the judicial body then closed the hearing. The next session will begin at 0900 tomorrow morning with the interrogation of the defendants.
