This was stated at a news conference held yesterday by Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor of the republic for economic policy. V. Akhundov termed the present increase in the price of bread and energy extremely necessary. According to him, this will make it possible not only to reduce their intensive exportation from the republic--that had been stimulated by the unjustifiably low prices of these products--but also to evoke a more solicitous attitude toward them. In addition, the increase in the price of bread will make it possible to reduce government subsidies by almost one-third and also to eliminate the strain that has occurred recently in the provision of the society with bread products. The increase in the cost of oil, on the other hand, on which the oil workers have long been insisting, will permit a recovery of the financial state of the oil-producing sector, which is the basis of the economy of the whole country and the main source of its currency receipts. As the state counselor announced, the funds derived from the price increase will be spent on sums of compensation for the needy strata of the populace, which are already being paid. Answering journalists' questions, he observed that the measures specified by the presidential edict pertaining, specifically, to a tightening in the republic of credit policy would make it possible to avoid another spurt in inflation, which usually accompanies a price hike. The current turmoil here, expressed in the uncontrolled issue of credit unsupported by real monetary resources, had become a factor of the growth of inflation, a deterioration in the financial state of the country, and a steep decline in the living standard of society. As V. Akhundov reported, as of the present time the republic's banks have issued 20-30 million manat over and above available resources. The cancellation of interbranch turnover (MFO) and the introduction of a system of correspondent accounts signifying control of credit resources on the part of the National Bank will make it possible to eliminate this negative phenomenon. According to the state counselor, this was the main condition set for Azerbaijan by the IMF, the World Bank, and other international financial organizations. The recuperation of finances will be aided also by a tightening of control of the repayment of loans, an end to the funding of facilities of incomplete construction, except for those nearing completion, and the sale of some of these facilities to private investors. As V. Akhundov maintained, the precise fulfillment of these and other measures specified by the edict will have made it possible by the end of the year to have considerably reduced inflation, whose level currently constitutes 30 percent a month.
