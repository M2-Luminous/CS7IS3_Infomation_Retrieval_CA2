Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto was not yet able today to estimate when Finland will decide its stance to Partnership for Peace. [Begin recording] [Haavisto] The Partnership for Peace idea is in itself a positive solution. It strengthens security in Europe, and in that sense it is in line with Finland's basic aims. In fact, Finland does not at present have a need for greater security and we do not need such a treaty in itself. However, it contains certain aspects, such as peacekeeping cooperation in which Finland would be a considerable contributing partner for the rest of Europe. The government will adopt a stance on this in due course. We will hear a more detailed report this afternoon on what timetable to follow when the decision is made on this matter, and this week the government's foreign affairs committee will discuss this situation for the first time. I cannot say when Finland's final decision will come. It requires very thorough familiarization and deliberation. Regarding Vaeyrynen's stance, he is no doubt right in that we do not need such a treaty, but the government will nevertheless have to consider the matter as a whole from all aspects. [Kervinen] Vaeyrynen is taking quite a critical view, perhaps because of these drawbacks. He says that there might be drawbacks from it for our neutrality. [Haavisto] It is my view that this does not affect the neutrality one way or the other. This does not mean entering any military alliance, but this is only a treaty on cooperation in various matters and as it has been offered to all CSCE countries, including Russia, I feel that this does not yet have anything to do with neutrality, nor would this treaty endanger Finland's neutrality. It is then a different matter whether the treaty in general is a sensible thing for us, because we have invested more in the possibility that as member of the European Union, we would develop European security structures.
