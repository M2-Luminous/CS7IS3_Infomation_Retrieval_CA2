The film is about sisters who volunteer to be shoe menders following their father and devote their youth to the worthy work in the spirit of selfless service for the people. The film shows an aspect of Korean society where all occupations are equally honorable. The leading characters of the film are modeled on Choe Kum-hwa and her younger sisters who work at the Welfare Service Cooperative in Kwangbok Street, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang, enjoying respect from all people. When they finished the course of senior middle school with great ambitions, they were recommended for university entrance examinations, but they volunteered for the job of shoe mending in order to become true servants of the people. In the DPRK, there are many persons who work with pure conscience, paying no heed to the rank of job. At the Pyongchon District City Management Office in Pyongyang, Choe Chang-ae and 20 other girls work as road cleaners. Graduating from senior middle school seven years ago, they volunteered for this job. They have since cleaned roads of the capital city, drawing affectionate attention of the passers-by. The family of Choe Tae-hwa of the Sinuiju Heating Station is called a family of town management workers. There are many people who sincerely work for society and the people for scores of years, not changing their posts, for example, Choe Kyong-hwa of the Kanggye Railway Corps and his two sons; Yi Son-ku, a heated floor repairer of the Kyongsong County building repair station in North Hamgyong Province; Cho Chung-un, a heat service worker of the farm attached to the university of the national economy; and Yang Pun-yo, a barber of the Pyongchon Welfare Service Office in Pyongyang. Their patriotic devotion is based on the deep loving care and favours shown by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who always puts the interests of the people above all in shaping policies. Comrade Kim Chong-il takes care that such persons participate in national conferences and state functions, and shows deep trust and loving care for them, saying that those who devotedly work on different jobs of society as faithful servants of the people contribute to the fuller display of beautiful relations among people across the country. Amid his trust and loving care, a road cleaning girl becomes a winner of "Kim Il-song Youth Honour Prize," the highest honour to a Korean youth, and ordinary workers enjoy affection and respect from all people as merited mender, merited barber and merited hairdresser.
