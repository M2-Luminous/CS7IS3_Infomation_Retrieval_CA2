Because the beauty in Pushkin's famous fairy tale had never had "ecological literacy" training. Incidentally, that subject, one pertaining to environmental protection, may soon be studied by Russia's school children and vocational students. Adults keep on polluting the environment as if they had no children, and as if they themselves would live forever. Clearly the next generation will have to save itself. And adults are already prepared to give it that chance. Recently a joint board meeting of two Russian ministries -- education and environmental protection -- approved a draft resolution on recruitment of school children in ecological studies. Our science correspondent discussed this new and extremely important undertaking with Professor Kirill Pavlovich Stayev, State Prize laureate, who helped prepare the resolution. Stayev: One of the main reasons for the thoughtless attitude toward nature is the lack of ecological culture in Russia. It needs to be taught in school, or else it will be too late. But ecology should not be a separate subject, but rather a leitmotiv for all disciplines, because the most important issue facing humanity today is the struggle for survival in a poisoned environment. Dmitruk: Why frighten school children with the "environmental ulcers" that have been uncovered virtually everywhere in Russia? If they learn of these things at a tender age they might be psychologically traumatized, and children's health has been undermined by environmental pollution as it is. Stayev: The mass media are no longer concealing the scale of environmental disaster in Russia -- and children are aware of it, too. But in the hunt for sensational material many journalists like to spend their time uncovering environmental crimes and talk very little about how to deal with their consequences. Most often children are psychologically traumatized because they do not know how they are going to survive in a poisoned environment. By teaching them that, we eliminate both destructive factors, both the psychological and the physical. Dmitruk: Is that really possible in today's Russia? Stayev: It is becoming possible. By a joint decision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and the Ministry of Education, ecology lessons are being introduced in secondary schools and vocational schools. These lessons are to be taught by instructors in biology, physics, chemistry and other subjects. Through practical exercises the children will learn about hazards to the environment so they will be aware of how to subsequently clean up various pollutants. Dmitruk: But should that not be done by the adults who work for Ministry of Environmental Protection agencies and the public health service? Stayev: Even school children know how well they are coping with their jobs. Those agencies are chronically short of people and money. Therefore even Russia's "environmental ulcers" -- places like Norilsk, Chelyabinsk, Plesetsk and many other "environmental disaster areas" -- have not been thoroughly studied, much less cleaned up. But things that underpowered organizations are not capable of doing can be accomplished by millions of Russian school children and vocational school students. Dmitruk: That tremendous force can be utilized free of charge under the banner of struggle for survival. But lots of money will be needed for instruments, reagents and cleaning agents for laboratory studies. Where will that money come from? Stayev: By decision of the two ministries it has been recommended that regional environmental organs and ecological funds allocate up to five percent of their total annual funding to support environmental education. Dmitruk: Excuse me, but in Russia not even laws are always complied with, so mere recommendations from two impoverished ministries can simple be ignored if it is not advantageous to comply. What advantages can there be from environmental education? Stayev: Very major ones, because environmental protection organs' funding is derived mainly from fines imposed on enterprises that pollute the environment. The more polluters the kids expose, the more fines professional defenders of nature will collect. The benefit will probably be several times greater than the five percent of funding that we recommend be allocated for environmental education. Dmitruk: But if this idea takes off, the mafia structures that are now pocketing the money allocated by the state for environmental protection are not likely to be too happy about it. And might not the heads of enterprises that are violating environmental protection law, to put it mildly, drop students a "hint" that they should stop any studies that might bring on scandals and fines? Stayev: Today there is nothing more important for the next generation than environmental protection. If young people do not protect the environment, soon irreversible processes in the biosphere capable of destroying every living thing could begin. There can be no compromise on this point: either we die out, or we save nature and ourselves. We cannot sit idly by while every living thing dies. It is not possible to halt this extinction without heroism and self-sacrifice, and we must prepare young people for that. Right now they are being taught to take really pointless risks. For example, Western movies are cultivating extreme individualism, depravity and cruelty -- that is about how to kill, not save. A majority of children and teenagers get no other training: the Pioneer organization is gone for good, and the Boy Scout movement is in its infancy. Kids cannot find a larger positive cause to unite them. The struggle to save their Fatherland from ecological disaster could be that cause. That struggle would fill teenagers' lives with profound meaning, a spirit of collectivism and noble romanticism. Dmitruk: It is not likely that pretty words will inspire today's teenagers to undertake selfless labor, even for the sake of saving everyone, because in recent years they have been taught to seek instant material gratification in all things. Stayev: And that is what we are offering kids. Through ecology lessons they would find out about the extent of pollution and method of decontaminating the food products they buy in stores with their parents, buy at markets or grow in their own garden plots. They would test sites to determine soil acidity, water hardness and background radiation, and then bring them down to normal levels. The knowledge and skills learned by students could be passed on to their parents and to their grandparents. The older generation should have a keen interest in their kids getting environmental training. I am referring not only to parents, but also to the heads of enterprises. A majority of enterprises are going to be privatized, and a good manager is always interested in the health of his employees. Dmitruk: In the West it has long been calculated like this: one dollar invested in environmental protection yields an eightfold profit. Stayev: Yes, and therefore it will be very much to an enterprise manager's benefit to hire graduates who have environmental training: they will look out for their health and for the environment. Even now owners of enterprises should be interested in environmental training at the schools and vocational schools from which they get new personnel. A farsighted manager could sponsor that effort, with benefit for himself as well. Enterprises used to become patrons of local educational institutions on orders from above. But prudent enterprise owners will voluntarily be patrons of economic [sic] education in general schools and vocational schools that will in the future yield for them greater savings in fines paid to environmental protection agencies and in sick days for their employees.
