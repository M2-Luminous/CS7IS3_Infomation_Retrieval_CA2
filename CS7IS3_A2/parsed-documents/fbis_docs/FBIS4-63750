In his opinion, politically, Belarus was ready to join this project, and had informed the NATO leadership. In an interview with INTERFAX, Belyayev said that the search for his republic's possible participation in NATO's program was very difficult, because Belarus had not yet reorganized its armed forces due to the deteriorating economic situation. Belarus must not hasten to join the Partnership for Peace program, because it was faced with many problems in conventional and strategic disarmament.
