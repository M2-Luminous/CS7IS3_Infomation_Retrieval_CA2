Motivated by the recent discovery of new superconducting materials A[.sub]x[/]C[.sub]60[/], we have theoretically explored new intercalation compounds based on _a_-B to find out a possibility of superconductivity. In this talk we investigate three kinds of boron intercalation compounds, and show the features of their electronic structures calculated by the first principle calculations. As the positions of intercalated sites, we consider 1) an octahedral site, 2) tetrahedral sites and 3) both ends of an interstitial chain along the body diagonal, which correspond to phosphorous positions of B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/] structure. Since there is not enough space to accommodate large atoms between icosahedra, we chose lithium (Li) atom as an intercalant, due to the smallest ionic radius of 0.68 A among all the alkali-metal atoms. In cases where Li's are intercalated into octahedral and tetrahedral sites, an energy band of Li character appears above the lowest conduction band of B character, and thus the Li 2s electrons are transferred into lower conduction bands with B character. As a result, the Fermi level crosses the lowest conduction band in the former and the two lower conduction bands in the latter, respectively. In the cases where Li's are intercalated into interstitial sites, the charge density calculations show that Li-B hybridized bands newly appear in the higher valence band region of B. As a result, the Fermi level crosses two higher valence bands, and hole-like carriers appear in this case. We call this intercalation compound ``acceptor-type metal.'' The present results show that both donor-type and acceptor-type metallic materials call be obtained by intercalating the same species of intercalant atoms. In this respect ``boron'' is different from C[.sub]60[/] fullerides and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). By calculating the total energies of these compounds, we show that the compound of octahedral intercalation sites, B[.sub]12[/]Li(O), has the lowest energy. Thus this donor-type compound is expected to appear as the first step of intercalation. In order to investigate a possibility of superconductivity especially in the case where Li's are intercalated into octahedral sites, we have calculated the density of states for this compound. Its value at the Fermi energy is 0.26/eV x atom, which is very close to that of K[.sub]3[/]C[.sub]60[/] calculated by Saito and Oshiyama.[.sup]1[/] References 1. S. Saito and A. Oshiyama, PHYS.
