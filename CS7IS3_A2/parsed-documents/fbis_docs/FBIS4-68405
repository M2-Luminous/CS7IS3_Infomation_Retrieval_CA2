FBIS4-68405 "jpusr048___94003" FBIS-USR-94-048 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 26 April 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Vice Premier Details Situation at Armenian AES Vice Premier Details Situation at Armenian AES 944K1125C Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in Russian 26 Apr 94 p 1 944K1125C Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA Russian CSO [Report on statements by Armenian Vice Premier Vigen Chitechyan by Mariam Ogandzhanyan: "The AES Is Beginning Operation, But Don't Expect It to Get Brighter"] [Text] As already reported, journalists were given the opportunity to visit the Armenian AES [atomic power station] on 22 April. Gagik Markosyan, the AES' chief engineer, personally accompanied them on a trip around the station. Journalists were shown a mockup of the station in the technical office and provided with detailed explanations of the basic principles in its operation. It is known that the first of the AAES' [Armenian Atomic Power Station's] two units were put into operation in 1976, and the second one was commissioned 4 years later. Both reactors are first-generation water-cooled power reactors, although unlike the standard units, they were designed by taking into account the region's seismicity. After the station is started, it is expected that 400 megawatts will be generated daily. But for the present, the station represents an additional load on the energy system by consuming 2.5 megawatts per day. Inasmuch as the second unit is in better condition and its restoration requires less efforts, it will be renovated first. After an inspection of the station, a press conference was held, at which Armenian Vice Premier Vigen Chitechyan drew the journalists' attention to a report on the current status of the AES, as well as problems associated with the renovation process. The necessary explanations were provided by Mr. Avagyan, chief of the Armatomenergo Administration; A. Margirosyan, chief engineer of the AAES; and F. Arakelyan, director of the Armatomenergoprom Planning Institute. As Mr. Chitechyan pointed out, the status of the AAES changed after the collapse of the USSR. In this connection, independent Armenia had to conclude a number of agreements with international organizations and sign international conventions on the use of atomic energy. The question of Armenia's membership in the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] was resolved successfully, and an intergovernmental agreement was signed with Russia on supplies, including nuclear fuel. The next step was establishment of the necessary infrastructure . An operating organ was formed--the Armatomenergo Administration, as well as a monitoring organ, the Armatomkontrol Administration. The regulations of the AES were revised and reapproved in conformity with international standards, and it was given the status of a special-purpose state enterprise. The concept was worked out and approved by the government, and a coordination plan was drafted on this basis. The working plans for each system and each unit subject to renovation were worked out in conformity with this plan. As Mr. Chitechyan noted, we can speak about completion of the preparatory stage today. The station's most important assemblies have already begun to be repaired in most sections. It is expected that the planned level of safety will be provided for by the end of this year. As far as additional steps to increase the station's safety are concerned, they require that additional sources of financing be found. On the whole, roughly $70 million are needed for the AES to resume operations. In this connection, there is a decision to establish a public fund under the Ministry of Energy to mobilize all the reserves and coordinate all the funds to put the AES in operation as soon as possible. For the present, the available funds are enough for a month of work. Mr. Chitechyan noted in particular that the most favorable conditions possible had been created for the station's personnel. The wages of employees engaged in the process of resuming operations add up to roughly 20 established minimum wages (25 percent more than the president receives). Three houses which are being built will be provided initially for the specialists that have been invited, and after their departure they will be used to improve housing conditions for the AES employees. Responding to journalists' questions, Mr. Chitechyan stated that the fuel needed for the station's operation is being obtained exclusively in Russia at present, although he added that there is a continuous search for alternate sources. It was explained that the seismic stability of the station after its renovation will correspond roughly to 8 or 9 points on the scale. The operational service life of both units existing at the station is 19 years. Mr. Chitechyan did not mention the periods for starting [one or two words illegible] and renovation of the first unit. They will become known only when the preliminary repair operations are concluded. However, even after the station is started, the people evidently will not observe any particular brightening in their everyday life. As the Armenian vice premier pointed out, the electric power being generated will be directed where its cost will be recovered the quickest. Only when a certain amount of profit is obtained will we able to think about lighting the streets and houses. Well, we are not accustomed to it anyway. In conclusion, Mr. Chitechyan noted the special role of the press in shaping public opinion and he called upon the mass media for cooperation.
