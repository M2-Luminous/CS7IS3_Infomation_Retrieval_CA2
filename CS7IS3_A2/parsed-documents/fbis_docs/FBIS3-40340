A magnesium-lithium superlight alloy developed at the Hannover University is half as heavy as aluminum. The alloy consists of 60% atom. Mg and 40% atom. Li. Its density is only 1.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/], making it weigh six times less than steel and half as much as aluminum. The credentials of this new material from Hannover demonstrate that the scientists of the Hannover research team have, with their novel binary alloying technique, come a whole lot closer to realizing the dream of superlight materials. Researchers have for decades been fascinated by the challenge to produce superlight materials with a lower than 1.5 g/cm[.sup]3[/] density by alloying with the lightest metallic element, which is lithium. Magnesium alloys are an interesting possibility as such a partnership, their density being 40% lower than that of aluminum-based materials. Such binary materials have encouraging properties: not only a much lower density than that of conventional magnesium alloys but also a better formability. Their advantages are, however, unfortunately attended by serious drawbacks: very low mechanical strength and very low corrosion resistance. "Alongside the basic concept of an integrated material development is also considered the industrial aspect of subsequent material production, i.e., evaluation of industrially feasible alloy making processes and testing techniques", so does Prof. Dr.-Eng. Heinz Haferkampf describe the scope of work done by the Hannover research team as sponsored by the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft = German Research Association). Powder metallurgy and nondestructive testing methods are accordingly being refined for adaptation to the specific properties of that new group of alloys. Unfortunately, the new material behaves like a moody primadonna. It poses serious problems in the magnesium and lithium mixing stage, inasmuch as both metals are chemically very active even in a normal atmosphere. A protective gas such as argon shielding the material from air must, therefore, be provided throughout the alloy making process. Magnesium with its hexagonal basic crystal lattice is, moreover, by nature brittle. Increasing the lithium content influences the crystal structure in a way which improves its formability. Because of the high lithium diffusion rate, on the other hand, segregation takes place and the material becomes nonhomogeneous. Even after successful casting there still remain unrelenting difficulties. Unlike aluminum-based materials, which form a continuous oxide surface film protecting them against further corrosion, magnesium-lithium alloys form steadily growing chappy chemically active layers. A high lithium content in the alloy and humid environment accelerate the loss of material. Material researchers limit the mobility of lithium by adding elements which appropriately inhibit the diffusion of lithium, for instance by binding lithium into compounds. Addition of hydrogen to the melt has proved to be very promising. A material with much better properties is, however, obtained by adding slight amounts of aluminum and zinc. This will unfortunately result in accelerated coarsening of the structure during heating and thus will not ensure the mandatory long-term stability required of engineering materials. Experimentation with additives such as silicon, cadmium, and zirconium seems to have revealed a way out of this dilemma. "Already slight amounts of silicon make the material more corrosion-resistant and thus reduce the loss of material to half the loss of conventional structural steel due to corrosion" Professor Haferkampf states joyfully. "For goal-oriented modifications of the alloy composition there are available metallurgical techniques which will ensure a low contamination level during treatment of highly chemical reaction prone alloy melts and thus ensure reproducibility of alloy making and treatment procedures." The alloy making process involves homogenization of the melt by stirring and its subsequent casting into steel molds. Attendant conversion and heat treatment are designed to improve the mechanical properties and to increase the corrosion resistance. A homogeneous melt can then be "frozen in" by rapid cooling. Material combinations can thus be obtained which are not obtainable by conventional casting methods. The melt is subsequently atomized into small droplets by injection of a high-energy gas jet. The finished material is a fine metal powder consisting of globular particles. The diameter of globules produced in a fully automatic spray-nozzle apparatus ranges from 0.02 mm to 0.25 mm, depending on the process conditions. This powder is then, by heat and pressure, converted into a compact material. Use of superlight cast Mg-Li alloys has been first demonstrated on a 10 mm thick and 300 mm in diameter light lamination (weighing only 0.7 kg) of a rotary neutron selector. It withstood speeds higher than the minimum required 20,000 rpm. Such rotors make it possible to select specific radiation propagation velocities for analysis of magnetic materials, electronic components, and plastics. Professor Haferkampf is satisfied: "Excellent machinability and high neutron absorption capacity, among lithium's relevant properties, enable this new kind of alloy to reach a very promising application potential in competition with fiber-reinforced plastic materials currently in use."
