The two countries, which will celebrate 30 tears of the restoration of diplomatic ties next year, will inaugurate the "Korea-Japan New Initiative for Economic Partnership (NIEP)" in April with its first meeting slated in Seoul. The establishment of NIEP was agreed upon in last November's summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Kyongju. Officials of the two countries have since had a series of working meetings to discuss how it will be set up, what it will be called and what it is supposed to do. "Although there have been some differences as to the function and title, we faced little difficulties in realizing the establishment of the NIEP," said a Korean official at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] who was involved in the project. As shown in the title of the organization, the NIEP is expected to lay a solid groundwork for bilateral economic cooperation, looking beyond the present and reaching out to the 21st century, Korean officials say. "Basically, Seoul and Tokyo will be able to discuss everything within the framework of the NIEP, from the bilateral trade imbalance to economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region," an EPB official said. The NIEP appears similar to the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), economic cooperation talks between Seoul and Washington, which the new administrations of Korea and the United States launched last year. But the NIEP differs from the DEC in that the latter is supposed to be disbanded after a certain period while the former will be in operation over a longer period. Officials say both the NIEP and DEC were designed to address bilateral economic issues but the former will be more comprehensive than the latter. In the NIEP, Korea and Japan will tap assistant foreign ministers as their respective chief delegate with 10-odd officials of various ministries representing each country. Two rounds of meetings will be held in Seoul and Tokyo this year but from next year, the two countries will hold meetings once a year in principle. What will be discussed in the meetings will be reported to President Kim and Prime Minister Hosokawa.
