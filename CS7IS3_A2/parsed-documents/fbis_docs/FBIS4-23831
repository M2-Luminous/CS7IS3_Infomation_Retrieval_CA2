Abiola wanted in connection with some alleged treasonable activities. A few hours ago, Mohamed Okoija took up the deputy inspector general of police, Nuhu Aliyu, on the progress in the police search for Chief Abiola. [Begin recording] [Aliyu] Yesterday, we carried out some searches of some areas where we suspected he could be found but he wasn't there. [Okoija] Now, in the news today, one of his wives, [name indistinct], says Chief Abiola is ill and will report to the police when he is well. Has this got to you officially? [Aliyu, hesitating] To the police that he is....[pauses] Yes, it got to us officially, and [words indistinct]. [Okoija] Well, Chief Abiola's camp continues to affirm that he proclaimed himself as president, and there were pictures in the papers on Tuesday [14 June] which purported that to be so. What is the police reaction to this one now? [Aliyu] Our reaction is that that was one of the gimmicks, of photoplay. We don't believe there was anything like that. [Okoija] Okay. Now, a former senator who is an aide to Chief Abiola says that.... [Aliyu, interrupting] Pardon? [Okoija] A former senator who is an aide to Chief Abiola says Chief Abiola will address his supporters anytime from now, and that they have their own strategy. [Aliyu] As soon as we find Abiola, we will pick him up. Anywhere, anywhere he shows up, we will pick him up. Anywhere we see him. After all, he is a wanted person. [Okoija] Now, what about this threat of chaos in the western part of the country? How prepared is the police, knowing that the western part of the country is a hotbed of political riot? [Aliyu] As you can see, we have got ourselves well prepared. Not only have we mobilized the police within the area in question, but we have brought in other policemen, mobile police forces from other parts of the country, to beef up security in this area.

The national secretary of the National Democratic Coalition, which backs Abiola's claim to power, said Abiola will `definitely (come out of hiding) this week.' `It will be a public event, at which the press, including the international media, will be in attendance,' the secretary, Ayo Opadokun, said as the junta took steps to beef up security in the southwestern regions where the Yoruba businessman draws much of his support."]
