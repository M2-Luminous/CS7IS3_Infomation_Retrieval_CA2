We would like to renew our congratulations to him on his assumption of this noble responsibility. We wish him every success and all progress in the interest of the brotherly Algerian people. We are sure that his competence, virtues, and belief in Maghreban unity will strongly contribute toward giving more impetus to the march of our union. I am also pleased to welcome brother militant Yasir 'Arafat, the president of the state of Palestine. Through him, we send humble greetings to the brotherly Palestinian people, and renew our support and backing for their heroic struggle for the recovery of their legitimate rights.

As a result, the endeavors of the AMU have continued uninterrupted on the path for finding a peaceful, just, and honorable solution to the conflict existing between the sisterly Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and certain Western states. Maghreban efforts have concentrated on a persistent search for a political solution to this crisis within the framework of respecting international legality and the protection of the dignity and sovereignty of the Libyan people; we also warned against the repercussions of the its suffering as a result of the continuous sanctions, in addition to the negative outcome of this ongoing crisis. The Maghreban efforts have been joined to those of the Arab family regarding this issue within the seven-man committee; the moves were coordinated on all international levels, mainly at the African and Islamic levels, the Nonaligned Movement, and the United Nations. It is only natural that the AMU should continue its contribution to all endeavors, on all international platforms, to help find a solution to this crisis and reach a just and honorable political solution.
