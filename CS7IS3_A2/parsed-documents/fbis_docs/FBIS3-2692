Li, who is attending the ongoing session of the National People's Congress (NPC) here as a deputy, said that a draft of the law, which has been submitted to the NPC Law Committee for revision, is expected to be submitted again to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation in April. Li, who is also an economics professor of Beijing University, said that, despite repeated changes, the soon-to-be-enacted law will always contain three principles: A tying of rights and interests with shares, unified management of the securities market, and opposition to such practices as illegal trading, inside trading and procurement of shares through the abuse of power. This, he said, is to ensure open and fair operation of the securities market. The Securities Law will have at least two "Chinese characteristics," Li said, although, for the most part, it will be compatible with internationally accepted practices. The first characteristic will be that companies to issue shares will be subject to approval by competent authorities as well as to commonly-accepted practices. The second will be a clear division between A-shares and B- shares. "the securities authorities will formulate special regulations on B-shares," Li Yining said. According to Li, such stipulations are necessary because China so far has a very small number of certified public accountants for auditing. Also, the inconvertibility of the Chinese yuan makes it impossible for the two types of shares to merge, he noted. "As China's economy grows and the Chinese currency becomes convertible with the passage of time, a revision of the law is possible after its enactment," he said. The ultimate goal is to make the new law compatible with internationally accepted practices and enable the Chinese securities market to adapt to the global securities market," he said.
