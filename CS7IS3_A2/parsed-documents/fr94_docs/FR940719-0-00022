FR940719-0-00022 FR940719-0-00006 Since Schedule II controlled substances have the highest potential for abuse, extra care and diligence must be employed with these substances. The diversity in the comments received, both positive and negative, reflect the dichotomy between availability and adequate controls. Having studied the comments, DEA feels that the original proposal struck an appropriate balance for Schedule II prescriptions and provides the necessary controls while still allowing for the rapid delivery of the controlled substances. Three comments address the issue of what administration methods should be permitted for purposes of the proposed definition of ``home infusion pharmacy'' and of the proposed exception which allows a Schedule II facsimile to serve as the original written prescription pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.02(h) and 1306.11(e). One commentor suggests including intramuscular and oral dosage unit. A second commentor suggests allowing oral dosage unit dispensing in the same manner as Schedule III and IV prescriptions. The third commentor suggests oral dosage unit for terminally ill regardless of the care setting. Dispensing of oral dosage forms for the terminally ill has been previously addressed in 21 CFR 1306.13. However, intramuscular has been added to the final rule. DEA was advised by health care professionals that intramuscular administration is one form of administration utilized when repeated doses are required. Four comments addressed the issue of expanding the term prescriber to include a prescriber's ``agent'' for purposes of defining who is allowed to transmit a facsimile prescription under 21 CFR 1306.11(a). Two suggest using ``practitioner's agent'' instead. Two suggest including ``prescriber'' or ``agent''. DEA agrees with the commentors that the proposal unintentionally implied that every practitioner would have to personally fax the prescription. Therefore, the language has been amended to include the faxing by the practitioner's agent. One commentor suggests that due to fading of certain types of facsimile paper DEA should allow copying. DEA is concerned about the quality of the copy and its durability. It is the intent of this rule that if a facsimile copy is retained as the original record it must satisfy the same record-keeping requirements as an original paper record. The facsimile copy must be maintained as a complete and accurate record for the record-keeping time limit of two years pursuant to 21 CFR 1304.04(a). A facsimile which can fade and deteriorate before the record-keeping time limit is reached would not be acceptable as the original record. Two comments suggested that the phrase ``administer and dispense (but not prescribe)'' be changed by deleting the prohibition against prescribing by the institutional practitioner as proposed in §§1306.21(c) and 1306.31(c). The proposed regulations address the situations where an individual practitioner or his agent (as opposed to an institutional practitioner such as a hospital) transmits a written instrument, a facsimile or an oral order. Hence, it would be confusing to delete the phrase ``(but not prescribe)'' because it would indicate that the institutional practitioner had the authority to prescribe based upon a prescription already issued by an individual practitioner. The current regulations do address the general circumstances under which practitioners and exempted persons are allowed to dispense, administer or prescribe in 21 CFR 1301.24. A proposal will be drafted in the near future to amend §1301.24 which should clarify any current ambiguities in §§1306.21(c) and 1306.31(c). One comment was received concerning an inconsistency in the use of the phrases ``transmitted from'', ``transmitted directly by'', and ``transmitted by''. DEA realized that there was an inconsistency. In section 1306.11, as proposed, ``transmitted from'' and ``transmitted directly from'' were used and in §§1306.21 and 1306.31, as proposed, ``transmitted directly by'' was used. For clarity and consistency ``transmitted by'' will be used for the final rule. The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, hereby certifies that this rule will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
