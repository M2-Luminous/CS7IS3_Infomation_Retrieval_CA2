"The military's actions are and shall be at all times directed toward respecting the physical and moral integrity of the people" of the southern Mexican State of Chiapas, the Secretariat of National Defense announced in a communique released on Saturday. The charges of alleged human rights violations by the troops "are based solely on alleged rumors and sensationalism," which confuse the people, the communique read. The clashes in Altos de Chiapas, where the self-styled Zapatista National Liberation Army occupied several towns on 1 January, left 100 dead and an undetermined number of people wounded. Those who accuse the Army of violating human rights seem to forget that 24 policemen were killed and 35 were wounded, as well as more than 100 civilians reported missing at the hands of the armed group, the National Defense Secretariat stated. It also recalled that the armed group began the clashes when it attacked Rancho Nuevo Headquarters, near the town of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. The armed group occupied and destroyed public buildings and "used terror to subdue" the population, hid their dead, and "very probably buried them clandestinely." The Defense Secretariat reported that the Army turned over the individuals arrested during the conflict to civilian authorities and informed them of the deaths registered among the armed group. It mentioned that, within the imitations imposed by the conflict, the military authorities have provided their best help to the National Human Rights Commission, which traveled to Chiapas State at the beginning of the clashes. The Army's participation is fully justified, as they have responded to the attack against the garrison, the demands for help from the government of Chiapas State, and the reiterated aggressions on the troops, the secretariat added. There is a relative calm in that area of Chiapas State after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed last week former Foreign Minister Manuel Camacho Solis commissioner for peace and reconciliation and announced the cessation of the Army's offensive operations.
