FR940413-0-00004 FR940413-0-00001 Section 5801.103␣Prior Approval for Outside Employment 5 CFR 2635.803 authorizes individual agencies, by supplemental regulation, to require agency employees to obtain approval before engaging in outside employment or other outside activities. The NRC has long had the prior approval requirement, set forth in 10 CFR 0.735&hyph;40. Section 5801.103 of the final rule retains the requirement that NRC employees obtain prior written approval before engaging in outside employment with entities that are regulated by or have business with the Commission. The NRC policy has been, and will continue to be, to encourage teaching, lecturing, or writing not prohibited by 5 CFR part 2635 or other applicable law. The agency designees for approval of outside employment and internal agency procedures for obtaining the necessary approvals will be set forth in NRC Management Directive 7.8 and the accompanying Handbook. This Directive and Handbook will be issued on the effective date of this regulation and will be available in the NRC Public Document Room and in each NRC Office. III. Repeal of Superseded Portions of the NRC Conduct Regulations and Related Modifications The final rule repeals the NRC conduct regulations 10 CFR 0.735&hyph;8, 0.735&hyph;29, and 0.735&hyph;40, effective on the same day that this rule takes effect. The information collection requirements of §0.735&hyph;8 are no longer necessary. Section 0.735&hyph;29 will be superseded by the prohibitions on securities contained in 5 CFR 5801.102 and §0.735&hyph;40 will be superseded by the requirements for prior approval of outside employment contained in 5 CFR 5801.103. These repeals, together with those effected by 58 FR 3825 and 29951, leave in 10 CFR part 0 only the waiver provisions of §§735&hyph;21 (a) and (b) which are preserved by 5 CFR 2635.402(d)(1). These paragraphs are redesignated §0.735&hyph;2 (a) and (b) to follow a new §0.735&hyph;1 which provides a cross-reference to the NRC's supplemental regulation and to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure and standards of ethical conduct regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635. IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure Administrative Procedure Act Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b), the NRC finds good cause not to seek public comment on this rule. Such comment is unnecessary because the NRC is essentially repromulgating existing regulations in a different form, and the regulations pertain wholly to internal agency personnel matters that affect only NRC employees, their spouses, and minor children. To increase the likelihood of a smooth transition from the NRC's prior ethics rules to the new Government-wide standards of ethical conduct regulations, these rulemaking actions should take place as soon as possible. The rule and accompanying repeals will become effective 90 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register . Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusions 10 CFR 51.22(c) (1) and (2). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for this final regulation. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule contains no information collection requirements and therefore is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Regulatory Analysis The NRC is promulgating a supplemental regulation to OGE's Government-wide standards of conduct regulations in order to implement effectively the NRC's ethics program. This rule has no significant impact on health, safety or the environment. There is no substantial cost to licensees, the NRC, OGE, or other Federal agencies. Regulatory Flexibility Act As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects only NRC employees.
