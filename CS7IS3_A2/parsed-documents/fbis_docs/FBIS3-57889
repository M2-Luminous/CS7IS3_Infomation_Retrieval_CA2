He expressed the belief that during his visit, concrete moves will be undertaken toward the establishment of a joint railroad car factory in Kazakhstan, in line with a previous agreement. Kostepen noted that Kazakhstan's request to purchase railroad cars, as well as ships for internal sea and river transportation, from Turkey will also be discussed during his visit. He added that the question of nonstop television broadcasts will also be raised. The transportation minister's visit to Kazakhstan will last three days.
