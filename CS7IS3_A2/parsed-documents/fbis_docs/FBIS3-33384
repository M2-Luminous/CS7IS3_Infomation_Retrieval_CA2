Camilion told CLARIN that, even if the neighbor countries do not purchase any materiel, when the Skyhawks join our country's Air Force "they will barely be enough to reestablish a sort of regional air balance." The defense minister -- who is on a five-day visit to Brazil -- believes it is a "very personal" opinion of the O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO editorialist, an opinion "that is not shared in any way" because "I have not received any direct or indirect expression of concern from the Brazilian Government areas that I have toured so far." Camilion met Army Minister General Zenildo Gonzaga Zoroastro de Lucena, with whom he discussed the possibility of Brazilian officers joining the Argentine peacekeeping forces that are operating in Croatia, Cyprus, and Mozambique. Camilion will be received by Brazilian President Itamar Franco today. The Brazilian Government is concerned because some 600 U.S. soldiers will be deployed in Paraguay as of May. During Camilion's meeting with the Army minister, they also discussed an increase in the exchange between the two armies at the level of company grade officers from operational units. Discussing the border security issue, Minister Camilion noted: "The Brazilians envy our national border police and regret the fact that they do not have a coast guard corps like our coast guard." During these talks it became obvious that the southern border does not represent a concern for the Brazilian military, which has initiated a redeployment of their forces toward northern Brazil and the Amazon region. It also became obvious that Brazil is worried about drug trafficking but is reluctant to join transnational strategies to struggle against this scourge. [passage omitted]
