FR940607-2-00033 FR940607-2-00025 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;4890&hyph;5] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, or to obtain a copy of this ICR, contact Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances Title: Training Verification Program for Implementation of the Revised Federal Work Protection Standards. (ICR No: 0277.09; OMB No: 2070&hyph;0060). This is a request for the approval of revised burden hours for requirements under Section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The current approval expires on February 28, 1995. Abstract: On August 21, 1992, EPA issued final regulations revising its Worker Protection Standards (WPS) for agricultural pesticides (40 CFR part 170 and 40 CFR part 156, subpart K). The revised regulations strengthen the requirements for the protection of agricultural workers and pesticide handlers from hazards of pesticides used on farms, on forests, in nurseries and in greenhouses. The regulations require that each agricultural worker and pesticide handler be trained in pesticide safety to reduce the risk of pesticide poisoning and other injuries. The WPS specified what safety information must be provided to workers and handlers; the WPS also provides for the issuance of EPA-approved WPS training certificates upon completion of training. This certification process allows employers to verify that workers and handlers have received WPS safety training. However, to relieve agricultural employers from the responsibilities of retraining migrant workers and handlers, the EPA offers a Training Verification Program (TVP) that involves the issuance of training verification cards. The TVP is optional for states; a state that wants to participate will submit an agreement form to the EPA and will request the number of verification cards it needs to implement the program. While this does not place any additional burden on the states, the TVP does require trainers to create and maintain records of rosters containing the names of the trainees. The upward revision in burden hours requested in this ICR reflects these trainer requirements under the TVP. The Agency will use the additional information for verification purposes and to provide a mechanism to standardize the worker pesticide safety training program across the agricultural industry. Burden statement: The public burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 10 minutes per respondent to prepare a roster, and 5 minutes per respondent to file a roster annually. This estimate includes the time to review instructions and review the collection of information. Respondents: Trainers of agricultural workers and pesticide handlers. Estimated No. of Respondents: 10,000. Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent: 10. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 24,990 hours. Frequency of Collection: On occasion. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of the information collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (PM&hyph;223Y), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 ␣␣␣and Matthew Mitchell, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503.
