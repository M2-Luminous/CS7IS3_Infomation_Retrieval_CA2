SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The air quality planning and state implementation plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 40 to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program. Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out requirements applicable in Marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph (3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the state each year emission statements showing actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ). This paragraph provides that the states are to submit a revision to their state implementation plans (SIPs) by November 15, 1992 establishing this emission statement program. The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the state within three years after November 15, 1990, and annually thereafter. The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statement data elements to be consistent with other source and state reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist states with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting requirements. II. Analysis of State Submission There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements of the CAA. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. A. SIP Revision Submission The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing the implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Sections 110(a)(2) and 110(l) of the Act provides that each implementation plan and plan revision submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission. After providing adequate public notice and holding a public hearing, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) submitted an emission statement SIP revision on November 16, 1992. A revised submittal was signed and submitted by the Governor's designee (Director of ODEQ) on November 15, 1993. Prior to the Director's signature, the state provided adequate public notice and public hearings (June 28 and August 17, 1993) on the emission statement SIP revision. EPA received an official SIP submitted by the Director of ODEQ on November 15, 1993. The November 15, 1993 submittal wholly superseded the November 16, 1992 SIP revision and therefore is the subject of this proposal. The November 15, 1993 SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete on December 20, 1993. B. Program Elements Oregon's emission statement program contains provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions of key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. In accordance with the Act and with a portion of the suggested guidelines, Oregon conforms by dictating that the emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification information and emissions information. The ODEQ requires the submission of data from the sources no later than February 28 of each year or the due date for the annual permit report specified in the source's Air Contaminant Discharge Permit. In addition, sources subject to these rules shall keep records at the plant site containing all applicable operating data, process rate data, and control equipment efficiency information and other information used to calculate or estimate actual emissions, and shall be available for ODEQ's review, or submitted upon request. Such records shall be kept by the owner or operator for three calendar years after submittal of the emission statement. C. Sources Covered The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO x or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional Office to waive the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources. Oregon's rule applies to sources of VOC and NOx in ozone nonattainment areas, with a Plant Site Emission Limit (PSEL) 25 tons or greater per year for either pollutant, and to any source whose actual emissions are equal to or greater than 25 tons per year. EPA believes this is sufficient to meet the requirements of the CAA. D. Enforceability All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the state and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). The state of Oregon has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) and sections 184(b)(2) and 182(f) for emission statement measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. The ODEQ will supply sources with guidance and an example on how to submit emission reports, informing sources to attach this information with the annual permit report. The enforcement section of ODEQ will follow through with violators by sending out notices of compliance and fines accordingly. EPA expects that the state's existing air enforcement program will be adequate. III. Final Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;66). EPA is approving Oregon's emission statement SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA. IV. Administrative Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.SE.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. The action will become effective on May 23, 1994. However, if we receive notice by April 25, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse comments, then EPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action; and (2) a document that begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
