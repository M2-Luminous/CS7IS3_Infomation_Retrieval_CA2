According to Smirnov, who led the Russian delegation, participants in the session focussed mainly on economic situation in the countries undergoing economic reforms. The Russian delegates drew attention to regional integrating processes with a view to preventing discrimination against the Russian Federation. They also raised the question of developing production cooperation within the framework of the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. We should immediately begin working on the economic aspects of the initiative, first of all, in the interests of our industry and state military-industrial complex, Smirnov said.
