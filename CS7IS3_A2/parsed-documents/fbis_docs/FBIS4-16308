Strategic reserves of masout and coal dwindle. Anatoliy Dyakov, president of the Russian joint-stock company "The Russian Power Grid", corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told ITAR-TASS. The overspending of these kinds of fuel at power stations made up over 300 thousand tonnes in March and over 116 thousand tonnes in April. The emergency situation is largely caused by huge non-payments the power-generating industry, running into 3,600 billion roubles. Being short of funds, the branch ran up a debt to fuel suppliers, owing about one thousand billion roubles for gas. Because of this, gas suppliers broke the agreement to deliver gas to power stations even if there is non-payment. Gas supplies dropped by over 600 million cubic metres in March. This resulted in the stoppage of a number of large power plants at thermal power stations. Half their number use gas for fuel. The situation has aggravated further because of the drop by 1,250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at nuclear power plants, the drop that has not been sanctioned by "The Russian Power Grid" joint-stock company. Managers of nuclear power plants explain this by the lack of fuel. Dyakov said these factors explain the rapid dwindling of stocks of fuel at power stations. Not even the use of strategic reserves can fully compensate for gas shortages, he said. Due to this it is necessary to cut fuel supply to industrial enterprises in the Transbaikalia, Siberia and Transcaucasia.
