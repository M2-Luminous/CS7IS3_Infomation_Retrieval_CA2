Following is our radio comment on these sabotage activities. In Phnom Penh recently, people staged a demonstration with slogans against Vietnam and the friendly relations between Cambodia and Vietnam. Concerning this incident on Monday, a spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry made a statement saying that Vietnam was very worried at this move aimed to undermine traditional friendship between the two countries, and to harm Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia. The statement said these acts were beneficial to no one, but created instability and encouraged the Khmer Rouge to destroy peace and the peaceful life of Cambodians and Vietnamese ethnic nationals living there. The main reason for the instability in Cambodia, despite the UN- sponsored elections, has been the Khmer Rouge. Together with sabotage acts against the national reconstruction of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge has always waged a national campaign of hatred and massacre against Vietnamese nationals. Reality shows the Khmer Rouge will never stop opposing Vietnam. Nevertheless, Vietnamese people have cherished hopes for peace in Cambodia so that the people can build a prosperous country. Vietnam places great importance on building and developing a neighborly and friendly relationship with the Kingdom of Cambodia, on the basis of respecting each other's independence, sovereignty, non-intervention in each other's internal affairs, and equal cooperation for mutual benefit. The spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry further said that Vietnam has never coveted Cambodian territory, and has always strictly implemented all territorial agreements signed between the two countries. For this reason, Vietnam requests the Cambodian authorities, as well as authorities in other countries, to assure normal life for Vietnamese nationals, like other foreign nationals in Cambodia, in conformity with international laws and regulations. Vietnam has reaffirmed its good will in relations with Cambodia many times, but response to this good will depends on Cambodia. The Vietnamese people hope that such acts of sabotage to friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia will never take place again in Cambodia.
