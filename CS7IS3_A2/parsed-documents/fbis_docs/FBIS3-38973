Speaking after a meeting with Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic, where Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin was also present, Andreatta said "my impression was that the tension which has risen over the past few days has now subsided a lot, and that the Russians realise that NATO action (in Bosnia) would be aimed at getting positive results." "It is not our job to use weapons simply for the sake of using weapons," Andreatta told the press. "They must be used as a political tool for achieving a certain solution. If, as it seems, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn, this has already been achieved and in this case arms will not be used or will be used only where heavy weapons remain in place." The Italian diplomatic chief was referring to a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement reached Wednesday afternoon between Bosnian Serb and Moslem forces. Andreatta described his talks with Siladjzic as "long and complex", with the Bosnian premier offering a view of peaceful co-existence between Moslems and Croats "which differed from that of peace negotiators and which had both interesting and problematic aspects which will have to be studied further."
