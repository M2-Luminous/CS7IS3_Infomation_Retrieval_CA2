It should be stressed that through its ambassador in Tirana, the Greek side proposed a meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries in Geneva on the occasion of a bilateral conference. This was done at a time when the Greek official reaction was not at all characterized by a will to treat the case at the proper level or with any seriousness or analyze the criminal act and discover and convict those responsible. The Greek statements did not even see fit to express any regret for the victims and their families. Despite this totally unjustifiable position and considering that he had no invitation to attend the bilateral activity in Geneva, the Albanian foreign minister expressed his readiness to meet his Greek counterpart in the most recent bilateral activity, that of Crans Montana held in Bucharest, of course, after the Greek Government had given an official response. We add that this answer arrived yesterday, on 14 April, through the Greek ambassador in Tirana. Today, on 15 April 1994, we have informed the Greek side that the Albanian Government is ready for dialogue. The foreign policy of the new democratic Albania has left behind the period of communist isolation and it has never closed the way to dialogue for resolving all the problems that exist between Albania and other countries. Its relations with the Greek state do not make any exception from this principle of its policy. Regarding the version contained in the Greek foreign minister's letter addressed to the UN Security Council chairman that the Albanian authorities were very late in informing the Greek side about the act of 10 April 1994, we can refer to the refutation by the Public Order Ministry on 13 April. According to this, the Greek side was informed at 0500 on the morning of 10 April by a border guard officer at the Albanian border crossing of Kakavije, who went and met a border guard officer on the Greek side to inform him about the crime and to ask him to help apprehend the criminals. Nevertheless, no offer of cooperation came from the Greek side.
