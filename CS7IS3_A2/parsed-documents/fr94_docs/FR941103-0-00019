FR941103-0-00019 FR941103-0-00004 Finally, like the proposed rule, the final rule provides that an application under this section normally shall not be required where an activity is permissible to a federal branch but the OCC imposes a quantitative restriction on the conduct of such activity by the federal branch. The commenters were supportive of this exemption. The Board believes appropriate quantitative restrictions can be addressed on a case- by-case basis as part of the ongoing supervisory process. Contents of Application Section 211.29(b) of the proposed regulation provided that the application shall be in letter form and shall contain certain information, including among other things, a description of the activity in which the branch or agency desires to engage or in which it is already engaged, the foreign bank's financial condition, the assets and liabilities of the branch or agency, the projected effect of the proposed activity on the financial condition of the foreign bank and the branch or agency, and in the case of an application by a state-licensed insured branch, a statement of why the proposed activity will pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. The commenters suggested that applicants not be required to provide information already available to the Federal Reserve through its general examination and supervisory process. Accordingly, the Board has deleted from the final rule the requirement to provide certain financial information. The Board may request such information in individual cases if the information in its possession is either out of date or otherwise deemed insufficient. The Board and the FDIC have consulted concerning the type of information which each agency will need in order to make an informed judgment and have agreed on a common list of information in order that applicants will need to prepare only one application which, in the case of insured branches, may be submitted to both agencies. It is contemplated that the Board and the FDIC will review such applications simultaneously. Standards To Be Examined Section 211.29(d) of the final rule sets forth the standards that the Board will examine in order to determine whether a particular activity is consistent with sound banking practice. These factors are: •What types of risks, if any, the activity poses to the U.S. operations of the foreign banking organization; •If the activity poses any such risks, the magnitude of each risk; and •If a risk is not de minimis , the actual or proposed procedures to control and minimize such risk. Each of these factors shall be evaluated in light of the ability of the foreign bank to provide financial and managerial support to the branch or agency, the performance record of the foreign bank in general and the branch or agency in particular, and the volume of the proposed activity. The Board may also determine that a particular activity, after consideration of the above factors and subject to any conditions or limits imposed by the Board, may be conducted by any other state-licensed branch or agency without further application to the Board. This section remains unchanged from the proposed rule. Cessation or Divestiture In the event that a state branch or agency is required to cease conducting an activity pursuant to the final regulation, §211.29(f) sets forth the guidelines that must be followed to divest or cease the impermissible activity. Generally, this section provides that the state branch or agency shall submit a written plan of divestiture or cessation within 60 days of (1) being notified by the Board or the FDIC that an application to continue to conduct the activity has been denied, (2) the effective date of the regulation in the event that the foreign bank elects not to apply for permission to continue to conduct the activity, and (3) any change in statute, regulation, order or OCC interpretation that renders the activity impermissible. Divestiture or cessation shall be completed within one year, or sooner if the Board so directs. The Board requested comment on whether or not this period of time should be longer or shorter. No comments were received on this portion of the proposed rule. Accordingly, no substantive changes were made.
