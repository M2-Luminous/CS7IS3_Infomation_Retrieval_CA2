I understand that it is not a rewarding business to make forecasts now, but still, as far as I know, both voters and deputies expect the president to make a speech during the first day of the session. Will this happen? [Filatov] You know, deputies are calling for this. They would like to start their work by meeting with the president, by a presidential speech. Such a program is currently being considered and prepared, though I am aware that Boris Nikolayevich has the final say on that. He must make the final decision on how to start cooperation with deputies. That is the first thing. The second thing is that one should be aware that people are tired of pointless discussions and confrontations. One should understand that what people really want is political stability in the country. The third thing that gives inspiration is that despite what is being said about the economic reform, or how much it is being blamed, its results are obvious. No one can deny this. Both the government and experts have predicted that 1994 might be a crucial year, and this also yields a certain optimism. If one were asked what year one would have liked to see come in, I would have said 1945. It seems to me that there is something deeply philosophical and humane in this. Hopes of victory, hopes of stability, hopes of peace, and hopes of calm -- it seems to me that there is very profound sense in all of this. I would like to live to see all this, and I think that if everyone understood that, and in particular those who will play a significant role in deciding the country's future, it would be a significant contribution to the country's development and to the process of stabilization.
