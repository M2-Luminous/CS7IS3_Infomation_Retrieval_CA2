The new budget implies that this is inevitable. When will it take place? [Aleksandrov] No one could doubt any longer the fact that with this budget we cannot have a 100,000-strong Army. Something must be done, although I by no means agree to the concept "cuts." What will actually happen is, first of all, retirements, and second, structural changes in the Army. Since there is no more space in which to retreat, and since the new draft bill on defense has no chance of being adopted at second reading, I decided to apply the existing law. I do not want to leave a grave heritage to my successor. According to the military service regulations colonels should retire at the age of 50, and lieutenant colonels at 45. These regulations are based on the 1958 Law on Universal Military Service, which was amended for the 11th time in 1979. [Denov] What does it mean in numbers? [Aleksandrov] According to the list a bit more than 3,000 officers will retire. [Denov] Would the combat ability of the Army not suffer? [Aleksandrov] This is a reasonable question. Since I had reports about a certain tension among the officers, I decided to investigate thoroughly the cadre issue in the Army. These are some of the generalized assessments of the officers who were polled: To reduce the inflated payrolls of the General Staff, the Ministry of Defense, the armies, and the divisions; to eliminate the unnecessary Ground Troops Command; to dismiss all officers with a service of more than 20 years. What do the figures show? There is one officer or sergeant to each soldier in our Army! This is an incredible luxury, which only countries like the United States or the UK could afford. The ratio between soldiers and commanders in Turkey is 12:1; in Greece it is 8:1. Their combat ability has not suffered because of this; the opposite is true. If the Air Force and the Navy require a larger number of officers and sergeants because of the higher degree of professionalism, a ratio like the existing one is inadmissible in the Ground Troops, which are the backbone of the Army. A great part of the officers actually do not implement commanding functions. Some 24 percent of the officers serve in structures which do not deal with the management of the Army or in other departments. Our Army is becoming dangerously old. The young officers are only 45 percent of the officer corps. Our Army is full of clerks. The number of combat officers is five times smaller than the number of their colleagues in the staffs and officers. Those figures are shocking! [passage omitted] [Denov] When will a final decision on the new personnel figures be adopted? [Aleksandrov] As a minister I already adopted my decision. The government fully supports me. The supreme commander in chief has no remarks in principle. I have the impression that the political forces also approve. At the beginning of April my decision will be discussed by the Supreme Military Council. I also have the support of Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff. [passage omitted] [Denov] Is it true that after the changes the Army personnel will be cut from 100,000 to 55,000? [Aleksandrov] There is an opinion according to which with the budget the parliament adopted we can maintain only a 55,000-strong Army. This conclusion is based on the methodology of a UK institute. I issued an order to the General Staff according to which an analysis is made at present regarding precisely what Army could we maintain. However, in this case it is more important to decide whether we should have a smaller but combat-ready Army, or to leave a fantastic big number of people with questionable qualifications. Personally, I prefer the quality to the quantity. [passage omitted)
