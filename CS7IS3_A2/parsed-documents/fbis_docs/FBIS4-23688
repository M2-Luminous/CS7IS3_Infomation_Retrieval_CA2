Louise Kayibanda says that along the Gitarama-Nyanza road, there are many refugees who escaped the killings and other refugees who had come from Gisenyi. These had earlier fled the fighting and went to Gisenyi, but they were sent back because they were Banyenduga. They returned to the RPF area. [passage omitted] Government forces are in a critical situation on all fronts; those on Kigali hill are counting their days. Those on Jari hill may even have fled by now. For the government forces, it is as bad to hear about the fall of Gitarama as the fall of Kanombe airport area. Gitarama was the second headquarters of the so-called government. Shortly, the government will be on the run forever. [passage omitted]
