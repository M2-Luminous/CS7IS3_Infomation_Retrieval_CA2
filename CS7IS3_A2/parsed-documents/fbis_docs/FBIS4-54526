What is Waldemar Pawlak's position on the issue? How long is this chaos supposed to last?" Senators asked Labor Minister Leszek Miller these questions yesterday. "Real unanimity is found only in cemeteries," the minister said. Labor Minister Leszek Miller reported to the Senate on the situation in which the country has found itself as a result of the wave of strikes. According to the minister, the action by "Solidarity" may endanger economic stability. "Inflation is falling, unemployment has stopped rising, and economic indicators are optimistic." This is the way the minister portrayed the country's economic picture. "The protests by Solidarity are an obstacle to overcoming economic stagnation," he lamented. According to Minister Miller, destroying social peace, which has been built with so much hard work, may also be a result of the strikes, while the social situation is being carefully watched by foreign partners, who regard the situation as a test of the state's credibility. According to Miller, a majority of demands put forward by Solidarity can be discussed within the framework of a trilateral commission, which includes representatives of the government, employers, and trade unions (the government will strive to have the commission's powers defined statutorily). The minister thinks, for instance, that it is possible to abandon central salary-control measures in state-owned enterprises provided some conditions are met. First of all, a process of commercialization of these companies must take place. But the minister stressed that the government will not be able to approve of solutions that would exceed the inflation level provided for by this year's budget. Miller also holds it against Solidarity for having withdrawn from negotiations concerning social guarantees for citizens. In his view, the reason it happened was that Solidarity fears losing the special position it enjoyed during talks with previous governments. "Negotiations are not as spectacular as strikes and demonstrations," Miller said, "but negotiations will at least result in changes being made to laws." The minister announced that the government wants to establish its own rapport with trade unions based on principles of partnership and treating all trade union centers the same way. The senators, however, were not happy with these explanations. "What is Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's position on the neopopiwek [salary-controlling legislation]?" they pressured Miller. "There should remain a control of salaries in some form until the end of the year," Miller presented the government's position. "After that, one can gradually abandon such controls, provided certain conditions are fulfilled that would prevent an uncontrolled increase in salaries." "How long will this chaos last?" asked Senator Krzysztof Kozlowski of the Union of Freedom (formerly Democratic Union) in a dramatic tone. "Either one should be in favor of salary controls, or against them," he demanded unequivocal declarations. Miller responded by saying that the Democratic Left Alliance and the entire governing coalition has a right to have different views on an issue as fundamental as this one. "Real unanimity is found only in cemeteries," Miller said. "One can call this chaos, but one could also describe it as learning the difficult art of reaching a compromise." "Why does the prime minister not take a stand of his own in a situation when the country is in danger?" attacked Zbigniew Religa, chairman of the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms. Miller replied that Pawlak will make a speech in the Sejm on Friday [29 April], while the Government's Press Office has presented the prime minister's position before.
