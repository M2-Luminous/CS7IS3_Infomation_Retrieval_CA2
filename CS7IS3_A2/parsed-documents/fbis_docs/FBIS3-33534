We will not allow this method to be adopted by those intent on leaving the country and entering a diplomatic mission cannot be a privilege or safe conduct for emigration, the spokesman added. It was learned that four men, two women, and a two-year-old girl entered the Belgian Embassy on 26 January. The Foreign Ministry spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has not changed its policy and reiterated that there are emigration laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long as he has received a visa and paid for the transportation. The spokesman added that those who knowingly, thoughtlessly, or out of ignorance or naivete enter an embassy are impairing the security of the diplomatic mission. We have cooperated with the Belgian authorities to the extent that we are allowed and if this matter was not handled earlier by the Cuban authorities -- even though the media have been reporting on the issue since yesterday -- it was because the Belgian authorities requested discretion, the spokesman said. We were not going to go back on our word, the spokesman added, but for some reason unknown to us the Belgian Embassy officials issued a communique. According to the spokesman, the citizens must leave the diplomatic mission voluntarily, return to their homes, and undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if they have a visa. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that entering the Belgian Embassy will not represent an impediment to or a privilege for others who are requesting visas. The spokesman added that only one of the persons in the embassy had served time for common crimes and was out on parole. He added that the others have no criminal background nor are they being persecuted for political reasons. In 1990 four persons entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana with the same purpose. They also had to leave the site without achieving their goal.
