Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Zou Zhekai, vice-president and secretary general of ARATS, held meetings with Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of SEF, in Beijing on February 1-4. After four days of discussions, they reached understandings on many important issues. First, both sides feel that they have reached understanding on three issues of routine affairs, namely, the repatriation of hijackers, the treatment of maritime fishing disputes and the issue of sending back other personnel who cross the straits in violation of relevant regulations. They said that this has laid a good foundation for the fourth working meeting between the two organizations to be held soon and the signing of a written agreement. Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth working meeting on the three issues in late March in Beijing, at which a draft agreement will be decided upon between the two bodies. Chiao Jen-ho hoped that Tang Shubei and his counterparts with ARATS will proceed to sign a formal agreement on the basis of the draft in Taipei. Second, also during the March meeting, the two bodies will discuss other unfinished issues included in the agreement reached between ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last year. The issues will include the protection of intellectual property rights on the two sides across the Taiwan Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on the two sides across the Taiwan Straits and joint operations against maritime smuggling, robbery and other criminal activities. Besides, they will formally discuss issues of economic exchange and cultural, educational, scientific and technological exchanges. Third, Tang Shubei presented a letter to Chiao on behalf of ARATS President Wang Daohan to invite SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu to meet on the Mainland. Chiao Jen-ho said he would actively create conditions for the meeting between Wang and Koo. The time and venue of the Wang-Koo meeting will be discussed at the March meeting. Fourth, the two sides agreed to work together to properly handle inherited property of those who left the mainland before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. During the meeting this afternoon, they agreed to publish a joint news release about their achievements. Each side has designated a vice secretary general to be in charge of the drafting of the news bulletin, which will be issued tomorrow. The discussions were fruitful and lived up to the expectations of the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Tang Shubei said at a press conference after the meeting. During the four days of discussions, each side deepened its trust of the other and had a better understanding of the other's viewpoints, Tang said. The results of the talks proved once again that high-level exchanges were very important, Tang said. Such exchanges can deepen trust on a higher level and solve differences which are not problems they appear to be, he said.
