The National Party [NP, Nats] asks blacks if they could look a doe-eyed rape-victim "in the eye and tell her you're giving a rapist the vote?" The Democratic Party [DP] asks coloureds if they could look a steely-eyed Helen Suzman "in the eye and say you're voting for the Nats?" "A better life for all"; "Be sure of a better life"; "Jobs, peace, freedom" -- hype, hype, hype. Look beyond the pig in the hat, though, and you'll find intricately devised campaigns. Millions have been spent by the ANC, NP and DP on print and radio advertisement. If it's hype, it's carefully managed. On the surface, the strategies governing the campaigns are: - The ANC wishes to assure potential voters that it is well- prepared to assume government, and that current NP policies have bankrupted the country and plunged it into violence: "We cannot afford more of this." - The NP wishes to make it clear that is has "made the change" to being truly multiracial and that black voters, too, have made the change and have come on board to support it. - The DP wishes to emphasise that it alone can be entrusted with providing effective opposition to an ANC-led government; that the NP and the ANC, both corrupt, are in cahoots, and that only the DP can protect South Africans "from the abuse of power". You could call the ANC's campaign dry, the NP's campaign dirty, and the DP's campaign elitist. But none of this is unintentional. This is advertising -- applied psychology. The parties are products that need to be sold. Behind these surface images and words, there are a whole lot of subliminal messages and unspoken assumptions. And there are mounds and mounds of research. To begin with, both ANC and the NP have determined that the other is the only serious contender. And so, even though the DP's campaign is clever, witty and intentionally strident to dispel the party's namby-pamby image, it has been all but ignored by the two major players. As in all ad campaigns, there are carefully-planned phases. The ANC's first phase, last year, was the people's forums, to give the impression of wide consultation. Then there was the "Our Plan" phase, which laid out, in simple terms, the basic tenets of the party's Reconstruction and Development Programme, accompanied by poetic-images of roses growing out of barbed wire or microphones attached to mops. Then there was the "contrast" phase, where the ANC compared its plan for the future with current NP government policy, accompanied this time by gritty snapshots of unemployed men and weeping women. The ANC is now moving into a "reassurance" phase: expect to see many comforting images of Nelson Mandela in the last week of the campaign. Strikingly absent from the ANC campaign has been hard-hitting negativity: no archival photos dredged up of Sharpeville or Soweto, or forced removals from District Six or Sophiatown. "It would be patronising to tell black South Africans that they've had a bad life under apartheid," says Ken Modise, responsible for the ANC account at Applied Marketing and Communications (AM&C), a division of Hunt Lascaris. "They don't need to be reminded." ANC media man Joel Netshitenzhe gives another reason: "We have to acknowledge that the National Party has been successful in presenting itself as a transformed multiracial party. F.W. is not P.W.. So rather than going back to the evils of apartheid, we have to show that, even now, under the new transformed F.W., policies still discriminate against black people." Modise notes that "everybody knows the ANC was a highly effective liberation movement. But will it be an effective government? South Africans look to the ANC as the incumbent. We had to be substantial; we had to be serious, to show people that we had the where-withal to govern." Eldad Louw is Modise's counterpart at the NP's ad agency, Optimum (a division of Saatchi & Saatchi). He believes that by mounting "a campaign of promises", the ANC dug itself into a difficult ditch. "Our research showed that there came a point when people could no longer believe all the ANC's promises; that they said, "that's very nice, but can they deliver?" Enter the NP, setting out with the avowed intention of proving to voters -- and particularly black voters -- that the ANC is not capable of governing. "What we would have liked to say," says Paris Pitsilledes, a member of the Optimum team, "is the following: 'Look how good life was for the whites, now you can take part in it as well.'" As one NP ad puts it; "South Africa works, so why change it?" From the very beginning of its campaign, the NP targeted African voters. This presented the party -- and its advertisers -- with a problem: "We treat the party as a product," says Pitsilledes. "And in the eye of the consumer, this particular product had a major fault. So we had to go about changing perceptions of it." This meant -- in blunt terms -- blackening it up. Given that the NP cannot organise effectively in black areas because of intimidation, advertising has assumed an immense significance. Just as De Klerk's staged events with traditional leaders and cheering black NP supporters were calculated to beam the message into the living-rooms of unsure black voters, that there are black NP supporters, the NP's advertising campaign -- particularly its latest series of straight-talk endorsements from black NP members -- is calculated, according to Louw, to show potential supporters that "they are not alone, that there are others who feel the same way as they do." Pitsilledes says: "We've been knocked for taking the emotional approach, but advertising is not about logic, it's about emotion". Precisely because the ANC is making an emotionally-charged call for the allegiance of black voters, "we have to take the emotional approach to negate this". And so, in an NP ad, one finds the textbook hear-tug image: the chubby soft-focus shot of a cute beribboned girl: "Vote ANC. And break her heart." Other NP ads, however, demand serious attention and have come in for fiery criticism. Like the ad, flighted last week, showing slain Inkatha supporters outside ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, above a quote from THE SOWETAN saying: "We are sick and tired of the cynical use of ordinary folk who are also misinformed about the real causes for marches, for rallies and for the politics of today." Or like the series of ads attacking the ANC and the DP's call to give prisoners the vote. Most controversial was the ad featuring an identikit of the Station Strangler: "Can you imagine the Cape Strangler having the vote? The ANC and DP can." The ANC and DP attacked it as playing on the racist fears of coloured people, because the identikit is of a man more black than brown, but NP executive director Olaus van Zyl rejects this outright: "It wouldn't matter if the strangler was blue or white! He's a strangler! A murderer! The issue is, should he have the vote?" Racist or not, Pitsilledes said the ad had immense effect among coloureds in the Western Cape, at whom it was targeted. And he answers criticism that it was cynical and manipulative by saying: "So what? It worked." Therein lies a major difference of style between the two teams doing the ANC and NP campaigns. While Pitsilledes talks of selling a product, for example, AM&C copywriter Steve Shaw highmindedly explains why the ANC has not used catchy jingles -- as the NP has -- in its radio advertisements: "We're not selling dish-washing detergents, we're talking about the future of this country." There's a moral righteousness to the team at AM&C; talk of "nation-building" abounds. Down the road at Optimum, however, the mood is hard-boiled: "Sure, the ANC campaign is efficient," says Louw. "But we're looking for effectiveness." Their respective attitudes reproduce, almost exactly, the moods of the campaigns they are working for. Van Zyl goes out of his way to show that the NP campaign is not a negative one, citing research figures that show that black people do not go for negative campaigning. According, to Van Zyl, the NP's "sheep in wolf's clothing" ad, which hit the ANC on the number of communists on its list, did not go down well among black voters. Nevertheless, the reality is the NP is the challenger in this campaign and, as the challenger, it has mounted a far more robust and strident attack against the ANC than vice-versa. Whether this tactic has worked will only be known after the elections. One thing is certain, though: all three parties' professional and fine-tuned campaigns will change South African electoral politics for ever. For better or for worse, commerce has become an integral and indivisible part of election campaigning.
