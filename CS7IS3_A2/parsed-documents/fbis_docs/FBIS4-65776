This recommendation, contained in a memo to the government formation, was made by the Central Economic Commission (CEC), which is comprised of senior officials from the Ministries of Finance, Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, as well as from the Central Planning Office. The CEC's savings measures are on the high side compared to the electoral platforms of the four major parties. Only the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] wants more savings: 17 billion guilders in addition to the 5 billion the current government has already chalked up. According to the CEC, 10 billion guilders must be saved in social benefits. Next, 11 billion guilders must be used to lower employers' wage costs to the level of the minimum wage. At the same time, the CEC is advocating measures to maintain the purchasing power of those earning the lowest incomes. In this respect, the officials are opting for a completely different path than that taken by the committee chaired by former European Commissioner F. Andriessen. Last week, he advised increasing the difference between benefits and wages by giving working people a tax break. The CEC wants to make it more attractive for employers to create jobs for people who are poorly trained. According to the CEC, intervention measures are inevitable if the government wants to prevent a situation in 1998 in which there are 89 people not working for every 100 employed. The officials call the growth in the number of nonactive people "socially and economically disruptive." They want to maintain the current social security system for those people who are currently dependent upon it. The changes should apply only to newcomers. As was already known last week, the CEC wants to place further limits on access to occupational disability insurance. Only those people who have worked five years or longer and who are more than two-thirds occupationally disabled will still be considered for occupational disability benefits. The officials feel that people suffering from partial occupational disabilities must remain at the service of their employers. This was also suggested by parliament's Buurmeijer committee of inquiry. As for the investigation into the viability of a "purple" government coalition comprising the Pvda [Labor Party], the VVD, and D66 [Democrats 66], the results of the Buurmeijer committee play an important role. The D66 embraced them in its electoral platform and VVD leader Bolkestein let it be known even before the elections that he wanted to give up the former system if the Buurmeijer proposal was adequate. The PvdA, which rejects the former system, also feels that the Buurmeijer proposal is more open to discussion. The CEC also wants to privatize the national health insurance system, abolish the Heir Act, and lower the contribution for single people to 60 percent of the minimum wage. In addition, old age pensioners who have a supplementary pension of at least 10,000 guilders per year will have to pay taxes for all kinds of national insurance, including of course the old age pension. The senior officials also proposed putting stiffer taxes on cars and energy. These measures should yield almost 5 billion guilders. Working through the plan it would appear that the ratio of working to nonworking people may become more favorable over the next four years: 100 working people to 82 nonworking people. The advantage of this is that the linking of benefits to wages in industry can continue. The law states that linking may only be applied if per 100 working people there are not more than 82.6 nonworking people.
