FBIS4-58211 "drnes085_g_94005" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 Sudan SPLM Official Interviewed on Various Issues SPLM Official Interviewed on Various Issues NC0105165894 Cairo AL-WAFD in Arabic 24 Apr 94 p 9 NC0105165894 Cairo AL-WAFD Arabic BFN [Unsigned article from the "Brothers" page] [Text] Daniel Akodi [name as transliterated], representative of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM] in the Middle East, has stressed that the congress that the SPLM recently held in south Sudan discussed 23 papers on the future situation in the south and what the SPLM should do about it. He noted that ad hoc committees have been formed to discuss these papers and work out their final views on how to administer the liberated areas in the south. In an exclusive statement to the "Brothers," (Akodi) pointed out that the SPLM believes that since it controls large areas in southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and (al-Anqasta), it must increase its attention to the infrastructure in these areas. He said: As events developed, the SPLM thought that there was a need to establish a civil administration with organizations from the bottom to the top at the level of villages, groups of villages, and larger areas. A national council will supervise all these areas. At the same time, the SPLM seeks to marshal the masses in the south so that they can confront the challenges facing them. On the military level, agreement was reached to form a military council to formulate military strategy. These are the issues that were discussed at the SPLM congress. He added: We in the SPLM did not at all mean these measures to mean that we are seceding, as several Arab papers reported. Regarding reports in the Sudanese regime's newspapers' that these measures were merely designed to cover up the SPLM's military defeats, Akodi said: Quite the contrary. The Sudanese Government did not score any important military victories during the dry season. The SPLM is now trying suicidal operations, having massed all its forces in the south in an attempt to tighten its control on the Nimule area, where pitched battles are raging. I believe that the ruling regime in Khartoum has completely failed to achieve any of its military goals, despite massing huge forces unprecedented in size since the civil war started in Sudan. This confirms that the regime's newspaper reports are false. The government forces failed to score any military victories. As a matter of fact, the SPLM has military resources to strike at the heart of the government forces. We are currently planning such moves. Regarding the term "New Sudan," which appeared in the communique released by the SPLM congress and which makes the opposition in the north fear that the SPLM is splitting away from the grouping under a new name, Akodi said: We in the SPLM are concerned about the grouping; our relations with the opposition forces in the north are very good. All that we mean by "New Sudan" is a Sudan based on new foundations and new concepts that will guarantee personal freedom to the citizens regardless of religion, race, ethnic affiliation, sex, or color. Akodi continued: We in the northern and southern opposition groups agree on all the basics. The movement, which has been fighting since the time of al-Numayri's, Siwar al-Dhahab, through the party government that involved Umma, the Democratic Unionist Party, and the Sudanese People's Federal Party, has opted to join the alliance embracing these parties due to its firm belief that major northern parties have basically changed their position on the issue of southern Sudan. We all have a clear vision of how to build a secularist, democratic, united, new Sudan. We in the people's movement have no disputes or disagreements concerning the objectives of the National Democratic Grouping [NDG] in the north. There is full harmony among us and we have a clear collective vision of Sudan's future after the fall of the National Islamic Front [NIF]. Akodi added: It is absolutely wrong to view the measures the movement adopted recently as a step toward breaking away. The movement absolutely believes that if the NIS regime falls, all democratic powers in Sudan will sit together to plan the country's political future. When this happens, everybody will eventually agree on how to achieve peaceful coexistence between the north and south after 28 years of civil war. Hence, he added, what the press said does not mean that the movement has drifted away from the basic principles of the NDG charters it signed. Asked whether the SPLM is seeking military support from northern elements in the NDG, Akodi said: We believe that all the NDG factions should join efforts to overthrow the ruling regime. This does not necessarily mean that all northern groups must undertake military action within the ranks of the SPLM. We believe that these elements can undertake a massive media campaign and urge and mobilize the northern masses to speed up the overthrow of the NIS. This is what both the north and south have agreed on in the NDG. As a military power, we do our duty in this connection. However, we do not object to northern military action if this is possible, even if it is on a small scale. This would give the southerners a big incentive to reaffirm their national affiliation.
