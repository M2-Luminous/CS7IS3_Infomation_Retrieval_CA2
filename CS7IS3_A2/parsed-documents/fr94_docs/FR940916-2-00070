ACTION: Notice of Application and Institution of Proceeding. SUMMARY: Burlington Northern Railroad Company, Inc. (BN) and Protexa Burlington International (PBI) filed a joint application under the Panama Canal Act (the Act), 49 U.S.C. 11321, for (1) a determination that BN's ownership interest in and operation of PBI do not violate the provisions of the Act, and (2) approval, under 49 U.S.C. 11321(b), of BN's continued ownership interest in PBI to eliminate any question as to whether the anticipated expansion of PBI's operations may bring it within the scope of the Act. DATES: An original and 10 copies of comments must be filed by October 17, 1994. A copy of comments must be served on applicants' representative. An original and 10 copies of applicants' replies to comments must be filed by November 7, 1994. Applicants must serve their replies on all parties who file comments. ADDRESSES: Send pleadings referring to Finance Docket No. 32533 to: (1) Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423, and (2) applicants' representative, Betty Jo Christian, Steptoe & Johnson, 1330 Connecticut Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20036&hyph;1795. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph H. Dettmar, (202) 927-5660. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927-5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: BN is a class I railroad operating in the northwestern and central United States. PBI, a joint venture formed to offer rail-on-barge water transportation between the United States and Mexico, is owned equally by BN and Grupo Protexa S.A. de C.V., a Mexican marine and industrial firm based in Monterrey, Mexico. At present, BN provides rail service between United States points and Galveston, TX, under transportation contracts with PBI, while a PBI affiliate, PBI-Bahamas, a vessel operating common carrier, provides water transportation between Galveston and Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. BN's cars are then moved from Coatzacoalcos to other Mexican destinations by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico. Applicants state that their integrated operation improves BN's access to central and southern Mexican markets and that PBI's service may be expanded to Veracruz, Altamira, and other Mexican ports. The Panama Canal Act prohibits a railroad from acquiring an interest in a water common carrier in areas where both may compete for traffic, unless the Commission finds that, notwithstanding such competition, cross-ownership will allow the water carrier ``to be operated in the public interest * * * and that it will still allow competition, without reduction, on the water route in question.'' 49 U.S.C. 11321(b). Applicants request the Commission to find that BN is not in violation of the Act, because it does not and cannot compete via all-rail service for the traffic handled by PBI. In light of PBI's anticipated expansion to other Mexican ports, applicants also seek approval of BN's ownership interest in PBI on the grounds that PBI's service will enhance, rather than reduce, competition on the water route and will continue to be operated in the public interest. Comments should address the competitive and public interest aspects of the joint application. In addition, comments may be directed to the impact, if any, on this proceeding of BN's recently announced proposal to merge with The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company. Copies of the joint application are on file and may be examined at the Office of the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC. Copies may also be requested from applicants' representative Betty Jo Christian, (202) 429&hyph;3000. Decided: September 6, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons and Morgan. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
