In his first news conference with local and foreign reporters, Frei said he will not emulate his predecessor Patricio Aylwin, who after his inauguration in March 1990 hinted to Pinochet that he should resign. The new Chilean ruler said he will not tamper with the constitutional provision that establishes the permanence of military chiefs until 1997. Frei added, however, that he would promote constitutional reforms to again empower the president to appoint armed forces chiefs. Frei emphasized that his relations with the Army and other defense institutions "will be impersonal" [as received] to ensure that such bodies also help the country face its great challenges and embark on a new phase of development. Frei said that recent Air Force and the Army weapons purchases are not part of an arms race but the unavoidable renewal of already obsolete weapons. The country needs an armed forces that is modern and ready to fulfill its mission of defending the country's territorial sovereignty and security, Frei added. The president said that weapons expenditures are not contrary to his political goals of overcoming the extreme poverty that affects more than 1 million Chileans. Frei added that the armed forces are absolutely subordinate to civilian power.
