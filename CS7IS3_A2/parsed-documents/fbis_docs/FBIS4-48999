Rather, the reception of Mr Lu may well be akin to the Zen concept of "the sound of one hand clapping". The wish to applaud the visit will be tempered by the uncertainties of the transition of rule and the realisation that the bitterness which has fuelled those uncertainties is as entrenched as ever. Mr Lu's refusal to meet Governor Chris Patten is one of the clearest signs yet that the fallout over political reform is hindering cooperation on other transitional issues as much as it ever did. Until now, both sides have at least attempted to bridge the gulf with rhetoric. China believes that Mr Patten breached key understandings between the two countries by unilaterally embarking on constitutional reform. But Mr Patten hasn't acted alone. And what China doesn't seem to realise is that by attempting to isolate the Governor it risks isolating the people of Hong Kong by exacerbating their uncertainties and alienating their sympathies. As much as China may want to, it will be impossible to undermine Chris Patten's influence on Hong Kong matters in the run up to 1997. Rather, in this case in particular, the Chinese leadership has allowed Mr Patten to launch a counter-offensive against Mr Lu's rejection of his invitation. The Governor has scored some points in suggesting that the Chinese side has not been prepared to put aside injured national pride for the sake of discussing the concerns of Hong Kong people in the transition period. The civil service is jittery over whether there'll be sufficient seats on the through-train straddling 1997. There is no through- train for the three tiers of government, and China's economic problems coupled with its crackdown on dissidents has caused widespread unease. Mr Lu will, of course, have extensive and thorough discussions with China's 200 or so advisers in Hong Kong, community think-tanks and business leaders over the course of this week. But the advice he receives may not differ much from that which has been channelled through the regular Hong Kong-China conduits of the National People's Congress and the Beijing-appointed Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). The meetings of the PWC--for the first time in the territory this week--will no doubt show the people of Hong Kong that Beijing is perfectly capable of looking after their interests despite its strained relations with Britain. That may be cold comfort for the majority of people who are not deluded into thinking that China indulges in grassroots decision-making. The PWC isn't seen as a power broker in Beijing and the plethora of Hong Kong advisers has little more influence. The real decisions are made within the upper echelons of the Chinese leadership. Everyone knows that. What the Hong Kong people want to see is some semblance of cooperation between the two sovereign states as the only sure way to minimise uncertainty and instability in the run up to 1997. How much clout did Mr Lu have in deciding whether to accept the Governor's invitation to meet anyway? Surely a decision to meet would not depend entirely on Mr Lu but on the approval of more senior Chinese leaders.
