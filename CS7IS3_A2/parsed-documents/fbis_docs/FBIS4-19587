A duty has also been fixed for silicon carbide from Russia, but, at the same time, the Commission has accepted undertakings offered by the official Russian exporter, namely V/O Stankoimport (Moscow), and the antidumping duty therefore does not apply to this exporter which, in practice, is the only one. The duty introduced is therefore a "residual" duty of a prudential kind: the rapid development of the economic system in Russia could, says the Council, entail the appearance of new producers and exporters working independently from the State and which would not be linked by the Stankoimport commitments. The duty would therefore apply to them. To complete the picture, it must be added that: - Procedure concerning Norway was closed as Norwegian producers did not have any further recourse to dumping practices; - Procedure was also closed concerning the Republics of the former USSR other than Ukraine and Russia as they do not export silicon carbide (they had been automatically involved in the procedure as, in the beginning, the procedure covered the whole of the USSR as a single bloc). Antidumping measures on silicon carbide had been adopted by the Community in 1986 and should normally have expired in 1991. Nevertheless, the CEFIC (European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations) had called for reexamination, noting the risk of serious injury, on behalf of Community producers Pechiney Electrometallurgie, Elektroschmelzwerk, Samatec and Navarro. The product in question is largely used in the manufacture of ceramics, plastic materials, high quality refractory products, etc., and also -- in a specific form -- in foundry and blast furnace operations. Community production has been falling since 1990 despite increased consumption and the market share of Community producers has fallen from 61.1 percent in 1988 to 42.8 percent in 1991. China has also taken a considerable market share (1.1 percent in 1988, 15.3 percent in 1991). The market shares of Poland, Russia and Ukraine have increased but to a lesser extent. All exporter countries except Norway practised prices lower than Community prices: Poland -- 29 percent; Russia and Ukraine -- 23 to 49 percent; China 50 to 71 percent. In addition, China, Russia and Ukraine did not respect price commitments undertaken during the 1986 procedure (commitments which were, on the other hand, honoured by Norway and Poland). On the basis of the above data, and taking the United States as a "reference country," the Commission has evaluated the following average dumping margins: China 72.5 percent, Russia 23.3 percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent. Norway has not practised dumping. At the same time, the Commission has established the fact that dumping practices caused injury to Community producers. This injury would increase with expiry of 1986 measures. Already two production plants (one in France, the other in Italy) have had to close down, and this has a negative effect on users as competition is reduced. The Council shared the Commission conclusions and decided by majority vote to introduce the following antidumping duties: China 52.6 percent, Ukraine 23.3 percent, Poland 8.3 percent, Russia (for possible independent exporters) 23.3 percent. The United Kingdom voted against the decision. In the meantime, the Commission has accepted the undertakings offered by current Russian producers to limit the volume of their exports to "a nonprejudicial level." The Commission considers that Russian authorities are able to guarantee respect of these commitments given that exports are carried out through the State trade body Stankoimport. It is to be stressed that, within the advisory committee (where the Twelve are represented), reservation has been expressed by some delegations against acceptance of such commitments. The Committee then reported to the Council and the Council did not find a sufficient majority to oppose the Commission's intentions. The Commission was therefore able to approve its decision.
