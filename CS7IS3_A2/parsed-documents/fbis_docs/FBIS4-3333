"The two mandates mean a breakthrough in establishing a legal framework for China's religious sector," said Dr Han Wenzhao, vice-president of the China Christian Council. The decrees issued on January 31, are the Regulations for the Control of Sites of Religious Activities and the Regulations for the Control of Religious Activities of Aliens in the Territory of the People's Republic of China. In drafting the regulations, Chinese authorities solicited opinions of the religious circles. "We are satisfied with the decrees," Han said, "since the two regulations will act as legal protection for normal religious activities and exchanges between Chinese religious groups and their overseas counterparts on the basis of equality and mutual respect." The two laws affirm the Chinese authorities respect for foreigners' religious freedoms. Aliens are guaranteed the right to participate in normal religious activities and to have friendly exchanges with Chinese religious circles. According to Han, the edicts have seized headlines and gripped imaginations abroad. Some foreigners assumed the regulations meant that new controls would be imposed on religious activities in China. "Most of the foreign articles I have read are inaccurate," Han said. He criticized reports that triggered unnecessary apprehension among the overseas friends who are concerned with Chinese affairs. He maintained that the two rules would be instrumental to encouraging Chinese religious associations' ongoing friendly exchanges with their counterparts in other countries. "If there are some restrictions, they are designed for the foreigners who are engaged in illegal, guileful activities in China," Han said. The regulations uphold the principle articulated in China's Constitution that the country's religious groups and religious affairs should not be directed by overseas forces. No foreigner should interfere in China's religious affairs. The eighth article of the regulations on the management of religious activities of aliens, for example stipulates that "foreigners must not set up religious organizations, offices or sites in China, recruit religious followers among Chinese citizens, or appoint religious ecclesiastics." Just 10 days after the promulgation of the two laws, seven people from the Hong Kong Revival Christian Church, including the Reverend Dennis Balcomb, were detained for several days in Henan Province for their illicit religious activities. The incident touched off erroneous stories in some overseas newspapers. The Reverend Balcomb is not a new name in China. He wrote a statement of repentance several years ago when he was given a serious warning for similar illegal undertakings, Han said. Today, peace and development are the common pursuits of people worldwide, requiring an environment of conciliation. Objective and accurate reporting will help create better understanding between different peoples. Although the Cold War has drawn to a close, the influence of the media from that time lingers. Quite a few people abroad have taken it for granted that the atheistic Chinese Communist Party (CPC), the ruling party in China, racks its brains to wipe out religion. "Biased, they turn a blind eye to or disbelieve in the achievements made by the State's religious policies," Han said. The reality of' Chinese Christians has long been ignored by the foreign press. When visiting the United States in 1993, Han talked about Christian honesty and ethics with Christian journalists from the major news media. He called for impartial reporting, both domestic and overseas, to enhance understanding between China and the rest of the world. Han notes that only a few foreigners are malicious to China. Many Christian associations and individuals abroad deem the two Chinese decrees as fair and reasonable. Han said his Christian council is grateful for the clarification made by 21 foreign Christian reverends residing in Hong Kong. The past decade has witnessed dramatic changes in China's Christendom. According to Han, 8,000 churches are now open to Christians. On top of that, China has set up 13 seminaries to train clergy for its 6 million to 7 million Christian believers. Since 1985, the Amity Foundation, founded by Christian believers in China, has been sponsoring around 80 foreign teachers annually for China's institutions of higher learning.
