In his opening statement, he pointed out that current HZDS district assemblies confirm that the movement is gathering new strength and that any opposition pressures are in vain because the ruling movement is fulfilling, and will fulfill, its electoral program. He noted that, in conformity with the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, the movement is trying to address ethnic issues so that everyone's freedom and the equality of all citizens regardless of nationality be guaranteed. No one is a second-class citizen in our country, the prime minister stressed. If someone suffers from the internal complex of being a second-class citizen, let him undergo treatment and not go public with it. Relations among citizens in the south of Slovakia are not complicated, but the problems are being exaggerated by Central European bodies and also by some circles from Hungary. Our borders are unchangeable, and each political party at home as well as abroad must realize this, Vladimir Meciar said, among other things.
