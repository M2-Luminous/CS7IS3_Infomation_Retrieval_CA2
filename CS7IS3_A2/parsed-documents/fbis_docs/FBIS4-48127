In a statement released today, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle said that the nation should remain calm and not be alarmed by the presence of members of the defense force. The prime minister further requests the nation to cooperate with the defense force members in their effort to protect human life and property, and to maintain peace and stability. The striking police have reported that they will not accept their monthly salaries at the end of the month, which is on Friday next week. In a letter reportedly written to the minister of finance, police say they want 60 percent increase for police officers, soldiers, and prison officers. They also demand a risk allowance increase of 100 percent for the three categories. The letter states that the police will not resume work before their demands, which include mountain allowance, patrol rotation, plain-clothes allowance, and patrol allowance, are met. The letter says that police want the Police Order of 1991 to be repealed so that their promotions should be controlled by the commissioner of police and not the principal secretary of home affairs, as they allege is the case now. The strike began yesterday, and reports from different districts say police are not working countrywide. The strike by members of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police continued throughout the country today. Reports of loss of life, looting, and destruction of property have been received, and members of the Royal Lesotho Defense Force have been deployed to maintain law and order. It is reported from Mohale's Hoek that residents have taken the initiative to protect property in business premises, as it is apparent that looters come from places outside the area. The government is appealing to all Basotho to follow this initiative and protect business premises in the light of the current situation and urges employees to cooperate with their employers, as these businesses are to their benefit. The government would like to reassure the business community that the situation, which is taken advantage of by criminal elements, is now completely under control. It further advises that great caution and vigilance should be exercised to curb any further activities of this criminal element.
