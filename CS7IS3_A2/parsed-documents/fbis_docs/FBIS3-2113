At the same time, its preferential policy of reducing and remitting taxes on other trades in which foreign investors are engaged will remain unchanged in the future. According to this official, owing to the rich natural resources for tourism in Hainan, the province has taken tourism as a leading form of trade to bring along the development of tertiary industry in the past few years. The development of real estate is a prerequisite for boosting tourism, so when examining and approving real estate investment projects, the province did not include office buildings, auditoriums, hotels, and guest houses as a category in which construction is restricted. Instead, it regarded them as means of production in the hope that the development of real estate will contribute to boosting tourism. Since the exercise of macroeconomic regulation and control last year, the central authorities have withdrawn many landlocked provinces' funds for real estate investment in Hainan, investigated the excessively large scope of investment, and imposed sanctions on Hainan by banning domestic remittances for any investment project in the province. So far, such economic sanctions have not been lifted, but trade-related remittances have been relaxed only recently. Superficially, the central authorities forbid mainland banks to lend money to coastal areas, but in fact the economic sanction is applied only against Hainan. Moreover, the central authorities openly criticized Hainan by name for its excessively large scope of investment. The Hainan official believes that Hainan, being the youngest province in the country, has no backing among the central authorities, who therefore dare to bully only Hainan, but are afraid of offending other major provinces or cities. As Hainan is the largest economic region in China, the central authorities have provided it with many preferential policies and vested in it the power to examine and approve projects. Since 1 January this year, the separation of financial and taxation departments and the collection of the VAT on land have come into effect throughout the country. However, in light of the hint given by the central authorities that taxation policy in Hainan will not be changed, the province has no intention of levying the VAT on any real estate developed by foreign investors, as this practice will adversely affect the national economic development of Hainan. The provincial government hopes that the property market in Hainan will boom. At present, a large number of real estate projects have had to be laid aside owing to the withdrawal of funds last year. The official added: At this crucial juncture, the province will not recall the land, but will let the original investors keep it so that they can develop it when "spring" comes. This official continued: The Hainan Special Economic Region had very remarkable advantages in the past, but as the central authorities also practice preferential policies in the landlocked areas, such advantages have weakened accordingly. The greatest advantage of the province now is that the market economy system was being practiced there five years earlier than in other provinces in the country, so its basic framework has taken shape. In addition, the provincial government is bold in action and ready to take responsibility. It always has the interests of enterprises and investors in mind. In order to reflect the strong points of the special economic region, the provincial government has decided to continue practicing the preferential policy of reducing or remitting taxes on foreign-invested enterprises. In the meantime, the government will allow the existence of second- and third-hand property markets. It has been learned that last year, Zhu Rongji intended to investigate and affix the local government's responsibility for the excessively large scope of investment in Hainan because the province originally planned to invest 10 billion yuan in infrastructural construction, though actual investment came to 17.5 billion yuan. Although the province has invested 21.7 billion yuan in capital construction over the past five years, infrastructure facilities in the province have been improved greatly. Therefore, when Zhu Rongji understood this, he praised the rapid development of Hainan instead of criticizing it. The province plans to invest another 20 billion yuan this year to improve the investment environment.
