Upon leaving the meeting, the prime minister told correspondents that the Labor party had undeniably been dealt a blow. However, when the correspondents asked him whether he intended to call upon Ramon to rejoin the ranks of the Labor party, Mr. Rabin pointed out that right now he was only commenting on the Histadrut elections and the immediate question was which form the internal arrangements inside the Histadrut would take. The prime minister said that in his opinion the vote reflected the feelings of protest and disappointment of Histadrut members following a long period of Labor rule and this was a well-known phenomenon. Nevertheless, Rabin stressed that he was glad that the votes had remained within the left-wing camp while the Likud had received a serious setback. The prime minister avoided giving a direct answer when asked about the anticipated new political alignments, but reiterated that the government and the Labor party had political goals on the national level, noting that its leadership would be guided by considerations on how to achieve these goals. Hayim Ramon's supporters in the Labor party, members of the quintet of Labor Knesset Members [MK's], called on the prime minister to permit the return of Ramon and his associates to the Labor party. This demand was firmly raised by MK's Ramon and Burg. Ramon's arch rival, Minister Shim'on Shetrit, once again called Ramon a deserter this evening. Shetrit, however, noted that in politics, coalitions are established even with one's worst rivals. This implies that the partnership between Ramon and the Labor party may be renewed in some form. Some members of Ramon's camp have called for the establishment of a coalition with the Labor party Histadrut faction, which will apparently receive 30 percent, or slightly more, of the vote. Minister Shulamit Aloni said that the Ramon list would be prepared to consider such an affiliation. In Aloni's assessment, negotiations would start this evening and the Ramon list would join with the Labor party. The country is waiting for changes in the Histadrut, Aloni explained. Rabin has no reason to be concerned. On the contrary, social and economic changes would only stand to his credit. Aloni asserted that the coalition between SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in the Histadrut would be lasting and durable, and presented no problems. MK Ya'aqov Shamay, head of the Likud list, congratulated Hayim Ramon on his achievement. Shamay noted, however, that this did not constitute a political upheaval in the Histadrut because Hayim Ramon was still a member of the Labor party.
