"We cannot look indifferently at how our economy has been deteriorating," Sakalas said. The Social Democratic faction who initiated the motion of non- confidence blame the government for failing to stabilize the national economy or "to make the life of Lithuanian people easier." However, the LSDP says that the main motive for no confidence to the Cabinet of the governing Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDLP), is the failure to carry out the commitments the party took on in the pre-election period last June. "Then it /LSDP election program/ was the best basis for reforming the Lithuanian economy," said the chairman of the LSDP faction. "The left-wing government has fallen short of coming up with an industry restructuring programme foreseeing the directions of its development; the best ways of using energy resources, scientific and labor potential; and sales on foreign and domestic markets," said Sakalas. 85 percent of foreign loans assigned to Lithuania was used by the government for consumer purposes. Each Lithuanian citizen owes foreign creditors $120 which were "eaten up instead of investing," according to the LSDP lawmaker. In the sphere of agriculture the government has failed to coordinate the production of farmers and food-processing industries, Sakalas said. He termed the tax and budget policy as "being badly implemented. Heavy taxes burden people who live merely on their salaries, while no indexing of budgetary expenditure is carried out and inflation rates are not taken into account." The Social Democratic MP stated that the Slezevicius-led government has also neglected its pledge to set equal salaries for state-employed specialists with equal qualifications. "Why are teachers, physicians, and culture workers paid 2 to 3 times less than employees in the energy system?," Sakalas said. The government missed the most favorable moment for indexing people's savings devaluated by inflation -- this should have been done while introducing the national currency, according to the chairman of the LSDP. The only consequences of the Slezevicius-led government is a decrease in the Gross Domestic Product, industrial production, and construction of flats by 35, 46 and 38 percent, respectively, during the year 1993, Sakalas said. The economy has failed to be stabilized, the savings of people are further being devaluated by the ever-widening gab between prices and interest rates. "The standard of living has declined, social stratification has been on the rise dramatically, while no stabilization was reached in either the economic or social developments," Sakalas pointed out. The head of the Social Democratic Party noted that the curbing of inflation processes "does not guarantee economic stability as always stressed by the prime minister." After the statements of the Social Democratic faction, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, who is also chairman of the LDLP, answered question put forward by members of parliament.
