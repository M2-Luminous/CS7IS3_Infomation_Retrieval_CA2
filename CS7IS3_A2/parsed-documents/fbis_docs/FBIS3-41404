A senior Avon and Somerset officer said that although the purer form was available from a number of sources at street level, it was thought that further up the drug-dealing chain one or two individuals were responsible for distribution. He said; "We have good intelligence linking us to one or two names and one or two addresses. We know these dealers have been particularly active in recent months.'' "I cannot give too much away, but it is safe to say there is an ongoing operation to stop them." Recent high-profile police activity in the area has produced 40 arrests in 17 days and raids on a number of drug dens. In the latest raid last Thursday evening, seven people were arrested and released on police bail. Forensic scientists are analysing 20 "wraps" of a substance found during the raid at a high rise flat, on an estate on the outskirts of Bristol. The police source said officers were liaising with other forces. There are also links with Customs aimed at identifying the source of the drug. The heroin trade in the city is largely handled by white dealers--crack is considered a black drug--but further up the heroin chain, there is believed to be an Asian connection. In Bristol heroin is in plentiful supply, despite police efforts. The wholesale street price has dropped by 50 per cent, from £32,000 a kilo to £21,000. A fix can be had for £10. Heroin as pure as 80 per cent has been recovered in the Avon and Somerset force area in recent months. Three deaths have already been confirmed as involving a form of the drug which has been analysed as being 63 per cent heroin, rather than the usual 40 per cent. The death of a 17-year-old, Ross Hamblin, as well as four deaths last year, is also likely to be linked to the purer heroin. There are 450 registered addicts in the Bristol area, but a recent survey has shown the true figure of addicts to be around 1,500. Casual users will push the number still higher.
