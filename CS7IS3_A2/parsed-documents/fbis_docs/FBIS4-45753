The government will send six experts through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in response to a request from the Government of Ecuador, the ministry said. The group, comprised of experts on birds, reptiles and botanical ecology, will visit Isabela Island, the largest of the Galapagos group, to survey the effects on wildlife of the prolonged forest fire that has been burning since April 12, it said. The experts will also offer advice to Ecuador's presidential panel for disaster prevention on measures to protect and increase reproduction of wildlife, to repair damage, and on monitoring the natural environment, the ministry said. The forest fire on the 460,000-hectare Isabela Island has not yet been completely extinguished. As of April 26, some 10,000 hectares had been devastated by the fire, it said. Wildlife peculiar to the Galapagos Islands, such as iguanas and giant tortoises, is endangered by the fire. The island's ecosystem is also seriously affected, the ministry said.
