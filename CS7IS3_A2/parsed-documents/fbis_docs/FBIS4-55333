This complicated operation, which certainly will not take place without some radical cuts, and thus also some scars on the face of the Air Force and PVO, is the consequence of the changed strategic conditions and the real reduction of resources earmarked for the Army. All the changes that the Air Force and the PVO are currently undergoing are not the last ones. Already in existence are plans for the look of the department in about 1995, and concepts for the look of the Czech Air Force in the next century are also known. This was discussed at a news conference by Pavel Strubl, Air Force inspector and PVO general. New Command System One of the substantive changes is the creation of a three-step system of command. Basically it is composed of the staff of the Air Force and the PVO of the Army of the Czech Republic [ACR], which handles not only organization and command, but also formulates the concept and plans for the future development of the department. Established as operational steps, designed primarily for the immediate command of the units, were the 3d Tactical Air Corps with its command headquarters in Hradec Kralove, and the 4th PVO Corps (Stara Boleslav). The active component is represented by the Air Force squadrons and PVO units. Among the largest in the Air Force is the 31st Tactical Air Force Base (ZTL) in Caslav, the 32d ZTL base in Namest nad Oslavou, the 33d Helicopter Base in Prerov, and the 34th Air Force Training Base in Pardubice. The PVO corps is composed of the 4th Interceptor Aircraft base in Ceske Budejovice and the antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments located in Drnov, Brno, Ostrava, Rozmital pod Tremsinem, Kromeriz, and Strakonice. Changes in the Air Force On the basis of analyses and after weighing the human, financial, and material possibilities, the General Staff worked out a concept for the development of the Air Force and the PVO up to the year 2005. In the case of the Air Force, it is assumed that this year there will be a radical reduction in aircraft inventory, and 77 fighter planes, 11 combat helicopters, 20 trainers, 10 transport and special planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be taken out of commission. Altogether, this will reduce the aircraft inventory by a full 30.6 percent! Next year the Air Force will be located at six airfields, and subsequently will have five permanent airfields at its disposal. The total number of 54 existing airfields will be reduced to 29. In addition to the five permanent ones, seven airfields will be occupied by airport administrations, nine airfields will have paved runways, and eight will have grassy surfaces. The plans also include changes in the equipment of the Air Force. Two bases, those in Caslav and Namest, would have subsonic planes L-159 of Czech manufacture and supersonic multipurpose planes. In connection with this we learned that as of this year there are no more plans to operate MiG-29's, or to make any further purchases of Russian equipment. The multipurpose supersonic plane is definitely going to be a plane of Western manufacture. But it is premature to talk about the precise type of plane. The air transport base (Praha-Kbely) would be equiped with large-capacity long-range jets to provide passenger service for government officials, and with mid-range planes (for example, Hercules) designed to transport people, materiel, and paratroopers, including the rapid deployment brigade. Also available would be small-capacity mid-range planes (for example, L-610). The Prerov base, in addition to the helicopters, would be home to propeller planes Z-142, subsonic L-39's, and L-159's. The modernization of the air force will begin this year with the purchase of Z-142's. Future of the PVO Basic changes will take place above all in the combat and operational use of the signal, antiaircraft missile, and interceptor aircraft units. First of all, positional defense of installations will be abolished and replaced by defense of important regions, with the possibility of concentrating forces in the main operational direction. There will be not only organizational changes in the PVO, but also reductions in the number of people and garrisons and an overall reduction in the cost of operations. The readiness system of the Czech Republic will thereafter be secured only by the signal corps and the interceptor aircraft units. The current equipment of the PVO should serve until the year 2010, the equipment of the signal corps until the year 1998.
