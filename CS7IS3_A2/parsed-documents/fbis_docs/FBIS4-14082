He said it is evident that while talking about dialogue, Indian authorities are intent to repress by force the legitimate struggle of Kashmiri people. The spokesman expressed the hope that the Muslim ambassadors visiting Indian-held Kashmir would report an objective evaluation of the situation to their respective governments and ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] secretary general, so that the Muslim world would have better knowledge of the atrocities being perpetrated by the Indian forces in the held valley. The spokesman hoped that the ambassadors will be allowed free access to visit all parts of the held valley, including the sites of recent massacres in Sopor and Bijbiara, and to meet the Kashmiri leaders, including those under detention. However, the spokesman said according to our information, unfortunately, it appears that once again this visit will be a conducted tour.
