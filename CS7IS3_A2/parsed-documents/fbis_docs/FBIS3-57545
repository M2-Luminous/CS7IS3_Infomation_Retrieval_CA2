"This approach is the only chance for Georgia to preserve its integrity and independence," the council said in an appeal to Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Wednesday. The Georgian leadership should admit that for various subjective reasons the social, economic, financial and credit policy of the government has failed. The severance of traditional ties caused by the sweeping disintegration of the Soviet Union has resulted in the collapse of whole industries in the republic, the appeal said. Georgian Social Democrats disagree with the position of political organisations which oppose the rapprochement with Russia, "the only potential country whose powerful industry makes it a desired partner not only for us, but for more developed countries as well," the appeal said.
