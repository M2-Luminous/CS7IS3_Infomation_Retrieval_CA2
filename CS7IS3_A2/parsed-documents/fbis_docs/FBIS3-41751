According to Miss Solovyeva, an examination of residents from the village of Muchlyumovo located on the river Techa, 78 km downstream from the radioactive waste discharge from the Mayak Scientific Production Association, revealed elements in the chromosomes of certain children which belong neither to the father nor to the mother. In the physicians' opinion, this is a result of mutation changes in the organism. Furthermore, the residents of Muchlyumovo display impairments in their organism which are typical only of this inhabited locality. Thus, e.g., the ailments not detected in other regions include constant dizziness, numbness in the body and limbs, nose and gum bleeding, and gastrointestinal tract disorders. In attempts to treat the residents of Muchlyumovo, children in particular respond inadequately to drugs. Moreover, 33 cases of balding have been recorded among children in recent years, some of them involving total baldness, according to the Postfaktum Agency.
