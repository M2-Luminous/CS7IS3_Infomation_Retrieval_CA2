Mr Mandela was speaking after a meeting with President F W de Klerk at the Union Buildings, Pretoria, to discuss indemnity for those who committed political crimes and the franchise for prisoners. The ANC wanted the security services to be committed to their duties without fear of facing prosecutions for political crimes after the elections, he added. Mr Mandela said he and Mr de Klerk also exchanged views on prisoners being allowed to vote. Mr de Klerk said on Thursday he would probably decide on the issue on Friday. Mr Mandela said: "We are more or less looking at the problem from the same angle."
