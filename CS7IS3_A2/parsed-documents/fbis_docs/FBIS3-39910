The young people involved in it will work in nontrading sectors for a monthly wage of about 15,000 francs [BFr]. The service will last a minimum of six months, a maximum of 12 months, and a maximum of 24 months for foreign service. That is the main thrust of the project set up by Defense Minister Leo Delcroix that was presented Tuesday [22 February] to the press. Voluntary community service (SVC), which is to succeed the defunct obligatory military service, covers a period during which a person voluntarily provides services aimed at improving life in society via a particular institution or organization. In principle, SVC will be open to everyone, men and women, Belgians and non-Belgians, whether able-bodied or handicapped, without any restriction on age. Initially, however, it will be limited to young people between the ages of 18 to 25. SVC may, for example, be served in the health and welfare sector, the sociocultural sector, in education and aid to young people, in the environment or heritage conservation sector, security at federal, regional, or local level, or in development cooperation. It will still be possible for any candidates who so desire to undertake voluntary military service. Such candidates may, for example, participate in the armed defense of the territory, even though -- during crisis periods -- they will not be sent outside the national territory. "This is neither a third labor channel nor a special, temporary framework," Delcroix stressed. "Nor do we intend to use this project to usurp the jobs which have devolved upon professional labor." Methods SVC candidates will enjoy a special contract. They will be guaranteed social security protection during their service. Thus, this period of service will be taken into account when calculating pensions; it will count as a waiting period for unemployment; family benefit will be maintained during service up to the age of 25 years; and the level of social protection (health/disability insurance) will be maintained. Candidates will receive a nontaxable allowance of around BFr15,000 per month and will have two holidays per month. At present it is impossible to put forward a budget estimate of the total cots of SVC in so far as the budget will depend on the number of volunteers, Minister Delcroix stressed. The financial breakdown of this cost could be as follows: The authority concerned (regional or federal department) will pay a portion of the BFr15,000 allowance, as well as social benefits, and administrative costs. The institution or organization which uses a volunteer will pay a fixed amount per person per month, as well as insurance premiums for the volunteers involved and any costs for training, which it will provide itself. In so far as the regions and communities have broad powers in the areas for which the SVC would apply, a consensus would have to be reached within the negotiation committee, Delcroix explained. The organization of the system would be centralized among the departments of the prime minister, which would have a coordination unit guaranteeing relations between national departments, the communities, and the regions. The project is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers before the Easter vacation. Negotiations with the communities and regions could be organized before 1 August 1994, the project could be submitted to Parliament at the end of the year, and the SVC could become a reality in 1995.
