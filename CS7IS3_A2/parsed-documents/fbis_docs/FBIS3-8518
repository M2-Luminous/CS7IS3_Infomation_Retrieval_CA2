The Bosnian Serbs Thursday again prevented one 10-truck convoy carrying 92 tons of food from entering the northern town, forcing the UNHCR to divert it to Zenica, in central Bosnia. Kessler said the UNHCR's head of operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Larry Hollingworth, who accompanied the convoy, was splitting it into two, one for Maglaj itself and one for the town of Tesanj, 15 kilometres (10 miles) west. The two towns are in the Maglaj pocket, containing some 130,000 people who have been under siege by the Serbs since last June. They are only supplied by international air drops and latest reports speak of desperate conditions in the area.
