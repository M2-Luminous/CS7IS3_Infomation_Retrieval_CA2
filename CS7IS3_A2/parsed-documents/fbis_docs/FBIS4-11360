Cristiani has promised to get to the bottom of this problem by disbanding the gangs, which, according to certain sectors of the nation, operate a vast network in Central America. It appears the administration that will assume power in May will inherit one of the country's most violent social problems: organized criminal gangs. On 20 April, Cristiani acknowledged the existence of those groups, and he said efforts are being made to eliminate them; no mention was made, however, of what had been achieved so far. [Begin Cristiani recording] Besides these armed groups, we have the problem of car thefts, which is highly organized. We have been painstakingly following up on the car theft problem. Drug trafficking is another organized crime that has not reached the levels observed in other places. [end recording] During the news conference, the president also mentioned the status of compliance with the peace agreements, which, according to Cristiani, has made progress. According to the president, his government is making the effort to clear his desk and resolve any pending issues. [Begin Cristiani recording] As of now, some pending issues concern certain decisions on the deployment of the National Civilian Police and the demobilization of the National Police. We hope that before 31 May, this issue will also be resolved, so that only the specifics, the concept of operations, will be left. [end recording] Cristiani will leave the Presidency in the coming months, perhaps leaving behind the halfway completed issue of land transfers, an agreement which will be passed to the future president.
