A spokeswoman for the EC's executive European Commission said that British Airways criticism about allegedly illegal state aid for state-owned Air France had been made in response to an existing EC inquiry. She contradicted reports that British Airways had lodged a new complaint. The privately-owned British Airways called on the Commission Wednesday to demand that Air France return a capital injection of 1.5 billion francs (253 million dollars) extended in the form of a bond issue and other securities. The EC's executive had already begun a probe of the injection last November on the grounds that it might contravene regulations against state aid which distorted competition and would not be granted by private investors. Air France has maintained that the bonds were taken up under normal market conditions, largely by an affiliate of the Caisse des depots et des consignations (CDC), a state-owned institution. British Airways has been campaigning against further government aid for loss-making state-owned European airlines.
