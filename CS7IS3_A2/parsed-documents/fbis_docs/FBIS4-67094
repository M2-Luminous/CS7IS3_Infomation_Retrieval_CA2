FBIS4-67094 "jptdd020__l94078" JPRS-TDD-94-020-L JPRS Narcotics 6 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Parliamentarian Faces U.S Charges of Marijuana Smuggling Parliamentarian Faces U.S Charges of Marijuana Smuggling Parliamentary Committee Prepared To Oust Accused Deputy BK0605080994 Bangkok THE NATION in English 6 May 94 pp A1, A4 BK0605080994 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The House committee overseeing MPs' conduct yesterday vowed to push for the ouster of Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong if he failed to clear himself of charges that he was involved in smuggling marijuana into the United States. The House committee on parliamentary affairs plans to hold a meeting on Thanong next Tuesday but has tried unsuccessfully to contact the MP, whose testimony is essential before the panel can come to a decision. Committee chairman Charoen Khanthawong said if the panel concluded that Thanong had damaged Parliament's reputation it would campaign for his ouster as MP. "If we consider him to be guilty, the House committee will invoke article 93 to oust him," said Charoen. Under article 93 of the Constitution an MP who tarnishes the reputation of Parliament can be ousted by a three-quarters majority vote, or 270 of the 360 members of the House. The motion would require the support of at least one-third of House or 120 members, before it could be submitted. Thanong has been accused of conspiring to smuggle more than 45 tonnes of marijuana into the United States, and his American assets have been frozen by a California court. "I think Thanong should resign to clear up all problems. An MP has previously resigned from the House after he being found to be involved in corruption," Charoen (Democratic-Bangkok) said. Charoen said he had called an urgent committee meeting on Tuesday at Parliament to discuss the matter and there would be an opportunity for Thanong to make an explanation. "I'm not so sure Thanong will show up. The committee has been unable to contact him," the committee chairman said. He said if Thanong was found guilty MPs could ask the House of Representatives to consider the matter promptly, without having to wait for the House committee to submit a motion. Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina said before leaving for the United States yesterday that Thailand may permit Thanong's extradition to the US for trial. Senior Thai officials said Washington had not yet requested Thanong's extradition. Den was invited to the US by the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] to discuss antidrug trafficking measures before Thanong's case was publicized. He told reporters at Don Muang Airport the DEA will give him all information relating to Thanong's case. He was uncertain whether US authorities had issued an arrest warrant for Thanong's extradition. Although Thailand has an extradition agreement with the United States, part of the agreement states that Thai authorities can take legal action against a suspect arrested here, Pol. Gen. Prathin said. The opposition Chat Thai Party has played down Thanong's case as a "personal affair", but indicated it would expel him if presented with solid evidence. Chat Thai MP Newin Chitchop said his party would definitely sack Thanong if he was found guilty. He admitted that press reports about Thanong affected the party's image. "However, I think this is a personal matter and has nothing to do with the party. Actually, there are good and bad people in every institution," Newin said. Chongchai Thiangtham (Chat Thai-Suphan Buri) yesterday accused government MPs of releasing the news to the public in a bid to discredit the opposition. "This is an old issue that we have known of for a long time. But I don't know why it is publicized now," he said. "I think this is similar to the previous case when they wanted to discredit Narong," he said. US drug allegations forced Narong Wongwan, a Chat Thai Party adviser to withdraw his premiership candidacy in March 1992. Narong strongly denied the accusations. Chongchai said Thanong should explain himself to the public as soon as possible. He said Thanong had not contacted the party since the charges against him were made public. Nor had the party been able to contact him because he had many houses in Nakhon Panom, Chiang Rai and Phatthaya and other places, he added. Suwat Liptaphanlop, secretary-general of the Chat Phatthana Party, said the charges against Thanong were unlikely to affect the opposition's unity because it was a personal matter. However, if Thanong was found guilty the Parliament's image would suffer. The opposition would discuss the issue next week, he said. Senior government officials yesterday denied claims the government was just drumming up a previously unattended issue to discredit the opposition which is planning to launch a censure offensive against the Chuan administration. "We never have such an idea (using Thanong's case to discredit the opposition) in our head," said Democrat Secretary-General Sanan Khachonprasat. Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, a Democrat MP, said the government would "never become involved in any political ploy". But he added all MPs should help to protect the reputation of the House and all political parties should see to it that their members observe ethical principles. Pol. Maj. Gen Chaowalit Yotmani, chief of the Office of Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], confirmed that Thanong's case was not being used as a political tool. "If the opposition wants the ONCB to clarify the issue, we are willing to do so," he said. Kraisak Chunhawan said Thanong must be arrested if police have enough evidence to back charges against him.
