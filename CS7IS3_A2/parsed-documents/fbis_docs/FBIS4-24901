This is what General Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed while conducting investigations and studies of units and academies of the armed forces garrisoned in Henan. From 2 to 21 May, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen, making light of hardships, went deep into the leading organs, academies, and training grounds of companies of the armed forces garrisoned in Henan and carried out extensive investigations and studies on questions centering on how to improve the quality of the contingent of cadres and how to deepen reform of military training. After fully affirming the achievements in training reform made by the units he visited, he pointed out: To do a good job in training reform, we must use as guidance Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army building during the new period. Mao Zedong's military thinking has summed up the experience of how our poorly equipped armed forces defeated their much better equipped enemy over several decades and has crystalized the collective wisdom of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army building in the new period have inherited and developed Mao Zedong's military thinking and are the theoretical basis for guiding the building and reform of the armed forces. So long as we seriously study them and arm our brains with them, we will be able to make new breakthroughs in training reform. In the course of conducing investigations and studies, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen stressed from a strategic plane the extreme importance of having our eyes on the future, giving special attention to properly grasping the training of cadres, and training comprehensively qualified personnel in deepening training reform, and increasing the combat power of the armed forces. He said: In training cadres, we should focus on improving quality in four aspects. The first is to improve political quality. Study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and education on world outlook should be regarded as basic lessons so that our cadres will really heed what the party says and will have lofty communist ideals. The second is to improve the military quality. They should be proficient in tactics and strategies and should master the skills of training the armed forces in times of peace and the skills of directing battles in times of war. The third is to improve the quality of science and culture. A modern war is fought under conditions of high technology. Without knowledge of science and culture, it is difficult to study and control a war. Besides, at a time when socialist modernization is developing rapidly, it will be very difficult for cadres transferred from the armed forces to adapt themselves to civilian posts if they do not have knowledge of science and culture. The fourth is to improve the quality of management. Importance should be attached to training cadres' about the actual ability to lead troops so that they can constantly improve the level of management in the armed forces. Vice Chairman Zhang showed great concern for building academies. On his way, he cordially visited teaching staff at all of the academies; asked in detail about ideology, studies, and the lives of the students; and discussed with them how to further strengthen the building of academies. He said: We should mainly depend on academies in training cadres. Training given in academies should enable the fine traditions of the armed forces to strike roots in the brains of the students, to develop in the armed forces, and to maintain them there forever. We should strive to narrow the gap between training in the academies and the needs of the armed forces and should earnestly build academies into important bases for training cadres. At present, many comrades have never taken part in a war. It is difficult to master the real skills of commanding war operations through exercises and maneuvers based on the imagination. How should this problem be solved? Vice Chairman Zhang said: The best way is to study examples of battles fought by our armed forces. We should, through such studies, increase our understanding of Mao Zedong's military thinking, solve the problem of how cadres without experience of war can acquire skills in fighting battles, and solve the problem of establishing confidence to darer to fight and to win. In studying examples of battles, we should first study examples of battles fought by our own armed forces before we study those fought by other armed forces, including examples of battles fought by foreign armed forces. On the basis of this, we should study new measures to cope with a modern war fought under changed and developed conditions. Making light of rugged mountain paths and a high temperature of 34 degrees centigrade, Vice Chairman Zhang stooped and entered tents as hot as food steamers to cordially visit soldiers of units which were garrisoning and carrying out exercises in the open country. He told leaders present that they should provide good food for the fighters because conditions of garrisoning and carrying out exercises in open country were very tough. He also looked with great interest at the newly upgraded training equipment used by the armed forces and their academies. He repeatedly emphasized: The objective of carrying out reform of training must be clear and we should not practice formalism. We should properly integrate men with weapons and should strive to increase the actual effects of training. At the end of his investigations and studies, Vice Chairman Zhang also made an important speech on deepening study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for 100 years, on implementing the "Program for Building Grass-Roots Army Units" in order to comprehensively strengthen the building of grass-roots army units, on upholding the principle of supporting militia activities with production and doing both production and militia duties and making great efforts to promote the building of militia and reserve forces, and on further improving leadership style and properly carrying out work in various aspects.
