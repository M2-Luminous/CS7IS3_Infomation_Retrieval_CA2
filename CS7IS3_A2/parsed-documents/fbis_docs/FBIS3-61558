A. Brodskaya and O. U. Gapurova; UDC 541.15:546.7] [Abstract] A [.sup]188[/]W-[.sup]188[/]Re generator is based on the separation of rhenium-188 radionucleides from wolfram-188 formed by irradiation of wolfram-186. Basic problems in obtaining this generator are the accumulation of a parent wolfram-188 radionucleide having sufficient specific activity, dissolution of a wolfram target and conversion to an insoluble matrix by selection of a sorbent and sorbent form of wolfram, determining the sorption conditions, charging the generator column with radioactive wolfram, and elution of rhenium-188 with maximum bulk activity and high radionucleidic and chemical purity of the end radionucleide. In the present work a study was made of radiochemical fundamentals of this generator. Possibilities for accumulation of a parent radionucleide of wolfram-188 of high specific activity were determined. Optimum conditions were found for dissolution of wolfram targets from various materials (oxide, metal, acids) and converting them into a sorpable form. Rules governing the sorption of wolfram and rhenium on several sorbents were studied and the conditions for maximum and minimum sorption of both metals were determined. The conditions for charging generator columns with radioactive wolfram and the elution of highly active rhenium-188 were worked out. Aluminum oxide was used as sorbent and a sodium chloride salt solution was used as an eluent. Several series of generators with activities to 4 GBk were prepared and studied.
