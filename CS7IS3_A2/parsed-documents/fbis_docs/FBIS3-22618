The cancer death rate is higher in the urban areas than in rural areas. In the category of people aged 33-60, the so-called category of active [working] persons, 29 percent of the deaths among females are caused by cancer, whereas the same figure among men is merely 22 percent. Among females, the most frequent cases of cancer are breast cancer, followed by uterine and stomach cancer. Among males, the list is topped by lung and bronchial cancer, followed by stomach and prostate cancer. The category of active persons is most affected by cancer (50 percent of the cases belong to that category), followed by the group of persons aged 60- 65 (45 percent), whereas the least affected is the group aged 0-33 (5 percent.) The number of cancer cases among children has increased lately: In 1993, 1,071 such cases had to be treated, compared to 800 in 1992.
