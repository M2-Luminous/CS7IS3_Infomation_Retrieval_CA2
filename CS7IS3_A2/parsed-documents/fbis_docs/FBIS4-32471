According to the report, the Slovak Office for Normalization, Metrology, and Testing issued a decree on 21 June, under which, with effect from 1 July, importers of fruit and vegetables will no longer have to produce a quality certificate issued by the Slovak testing authority. The above decision is also the subject of a 650-word Stefan Mistrik commentary, entitled "Inadmissible Concession," in Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 22 June on pages 1 and 4. The NARODNA OBRODA report notes that, as of 1 July, Slovakia will recognize certificates issued by the OECD, the European Union [EU], or the "certification authority" accredited in the country from which the goods come. The Slovaks reportedly took this "accommodating step" on the basis of a protocol on the recognition of OECD certificates that was signed by Minister of Agriculture Koncos and the EU "at the beginning of June." NARODNA OBRODA notes that the previous requirement for a Slovak certificate "had greatly complicated and, as a result, drastically limited imports of fruit and vegetables, including those that do not grow in Slovakia or of which there is shortage." According to the paper, importers welcome the new decree as a "step that will move us closer to the practices used in fruit and vegetable trade in the world." Stefan Mistrik opens the commentary by saying: "The Slovak agricultural public has the right to be enraged. On 10 June 1994, Minister of Agriculture Pavol Koncos yielded to the European Union commissioner during talks on the recognition of OECD and EU states' certificates for imports of selected types of fruit and vegetables. This is an inadmissible concession, whose consequences for the Slovak economy are scarcely calculable today. We have opened wide the doors of the Slovak agricultural market, creating conditions for its inundation with imported vegetables and fruit." According to Mistrik, OECD and EU certificates for the following items will be recognized as of 1 July: potatoes, tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, bananas, citrus fruit, grapes, watermelons and cantaloupes, apples, pears, apricots, peaches, cherries, as well as nuts and frozen fruit. According to Mistrik, this measure will put Slovak growers at a disadvantage because their produce will still have to meet strict domestic norms. Because Minister Koncos "yielded to the pressure of EU commissioners," Mistrik continues, "the Czechs can laugh because they have now achieved what they did not achieve in direct talks with Slovakia only a few weeks ago. What they wanted has been accomplished for them by EU commissioners." Besides expressing concern at the "millions of korunas of which Slovak farmers will be deprived" as a result of the new decree, Mistrik is also worried about its impact on citizens' health: "The question arises about the place of the Slovak citizen in all this. His government does not protect his health. Last year our inspection authorities ascertained that our market is flooded with food that is damaging to health. In some cases, substandard quality goods made up 70 percent of the imported volume."
