Stunned by the unexpected end of the Yi Hoe-chang cabinet after only 128 days, top government and ruling party officials awaited follow-up measures by President Kim Yong-sam. Kim has already designated deputy prime minister and head of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok as his new prime minister after accepting Yi Hoe-chang's resignation. The president must now fill the NUB post and possibly reshuffle a number of cabinet ministers. Keen public interest is focusing on who will replace Yi Yong-tok at the NUB. The first name mentioned by many analysts is Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong, who is widely recognized as an expert on North Korean affairs. In addition to this expertise, Pak is a good bet for the deputy premiership given his stature at Chongwadae [presidential office] and within the ruling circle. A spate of misjudgements, confusion and questionable decisions has plagued diplomatic and national security policy since the inauguration of the Kim administration in February last year. Pak is among the very few deemed able to straighten out the situation as he has stayed close to Kim Yong-sam over the past 14 months. He has not only assisted the president on unification and other inter-Korean problems but also served as "a bridge" among the various ministries. In this regard, Pak is highly qualified for the job of deputy premier and head of the National Unification Board, some senior officials at the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] believe. Others in the DLP, however, say that the current situation was created by the prime minister's resignation alone, and therefore replacing Yi Hoe-chang should be enough. The president should not change his chief secretary, they add. Along with Pak Kwan-yong's immediate future, attention is also centering on the scope and timing of the cabinet reshuffle. A lot depends on whether Pak remains at Chongwadae, however. If the chief presidential secretary stays on, many observers believe that two or three ministers, including the deputy premier, will be changed. Speculation has it that Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui could take over the NUB portfolio. In that event, there is a slight chance that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and the senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs, Chong Chae-uk, who have both contributed to confusion in the government's foreign and North Korea policy, could be replaced. One senior ruling party official pointed out that since the current cabinet was formed only five months ago, the president will probably just patch it up a bit. If Yi Yong-tok is quickly approved as prime minister by the National Assembly on Monday, Kim is expected to present his credentials on the same day and go right to work on a limited cabinet shake-up, he said. But since the Democratic Party has already said it will resist Yi Yong-tok's appointment, it is difficult to speculate what kind of "card" President Kim might use to overcome such opposition, sources say. If parliamentary approval of the new prime minister is delayed, the scope of the cabinet reshuffle will likely increase, they said.
