And This Has the Region's Support. Those Are the Results of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's Visits to Yerevan, Tbilisi, and Baku"] [Text] How right the wise man was who gave the world many centuries ago this brief but profoundly meaningful phrase: Everything is relative. He may not have thought then that a thousand years later people would use it to assess their past, weigh up their present, and look to the future. Thanks be to the wise man.... In spring 1993 Pavel Grachev inspected the 145th Motorized Rifle Division of the Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus and the Gudauta airborne troops. It was then that he told journalists who besieged him in Batumi that Russia has always had and will continue to have national interests in the Transcaucasus. What a hullabaloo that caused.... This elicited an extremely irritable reaction from the Transcaucasian capitals. What hasn't the Russian military minister been accused of! Imperial thinking, aggressiveness, an unwarranted incursion into lofty politics.... But Pavel Grachev did not counter the insults. He kept himself in check. Since he realized that time and events would provide the best commentary. A year has elapsed. And the Transcaucasian states, our former Union brothers, have passed this year in an amazingly similar fashion. Azerbaijan and Armenia have exhausted one another in the war in Karabakh. Georgia has proudly and unsuccessfully tried with weapon in hand to get back Abkhazia. Ostentatiously turning their backs on Russia the heads of states sought patrons elsewhere. It is needless to say blasphemous to compare diplomacy to soccer, but I will run that risk: Fortunes fluctuated during the game, but the ball is round, as they say. And the result is what counts. There were no sponsors to be found in the direct sense of the word. Cautious advice was provided. And a little help. Aircraft carrying humanitarian aid have indeed begun to be heard in the skies of the Transcaucasus, but nothing more. People in the capitals of the Transcaucasus have probably begun to realize that turning their backs on Russia is tantamount to fouling their own nest and flying in the face of history [metit pod katok istorii]. And, regrettably enough, one once again has to realize that the "notorious" wheel of history cannot be stopped. And that Russia does indeed have and will continue to have its interests in the Trancaucasus. And there where people have always spoken ironically of Pavel Grachev's diplomatic efforts and statements, he has suddenly begun to be eulogized and his visits to each of the capitals have begun and ended with an honor guard and the thunder of a military band. And it suddenly became clear amid this thunder that not only do Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus really exist, but the Transcaucasus states themselves are committed to ensuring that the interests of Russia and the Transcaucasus do not wane.... The Russian defense minister's visit to the Transcaucasus lasted over three days. In Yerevan Pavel Grachev saw that the Armenian leadership has no false illusions as to the nature, scale, and intensity of the development of Russian-Armenian relations in the military sphere. In their view, tackling the question of creating some kind of coalition organ for the whole Transcaucasus is a thing of the future. The previous accord on retaining the two base components of the Russian Army as defined and envisaged by the relevant provisions of the interstate agreements and the norms of international law, on increasing the number of personnel, and giving Russian troops in the republic greater mobility while tangibly strengthening Air Force and Air Defense Force facilities was reaffirmed. Tbilisi also clearly manifested a desire to change the Russian troops' status to the base principle taking as a foundation for this the Russian troops' current stationing locations. The sides agreed to set up groups of experts to draft decisions on this matter. Pavel Grachev's "drop" into Gudauta for a few hours and his meeting there with Abkhazia's head, Vladislav Ardzinba, was due to his desire to clarify the whole problem of bringing Russian peacemakers into the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. That seems to have been done and the sides -- Georgian and Abkhazian -- are satisfied. So the peoples are waiting for the peacekeepers. In Baku people were waiting for Pavel Grachev to confirm his intentions regarding the subsequent development of military cooperation. In particular, the Azerbaijanis displayed interest in the creation of a common air defense system with Russia. Talks on the Russian early warning station can also be considered successful: The station will operate; Azerbaijan also has an interest in that. As for the Karabakh conflict, Geydar Aliyev could not say anything more than that he is ready to observe the cease-fire and so the question of bringing Russian peacemakers into the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone remains open. Those are the results of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit to the Transcaucasus. Despite the lack of concrete accords in Baku, the results can be considered successful. The current round of military diplomacy strengthens Russia's positions in the Transcaucasus. So are we returning to the Transcaucasus? Perhaps we have not even left? At least we have not left the hearts and minds of the peoples.
