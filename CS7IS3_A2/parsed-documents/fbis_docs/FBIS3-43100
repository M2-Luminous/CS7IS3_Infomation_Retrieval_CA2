V. Nazin; UDC62-506.1] [Abstract]An algorithm is examined for adaptive control of a multidimensional linear stochastic plant. This algorithm is based on the usage of recurrent estimates of stochastic approximations with weighted averaging. Of primary interest was the speed with which the quality criterion converges with the optimal operating mode for a closed system. It is shown that the usage of a stochastic approximation algorithm with weighted averaging allows the maximum possible convergence speed to be achieved, if the necessary a priori information is available. The objective of control is to minimize threshold values of the output signal second moment, which is time averaged. The asymptotic properties in the sequence of estimates and average losses are researched. Conditions are established for asymptotic efficiency of the control algorithm. 29 references.
