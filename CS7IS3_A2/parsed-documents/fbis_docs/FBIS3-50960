The clashes have not stopped, especially near San Cristobal de las Casas. The first signs of an eventual dialogue with the armed groups have emerged. The clashes continued between the Army and the rebels in Los Altos de Chiapas for the eighth consecutive day. The Army has repelled a rebel attack against the Rancho Nuevo Military Barracks near San Cristobal de las Casas. The roads to the areas of conflict remain closed. During the pursuit operations, authorities found a Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] vehicle from which the rebels stole 1.5 tons of dynamite 31 December. The truck was found in Guadalupe Tepeyac, a town thought to be the rebels' stronghold, where it has been confirmed they are still holding captive the former Chiapas State governor, Absalon Castellanos, and approximately 100 social security employees of the town. Thousands of Indians and peasants are fleeing from the areas of conflict to seek refuge in San Cristobal de las Casas, a city being reinforced by the Army. [passage omitted]
