Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made the remark at today's opening of a symposium on the educational thoughts of Deng Xiaoping. He said that the study, publicizing and implementing of the educational thoughts of Deng Xiaoping are also main conditions for party and government leaders at all levels to enhance their competence to exercise leadership over China's modernization drive. The symposium, which was sponsored by the Research Center of Educational Development of the State Education Commission, has the purpose of studying and understanding the educational thoughts of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and discussing how to implement "outlines of educational reform and development in China". In his speech, Vice-Premier Li said that education made up an important part of Deng Xiaoping's theory. In probing into ways for solidifying, developing and building socialism, Deng Xiaoping had treated education as one of strategic issues which will be of vital importance to the overall situation of China's socialist construction and the historical fate of socialism. He had carried out concentrated investigations into it, and had formed educational theories with Chinese characteristics, which had developed into a scientific theoretical basis and powerful ideological weapon for guiding China's educational reform and development. Deng held in his educational theories that we would rather exercise patience on other aspects, or even sacrifice some speed, in order to make a success of educational work. In his theory, he also pays great attention to solving input in education, improving treatment of intellectuals and helping solve practical problems faced by teachers. He added that for an economically underdeveloped country like China, a down-to-earth and unswerving manner should be adopted to solve practical problems and to achieve a fast and healthy development of the country's education.
