Yang, 50, a Shanghai-based dissident and a founder of the Peace Charter movement created last November, was also detained on Friday and then released yesterday morning after receiving a "warning" from authorities. Li Guoping said her husband had been arrested along with another dissident, Li Guotao, who was also a leader in the CHRA. On Friday, he was detained with another leading Shanghai activist, Wang Fuchen. Wang is still being held. Several other dissidents, including veteran democracy activist Xu Liangying, also said by telephone yesterday police had thrown security cordons around their apartments, in examples of official pressure on dissidents during the visit of United States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. To date, police have arrested or detained about 15 activists in the run-up to Mr. Christopher's visit. Mr. Xu, 74, said he was being kept in a state of virtual house arrest, with police not allowing anyone into or out of his home. He was one of seven intellectuals who wrote to government leaders last week demanding the release of political prisoners. He said two policemen had stationed themselves at his door and four more had come to the main entrance of his building yesterday morning to keep friends from visiting him. "When I asked them what they were doing, they said: 'We're protecting intellectuals'," Mr. Xu said. He later tried to leave his apartment in Beijing's university district to pick up a newspaper, but police would not let him out, he said. "I fought with them, and demanded to know what law allowed them to do this," he said. "All they answered was: 'It's orders from higher authority'. " His wife, historian Wang Laidi, said: "They don't allow our friends to come in. They're concerned we'll have contact with Mr. Christopher." Mr. Christopher has said he has no plans to meet dissidents during his trip. Speaking during his hours of freedom, Yang -- Shanghai's most prominent political dissident -- said he had been treated well by police. Police also swarmed around US diplomatic compounds in Beijing yesterday in an attempt of head off any demonstrations during Mr. Christopher's visit. Journalists who tried to see some prominent dissidents on Friday night or yesterday were stopped by police and, in at least three cases, detained for questioning. A Dutch reporter was held for five hours yesterday for attempting to visit Liu Nianchun, the founder of a new labour rights' organisation. Caroline Straathof, of the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, said she and her Chinese translator were taken to a police station in the city's university district. Mr. Liu was one of three dissidents who last week sent government officials an official application to establish a group to look after labour rights in the current economic boom. Straathof said police seized a copy of a document in which Mr. Liu proclaimed the labour federation, along with her notes, tapes and film. They also accused her of "visiting Chinese citizens without permission" and failing to carry her residence permit. Mr. Liu's wife said he left the house on Friday and had not returned. Two other reporters, Nicholas Driver of United Press International and Matthew Forney of Newsweek, were detained near Mr. Liu's house on Friday. They were held for six hours. Other important dissidents have left Beijing in recent days and do not appear likely to return during the U.S. official's visit. They include China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng.
