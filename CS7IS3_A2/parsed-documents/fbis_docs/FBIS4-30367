For its part, the government will closely coordinate with the related sectors under the National Assembly Standing Committee's supervision to quickly promulgate the bylaws so that the newly adopted laws can become effective early. Together with its main duty, that is legislative work, the National Assembly also devoted time to discussing the government report on the implementation of socioeconomic duties in the first six months of 1994 and on measures to accomplish all the socioeconomic duties in 1994. Authorized by the party and state, I recently led our government delegation for an official working visit to the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation. Therefore, I could not attend the National Assembly debate directly. However, since my return, I have received briefings on the debate. All National Assembly deputies expressed their interest in the government report evaluating the socioeconomic development in the first six months and on major issues that need particular management attention in the last six months. The government is really taking the opinions contributed by the deputies into account. It considers these opinions a foundation for its guidelines and operations in the last six months. Now, I would like to further present and emphasize some issues so as to complete the duties for 1994 and to prepare for the following year: 1. The duty to concentrate all efforts on achieving all the socioeconomic targets set forth for 1994. As the government has reported earlier to the National Assembly, 1994 plays an especially important role. This is the year when a new period of socioeconomic development begins in our country. While continuing to take care of our economic, social, and political stabilization, in 1994 we now enjoy the necessary conditions to accelerate socioeconomic development and settle social issues, thus creating foundation for the socioeconomic consolidation and the strengthening of our national defense and security. This can help our country extricate itself from the socioeconomic crisis and enter into a period of stabilized and firm development. The tasks for the last six months of the year are very great. The report presented by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai at the opening session of the National Assembly pointed out six types of difficult problems where concentrated efforts are needed for a resolution. I would like to further emphasize that apart from attaining the various requirements for 1994, the implementation of various tasks in the last six months of this year will also have a great effect on the following year. The implementation of these tasks requires great effort by the various sectors and echelons from the central down to grass-roots levels. In the period ahead, the government will hold meetings with various provincial and city people's committees of all the three regions -- namely, the south, the central highlands, and the north -- to review the problems encountered by various regions. This is to determine more substantive measures with which to resolve the difficult issues now encountered by each region. The government will strive to promptly promulgate various bylaws to provide guidance for the enforcement of the laws already passed by the National Assembly at this session. At the same time, we will also reexamine and continue to supplement and perfect the current system, structure and policies. This will involve a large amount of difficult work. Now, I would like to move on to concrete issues. 2. The state budget, credit sources for infrastructure construction, and inflation. Currently, the state budget, credit, and investment situation is severe. A. State budget. The balancing of the state budget is a pressing issue at present. We must execute following measures: -- We must use all measures to increase state revenue. These measures must be based on the development of our economy. All policies on revenue collection must be fully implemented. We must fight against revenue loss and smuggling. The prices of some goods must be adjusted. Especially, revenues collected from the transfer of the rights on land usage, house sale, and renting of government housing must be channeled to the state budget. -- To conform with the National Assembly resolution, the government has carried out the frugality plan. Now, nearly 50 ministries and central organs and 20 provinces and cities have registered to practice thrift in a common effort to save 2,000 billion dong. The government requests the remaining sectors and localities to quickly establish their long overdue frugality plan. However, it is necessary to stress that the entire revenue and savings from all sectors and localities must be used to compensate overspending in the budget which had already been approved by the National Assembly. The money must not be used for other purposes. Therefore, the current mechanism for the handling of the state budget must be adjusted. All ministries and localities are only allowed to spend according to their approved plans. New expenditure on national defense, security, village and subward cadres, and on people who have rendered meritorious service to the nation must be kept within the reservation limits in their budget plans. B. Infrastructure investment. We need more investment to obtain a high level of economic development, better economic structures, and gradually carry out national industrialization and modernization. It is predicted that investment nationwide will reach about 40,000 billion dong in 1994. Direct foreign investment and private investment may reach the estimated levels, but state investment through the state budget and banking credit is still too little. Therefore, it is necessary to reexamine all infrastructure construction projects. If they have not completed all the building requirements and not ready for the construction, they should be canceled. For projects that are under construction, if it is possible, their investment should be reduced and their work slowed down. New projects, if possible, will also need to be delayed. The procedure for construction, verification, payment, and finalization must be closely controlled. The prime minister has issued Decision No. 92 on the restoration of order in infrastructure construction and on the practice of thrift. He will continue to amend and perfect more documents on construction. It is suggested that the National Assembly deputies, depending on their work areas, organize, motivate, and check the execution of those instructions. Business enterprises will be allowed to issue credit notes and shares and obtain foreign loans according to government regulations to maximize capital resources for construction, especially for the renewal of equipment and technology. The approval of the Law on the Promotion of Domestic Investment will certainly encourage all economic sectors to engage in more business and production investment from 1995. C. Fight against inflation. Despite no major price fluctuations in months, prices in the first five months of 1994 increased by six percent compared to the end of 1993. It is going to be difficult to keep price increases to less than 10 percent for the whole year as we do not allow the price of agricultural products to be decreased to avoid affecting a majority of the peasants. It is necessary to adjust the prices of some materials reasonably and improve the supply and demand relationship. Some commodities suffering from unbalanced supply and demand such as cement, sugar, and cotton will have sudden price changes if they are not handled correctly. The unbalanced state budget and lack of credit sources, if not correctly settled, will cause inflation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve goods production and circulation. At the same time, we must be vigilant in regulating monetary circulation. We must balance supply and demand to keep inflation in single digits and avoid sudden changes to the prices of goods, services, gold, and U.S. dollar exchange rates.
