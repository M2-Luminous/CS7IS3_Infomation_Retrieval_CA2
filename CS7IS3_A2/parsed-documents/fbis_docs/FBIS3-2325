With life-giving spring breezes and rains, our great socialist motherland is full of life and energy. This year is a vital one for China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; a year significant to the people of all nationalities in their efforts to implement the spirit of the 14th party congress and to put into practice all the "resolutions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. It is also the first year since China's economic structural reform entered a new phase of comprehensive promotion and specific breakthroughs. The adoption and implementation of the package of comprehensive reform measures will serve to alleviate many profound contradictions and problems that long have existed in China's national economy and that China always has wanted, but failed to resolve over the past many years. It also will give initial shape to a solid foundation for a socialist market economy structure. Therefore, it is our unshirkable responsibility to act in accordance with the arrangements of the party Central Committee, to support reform with a clear-cut stand, to unremittingly promote reform, and to enthusiastically plunge ourselves into reform. To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we should regard reform as our own duty and be eager to meet the needs of reform. The energetic cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics is created by the billions of the masses themselves. The process of building a socialist market economy structure is, in essence, a process in which the masses of the people create history. Reform is a cause that relies on the masses and benefits the people. Every one of us is the master of reform. Taking reform as our own duty means that we need to fulfill tasks and duties as masters, regard difficulties in reform as our own difficulties, and share weal and woe with reform. Experience gained from reform and opening up over the past 15 years has told us that the extensive support and participation, as well as the conscious creation of the masses of the people are the motive of the constant deepening of reform, and also a basic guarantee for success in reform. Without the support, the wisdom and strength, or the understanding of the masses, we can see no hope of success in our great cause. Reform is an undertaking from which the people can benefit. To achieve its ultimate target, our party has adopted major measures, policies, and principles to suit the development needs of social productive forces, with the aim of bringing benefits to all the people. This is determined by the socialist nature of reform. However, we cannot but see that reform is a readjustment of the original interest structure, as well as a recombination of interest relations among the people. Therefore, during the implementation of a certain policy, it is unavoidable that the benefits enjoyed by the masses living in one location are different from those enjoyed by the masses living in another, that there still remain wide gaps between different regions, and that we have to sacrifice the interests of some for the time being. By no means can we lose sight of the glorious prospects of reform in favor of temporary interests, nor can we sacrifice the future for immediate interests. The shape and shift of things always should be taken with a broadness of view. Only when we integrate immediate interests with long-term ones, and partial interests with the interests of the whole can we always remain confident in reform. To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we must safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee and the government, seek unity of understanding, and coordinate our actions. In a large country like ours with such a vast territory and such a large population, extensive and thoroughgoing revolutionary changes cannot succeed without correct theoretical guidance, powerful spiritual backing, or an authoritative and firm leading core. Having withstood the grim tests of complicated practice over the past couple of years, the leading collective of the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, is a leading nucleus that can be trusted fully by the whole party and the people of all nationalities throughout the country. It is of particular significance in today's reform to firmly safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee, and to seek unity of understanding and action under the leadership of the party Central Committee. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in as early as 1988: "To succeed in reform, we must carry out reform in an orderly way under a correct leadership. What can we achieve under a chaotic situation in which everyone goes his own way?"; "If the party Central Committee and State Council have no authority, the situation will get out of control"; "Macroeconomic management should be reflected by the authority of the central authorities." Comrade Jiang Zemin also stressed in his speech at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee: "Party organizations at all levels should consciously place the interests of the party and country before everything else. They should subject partial interests to overall ones and immediate interests to long-term ones. They should take the overall situation into consideration, ensure the implementation of all policies and principles of the central authorities, and promote a high degree of unity within the whole party -- politically, organizationally, and practically." To safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee and the government, we should implement to the letter the principles, policies, and decisions of the party Central Committee and the State Council, and must never permit the existence of the practice whereby "the higher authorities draw up policies, while the grass-roots levels adopt countermeasures." It is imperative to put into effect all the orders and bans imposed by higher authorities, and no one will be allowed to continue banned practices in disregard of repeated prohibitions. Some leading cadres, on the one hand, are extremely enthusiastic in starting new projects; competing with each other to attain a higher speed; and go in for ostentation, extravagance, and high consumption. On the other hand, they show little interest in improving economic efficiency; practicing thrifty; putting an end to deficits and increasing profits; strengthening management; or concerning themselves over market development, commodity prices, and the livelihood of the masses. On seeing this, one will find it hard to convince oneself that these leading cadres really are doing their bit to safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee. To support reform with a clear-cut stand, we need to make active explorations and have the courage to carry out practice. The establishment of a socialist market economy structure is, in the final analysis, an issue of practice. We need to engage ourselves in practice if we wish to overcome difficulties and resolve problems. We need to study policies, work out measures, sum up experience, and distinguish right from wrong. We should take note of the fact that in carrying out major reforms this year in such sectors as finance and taxation, the monetary [jin rong 6855 5816] industry, investment, and commodity prices, we have gained experience in certain fields, yet we still know very little about others. Facing things totally new to us, we should draw up plans carefully and have the courage to put them into practice, just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Once we determine the direction, we need to have the courage to experiment and to open up new paths." Without the courage to open up new paths or the spirit to carry out practice, we can never take a correct new road, accomplish new undertakings, or bring about the stable progress of reform. At present, we are faced with a favorable historic opportunity to carry out reform and promote development. We now are enjoying sound natural conditions, topographical advantages, and unity and coordination within our own ranks. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, let us unswervingly carry out the party's basic line, firmly seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform and expand opening up, bring about greater development, maintain and stabilize the overall situation, and strive for new victories in the socialist modernization drive!
