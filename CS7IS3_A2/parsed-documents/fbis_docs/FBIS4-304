PAC President Clarence Makwetu said the declaration of the measure had nothing to do with the clamping down on violence in the area. Mr. Makwetu was speaking at the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the PAC in Soweto. [Begin Makwetu recording] The real intention of the emergency is to force the opponents of the African National Congress and the National Party in that region to tow the line. It all goes to show what kind of government we will have should the ANC ever be elected to rule this country. It also goes to show what type of rule we will have should the National Party scrape through with some seats in the proposed cabinet. [end recording]
