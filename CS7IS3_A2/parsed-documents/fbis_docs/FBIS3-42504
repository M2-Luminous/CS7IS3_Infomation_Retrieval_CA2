Gromak under the "Pressing" rubric; place and date not given: "Used Combat Ships Come Under the Hammer" -- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction; questions published in boldface] [Text] The beginning of this year witnessed an auction of obsolete military assets -- one medium-sized warship and three smaller ones. I opened my conversation with Vice-Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first Deputy Commander of the Baltic Fleet, with a question concerning this particular event. [Kravchenko] In line with the decision of the Main Directorate for Material Resources at the Defense Ministry, the Baltic Fleet was allowed to hold a closed auction of outdated equipment -- one medium-sized and three smaller warships. Four firms participated in the auction. The initial bid increased by one-and-a-half times by the end of the auction. The three small ships were purchased by a St. Petersburg firm, which will break them up for scrap. The medium-sized warship was also sold to the St. Petersburg firm. After it is revamped in accordance with the requirements of the register, the medium-sized ship will acquire a second civilian life. [Gromak] Viktor Andreyevich, how will the money that was raised be distributed? [Kravchenko] Sixty percent of the money will be transferred to the Baltic Fleet Command's current account. This share will go toward the construction of military housing, while the remaining 40 percent -- to the Main Directorate for Material Resources at the Defense Ministry. [Gromak] Who was allowed to participate in the auction? [Kravchenko] All those who wished to do so. We had only one condition: To sell the ships on the domestic market alone. [Gromak] Please tell us about the need to sell the fleet's property in the Baltic states, which has been going on for several years now. It is only now that we had the first event, but only as an experiment.... [Kravchenko] We lost two years in selling all our obsolete ships. If the fleet commander had had permission (and there is no shortage of inspection bodies) to market all unnecessary and outdated hardware at prevailing prices for the region, we would have sold everything long ago. At the same time, we would not have requested a nickel from either the government or the Defense Ministry for the construction of housing for the troops and the fleet withdrawn from the Baltic states. Our estimates prove this. Until now, however, the Central Administration for Material Resources has held this issue in its fist, and the fleet has been permitted very little. Only some insignificant deals.... [Gromak] As far as I know, the Main Directorate has its representatives in the Baltic states who engage in the sale of fleet property.... [Kravchenko] Yes, it does. However, the situation in the Baltic states is paradoxical. Riga, Liepaja, Paldiski, Tallinn -- the Baltic Fleet will stay there for only four more months. A special representative for the sale of movable property was appointed by decree of the Russian Defense Minister last year. He arrived in August very eager to work. He promised to sell all the outdated ships in three-months time. Thus far, he has been selling them without success. Several contracts for the sale of certain vessels were concluded last year, but none of the ships were sold. The reason is that the prices determined by the Main Directorate for Material Resources were too high for this region. Now the Lieutenant-Colonel has concluded a deal for the sale of two used surface ships. I do not know, however, whether it will be accomplished. The representative is also negotiating the sale of all obsolete vessels in the Baltic states with a U.S. firm. Time flies, however. The fleet command has prepared a letter to Colonel-General Toporov, deputy Defense Minister, with its proposals and a request to make this process more dynamic....
