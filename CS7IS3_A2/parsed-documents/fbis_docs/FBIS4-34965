Diplomatic delegation heads, military attaches, and other officials of the diplomatic corps accredited in the country were accompanied by Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Nicolas Rodriguez, who has firsthand knowledge of the school which trains officers for Cuba's Navy, merchant marine, and fishing boats. Following their welcome in the form of a brief military parade, the diplomats took a two and one-half hour tour to observe the details of projects required of the hundreds of specialists who graduate from the academy. The projects are related to the country's defense and other activities linked to national economic development The academy, located in Bauta Municipality, Havana Province, educates military science graduates; experts on mines, torpedoes, complex artillery missile systems, radio communications, and power installations; navigation officers; and naval science graduates. Hundreds of youths are tested annually before registration at the academy, which graduated 200 students during the last school year and which organizes the country's maritime manning tables, among other duties. In keeping with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's policy of promoting contact between accredited diplomats and the many domestic sectors, the foreign officials visited classrooms, talked with recruits and officers, and had access to modern weapons displays. The domestic and foreign reporters accompanying the diplomats also witnessed peculiar events, such as the curiosity exhibited by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Interests section in Cuba, about sophisticated equipment used to camouflage submarine units. At the end of the tour, the visitors were able to closely observe the NIG 14 antisubmarine helicopter and the installation of a powerful land-sea rocket launcher, which, in addition to being part of the academy students' curriculum, are defense instruments used by the Cuban naval forces.
