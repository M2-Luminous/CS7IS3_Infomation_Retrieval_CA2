Dozens of settlers set up a new outpost near the settlement of Yaqir on the trans-Samaria highway. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 2 February reports that "the 50 settlers from Yaqir who attempted to set up a new settlement on a hill next to their settlement left the site after the Army declared the area a closed military zone. Our correspondent Dani Gur-Arye reports that no confrontation occurred between the soldiers and the settlers."] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers said that the operation impedes the routine activities of the IDF, which is compelled to assign a large number of troops to evacuate the settlers. The organizers of the operation, called This Is Our Land, say that the operation will continue in all 130 settlements, or until 50,000 people are arrested. As is known, the leaders of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza object to the operation, but have nevertheless announced they will provide legal assistance to settlers who are arrested. [passage omitted] The struggle between the official leadership of the settlers and activists in the field in fact exists only on paper. This week, an attempt will be made to close ranks in anticipation of the deployment of Israel Police in the territories in place of the IDF. [passage omitted] The IDF announced today that demonstrations by Jews in the territories will henceforth be allowed only within the Jewish settlements, just as demonstrations by Arabs will be allowed only within Arab locations. Our legal affairs correspondent Shlomo Arad reports that the High Court of Justice today rejected the settlers' request to demonstrate in the synagogue in Jericho based on this policy, arguing that the synagogue is located in an Arab location and that the court was convinced that such a move could imperil security on the site.
