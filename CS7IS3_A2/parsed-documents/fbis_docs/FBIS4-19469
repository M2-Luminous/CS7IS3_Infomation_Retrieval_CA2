This incident is one of a series of others that have occurred recently against the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul. Threatening slogans were written on the walls of the Patriarchate and there were repeated attempts to set fires. Replying to a question on whether the government made any representations on the attack against the all-girl school at Fanari, Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the government always makes the necessary diplomatic representations. We do not know to what extent official Turkish policy is reflected in these recent events. Venizelos repeated that Turkey should prove that it has some kind of relation to what is called European civilization.
