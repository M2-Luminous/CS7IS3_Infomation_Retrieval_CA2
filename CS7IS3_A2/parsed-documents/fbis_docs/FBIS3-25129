Just like the parliamentarians who signed the agreement, these top military officers are also natives of the four regions in southern Congo -- Niari, Bouenza, Lekoumou and Pool. In the past few months, citizens of the four regions of southern Congo have been locked up in clashes in Brazzaville that led to over 200 deaths in the fight between militias of the presidential group and the opposition. The plan was drawn up within closed doors in the presence of General Emmanuel Eta Onka, chief of general staff of the Congolese Armed Forces, and has been submitted to the intraregional parliamentary peace committee. Highlights of the plan have not yet been made public. The military officers and committee members are expected to meet on 8 February to examine the plan, Mr. Goma Tsika, a parliamentarian serving on the committee, disclosed on the national television. The rehabilitation of the Brazzaville-Pointe Noire railroad installations, sabotaged during the political violence, has been postponed pending the implementation of the plan. The repair work, anticipated in the cease-fire agreement, were initially scheduled to start on 1 February but was postponed to 8 February after an attack by opposition supporters on railway technicians leaving four dead. Aside from the resumption of rail traffic that has been interrupted for the past two months, the cease-fire agreement also provides for the deployment of a buffer force and the dismantling of militia forces in Brazzaville.
