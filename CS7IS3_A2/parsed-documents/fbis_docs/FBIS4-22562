Zlenko: "We Are Not To Be Frightened by a Paternalistic Attitude"] [Text] From the editors: A copy of the letter which staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG sent to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been sent to MOLOD UKRAYINY. We are printing it here below with some minor abridgements. Dear Anatoliy Maksymovych! As staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG, we turn to you in connection with the situation which has evolved--unfortunately--at this embassy. Each of us has worked in the embassy for various periods of time, but all of us have reached one and the same conclusion: Work at this embassy does not measure up to the demands of our times; genuine opportunities for organizing assistance to Ukraine are not being taken advantage of and--in many instances--are being blocked. Our state is thereby caused political, economic, and moral damage or harm. All this is taking place through the lack of knowledge or desire on the part of Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy to organize the embassy's work in the proper way. It is also caused by his consciously creating an unhealthy moral and psychological climate within the collective, as well as by his ignoring presidential edicts and orders issued by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To this very day the collective has been working under absolutely abnormal conditions, remaining under constant surveillance by the special services involved. At the same time repairs on the building acquired by the embassy are being unjustifiably delayed and are being done in an inappropriate manner. With regard to the ambassador himself, there is a lack of the proper political ideas or any desire to protect and defend Ukraine's interests at the higher levels of the German government and state. He also lacks an aggressive quality and initiative in political work. This was attested to, for example, by his reaction to the resolution by the RF [Russian Federation] Supreme Soviet on Sevastopol. The tragic subject of the famine in Ukraine during the years 1932-1933 was not utilized in any way for attracting the attention of political and civic circles in the FRG to Ukraine, even though there were all sorts of opportunities to do this. The ambassador also openly shuns contacts with the Ukrainian community in the FRG. And the representatives of that community have already begun manifesting a dissatisfaction with such an attitude on his part. The "tempestuous" economic activity under the ambassador's direct guidance boils down to mending connections with small firms or creating very favorable conditions for those German firms in which he has a personal interest. A blatant example of this is the "Stalmann" Concern. The ambassador himself actively intervened in this matter and insistently demanded that K. Stalmann be appointed an honorary Ukrainian consul. At this same time the embassy failed to provide any initiative for preparing or carrying out any large-scale economic project, either in the field of finance or that of production. Moreover, we have in our possession here genuine documents attesting that the ambassador intentionally undermined or unjustifiably delayed the examination of matters which were--and are--of extreme economic as well as political importance for Ukraine. What we are talking about in particular here is the delivery to Ukraine under very favorable conditions of a considerable quantity of oil with a deferment of payment for several years. Also involved is a matter of utilizing progressive technologies in machine building, etc.--a matter which could be used as a weighty argument in our relations with Russia. Nor can we neglect to mention such items as the following. By the ambassador's efforts to have the staffers of the Ukrainian Embassy insured by the German "Gothauer" Insurance Company, they were introduced to Mr. Yu. Kvitsinskiy (a citizen of Russia). During the Soviet period these people openly regarded Ukraine with scorn and a lack of respect. For four months the Kvitsinskiy family received medical benefits amounting to almost 50,000 German marks. The insurance company has accused the Ukrainian Embassy of forgery and is demanding that we pay back the above-mentioned sum, warning that--otherwise--the insurance policy will be cancelled. We persistently endeavored (and on more than one occasion) to call upon the ambassador to organize the work in the proper manner, sincerely believing in his decency and honor. Several meetings of the collective took place. But in response to all of us (each one in a separate interview) the ambassador began to threaten to send us home to Ukraine officially. We are not to be frightened by a paternalistic attitude! In response to Ambassador I.M. Piskovyy, we are citizens of Ukraine, and it was to protect and defend its interests that we were sent to work in the FRG by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. And no matter what the circumstances, we will not--like certain "Ukrainian" diplomats in Berlin--appeal to the German authorities. Here too, unfortunately, the ambassador played a disgraceful role, forcing one of the embassy staffers to sign an illegal document--contrary to instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our collective wants to work and is capable of doing so. For this purpose each of us has professional knowledge and skills, competence, a certain amount of experience, and a wide circle of ties in the country where we are stationed. But the main thing is that we have the desire to honestly and honorable perform our civic and service duties. The restricted scope of the present letter does not accord us the possibility of elucidating the entire picture. However, we can no longer put up with scorn and abuse of our state nor moral torments and maltreatment. We are not serfs, and we do not work for Mr. Piskovyy, but rather for our own state. Piskovyy is not yet the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and certainly not Ukraine. If--in response to our criticism here--the ambassador attempts to deprive us of the right to perform our duties, as he threatened to do at our recent meetings, and to organize groundles charges against us one at a time, we will return all together. And this will be done not only by those persons who have signed the present letter. Germany is too important a factor for Ukraine's foreign policy to leave our diplomacy with it in such a state of disarray. We would request that you, dear and esteemed Anatoliy Maksymovych, thoroughly examine the situation which has evolved and take the proper measures. We sincerely trust you. Respectfully yours, [Signed] V. Ohryzko, counsellor of the Ukrainian Embassy in the FRG [Signed] B. Sokolovskyy, first secretary of the embassy [Signed] O.
