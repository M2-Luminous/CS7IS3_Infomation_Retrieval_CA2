Investigation circles have denied this report, noting that the judicial investigator asked Malik at the start of his interrogation, in the presence of his lawyer Emile Rahmah, whether he wanted to be medically examined by a state doctor for any reason. Malik and his lawyer replied that there was no need for that. This remark was recorded in the official minutes of the interrogation. The judicial circles do not conceal their extreme indignation at the attempt to focus the spotlight on the investigation and distort the proceedings. It has been learned that these circles will demand that the authorities pursue all those who interfere in this case without having official proof.
