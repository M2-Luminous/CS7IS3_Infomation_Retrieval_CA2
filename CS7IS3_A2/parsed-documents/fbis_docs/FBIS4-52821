FBIS4-52821 "dreas093_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 South Korea Russia Protests Media Coverage of Logger Issue Russia Protests Media Coverage of Logger Issue SK1205084494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0831 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205084494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Moscow, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Moscow has protested to Seoul about the allegedly overheated media coverage in South Korea of the issue of North Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps, diplomatic sources here said Thursday. The Russian Government has stated that it might reconsider the basic policy on the loggers previously agreed with Seoul, thereby putting bilateral relations in a high state of tension, according to the sources. The two countries' foreign ministers met in Moscow last month to agree on a basic policy under which Russia would deal with the North Korean escapees according to its domestic law but from a humanitarian point of view. [sentence as received] The agreement also calls on Moscow to give Seoul maximum cooperation if the North Koreans want to resettle in the South. Seoul is devising concrete measures to help North Korean refugees resettle in South Korea -- providing opportunities for vocational education and social adaptation training, for example. Russia, however, took a tougher line when the loggers started receiving heavy coverage in the South Korean media, some of which compared the issue to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1990. The Russians, hoping not to further dampen relations with North Korea, expressed their bewilderment and dissatisfaction with such reports through a diplomatic channel to the South Korean Government, sources said. Some Russian public security officials even suggested that Moscow should forget the earlier agreement with Seoul and not cooperate in dealing with the loggers, sources said. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said the issue of the loggers would have already become a serious diplomatic problem had it not been for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's scheduled visit to Moscow in June. Working-level consultations among related ministries on resettlement of the North Korean loggers are under way in Moscow, but some ministry officials are apparently mindful of North Korea raising objections, sources said. Some Russian Government officials said Moscow may allow some North Korean loggers go to the South on the occasion of President Kim Yong-sam's visit, but that it may stop if South Korean papers keep playing up the issue. So despite President Kim's visit to Moscow, the logger problem may seriously damage bilateral relations, experts on Korean issues say. Complicating matters, Russia is anxious to mend fences with North Korea. The diplomatic experts said Russia is seeking good relations with North Korea in a bid to gain more influence in Korean affairs, including the nuclear dispute.
