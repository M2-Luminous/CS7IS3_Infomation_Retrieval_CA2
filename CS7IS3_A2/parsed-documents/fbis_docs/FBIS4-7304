The private sector and the ruling coalition parties, as well as government ministries, should make concerted efforts to maintain Japan's national interests on the trade front, Hata said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and other news organizations Thursday. As a way to improve the current trade situation, the new coalition government may need the power of a single influential politician, Hata said in an indirect endorsement of the role of Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist for the government of new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa. Ozawa is believed to have played a key role in settling the Japan-U.S. row over Motorola Inc.'s access to Japan's cellular phone market in March. In his first press conference as MITI chief earlier Thursday, Hata also vowed Tokyo's maximum efforts to use "every trade channel, including informal negotiations" to mend the strained economic ties between Tokyo and Washington. The trade minister said Japan should take the formation of the new cabinet as an opportunity to clarify anew the fundamental problems between Tokyo and Washington. "Little time is left (before the July summit of the group of seven leading industrialized nations in Naples). But the new government should not spare time digging into the core part of the current trade wrangling," Hata said. Hata opposed the U.S. demand for numerical targets as a tool to gauge the openness of Japan's markets, calling for Washington's understanding of Japan's stance against managed trade. The trade minister voiced regret over the Social Democratic Party's departure from the coalition, due to intracoalition feud, immediately after a coalition accord on a policy platform was struck. The departure resulted in a ruling minority alliance for the new government, the first in Japan in nearly 40 years. Hata called for the socialists to continue respecting a coalition accord on key issues, including tax reforms. The platform includes "significantly painful measures" for the SDP, but they are "worth being implemented," he said.
