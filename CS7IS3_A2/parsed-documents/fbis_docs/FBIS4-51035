The motion, put forward by Representative Porter Goss and endorsed by a 223-201 vote, is not binding but expresses congressional opinion. The motion opposes U.S. military action against Haiti unless there is a clear and pressing danger to U.S. interests or citizens. But it supports the use of Ile de Gonava, a 35-by-8-mile island, for screening refugees seeking asylum in the U.S., as well as for a base of operations for exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on May 8 some changes in U.S. immigration policy on Haitians. U.S. officials will no longer send Haitian boat people home without any asylum screening, but will determine on board ship or in another country who are bona fide political refugees. Clinton has also said that he would not rule out a military option against Haiti.
