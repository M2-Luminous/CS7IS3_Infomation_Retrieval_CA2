It was chaired by Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. The state program for the building and development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was reviewed. The members of the collegium analyzed the long-term plan for the building of the Ukrainian military--the three stages of which are planned to conclude in the year 2000--proceeding from the provisions of the law "The Defense of Ukraine" and the military doctrine of the state. That program will be submitted, after its refinement, for the consideration of the State Defense Council. Also considered was the question of measures for further improvements in the training of skilled personnel at military educational institutions. It was noted that the work on the reformation of the system of military education in Ukraine has been carried out with insufficient preparation and with a whole series of mistakes. All of these errors have been taken into account, and a system of measures has been developed to promote improvements in the training of military personnel. Representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and scientists took part in the work of the collegium.
