This has enabled our province to increase its broadcast coverage rate to 72 percent, and its television coverage to 77 percent in terms of population. These stations have played an important role in propagating the party line, guidelines, and policies, educating and encouraging the masses, and enriching their cultural life. The meeting pointed out that the main reason our province could built more than 10,000 satellite ground reception stations, which account for one fourth of the total number of satellite ground reception stations in the whole country, within a short period of three years was that the provincial CPC committees and government attached great importance to it, in addition to enthusiastic support by CPC committees and governments at all levels. Workers and staff members on the radio and television front throughout the province also worked hard for this project. The meeting stressed that the future focus of radio and television development projects in our province will be placed on impoverished counties which are supported by the provincial government, densely populated areas, and areas where the broadcast and television coverage rate is still comparatively low. To ensure safe and high-quality operations of the above-mentioned more than 10,000 satellite ground reception stations, the specific requirements for their administration in the future are: First, strengthening training and education for administrative personnel. Every year, the provincial radio and television department, and the relevant departments in prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties must provide their junior, middle-ranking, and senior management personnel with several training sessions. Second, each and every county will set up a maintenance and service department which has one or two full-time maintenance personnel in charge of maintenance work. Third, enterprises manufacturing radio and television equipment must provide satellite ground reception stations with high-quality products and service.
