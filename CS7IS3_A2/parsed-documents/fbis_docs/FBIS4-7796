In the past four years since the December 1989 revolution, there have been numerous contacts between us. President Slobodan Milosevic is visiting Romania for the second time. He visited Romania in 1992 and I have visited Belgrade twice in this period. Our relations have a longstanding tradition and are positive from every point of view. Throughout history, including the more recent history, Serbia and Yugoslavia have been Romania's best neighbors. We have never had conflicts or any type of dissensions. There have always been feelings of friendship and solidarity in relations between our peoples. These relations continued to develop after the December 1989 revolution and the economic relations between our countries also registered an upward course until the establishment of the embargo. First of all, we followed with great concern and awareness the tragedy that people in the former Yugoslavia and in the republics which have emerged in Yugoslavia had to face and are still facing today. We believe that it is a real tragedy that our neighbor has had to face and this human tragedy still continues. We have always believed that the only solution is to find ways out from the state of conflict solely through political and peaceful means. The way of force, of military conflict, or of taking measures such as the embargo -- which is also a measure of force -- are not meant to ease actions of finding solutions to the problem. On the contrary. The situation in Yugoslavia has just confirmed this. Therefore, we have hailed all elements of realism that have appeared in the meantime and that are aimed at supporting the efforts made by internal forces, which are directly interested and are the only ones able to find the best ways to solve this conflict. During our talks, we tried to find out in what way the leadership of Serbia regards the evolution of the situation in Yugoslavia, including the conflict in Bosnia, and the effort made to find political and peaceful solutions to problems. We have also discussed bilateral relations and preparations made by the two sides for the period that will follow the lifting of the embargo, because we believe that, in the situation that has been created today in the area of the former Yugoslavia, the lifting of the embargo is an important element in the process of creating premises for finding peaceful solutions to the conflict. We also expressed the belief that we should be prepared, so that immediately after the lifting of the embargo we should be able to resume normal relations in the economic area and be able to diversify and revive these relations. In 1992, until the embargo was imposed, for five months the volume of exchanges between our countries reached over $260 million. We estimate that after the lifting of the embargo we will be able to reach easily a volume of $1 billion in our bilateral relations, even as early as the first year after the embargo. Likewise, we believe that the positive relations between our countries, under conditions of peace in the region of former Yugoslavia, will be a stabilizing, positive, and constructive factor in our efforts to develop dynamic economic relations in our area, with all the new states that have been formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and with Bulgaria, Greece, and the other neighboring countries in our region. Thus, we wish to make preparations for such prospects. In the same spirit we discussed the issue of finalizing the process of drafting the text of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between our countries, which should be concluded in the near future and should be signed at an appropriate time, within a framework that we are going to establish mutually. Hence, we believe that the visit paid by President Slobodan Milosevic to our country and the talks we have held represent a significant political element for the relations between our countries and a constructive factor in the joint efforts aimed at promoting a climate that is favorable for the normalization and development of a political climate in this region of joint interest.
