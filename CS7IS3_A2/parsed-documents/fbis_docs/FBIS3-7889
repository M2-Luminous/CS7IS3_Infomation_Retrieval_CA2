He believes in the need for a new philosophy of peaceful co-existence. "The Balkans will either constitute a free, democratic and developed part of Europe or will not exist at all," he said. In his opinion, the sanctions against Yugoslavia have long become unwarranted, as Serbs are no longer involved in the war in Bosnia; the war is now between Croats and Muslims and among Muslims themselves. Besides, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have yet another thing in common: They both suffer from the embargo. Yugoslavia's neighbours which are most affected by the embargo should insist that the United Nations lift the sanctions, he said. Yugoslavia assigns top priority to its relations with Bulgaria, he said. "Our relations are good, but are not up to the inner needs and the potential of two neighbour nations." In his opinion, the Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia suffers relatively less from the sanctions owing to the humanitarian aid it receives regularly from Bulgaria and to some unspecified "other benefits" from life along the border. According to Mr. Smilkovic, there is no reason to worry about the preservation of the national identity of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. "I have never read in the Bulgarian press that Bulgarian minorities anywhere enjoy more rights and are more satisfied with their lives," he said. In an interview for STANDART NEWS in January Mr. Smilkovic said that Bulgarians in Yugoslavia were not many at the time the federation was formed and that they were embarrassed by the fact that they were receiving aid from Bulgaria on an ethnic basis. "We are sorry that we have to deny the words of the ambassador of the country whose citizens we happen to be," Mr. Dimitur Dimitrov, member of the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia in Bosilegrad, writes in a letter to the same daily. Another member of that organization, Mr. Marko Shukarev from Tsaribrod, also denies statements of Ambassador Smilkovic in his interview in January. He disagrees with Mr. Smilkovic's assertion that the problems of the Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia are needlessly politicized by the Bulgarian mass media. Mr. Shukarev also denies that the newspaper of the Bulgarian minority is no longer published because of the UN sanctions. Neither the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia nor the Bulgarian newspapers are raising nonexistent problems, he said. Not a single problem has been settled so far, be it educational or religious. "Do not blame Bulgarians, they know what they lack!" reads the headline in STANDARD NEWS which carries both letters.
