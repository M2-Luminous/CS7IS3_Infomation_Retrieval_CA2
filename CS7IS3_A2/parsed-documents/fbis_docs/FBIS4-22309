Maltseva, under the rubric "Express-Interview"; place and date not given: "Vasiliy Kiselev: `Oblast Administration's Responsibility Must Be Financed'"] [Text] At a press conference Vasiliy Kiselev, first deputy head of the Novosibirsk Oblast administration, mentioned that beginning 1 April the territories will gain relative freedom in disposing of money received from the federal budget. The editors asked V. Kiselev to demonstrate with a socially significant example some opportunities for maneuver under the new conditions: "Since responsibility for creating food reserves now rests entirely with the local bodies of authority, this responsibility must be financed. The edict on liberalization of the grain market prescribes that we form grain reserves with our own resources as well. The oblast needs 590,000 tonnes of grain--according to the most meager measure. The normal level, which takes into account the needs of specialized animal husbandry farms, is 850,000 tonnes. Even if we project that a tonne of grain will cost 100,000 rubles [R] (and realistically this figure should be doubled), we need R100 billion to pay for this 'purchase.' "To protect grain suppliers from inflationary costs and guarantee these deliveries into the reserve fund, we have to pay an advance of at least 25-30 percent of the cost of grain procurement. "After taking credits year after year and then paying them back, we came to the conclusion that a different system was needed--we need to put this process on a compensated-delivery basis. In this connection we are looking into the question of setting up a grain customer service--the oblast administration's committee on the economy will be that customer. This will change the relations with the existing Russian Grain Products agency's system on our territory. "Why are we bringing up the question of changing the terms of cooperation? "Last year, for instance, the oblast took out a loan from the budget and gave it to the Novosibirsk Grain Products agency. For the most part, of course, the money was used as intended, but at the same time some money was "skimmed off" for other payments--for instance, this organization's debts for prior deliveries. "Why is this paid for with our money? Most likely because it is state money, our common money, and one does not count it. But in reality it is already different money. "Therefore we need a mechanism that would guarantee that if we spent R40 billion on grain procurement, this grain would be ours. Other partners simply provide for us services in getting the grain into proper condition and processing it, but at the same time the oblast does not lose the right of ownership of the grain. And, correspondingly, proceeds from sales will also belong completely to the oblast. We can start giving the money generated to producers, to finance the 1995 harvest. "This new ideology of market relations will allow us to save money, and this money we now be `circulating' only within the boundaries of the oblast financial system."
