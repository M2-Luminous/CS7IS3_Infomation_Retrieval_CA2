FR940606-0-00031 FR940606-0-00011 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50585E; FRL&hyph;4649&hyph;8] Amide of Polyamine and Organic Acid; Revocation of a Significant New Use Rule AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for amide of polyamine and organic acid based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that for purposes of section 5 of TSCA the substance will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this rule is July 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543A, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of September 28, 1990 (55 FR 39892), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for amide of polyamine and organic acid (P&hyph;89&hyph;1062). Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR. I. Background The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the Federal Register of May 7, 1993 (58 FR 27255). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result EPA is revoking this SNUR. II. Objectives and Rationale of Revocation of the Rule During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to be produced in substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified the tests necessary to evaluate the risks of the substance. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter, and a SNUR was promulgated. The consent order required the PMN submitter to perform toxicity testing on the chemical substance. EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the consent order for the substance and determined that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. III. Rulemaking Record The record for the rule which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS&hyph;50585 (P&hyph;89&hyph;1062). This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data to which the Agency has responded with this revocation. IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
