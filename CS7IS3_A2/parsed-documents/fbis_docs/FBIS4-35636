[Al-Jifri] The secession was declared not by us but by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. What we did was announce the result which Salih caused, because we had agreed with him before the war that a declaration of secession would mean a declaration of war by either side and that a declaration of war would mean secession. So he declared war knowing that that would mean secession. Secondly, they (the northerners) say that they have occupied one area or another which means that they are advocates not of unity but of occupation, and that their view of unity is that they should occupy and control others. Thirdly, we are not playing games to set up a state as a means of pressure for a cease-fire but we cannot accept unity on the old foundations and we cannot place the lives and future of the public in the hands of people obsessed with domination and hegemony. We, however, advocate unity based on law and order, equality, democracy, and respect for human rights. When there is a regime in Sanaa which believes in what we believe in, then we will discuss unity with it. Also, if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih observes a cease-fire and withdraws his forces then we would be willing to build special and cordial relations with our brothers in the north and later develop these relations into anything. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] It has been rumored that there is U.S. pressure on you to revoke the secession decision in return for which Sanaa would be forced to stop the war and agree on a new form of unity. What, in your view, would that form be, after missiles have hit Sanaa as well as Aden? [Al-Jifri] There is no U.S. pressure on us in that direction. We know that our American friends are indeed against infighting in our country and against the imposition of unity by force, and that they are in favor of unity on new and sound foundations. We never called for anything else before. We believe that a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces to their pre-22 May 1990 positions would pave the way for calm and sensible negotiations that would maintain some kind of link between the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] and the Yemeni Arab Republic [YAR]. That way we would achieve the stability sought by everyone at home and abroad. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] There are conflicting reports about the results of the battles, sometimes exaggerated. What is the true military situation on the various fronts? [Al-Jifri] In such battles on such a long front there is bound to be advance and retreat and confused and exaggerated reports, but what we want to fully emphasize is that Aden is protected, firstly by God and then by our people in the battlefields led by Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, his aides, the chief of staff, the air eagles, and the naval forces. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to conquer Aden. That we categorically affirm. His plan was to occupy Aden within 48 hours or five days at the most. We are now in the fourth week. Even in four months his position would be worse and ours would be better. We are defending a cause and our territory and he is an aggressor without a cause. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Has there been any confirmation of Iraqi or Sudanese involvement in the current war in Yemen? [Al-Jifri] We have definite indications or information about involvement of quarters from outside the DRY and YAR in this sedition triggered by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. At present at al-Hudaydah air base there are experts, training instructors, and pilots from abroad. As regards those who claim to be fighting in the name of Islamic Jihad, God knows that we know Islam better than them and are more committed to it than them, otherwise they would not have destroyed entire villages, including women and children, in the holy months and during 'Id al-Adha. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] It has been claimed that al-Bid has moved his headquarters to Hadhramaut and that he is running his affairs from there. What are the justifications for such a move in the circumstances? [Al-Jifri] President 'Ali Salim al-Bid went to Hadhramaut to to carry out extremely important tasks and to deal with various matters at local, Arab, or international levels. Wherever there are duties for the brother president or any of the officials in the south to perform, they would go to perform these duties. [Shatarah] Could it be that he moved there because Aden became unsafe? [Al-Jifri] That is not true at all. [passage omitted]
