Born into a poor peasant's family in Kongju County, South Chungchong Province, she underwent all hardships as a nurse-maid at a landlord's home from early years and then a tenant farmer. It was not until she was embraced in the bosom of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the country's liberation that she could enjoy a worthy life of humanity. She actively participated in assisting the front in the period of the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953) and afterwards devotedly worked for the strengthening and development of the socialist motherland. She is now the oldest woman in a big family of 50 members including her sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters. All people in the DPRK are now living a happy life with no worry about food, clothing and housing, singing the prime of youth in the sixties and the first step into old age in the nineties, benefitting by the free health care system.
