FR940203-2-00108 FR940203-2-00068 Under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative and the fiscal year 1994 Cooperative Demonstration Program competition, Federal funds will be used as ``venture capital'' to stimulate State and local creativity in establishing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. To achieve this systemic reform, States may choose to build on and enrich current promising programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, school-to-apprenticeship, cooperative education, youth apprenticeship, and business-education compacts, that can be developed into programs under a School-to-Work Opportunities system. Through the formation of partnerships among secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, private and public employers, labor organizations, government, community groups, parents, and other key groups, communities will take ownership and responsibility for giving American youth access to skills and employment opportunities that will launch them on paths leading to high-skill, high-wage careers. Together, States and localities will take the lead in determining goals and priorities, developing new strategies, and measuring progress. The Federal role in the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is important, but limited to the establishment of broad national criteria and a framework within which States create School-to-Work Opportunities systems. The Federal role is to (a) invest in State and local initiatives by providing seed capital; (b) help States and localities learn from each other and from the experience of our international competitors; (c) build a knowledge base of effective school-to-work models, including strategies that meet the needs of disadvantaged youth and that can be implemented successfully in poor communities; and (d) create a national framework through common core criteria and national standards. School-to-Work Opportunities Systems The School-to-Work Opportunities initiative provides for a substantial degree of State flexibility and experimentation, but all State systems will share the following common features and basic program components. The basis of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is (1) the integration of work-based and school-based learning that provides students, to the extent practicable, with broad instruction on all aspects of the industry students are preparing to enter, (2) the integration of occupational and academic learning, and (3) the linking of secondary and postsecondary education. To build bridges from school-to-work, programs must provide students with an integrated array of learning experiences in the classroom and at the worksite. In order to ensure that students receive these learning experiences, all School-to-Work Opportunities programs must incorporate three basic program components: Work-based learning, school-based learning, and connecting activities. These three core components include_ •Work-based learning that includes providing students with a planned program of job training and experiences relevant to a student's career and leading to the award of a skill certificate, paid work experience, workplace mentoring, and instruction in general workplace competencies. •School-based learning that includes career awareness and career exploration and counseling, initial selection of a career major by interested students not later than the beginning of the 11th grade, a coherent multi-year sequence of instruction typically beginning no later than the eleventh grade and ending typically after at least one year of postsecondary education tied to high academic and skill standards, which would be developed under the proposed ``Goals 2000: Educate America Act,'' and regularly scheduled evaluations to identify students' academic strengths and weaknesses, academic progress, workplace knowledge, and goals; and •Connecting activities to ensure coordination between the work-based and school-based learning components of each School-to-Work Opportunities program, which includes matching students with employers' work-based learning opportunities, serving as a liaison among employer, school, teacher, parent, and student participants, providing technical assistance to employers and others in designing work-based learning components, providing assistance to students who have completed the program in finding appropriate employment, continuing their education, or obtaining additional training, collecting information regarding the outcome of students' participation in the School-to-Work Opportunities program, and linking youth development activities under the School-to-Work Opportunities program with employers' strategies for upgrading the skills of their workers. School-to-Work Opportunities programs will result in students attaining: (1) A high school diploma or its equivalent, (2) a certificate or diploma recognizing successful completion of one or two years of postsecondary education, if appropriate, and (3) a skill certificate. In addition, these students will be ready to begin a first job on a career track and pursue further education and training.
