This was the conclusion of a study on the causes of "karoshi" carried out by the Economic Research Institute of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). The report is expected to appear shortly in the agency's publication, THE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMY. According to the study, Japanese workers' average annual working hours came to 2,124 hours in 1990, about 200 hours longer than those in the United States and Britain, and 400 to 500 hours longer than workers in France and Germany. Moreover, Japanese workers are believed to work an average 1.5 hours daily of so-called "service overtime" or unrecorded and consequently unpaid overtime work. Most of the people whose deaths are suspected to be caused by fatigue from overwork had worked more than 3,000 hours a year, including overtime. As of fiscal 1992, one in six Japanese male workers was reported to be working more than 3,100 hours a year, and 46 percent of workers in a survey answered they are afraid that they could die from overwork, the researchers said. Meanwhile, they said, the quality of work has become increasingly demanding and stressful due to new technologies being introduced in rapid succession. "Long, intensive work is a main factor causing an increasing incidence of health-disorder complaints at Japan's workplaces...and the most drastic case is karoshi," the report says. The researchers said people's sense of values, combined with the long-standing labor practices in Japan, tends to aggravate overwork. Individuals and corporations need to change their attitudes toward work in order to prevent overwork, they said. They suggest the government should extend workers' accident compensation insurance to cover karoshi cases and introduce a new premium calculation method for the insurance based on the working hours at each workplace. Higher premiums that employers would have to pay to the government for longer working hours would eventually persuade them to take some preventive measures to curb overwork, they said. The phenomenon of karoshi was reported as early as in 1960 when the nation's economy was expanding rapidly, and karoshi was recognized widely as a serious problem in the mid-1970s. Karoshi is defined as death due to accumulated fatigue from overwork but it is not a recognized medical term and there are no official statistics on it. Its most common manifestation is in the form of sudden death from stroke or heart failure. The researchers, however, said a group of lawyers has recorded 1,416 cases of inquiries in four years from June 1988 from people looking for compensation for the deaths of their relatives from suspected overwork. According to the researchers, most people would feel tired on the day following one when they worked more than 10 hours, and complaints of fatigue would sharply increase if they worked overtime of more than 40 hours a month.
