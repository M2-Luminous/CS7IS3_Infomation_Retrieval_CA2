The winner of the elections was Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who is in Panama City. Good evening, Dr. Perez Balladares. [Perez] Good evening. [Zabludovsky] How do you feel after the elections? [Perez] Obviously, I am quite satisfied. I think this has been an extraordinary civic process by the Panamanian people. I greatly appreciate the massive support received through votes. Also, I am greatly appreciative of my adversaries, because we managed to conduct an extraordinary campaign with a high level of civic-mindedness and specific proposals. I am very proud -- truly very proud -- of the Panamanians and of the level of culture and political development we have demonstrated in this campaign of 1994. [Zabludovsky] Everyone is asking the question: Who is Dr. Perez Balladares? [Perez] I am an economist. I graduated in 1967, obtained a masters degree in economics in 1969, and a masters degree in finance in 1970. After that I was a banker for five years. I then joined the government of Omar Torrijos, where I served from 1976 until one year after his death until 1983 -- excuse me, 1982. I was finance and treasury minister. I was planning and economic policy minister. Since then I have been an active member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party. [Zabludovsky] One of the topics that was raised by your enemies during the campaign was that there could be a rebirth of militarism with your victory in Panama. [Perez] I think that, more than anything, that was an electoral attack, which has now ended. Many knew that was obviously false. First, all military regimes have been dismantled throughout not only the American continent, but also in Asia, Africa, everywhere. The justification that was used for its existence, the alleged retaining wall to curb the progress of what the United States identified as its enemies -- international communism -- has vanished. Now democracy is in vogue, and this is something we applaud. The same thing is happening in Panama. Because of international geopolitical conditions, and because of domestic conditions, there cannot be a return to militarism. This is so true that today I dare say the next foreign minister of my government will be Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a man who, from the United States, strongly opposed the former military regime. Therefore, there can hardly be any threat of a return to the past. [Zabludovsky] What type of government will you try to promote in your first 100 days? [Perez] We have based all of our government proposals, our entire campaign, and all of our efforts on achieving the reconciliation of Panamanian society. This society was deeply divided during the final years of the military government and by the invasion. We have to achieve this, and we must take specific steps. This cannot remain a mere electoral pledge or an expression of goodwill. I have to dedicate myself to building on this pledge in the first 100 days, striving to achieve a government of national consensus and unity, to enable Panama to enter the 21st century as a united country and as a country of equal opportunity. Obviously, I must work to ensure this at a later date, but the first thing is to make sure that everyone perceives us as a government of unity, as a government disposed to making the best efforts with the best men and women available in order that this can be our goal within the next five years. [Zabludovsky] For nearly 100 years, one of the most controversial topics in Panama has been the U.S. military presence there. A poll was conducted and many people believe the U.S. military should remain. What is your view on this? [Perez] Let me clear up something first. What we have are polls, and it has been proven that polls in Panama somehow are not totally reliable, as was shown in the recent elections. What does exist is a statement by many who have been polled in the sense that there is a feeling of apprehension, of fear perhaps, regarding the possible departure of the U.S. military from Panama. We cannot give into this fear, which in the majority of cases is unfounded, because we Panamanians have not only the capability but also the willingness to oversee the administration of the Panama Canal. Most of these fears respond to things that the people themselves do not understand, perhaps because of a certain degree on evil within some people who have instilled this in the people's minds. For example, some say that if the North Americans leave, the U.S. dollar will leave. These are two completely different things, and yet, the man on the street does not understand that the U.S. dollar is circulating on the street, not because of the U.S. presence here, but because it is our sovereign decision to have this currency circulating in Panama, which we Panamanians earn with our sale of services and goods abroad. The presence of U.S. military bases in Panama is defined in the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. They clearly state that by 31 December 1999, there should not be one single U.S. soldier in Panama. The presence of bases in any part of the world by any foreign power cannot be justified by economic issues. Military bases exist in any part of the world when there is a military interest in protection or aggression [as heard]. I do not think this is the case in Panama. The historic justification for the existence or presence of military bases in Panama, which was to defend the interoceanic waterway when the U.S. strategic weapon was the Navy, has disappeared. Nor is the Panama Canal threatened. In turn, we Panamanians do not see any reason from a military standpoint for there to be bases in Panama, at least not with the justifications used in the past. If there is any other reason for a small or medium-sized U.S. military presence in Panama, the United States would have to say what it is and propose it to the Panamanians. Then we would have to look at our national interests, strictly from a security and military viewpoint. The positive or negative consequences of the permanence of U.S. troops in Panama because of economic issues is not a basis for such a decision. That is something altogether different, and it cannot be the fundamental criterion for agreeing to or opposing a U.S. military presence in Panama. Let us suppose there is an additional interest on the part of the United States to maintain some presence in Panama. I can think, for example, of let us say the struggle against drug trafficking. If there is an interest on the part of the United States in this, then we would have to see what the terms and conditions are. Anything that might be agreed upon would then have to be submitted to a national referendum, because that is not a decision that can be made exclusively by the executive or legislative branch. It would have to be subjected to a referendum by the Panamanian people.
