The meeting stressed that the new situation demands that all these organs conscientiously carry out the following three tasks: paying attention to the party's policy of reform, development, and stability; strengthening their service functions; and pushing forward the anticorruption struggle. The meeting also held that the important conditions for guaranteeing all these organs to better perform their duties lie in bringing into full play their role as an assistant, inspector, and coordinator. The meeting affirmed the achievements attained by these organs in strengthening the party's work style, building a clean and honest government, and fighting against corruption. The meeting held that in light of this year's work and the anticorruption campaign put forward by the central authorities, all these organs should fully play their roles and work harder in carrying out the following four tasks. First, it is necessary to improve information and statistical work. In this way, they can reflect in a timely fashion the new situation, problems, and experiences in their anticorruption struggle to improve their work system, strengthen dynamic analysis, and provide conditions for the better implementation of the anticorruption struggle and a basis for formulating policy. Second, it is necessary to improve the supervision and inspection work. All these organs should focus on carrying out the guiding spirit of the third plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and on conducting extensively the anticorruption struggle. They should enhance the quality of their supervision and inspection work and promptly receive feedback on the results of their work. Third, it is necessary to improve coordination work. They should further smooth away the problems in their internal and external relations after discipline inspection and supervision units began to work together in the same offices. They should assist leading comrades in solving new problems cropping up during the course of the anticorruption struggle and promote the healthy development of such a struggle. Fourth, it is necessary to improve the press and public opinion work. They should let the public fully understand new results and experiences regarding the anticorruption campaign. In dealing with the ideological trends inside and outside the party as well as the symptoms, tendencies, and work problems in a particular period, they should write articles to guide public opinion. Attending the meeting were directors of the departments (offices) of the commissions for discipline inspection from all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic decision-making authority; of the Work Committee for Organs Under the Central Committee, and of the Work Committee for Central Government Organs, as well as representatives from excellent information network points.
