The premier indicated that the Chinese Communist authorities should not be forgiven for their total disregard of sensibilities, human rights, and humanitarianism. Station correspondent Wang Wei-chun reports: [Begin recording] [Wang] Premier Lien again used strong wording to condemn the Chinese Communist authorities for their handling of the tragedy that occurred on Lake Chientao. Premier Lien stressed that places which cannot ensure the safety of tourists are not qualified to welcome visitors. [Lien] As one Chinese saying goes, one should not enter a state besieged by danger, or live in a state of unrest. Before we visit a place for sightseeing purposes, we must make our decision carefully. How can a region of danger or unrest, or a region that cannot ensure the safety of its visitors, consider itself qualified to welcome visitors from the outside? [Wang] Premier Lien also urged tourism services at home to examine their operations. He pointed out that under a plan drawn up by the Ministry of Communications for developing sightseeing in Taiwan, the government will improve the sightseeing environment every year. On the other hand, he urged the Legislative Yuan to quickly finish examining the regulations which the Executive Yuan has drafted for developing tourism so that departments in charge of tourism will become more effective in supervising travel safety. Meanwhile, in view of the fact that some legislators of nonruling parties have insisted on linking the tragedy on Lake Chientao with the controversy of reunification and Taiwanese independence, Premier Lien pointed out that the most important thing the government and the public can do at present is to work together to make sure the death of the 24 citizens is justly settled. He said the focus of the tragedy should not be blurred. This is China Broadcasting Corporation correspondents Ho Chien-min and Wang Wei-chun at the Legislative Yuan. [end recording]
