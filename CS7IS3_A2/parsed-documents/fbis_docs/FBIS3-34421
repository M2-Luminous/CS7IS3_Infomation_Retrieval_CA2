One of the reactionary Majles deputies, Khamushi, said that the 50.9 percent increase in current prices was shattering and stated: Unfortunately this budget will raise inflation to 50-60 percent. It is worth mentioning that in the course of the discussions on the regime's budget bill, 120 of the reactionary Majles deputies, who were terrified of the explosion of popular discontent against high prices, presented a triple urgency bill to the Majles that stipulated that the government should be stripped of all authority to raise prices and grant only the Majles this right.
