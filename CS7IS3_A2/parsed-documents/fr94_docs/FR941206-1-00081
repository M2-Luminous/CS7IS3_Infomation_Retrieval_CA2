FR941206-1-00081 FR941206-1-00007 The records and reports that the EPA considers necessary for demonstrating initial and continuous compliance for this source category are summarized in Table 5. (The selection of reporting and recordkeeping requirements is further discussed in section VI.H.) Reports identified under initial compliance methods in Table 5 are required to be submitted in accordance with the requirements of ยง63.9(h) of subpart A, the General Provisions to part 63. Information that should be included in the initial compliance report is identified in Table 5. In order to perform the emission calculations, a source must by necessity keep records of the quantity of finishing material used over each month, and the VHAP and solids content of these finishing materials (see Table 6). An affected source demonstrates continuous compliance if finishing materials, thinners, adhesives, and spray booth materials meeting the limits in the proposed rule are used. If a source at any time uses a material that does not meet these limits (unless the source is using an averaging approach or is subject to the special compliance provisions for coatings applied with continuous coaters), the source is out of compliance with the rule. A source that complies with emission limits for finishing operations by achieving an average HAP limit across all finishing steps is in compliance if, over each month, the HAP limit required by the proposed rule is met. The Committee agreed that a monthly averaging period was appropriate for this source category because, at many facilities, manufacturing operations change from week-to-week or even day-to-day. The compliance timeframe of a month that is identified in the proposed rule accounts for this variation, and allows a source flexibility in performing manufacturing operations. The Committee did not think that there would be any adverse environmental impact by choosing a monthly compliance period. It was agreed that throughout the month, a source would not be likely to exceed the HAP limit by a considerable amount. If it did, they would have difficulty in meeting the monthly limit. If a source does not meet the HAP limit over any monthly period, it is out of compliance with the rule for each operating day of the month unless the source can demonstrate through records that the violation of the monthly average can be attributed to a particular day or days of operation. Further, periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction should be included when determining compliance when methods other than control devices are used to meet the emission limits. Startup, shutdown, and malfunction periods are included because the use of compliant coatings should not be affected during these periods. Semiannual reporting, in addition to recordkeeping, is necessary to document the compliance status of the affected source. A source using compliant finishing materials, thinners, adhesives, or strippable spray booth coatings must submit a semiannual compliance certification that states compliant materials are being used. A source using an averaging approach must provide copies of each month's emission calculation and submit a semiannual compliance certification that states that the value of (E), as calculated by Equation 1 of ยง63.804, is no greater than 1.0 for existing sources or 0.8 for new sources. The Agency has identified semiannual reporting for this source category, except for sources that experience excess emissions and are using a control device to comply with the proposed rule. For these sources, continuous monitoring system data are used directly for determining compliance. Sources with a control device that experience excess emissions must follow a quarterly reporting format for at least 1 year after the excess emissions occur and until a request to reduce reporting frequency is approved. This is consistent with guidance provided in the General Provisions, subpart A, 63.10(e)(3). In addition, if the Administrator finds significant industry-wide noncompliance with the rule, the Administrator may require that semiannual reporting be changed to quarterly reporting. The Agency considered small business impacts when developing the compliance and monitoring provisions and decided that more frequent reporting for those sources that are routinely complying with the rule would not be necessary for small businesses.
