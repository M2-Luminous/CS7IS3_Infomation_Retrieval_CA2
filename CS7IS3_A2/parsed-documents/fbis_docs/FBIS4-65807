During a hearing of the Economic Committee of the Bundestag, the government's intention to extend the control of letters, telephone conversations, and telexes of suspicious companies until the end of 1996 was discussed. The Customs Criminal Office is allowed to do that. According to its vice president, Karl-Heinz Matthias, it prevented "several exports of sensitive goods" on the basis of observation. BND President Konrad Porzner told the committee that some countries in the African, Arab, and Asian region are making "massive" efforts to build missile systems. He cited Libya, Syria, and Iran as examples. He considers this "the real threat." Porzner believes that several states will possess carrier missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 km in six to eight years' time. Medium-range missiles of a range of up to 3,000 km might follow "soon." The efforts of these countries to acquire machines, parts, and specialists in the international market are continuing at an "intensive level," the BND chief pointed out. Particularly trade with the so-called dual-use goods -- products that can be used for civilian and military purposes -- "is developing in an increasingly problematic manner." "Sophisticated acquisition networks" are being established. Technically, the BND is in a position to provide "first hints" as a result of the control of the telecommunications traffic, but it is not allowed to evaluate findings in Germany. "We have to pretend not to hear and see anything," Porzner regretted. He demanded the expansion of the "instruments designed to discover individual illegal deals" and to involve the BND. Whereas representatives of the Customs Criminal Office and the Stuttgart public prosecutor reported initial success in the prosecution of violations of the foreign trade and the war weapons law, Bielefeld jurist Christoph Gusy warned against continued control of the post and telecommunications traffic. Gusy is representing Rhineland-Palatinate in a lawsuit against infringements of the secrecy of post and telecommunications traffic with the Federal Constitutional Court.
