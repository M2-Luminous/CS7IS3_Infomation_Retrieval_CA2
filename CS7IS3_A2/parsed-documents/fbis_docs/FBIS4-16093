Explaining this decision, Boris Fedorov, the leader of the union, told our correspondent: We are liberal and we are democrats. We have simply taken a long time to see who we are in the political spectrum. Many options were discussed, and we decided that this one is the most appropriate. Incidentally, the Russia's Choice had similar discussions, but they became frightened. We believe that if we are liberal democrats, we should not hide it. All we are doing is returning the true meaning to the title of liberal democrats.
