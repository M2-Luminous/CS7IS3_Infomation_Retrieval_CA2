The severance of economic ties; the sharp jump in prices for printing materials imported into the republic, primarily from Russia; and other market-related expenses have created quite a few problems. As a result, the regularity with which many newspapers are published has been disrupted, prices for publishing services have increased almost every month, and the printing rendition and quality of the printed product have sharply fallen. The subject of the interview "How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the publishing house's general director, which was published in BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY and KHALG GAZETI on the first of April of this year, concerned these and many other aspects of the publishing house's activity. "How are things today with the publishing house? What has changed since its transfer to management by the Administration of Affairs in the president's staff?" The conversation of our correspondent with Afik Velimetov, chief economist of the Azerbaijan Publishing House, began with these questions. [Velimetov] In my opinion, this year should be the decisive one in the publishing house's emergence from its protracted crisis. The first quarter results inspire optimism and are witness to the fact that, in the main, the path selected to overcome the combination of problems is the correct one. I will not make unsubstantiated statements; I will cite concrete facts. Thus, the profit that remained at the publishing house's disposal during that quarter is almost twice as much as that which all of last year brought us. Whereas our debt to the bank was 70.1 million manats on 1 January, it does not exceed 18 million manats today, despite the enormous inflation and the increase in bank interest for loans. [Aliyev] How have you managed to achieve these changes? Perhaps the delivery of printing materials has been normalized? [Velimetov] No, it is just the opposite. Deliveries have not only been reduced, but the prices for these materials have increased sharply. Moreover, as before, questions connected with exchanging the manat for rubles have not been solved, and transportation expenditures and customs duties have increased, in particular, for products imported into the republic from Russia. As I have already pointed out, however, a certain improvement is being observed in the publishing house's financial and economic activity. The fact that we were able to forecast future difficulties awaiting our printing trade has helped us prepare somehow for them. First, we oriented and mobilized the collective and our printing capabilities to the production of so-called cultural and personal goods and consumer goods. In particular, we expanded publication of the products list of goods absent in the market. In particular, we organized the production of school notebooks and textbooks. An increase in management and production discipline helped us establish economic effectiveness for each order more carefully. This decreased expenditures per one manat of commodity output from last year's level of 96 gyapiks to 61 gyapiks by the end of the first quarter. In addition, we organized businesslike and mutually beneficial relations with the republic's book publishers. [Aliyev] Did not all of this reflect adversely on the publication of newspapers? [Velimetov] I ask that you direct your attention to the fact that our prices for printing newspapers and for newsprint has not changed since January, that is, we were somehow able to stabilize the prices for the publishing house's main type of activity--providing typographic services for newspaper production, which occupied approximately 80 percent of our total commodity volume for years. Now, the percentage of newspaper production does not exceed 50 percent. [Aliyev] Perhaps, it has become unprofitable for you to publish newspapers? [Velimetov] I would not say that.... The drop in the percentage of newspaper production is connected with the reduction in the circulation of periodicals; this is unprofitable and inefficient from an economic point of view. That is why we are introducing practical adjustments in the list of published products. This is a demand of the times and the meaning of market relations--for example, having analyzed the situation, we increased our attention toward the production of book items. [Aliyev] It is rumored that a new landslide-type increase in prices for the publishing of newspapers is coming in the near future--as has previously occurred repeatedly.... [Velimetov] I think that a landslide-like increase in prices will not occur, although there is still no complete guarantee of this. We are following a reasonable pricing policy, as the market demands. In cases where the publishing house's capabilities permit stable prices for the publication of newspaper products to be maintained, prices will remain the same. If the trend toward further increasing prices for printing materials is maintained, this naturally will force us also to increase their wholesale cost, since it is impossible to forget about the interests of the publishing house and its collective, which we are obliged to protect. However, there are factors that are independent of us; these are an increase in energy rates, raw material imported from Russia, and so on. [Aliyev] Many newspapers are today not being published in general. Is this not connected with the toughening of the publishing house's economic policy? [Velimetov] For a long time, quite a few newspapers were published....on credit, violating the production contract with the publishing house. It came down to the fact that the editorial boards' total incurred debt to the publishing house reached the half-billion (in rubles) mark. This put the normal existence of the publishing house itself in doubt. It was necessary to toughen the economic interrelationships with the debtor editorial boards, since it was simply impossible for us and for them to work this way any longer. Of course, dissatisfied people appeared, but we withstood the pressure. Incidentally, thanks to this completely fair policy, we are managing to raise wages and, at the same time, distribute them. Moreover, many other social problems, whose realization is more than an enterprise can afford today, are being solved--for example, we are planning to lay the foundation of a nine-storey apartment house for our workers this year. We are planning to repair the main building of the publishing house, and much more. A preliminary plan for establishing a vacation area in Absheronskiy Rayon for printing workers exists. As they say, Allah will smile as soon as the war ends.... [Aliyev] In your view, were the first quarter's positive results achieved exclusively thanks to the toughening of relations with your partners? [Velimetov] Of course not. This is the beginning of the implementation of a long-term program based on the effective use of the experience acquired by the collective, efficient operation of equipment, savings in expenditures of raw material and materials, strict production and management discipline, and, the most important thing, the accurate construction of relations with partners and customers--in a word, the realization of all components making up normal market relations. I will also talk about something else in this connection. A joint enterprise with Russia, which will supply the publishing house with printing materials, is now in the founding stage; we hope that it will start operating in the very near future. Let us say right out that we are placing rather large hopes on this joint enterprise. In addition, we have established a motor transport enterprise, which engages in all repair and maintenance work and provides services to the population, on the basis of the publishing house's garage. Incidentally, we would like to report that the publishing house allocated R96 million last year to cover the financial losses connected with motor transport servicing of the editorial boards. One cannot resign oneself to this situation in the future; that is why we have established an independent enterprise having the rights of a juridical person, which will be financed through its own activity. In the future, the publishing house will receive a percentage of its profit. [Aliyev] It is known that many enterprises have not been distributing wages for months, that some are completely idle, due to a lack of materials and raw materials and, moreover, that they have recently resorted to such actions, which you know about, as a reduction in workers. Will this not apply also to the publishing house? [Velimetov] Considering the present slump in production everywhere, perhaps a reduction in production and management personnel should follow in accordance with the severe laws of a market economy. However, we are not pursuing such a goal, since we are trying to carry out market reforms with consideration given to the human factor. Moreover, as I have already pointed out, despite all difficulties, we are finding capabilities to increase wages regularly, pay a 13th wage, and so on. [Aliyev] In conclusion, let us return to the recent interview "How They Have Robbed 'Azerbaijan,'" with the publishing house's general director. In particular, it was pointed out there that up to 25 commercial structures, which have practically not yielded any returns, were functioning in the publishing house in an incomprehensible manner. [Velimetov] Since that time, we have been able to free ourselves from many commercial organizations that were unprofitable for the publishing house. In particular, we parted with ones like the Milli Dastan Theater, Topaz, Tidzharet, Ulduz, the Torpag Store Fund, Gyulzar, Elzar, Agdam, Araz-9, Karvan, and Khazar-1. Legally sound documents to cancel contracts are still being prepared for some, in order to use the areas occupied by them more efficiently. It seems that if we should, for example, delay for half a year the implementation of the mentioned measures, the Azerbaijan publishing house would "fall ill" for a long time.... Naturally, it is very difficult to solve in a short time all the problems that have accumulated; of course, time is required to do this. I would like to believe that it will work for us and, consequently, for the good of the republic also.
