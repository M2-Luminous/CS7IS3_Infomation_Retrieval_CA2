Following numerous remarks by ministers and heads of departments, the bill was adopted as a whole. A decision was made to submit the land code to the Russian Parliament lower chamber on June 2 after it is finalised. "The land code which is still a bill, interferes with reforms", Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin summed up speeches on this top priority issue for Russia. "The absence of the legislative basis retards reforms in the agricultural sector and blocks channels for domestic and foreign investors. "On the other hand, we must not leave unsettled issues and legal contradictions," the premier stressed. Vice-Premiers Sergey Shakhray and Anatoliy Chubays spoke about the above problems when discussing the land code bill. They were interested in how members of the Russian Federation will behave themselves when the land code is adopted. They also asked why the bill favours the principle of state regulation of land relations at the expense of the rights of owner, including foreigners. The vice-premiers suggested that the document be finalised by the Government without shifting this task onto legislators. The Government Presidium also approved the bill on civil defence as a whole.
