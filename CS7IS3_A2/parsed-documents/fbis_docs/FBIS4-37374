Specifying the national, legitimate groups that President Husni Mubarak will invite to attend the congress, the committee recommended inviting representatives of the political parties, the People's Assembly and Consultative Council, professional associations, the General Labor Federation, specialized national councils, the universities, university faculty clubs, the media, writers, research centers, and scientific research institutes; individuals who have won state prizes; women's and popular societies; and people concerned with children's, youth, and sports affairs. The Preparatory Committee also recommended that representatives of the following groups be invited: student federations, local government councils, chambers of commerce, industrial federations, banks, economists, agricultural cooperatives, and people concerned with family planning and the anti-illiteracy campaign. It also recommended inviting a group of public figures and cabinet members. The Preparatory Committee recommended that every political party be represented by four members, one of whom would be the party leader. Regarding the working method and the organization of the National Dialogue General Congress, the Preparatory Committee recommended that the congress should meet to approve the committee's recommendations and then divide itself into three main committees: the Political Committee, the Social and Cultural Committee, and the Economic Committee. Every congress member would choose the committee he would like to join. He would list this as his first choice, and then another committee as his second. The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that every political party should have the right to attend the meetings of any of the three major committees. Every committee would then elect a moderator who would organize the debates and the committee's work. The Preparatory Committee stated that the moderator of each committee should have the right to summon any official to appear before it in line with the committee's request. The Preparatory Committee proposed that the National Dialogue General Congress should have an office staff consisting of its Moderator General, appointed by President Husni Mubarak, the elected moderators of the three committees, and three other members to be selected by the president from among the leaders and representatives of the political parties participating in the congress. The office staff would oversee the activities of the congress. Concerning the issues that the congress will debate, the Preparatory Committee decided that the Political Committee would discuss the revision and amendment of the law pertaining to the exercise of political rights, the fight against extremism and terrorism, and the revision and amendment of the law organizing the powers and responsibilities of the Socialist Prosecutor. The Preparatory Committee recommended that bills under discussion and the draft general budget should be submitted to the Consultative Council prior to their discussion by the People's Assembly. This would be in line with the recent tendency to give legislative powers to the Consultative Council, which would mean adopting a two-chamber system when discussing and passing bills. With regard to the economy, the Preparatory Committee recommended that the National Dialogue General Congress debate issues pertaining to continuing the economic reform process toward the attainment of a market economy, while at the same time specifying the state's role in this transformation. The Preparatory Committee recommended the elimination of all obstacles hindering economic development and investment. It called for providing backing for cooperatives and encouraging the citizens to participate in industrial and agricultural economic development plans. The Preparatory Committee's report stressed the importance of paying more attention to exports, regarding this as a strategic objective. It urged combating deviant practices, economic corruption, and the theft of public wealth. It recommended greater backing for domestic industry and agriculture vis-a-vis foreign competition. The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that the Social and Cultural Committee debate the future of education in Egypt, the anti-illiteracy campaign, population affairs and family planning, and human health. The committee emphasized the need to confront violence, fanaticism, and terrorism. It called for developing rural areas and creating a balance between them and urban areas.
