Speaking at the opening ceremony, he promised that the Civil Guard units will be limited to patrolling within the settlement itself. The police minister also said that five other Civil Guard stations will be opened shortly in the territories. Reporter Mark Weiss asked Minister Shahal about the significance of the opening: [Begin recording] [Shahal] A decision has been taken about a year ago, and the previous government decided to implement the idea of having this guard, like in any other parts in Israel. I think that the significance is that we are looking upon Ma'ale Adumim as any other town, and we rely on the citizens of this town to be responsible for their security, to help the police force. I think this is the political significance of the decision. [Weiss] Do you believe this new Civil Guard will be able to cooperate with the Palestinian police force to be set up under autonomy? [Shahal] Well, I think that there will be a need of cooperation. If the Palestinian police force cares for the security, to deal with and to prevent crime, I think that it will be necessary to cooperate on all levels, and we hope that this is going to happen. Any professional police force need this kind of cooperation. [end recording] [passage omitted]
