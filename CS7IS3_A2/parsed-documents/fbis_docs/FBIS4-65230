Dhasenakis. According to poll results, a majority of respondents (89 percent) agreed with the statement that "our country is going through a period filled with dangers," while only 11 percent disagreed, with figures cutting across party lines. When asked whether Greece "gained from the European Union (EU)," 23 percent agreed, 30 percent rather agreed, 19 percent rather disagreed, 18 percent disagreed, and 9 percent did not know. According to Dhasenakis, of those who agreed, 70 percent belong to the New Democracy (ND) and to Political Spring. When queried whether "Europeans are anti-Greek," 36 percent fully agreed and 28 percent rather agreed, compared to 17 percent who rather disagreed, 12 percent who disagreed, and 7 percent who did not know. The majority of those who agreed support the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and Political Spring. Suspicion of foreigners surfaced also in the response to the statement that "foreigners do not understand us in national issues," as 84 percent of the respondents agreed. Nevertheless, 65 percent disagreed with the statement that "Greece is strong and needs no one." Another question asked whether "there should be less government intervention in the economy." Some 57 percent agreed, while 32 percent did not. It is noteworthy, Dhasenakis points out, that according to poll results, majorities expressing reservations on the role of the state exist across party lines, and even in the Left. When the statement "tax evasion is not stealing" was put to the respondents, 8 percent agreed with it, 8 percent rather agreed, 16 percent rather disagreed, 63 percent disagreed, and 5 percent did not know. Dhasenakis reports that most of those who tolerate tax evasion said they had voted for Political Spring (19 percent) and for the ND (20 percent). He adds that no Communist Party (KKE) voter agreed with the statement. Finally, the poll also showed that 43 percent of Athenians believe that "pulling strings is a necessary evil."
