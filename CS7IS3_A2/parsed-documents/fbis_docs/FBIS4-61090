Pavel Grachev Officially Recognizes Military Trade Union"] [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the Central Committee of the Independent Trade Union of Servicemen of the Russian Federation [ITUS], have signed an agreement on cooperation "in the name of reaching understanding" on the basis of "respect for differing opinions." The trade union has been in existence for two years but throughout that time the Defense Ministry had not recognized it, thereby, to all appearances, hindering the inception of a trade union movement in the Armed Forces. The occasion for signing the agreement, according to Vladimir Piskurev, ITUS Central Committee deputy chairman, was provided by "optimal approaches to the resolution of pressing problems elaborated of late in the Army and the Navy." Thanks to these approaches the Defense Ministry and the trade union have signed an agreement under which both sides undertake to conduct joint work to form the Russian Federation Armed Forces on a professional basis. They have agreed to jointly solve questions connected with social adaptation of citizens discharged from military service, and with the construction of housing and training people in civilian specialties. Joint work of the Defense Ministry and the ITUS has been envisioned as opening new enterprises based on those being converted to civilian uses, and the creation of insurance guarantees and pensions for servicemen. The sides have undertaken not to let the Army and the Navy be involved in political gambles, not to let sink the level of defense capability and social protection for servicemen and citizens discharged into the reserves or into retirement, nor for their family members. The ITUS and the Defense Ministry have agreed to jointly "revive the glorious traditions of patronage links between military and work collectives, to spread the spiritual traditions of the Russian Army and Navy," as well as to uphold "the norms of moral behavior of servicemen in public life."
