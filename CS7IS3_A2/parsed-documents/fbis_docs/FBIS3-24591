A. Bagrov, Hydrometeorological Scientific Research Center; UDC 551.513.001.572:551.583] [Abstract] Linearization of the heat balance equation for the climatic system leads to the linear differential equation for the dependence of system temperature on CO[.sup]2[/], the main substance absorbing longwave radiation. Estimates of equation parameters make it possible to find simple connections between temperature and CO[.sup]2[/] content in the atmosphere. Attempts are made to predict the heat pattern for the next few decades. References 10 (Russian).
