In a statement issued a short while ago, the Conservative Party said Mr. Omar had agreed to consider a number of proposals. These include an extension of the amnesty for so-called political prisoners from the present cut-off date of December the 5th last year, to the date when final agreement is reached on the amnesty. Gary Alfonso reports: [Begin recording] [Alfonso] More than 50 right-wing supporters were arrested and subsequently released on bail after a spate of bombings shortly before the country's historic all-race elections just over a month ago. Few doubt that the explosions were aimed at destabilizing the election process. Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television last night that the people who carried out these acts, as well as the Chris Hani killers, Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis, were not eligible for amnesty. But according to CP leader, Ferdi Hartzenberg, who met with Mr. Omar this evening, agreement on what he called equal treatment for all had been reached earlier with President Mandela. [Hartzenberg] There was this agreement between us and the president that all the people will get the same treatment and the same principles will be applied, so I think we must first have a discussion with the minister. [Alfonso] Talks about amnesty for the right-wingers in question is not just an issue of an agreement between the Conservative Party and the minister of justice. The 1993 constitution would have to be revisited, and that can only be changed by Parliament and the government of national unity. [end recording]
