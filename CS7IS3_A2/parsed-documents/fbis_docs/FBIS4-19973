To this end, France and the other members of the UN Security Council must, in Talabani's opinion, adopt the following approach: "Send UN observers to Iraq (against Baghdad's wishes -- LE MONDE editor's note), increase the isolation of the Iraqi regime by forcing it from international bodies, and bring Saddam Husayn, in absentia if necessary, before a court for crimes against humanity." But Jalal Talabani admits that what he is advocating is difficult to achieve, particularly because the international community at present has other priority concerns, especially following its failure in Bosnia. However, he expects the members of the Security Council to "give political, moral, and financial support to the Iraqi opposition and to the formation by that opposition of an Iraqi coalition government which would have its seat in Irbil," the capital of Kurdistan. He stressed that such a government should only be formed if it enjoys prior international support. "Then," he said, "the Iraqi Government, which is already totally rejected by the entire population, irrespective of background, will fall." Mr. Talabani is convinced of it. In the same way, he is convinced that France, Russia, and China will not oppose the embargo imposed on Iraq by the Security Council since the Gulf War. He maintains that everybody, including the oil companies which are currently negotiating with the Iraqi authorities, knows that the Baghdad regime is politically and economically bankrupt. It would be nice to admit that he is right, but even THE NEW YORK TIMES recently suggested that it was time for the United States to review its attitude "in the direction of a possible end to the military and economic confrontation" with Baghdad. Mr. Talabani admits that there is no absolute guarantee that the isolation of the Iraqi regime will be maintained, but he states that the opposition is determined to make every effort to ensure it is continued, or even strengthened, and leads to the fall of Saddam Husayn. Meanwhile, Mr. Talabani wants international aid to Kurdistan "no longer to be in the form of humanitarian gifts, but aid to rebuild the infrastructure." He also asked for the lifting of sanctions on some products which are "essential for rebuilding and for getting industry working again." Finally, he expressed the hope that the Western protection of Kurdistan since April 1991 will continue and will no longer be subject to a six-monthly extension as is currently the case. The Kurds have been making these demands for a long time. In vain. [passage omitted]
