Despite the results, "is it a step forward in the consolidation of democracy. The political participation of those who were in the mountains is an example for the world," the chief of state added. "The mere fact that they held elections without a war is a great step forward," the president told reporters at the presidential palace. Alfonso Cabrera, secretary general of Guatemalan Christian Democracy [DCG], told ACAN that the elections represent one achievement of current President Alfredo Cristiani in the triumph of democracy. "Now it is the political parties' responsibility to ensure the welfare of the people and to consolidate democracy," the political leader said. Cabrera believes ARENA will win if there is a runoff election. Sidney Shaw, leader of the Union of the National Center, told ACAN that his party is pleased that 50 percent of the people voted and that this is a sure path toward peace. "The sad thing is that we are still at war in Guatemala, but hopefully in the next elections (1995) we will have the guerrillas registered as a political party," he stated. Shaw said that if there is a runoff election in El Salvador, there is a possibility that the leftist coalition headed by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) may win, because the DCG could offer to support it. He noted, however, that ARENA is strong and might obtain favorable results.
