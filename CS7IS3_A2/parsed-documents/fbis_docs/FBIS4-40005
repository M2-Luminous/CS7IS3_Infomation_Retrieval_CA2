The questions to the speaker were put by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Spektor. [Moroz] The decision to put myself of all people at the head of parliament is the optimal variant. In the difficult time Ukraine is going through, the reins of government should be in strong hands. In guiding parliament I am not supposed either to tug at the reins or to let them go slack. Today all normal politicians are Marxists in the best sense of the word who, having dialectically mastered the whole mass of knowledge, are creatively using it. If one tries to pressure me they'll know where to quit. [Spektor] Do you think selling land may mark the beginning of Ukraine's pulling out of the crisis? [Moroz] Given the Republic's economic situation, to turn land into a commodity, is a crime before the people and the future generations. An unemployed person in the West gets benefits 50 times that of a Ukrainian professor's salary. Granted dual citizenship, that person could buy with his benefit payment vast tracts of land. Selling land as a condition for getting foreign investments is unacceptable. Investors of this sort may pursue different ends. Investments for partnership may be secured in a dignified way, through a long-term lease for example. But the West's attitude to Ukraine is too short-sighted. Including to Ukraine's desire to become a non-nuclear power. No, we are not in a position to maintain nuclear weapons today. They should not become necessary for us in the future. But we cannot get rid of them overnight. Compensation to Ukraine for giving up nuclear weapons is in fact the West's payment for its own peace and security. But the West has decided to profit by someone else's misfortune; it has offered Ukraine only humiliating handouts. This, despite the fact that the desire of a nuclear power to go over to non-nuclear status has no precedent in world history so far. [Spektor] Do you agree with the widely held opinion that a number of deputies are engaged in commerce? [Moroz] Yes, this did and will happen. It is the possibility to engage in honest commerce that progressive politicians have been pressing for. But to benefit the state, the people, not just themselves alone. In order that commercial activities of deputies stay within the law, the commission on combating organized crime should be real, effective, and subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. This parliament is in for difficult and unpopular measures, with part of Ukraine's population, to reinvigorate the ailing economy -- primarily the sphere of regulating foreign currency turnover, and control over credit policy. There should be an efficient government in order to control economic life normally. The present government is no longer competent, it is incapable of creative work. Therefore a new government should be formed immediately without waiting for possible presidential elections: Anarchy is ruinous for Ukraine; if the paralysis of power drags on, the process of disintegration may become irreversible. [interview ends] For the time being Oleksandr Moroz is among those who are running for president. It is probable, however, that closer to the election date he will drop out. Most probably in favor of Leonid Kuchma.
