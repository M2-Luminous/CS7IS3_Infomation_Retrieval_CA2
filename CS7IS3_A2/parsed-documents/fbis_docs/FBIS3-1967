While he refrained from stating the specific inflation rate for January in an interview with a reporter yesterday, an authoritative official at the department concerned in the Guangzhou City government said: "It is certainly a little higher than last January's 19 percent." The precise figure is not known until it is released by the relevant government department, he said. The official said that the Guangzhou market was relatively stable in the Spring Festival period. But this official is concerned about preset price increases in Guangzhou. He said that pork recently went up by 23 or 24 or even 30 yuan per jin from an original price of less than 20, adding that such unreasonable rises are unacceptable to citizens. The government's new task is to exercise effective price controls while freeing prices, he continued. [sentence as received] Guangzhou's inflation rate in 1993 was as high as 25.1 percent, ranking third among other areas across the country. Guangzhou Deputy Mayor Chen Kaizhi stressed here two days ago that Guangzhou's inflation rate must be kept below 15 percent this year.
