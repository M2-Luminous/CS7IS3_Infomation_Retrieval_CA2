FR941102-1-00031 FR941102-1-00006 Section 42.8␣Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge Because the individual who is temporarily or permanently decertified may suffer a reduction in pay and possibly loss of his or her livelihood, the issue of due process for such individuals is a central concern of this rulemaking. MSHA is therefore committed to providing meaningful procedural safeguards at an appropriate level of due process. Morrisey v. Brewer , 408 U.S. 471 (1972). Thus, MSHA's multi-level review scheme within the Agency incorporating informal pre-decertification proceedings such as a notice of charges, explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for the certified person to present ``his side of the story'' should be sufficient to satisfy the test of ``what process is due'' when the informal pre-decertification proceedings are followed by a full post-decertification evidentiary hearing. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill , 470 U.S. 532 (1985). MSHA has carefully considered whether a certified person should get a formal pre-decertification evidentiary hearing. At this point in the rulemaking process, MSHA believes that the procedural due process safeguards proposed here are adequate under the requirements of the United States Constitution. In addition, MSHA believes that the potential harm to miner health and safety which may result from protracted pre-decertification litigation is an issue which must be carefully considered. Therefore, under proposed §42.8(a)(1), a person whose temporary or permanent decertification has been upheld by the administrator may obtain a de novo hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, United States Department of Labor, by filing a request for a hearing with the administrator within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's decision. The administrator would refer the request for hearing, along with the district manager's decision, and the administrator's decision to the Office of Administrative Law Judges within 10 calendar days of receipt of the hearing request. The starting date of the temporary or permanent decertification would not be affected by the certified person's decision to obtain a post-decertification hearing. The temporary or permanent decertification would be effective 30 days after the certified person's receipt of the administrator's decision, except as provided in proposed §42.8(e). The request for a hearing under 42.8(a)(2) would include a summary of the issues involved and the specific objections that the certified person has to the administrator's decision. Under proposed §42.8(c), the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case would expedite the hearing of the case because of the possibility that temporary or permanent decertification may significantly impair the certified person's livelihood. In addition to expediting the hearing, the administrative law judge would render his or her final decision in the case within 45 days of the close of the record. Proposed §42.8(d) would provide that decertification hearings before the Department of Labor Office of Administrative Law Judges would be governed by the rules of practice and procedure for hearings before the Office of Administrative Law Judges at 29 CFR part 18. Under proposed §42.8(e), a request for a stay would be filed within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's decision. The request for a stay would automatically stay the administrator's decision until the administrative law judge could rule on the stay request. The automatic stay would allow the administrative law judge sufficient time to obtain jurisdiction to rule on the request for a stay, and it would allow the status of the certified person to remain unchanged until the stay request was decided by the administrative law judge. In determining whether to grant a stay, the proposal would require under §42.8(f) that the administrative law judge would be required to consider the certified person's likelihood of success on the merits, and the potential harm to mine safety and health if the certified person were allowed to continue his or her work during the pendency of the case before the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge would also be required to clearly state the reasons for the granting or denial of a stay in any subsequent order concerning the granting or denial of the stay. MSHA envisions that a decision of the case rendered by an administrative law judge could then be appealed to the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. In the Mine Act, the Congress established a scheme whereby judicial review of all record-based Agency determinations is available only in the courts of appeal. After fully examining this statutory review scheme, MSHA believes that all judicial review of Secretarial action under the Mine Act lies exclusively in the courts of appeal, whether such review is specifically provided or whether the Mine Act is silent as to judicial review. See, Bituminous Coal Operators' Ass'n . v. Marshall , 82 F.R.D. 350 (D.D.C. 1979). Section 42.9␣Notice of Decertification. After a decision to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual becomes final, the district manager would immediately notify, in writing, the mine operator or operators for whom the certified person performs such work that he or she has been temporarily or permanently decertified. The district manager would also notify the appropriate Coal Mine Safety and Health or Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health Technical Compliance and Investigation Division (TCID) and the Qualification and Certification Unit of MSHA. The TCID would notify other district offices of the temporary or permanent decertification so that all districts would be aware of the change in status of the certified person.
