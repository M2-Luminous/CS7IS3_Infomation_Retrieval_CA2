The businessman believes that an increase in imports cannot be avoided because they are caused by the overall growth of the economy, but he considers that it is necessary to adopt measures so that the government "can achieve the highly touted objective of increasing exports." The trade deficit amounted to $2.404 billion during the first 4 months of the year, 378 percent greater than in the same period in 1993. Brunella maintained that financing exports, and granting loans with an interest rate equal to that in competitor countries, are the problems that have to be resolved. Finally, the businessman indicated that "the labor laws must be modified to create new job sources and achieve once and for all an efficient system of temporary admission."
