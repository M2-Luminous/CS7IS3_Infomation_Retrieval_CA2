Karosas: `I Will Never Admit That We Are Making Concessions to the Opposition...'" [Excerpts] [Kniuksta]One would like to speak about something pleasant and bright in the beginning of the new year. The current period is not indulgent to you, politicians. Talk about the party's split and extremely categorical statements by some of its members show that something is wrong in the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] family as well. Might I be wrong? [Karosas] The situation in the LDDP family, as you put it, is the same as in our society. Over those 50 years, we have acquired a bad habit of saying that everything used to be all right everywhere. Western parliamentarians even fight among themselves. Discussions in the legislature is a completely normal phenomenon. [passage omitted] The difference of opinions is a sign of the community's democratization. Another issue is that Seimas' [parliament] activities will not be effective until we develop a critical approach toward ourselves and overcome personal ambitions. I think that the Seimas' work last year was satisfactory. However, I would like the legislature to make greater progress over the next year. [Kniuksta]Nevertheless, let us recall Vytautas Petkevicius' statements, Vytautas Bubnys' withdrawal from the LDDP faction, and the conference of LDDP members in the Klaipeda region. Might you have underrated those people? Might you have not proposed some higher positions to them? By the way, do you agree that the LDDP faction has some casual people who do not, perhaps, deserve their status of Seimas members? Certainly, this is an internal party problem. Believe me, however, that it interests the community as well. [Karosas] All of us are casual people in the Seimas to a certain extent. Many of us did not intend to become professional politicians. We were just fated to become so. Disagreements had to come out sooner or later, because since the very beginning, our party has had not only moderate members but also militant or more radically oriented ones. The latter imagine that a democratic state can be created by resolute and extreme actions. Some of them often proposed to change employees in self-governments immediately, in a word, to make serious changes, forgetting that in a normal community employees can be dismissed only in line with the law. I understand the legitimate anger of some people. They were painfully mistreated, blackmailed, and laid off by the former government. Now they are demanding the same treatment for those who did that. However, someone must rise above this rage and think how to lay the foundation for our democratic state. I suppose that we must undertake this mission. This orientation has a perspective and meets the standards of a civilized and democratic community. I hope that the new majority that will come after the next elections will discontinue this type of behavior. It will abide by the law, recognize that one ruling party replaces another, and so on. I do not claim that there is no irresolution in the activities of our party, but I speak out against the arbitrary restructuring of government institutions by ignoring the law and forgetting that such actions will wind up the coil of hatred. A democratic state cannot be created in such a manner. [Kniuksta]By the way, the LDDP is being reprimanded for lack of resolution. Do you agree that your party is continuing the chain of mistakes begun by Sajudis? I have heard in Samogitia [Lithuania's northwestern part] that the LDDP works as though it lived in 1988 and tries to flatter the opposition. However, nothing good will come out of this friendship because V. Landsbergis' tactics are very clear. [Karosas] I understand those opponents who think and talk like this. Unfortunately, the current opposition is not that of a democratic community. It follows the principle "the worse the better" and does its best to implement it. They think that this will help them to win more political capital. Let us remember the opposition's behavior after our victory in the elections. Its high-ranking members were travelling throughout the world and spreading the thought that communists were returning to power, that Soviet socialism would be restored, that no foreigner would invest in Lithuania, and so on. [passage omitted] This is an open sabotage of state interests and a damage to its prestige. Party interests are never raised above the state in normal society. The opposition forgets that its blackmailing statements or actions are damaging to the state's interests. I will never admit that we are making concessions to the opposition. We simply want to stop winding the coil of hatred which I have already mentioned. The fact that a party has its majority in the Seimas and its government does not mean that such authorities are agreeable to all society. The majority rule cannot be identified with the state and society, because about one-third of the Lithuanian people voted for the opposition. Certainly, it is totally abnormal when officials, who are our political opponents, openly ignore Seimas laws or government resolutions. We have not yet managed to reach an agreement with the opposition because the latter imagines that a consensus would be ruinous to it. A consensus would be useful to the state, and thus, to the ruling party as well. All this is unacceptable to the opposition. We are forced to follow the principle of the so-called "voting machine." We have no other option if we want to do something beneficial for the state. However, we cannot ignore the opposition, and a certain search for a dialogue is essential. Another issue is that our success here is rather poor, and this irritates people. However, we must overcome this hostility. If we turned away from the opposition, we would create a totalitarian rather than a democratic state. By the way, the opposition has simply provoked us since the very first days of Seimas' work. [passage omitted] [Kniuksta] Thus, the LDDP is forced to maneuver, although some people assess such tactics differently. [Karosas] [passage omitted] One of the more prominent achievements of our moderate policies or maneuvering is that the division of society has almost disappeared today. This success cannot be denied. When two years ago we went to rural districts, people would speak only about Brazauskas, Landsbergis, and other politicians. We hear something completely different today: They usually raise specific everyday problems. If we had not pursued such moderate policies, we would again have two distinct camps today. Therefore, I understand the opposition's pressure on television. By taking advantage of a million-strong public, it would be possible to incite people again and engage in overall negation of any positive sides of the current government. [Kniuksta] By the way, some of your opponents also admit this. Tensions have eased after the elections, and the constant search for enemies has disappeared. It is enough to remember the speeches of the former Supreme Council chairman [Landsbergis] about crawling coups, revolutions, packs of dogs, and so on. However, can a situation with strikes and pickets of teachers, medical workers, and farmers be called stable? [Karosas] This stability is fragile. However, I think that everyone would agree that prices in stores do not change each day. This is incomparable with what we had six months or a year ago. Finally, let us take hot water and heating. These are also the signs of stability. Certainly, these are only the first signs, and we have nothing much to rejoice in. Life, albeit poor, is more stable, and people have some hope in the future at least. Strikes and pickets occur throughout the world. They are especially attractive to people who have left the socialist camp. Formally, these people dissociate themselves from socialism, but actually they want it. Recent sociological studies show that only 6 percent of those polled believe that they are themselves responsible for their lives. All others accuse the Seimas, the president, and the government, rather than themselves. They want the state to take care of them, plan prices, crops, and so on. The most interesting thing is that this socialism is also advocated by the conservatives or our opposition. For example, Mr. G. Vagnorius' proposals concerning the indexation of incomes and agriculture clearly demonstrate that the conservatives want socialism. What a paradox! The worst thing is that strikes and pickets are extremely politicized. [passage omitted] Behaving in this manner, it is as though the opposition does not understand that the disruption of political stability is dangerous to Lithuania, particularly against the background of the recent events in Russia. For example, the conservatives' congress declares the idea of early elections, while Zhirinovskiy wins the elections in Russia a week later. The destabilization encouraged by our opposition coincides with similar processes in Russia, which is extremely dangerous to the state. Finally, what does the unstable situation mean to foreign investors? Lithuania's prestige is low as it is, while we want to continue to shake it with strikes and so on. How can we say that the conservatives help the state if they tolerate and encourage such acts? [Kniuksta]Let us go back to the economy. Memorandums are in fashion today. The liberals also write them. In their opinion, LDDP's economic policy ruins the hope for economic reform in the country. The LDDP which won the elections by the majority of farmers' votes ignores their interests. [Karosas] The liberals have already received one bitter lesson during the previous elections by demonstrating the idea of pure liberalism typical of the late 20th century. It seems that this was not enough for them. They are proposing pure liberalism as the greatest achievement and the clearest doctrine forgetting our reality and the fact that the current free market is a social market. By the way, some liberals, angry with their defeat in the elections, criticize us for socialism, while the social democrats accuse us of liberalism. We, as social democrats, are told that LDDP policies are not social democratic. However, the social democratic policy can be implemented only in an efficient social economy of a free market. [passage omitted] We are only creating an economic foundation for society based on a social market, which is a necessary condition in implementing the principles of social democracy. Therefore, the state must look for provisional options. We engage in discussion with farmers who sometimes drag us into the planned economy which has no future. However, we cannot reject their request to regulate certain issues. Farmers were instructed for many years what to grow and how much. Last spring, the government rendered much assistance to farmers, but this support returned as a stone to its garden. Farmers said that we had helped them to sow the crop but that we did not want to buy it. Such "clashes" are likely to occur many times. People must get accustomed to the "do-it-yourself" principle. We understand perfectly well, however, that the state and its institutions must help people in the transitional period. Certainly, certain "clashes" between the state and the people are inevitable. However, when the state does not do something, people themselves must undertake it. [passage omitted] [Kniuksta] We hear from the same people that the LDDP is doing nothing, that it is drifting down the stream, and that all achievements are spontaneous. [Karosas] I think that the element of spontaneity is a normal social condition, but I do not agree with the thought that the LDDP is doing nothing. Last year, we created the basis for the continuation of economic reform and restrained inflation. We know that A. Slezevicius' government inherited some debts -- $43 and $28 million for gas and nuclear fuel, respectively. The government paid off these debts over a short period of time and created conditions for the normalization of gas deliveries and the production of electric energy. Does this say nothing? [Kniuksta]I think that the future of industry is very problematic. Although still breathing, industry is clearly dying. Let us take the system of education, for example. It is obvious that there are too many higher educational establishments in Lithuania, but not in the sense that Lithuania has enough educated people. We simply cannot afford so many higher schools. The same applies to the national defense system. True, Mr. Landsbergis holds a different opinion on these problems. I say to him: "How can I invite 100 guests if I have only one refrigerator of food. Will I not look ridiculous?" The professor replies that there must be three refrigerators full of food. From where can we take them? Many structures of our young state were created according to the principle "we must have the same as in the West." Since a drop in production was catastrophic, the burden of supporting such expensive structures became heavier on taxpayers. [passage omitted] [Kniuksta] The Council of the Citizens' Charter maintains that the interests of the ruling LDDP dominate radio and television programs. In my opinion, LDDP's propaganda is insufficient. The LDDP underrates the power of the mass media and advocates its activities too little. Another thing is when some mass media have a liking for a particular political force.... [Karosas] Yes, we advocate the ideas of our party and the state insufficiently. We did not care about this when we began our work in the Seimas. Now we are trying to speak on the radio and write more articles. Many opponents still imagine that the ruling force has newspapers, television, and radio in its hands. However, the mass media themselves choose sources of information in democratic society. I think, and people will agree with me, that we hear more representatives of the right-wing opposition on radio and television today. The worst thing is that we lack official information about the government's work even in the state-supported mass media. [passage omitted] It is useless to try to change something immediately. Much time will pass until we develop people's political culture. This cannot be achieved by administrative measures. On the other hand, it is abnormal when some papers defile the president elected by the nation, or when the chief of television prevents the director of the Statistics Department from addressing the public and familiarizing it with official data about the country's economic and financial condition. [Kniuksta] What are your personal relations with Vytautas Landsbergis? [Karosas] We maintain certain official relations. I do not like to characterize my political opponent and I consider it to be incorrect. I can only say that no politician, if he is democratically oriented, should assume the role of a messiah, the only true defender of independence. If a politician lacks self-criticism, and if he sees only mistakes in the behavior of others, he will inevitably raise himself above the rest and will readily or unwillingly assume the position of the father of a nation or a state. Nor do I like Machiavellian politicians. [Kniuksta] How are you preparing for the elections to self-government councils? By the way, how do you assess the elections in Kaisiadorys [elections did not take place due to low voter turnout]? Have you learned any lessons? [Karosas] The elections have shown that people have become less politicized and that they cannot be bought with political chatter. People are beginning to understand that impossible things cannot really be accomplished. We are moving from the politicized stage in the community's life to the economy. Therefore, the force that will propose comprehensible and realistic measures for the resolution of problems will win the elections. I think that our government has possibilities to resolve the problems over the remaining three years in such a way that would increase our prestige during the next elections. [passage omitted]
