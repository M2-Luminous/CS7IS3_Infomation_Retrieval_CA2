He said: This savage act was in fact a declaration of war against Islam, and those who have no respect whatsoever for the status of the family of the prophet undoubtedly adhere to no doctrine or school of thought. The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran added: The perpetrators of such acts should know that such crimes will lead to nothing but the further consolidation of the revolution's foundations. Moreover, such acts draw the attention of Muslims and the followers of other divine religions to the scared notions of Islam. Ayatollah Emami-Kashani described the terrorist actions of the Monafeqin throughout the history of the Islamic revolution. He then commemorated the martyrs of 7 Tir [bomb blast in Islamic Republic Party on 28 June 1981], of Mashhad'a 'Ashura [bomb blast on 20 June 1994], and the other martyrs of the revolution. He said: The recent act by the Monafeqin was condemned in many countries. However, mere condemnation of these savage acts, by Islamic communities and Shiite and Sunni scholars is not enough, and the Islamic world has a duty to react against such crimes.
