Following the four written-off "Foxtrot" class Russian submarines (IZVESTIYA No. 9), the Pacific Fleet has apparently sold another 10 "Golf-2" submarines, capable of carrying three SS-5 sea-based ballistic missiles, to North Korea. The unease in the countries in the region neighboring North Korea is entirely explicable. Pyongyang does not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to monitor Korean nuclear reactors, thereby reinforcing the world community's suspicions that secret plans exist in North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. "Nodong" missiles, copied from the famous "Scuds," have been flying out of the country's military test sites. Reports obtained by IZVESTIYA at the Navy Press Center provide no grounds for suspecting the Russian military of having an frivolous attitude. A contract has been signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which, by an edict of the president, has been authorized to sell written-off warships for scrap. An agreement has been signed with the Japanese firm "Toen [name as transliterated] Trade Inc." for the sale of 12 diesel submarines manufactured in the period between 1961 and 1968. They have outlived their service life and, so we were told, it is no longer safe to go to sea in them -- indeed, it is now quite impossible to do so. Under the contract, all the submarines have been brought to a condition which rules out the possibility of restoring them for naval use. All weapons, basic equipment, and precious metals have been removed from them. The "Toen Trade Inc." firm will receive only the hulls, which it will supply itself to a ship-cutting enterprise. Under the terms of the contact the company does not have the right to re-sell the submarines for purposes other than in the form of scrap, and it is obliged to supply documents confirming that the hull has been cut into pieces. Defense Ministry experts will be on site to monitor the fulfillment of the contract. The Japanese company has so far collected only one submarine. The contract does not stipulate where the submarines will be cut up or who will finally get the scrap. The Navy Press Center refused to name the sum involved in the contract, saying merely that the fleet did not get a bad bargain.
