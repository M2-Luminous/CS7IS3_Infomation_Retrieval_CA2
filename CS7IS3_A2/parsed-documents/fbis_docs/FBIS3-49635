"Mr. Butrus-Ghali assured us that the planning required for these operations would take place as quickly as possible," Juppe said. The other countries contributing troops for these missions -- Britain, Canada and Denmark -- would be in touch with the UN secretary-general to this end, he added. The United Nations Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia plans to reopen the airport at Tuzla and to relieve the Canadian UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica. "It is not a matter of launching air raids against Tuzla or Srebrenica," Juppe said. "It is a question of organizing the rotation of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica and clearly warning the belligerents that if they prevent UNPROFOR's freedom of movement, they will be exposing themselves to our reaction." In Tuzla, Juppe said the main point was not "conquering the airport" but "saying that we are installing ourselves at this airport to assure its operation." "If anyone opposes this operation, there will be an immediate reaction from UNPROFOR and from its aerial coverage," he said.

General Briquemont said in a statement that artillery units of President Alija Izetbegovic's army had opened fire on Serbian positions around 10.00 a.m. (0900 GMT) Tuesday, ending two days of calm around the capital. The journalists said, however, that shells had fallen on Sarajevo several hours earlier and that no protest had been issued against Serbian forces following that attack. International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official Jessica Barry said that a shell had fallen on the Red Cross's Bosnian headquarters at 9.15 a.m. (0815 GMT), killing one person and injuring two ICRC employees. UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said that government forces had fired 200 shells against the Bosnian Serbs, who responded by firing 600 shells at Sarajevo. "That's a large number of shells fired by the Bosnian side, which installed artillery pieces near civilian objectives in the centre of Sarajevo," Aikman said. [passage omitted]
