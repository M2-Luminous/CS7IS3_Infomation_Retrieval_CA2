The report added that the U.S. Senate Investigative Committee should make Laos a priority in its efforts. The following are the facts about this issue that everyone should know: After the end of the Indochinese war in 1975, the Lao side returned to the U.S. side all nine American prisoners of war. Since then, the U.S. side has admitted that there are no more American prisoners of war in Laos. Nevertheless, for humanitarian reasons and acting in response to requests from the U.S. Government, the Lao Government has always cooperated with the U.S. side in searching for and collecting information about personnel missing in action in Laos. In 1985, 1986, and up to the present time, Lao officials have respectfully cooperated with American officials and done their best in conducting surveys and excavating areas around plane crashes in 11 provinces, in accordance with all suggestions and plans from the U.S. side. Between 1985 and November 1993, the two sides jointly conducted surveys and excavations on 34 occasions in 11 provinces. So far, the remains of some 50 American pilots of planes shot down in wartime have been discovered and retrieved. The total number of American personnel missing in action in Laos, in accordance with official U.S. figures, is 514. In addition, to remove the doubt and suspicion of the U.S. side, which has claimed that American prisoners of war remain alive in Laos in accordance with information it has received from certain exiled Lao refugees or deceivers who have taken advantage of the situation to make money or profit from other people's suffering, the Lao side has agreed to allow technical teams from of both countries to jointly investigate all suggestions of the U.S. side. Examples are the case of Captain Borah, who was found after the investigation to be a Lao Theuang tribesman, namely (a Lao), and the case of First Lieutenant (Kha,) who was later found to be a German businessman running his business in Thailand, namely (Gunbe). There were also similar cases in Xieng Khouang and Hopua Phan Provinces. Another recent one was the case of a person in Toumlan District, who was later found to be a physician attached to (?a medical team operating in a border area). All cases of live prisoners of war turned out to be groundless after joint investigation. They are all fabricated stories. In view of the fact that the technical teams and officials of both sides have unanimously concluded that progress has been achieved in cooperation in dealing with the problem of prisoners of war and personnel missing in action, what are the hidden purposes and intentions of the Voice of America in its indiscriminate and irresponsible reports? The Lao people feel very disappointed about this outdated trick. The Lao people have now asked themselves why in the world does our country have to sincerely cooperate with the U.S. side, despite the fact that during the war, tens of thousands of their sons and nephews were killed by U.S. bombs and they have not been paid any compensation. If the Voice of America, which has served as the mouthpiece officially conveying the views of the U.S. Government, continues to carry such slanderous news, it will only continue to increase doubt and suspicion between the peoples of the two countries. The only result will be that the cooperation in searching for the personnel missing in action during the war will be affected.
