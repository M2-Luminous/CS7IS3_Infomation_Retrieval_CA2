The Muslim students from various institutions stated in a mass religious meeting here Saturday that they were ready to engage in a holy war (jihad) as volunteers for Bosnia. The young Muslims also urged the government and the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) to immediately prepare the sending of volunteers to Bosnia, expressed their support for Indonesia's effort to open diplomatic relations with the Bosnian Government and to sever diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. "We also fully support Indonesia's active role as NAM [Nonaligned Movement] chairman in urging the UN Security Council to punish Zionist Israel and Serbs over the killing of Muslims in Hebron and Bosnia, and call on Indonesian Muslims to give more material assistance for the struggle of Bosnian Muslims," they said. An executive of the North Sumatra chapter of the Indonesian Islamic Propagation Council, Ilham, told ANTARA that his side has distributed hundreds of registration forms for volunteers to Bosnia.

At least 35 university students have registered themselves to become volunteers to Bosnia.
