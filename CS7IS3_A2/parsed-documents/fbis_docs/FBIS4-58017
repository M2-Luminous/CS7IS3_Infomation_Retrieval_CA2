As many of you are aware, I have been attending conferences of heads of government of the OECS [Organization of Eastern Caribbean States] from its inception. Indeed, you accorded me the distinct honor of allowing me to be its first chairman even though I was not a prime minister. In that sense, I spent the last 14 years in this council impersonating a head of government. And many of you spent the last 14 years in complicity. I am pleased that by electing to government the party which I have the honor to lead, the people of Antigua and Barbuda have chosen to relieve not only me of the role of impersonator but you of the burden of collusion. On a serious note, I place on record my profound thanks to OECS heads of government past and present, who over the last 14 years, have treated me with such great consideration. Mr. Chairman, it is fitting for me that the first OECS heads of government conference I should attend as prime minister is held in St. Lucia. For on this island and under your wise and mature guidance, Mr. Chairman, our countries have together made many practical decisions which have advanced the economic and political interests of our subregion. Therefore, while coming to St. Lucia for the first time as prime minister is for me a beginning, it is also a continuum for the beginning benefits from a solid foundation of experience gained in the council. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, more than anyone else I am conscious that in recent years Antigua and Barbuda appears to have stepped back from the regional movement. We appear to be standing apart, indifferent of the faith and fortunes of our regional kith and kin. This is not so. In this case, appearance belies reality. The vast majority of the people of Antigua and Barbuda continue to regard the Commonwealth Caribbean and the OECS, especially, as an extension of themselves. They are keenly aware that ultimately their authenticity as a culture group, their survival as an economic entity, and their political legitimacy in a world which increasingly marginalizes small and powerless states lies in concerted economic and political action with the Caribbean family and more particularly their West Indian brothers and sisters. Over the last few years, Antigua and Barbuda has been preoccupied with its internal political affairs. Our preoccupation flowed from the fact that after more than 50 years in which he dominated political life in our country, Vere Cornwall Bird, Sr. was departing the national stage. As you are aware, any change creates insecurity and uncertainty. When the change in power replaces a leader who over five decades symbolized dependability and safety to the nation, even greater apprehension arises. In such a milieu, as people search for something to fill the void, opportunities are created for the untried and the untested in whose hands neither Antigua and Barbuda's affairs nor the influence of such affairs upon neighboring territories could be certain. Mr. Chairman, it is as well that in Antigua and Barbuda we took the time to settle our internal affairs for we have emerged from it a stronger and more stable democracy. While the campaigning was intense, our elections were conducted without violence or loss of life. The decision of the people was accepted peacefully by our two political parties, both of which are represented in parliament. We have now set to the task of governance through established democratic institutions, including a virulent if sometimes unnecessarily vicious, unfettered opposition press, enhancing, as it does, the space for free political expression and action. Such a democracy is good for the maintenance of stability in Antigua and Barbuda. It can only be beneficial to the security of the region as a whole and, particularly, to the member-states of this organization. Mr. Chairman, our preoccupation with our internal political affairs led only to a lowering of regional concern on our national agenda, not to its removal. That decisive period in our nation's history is now behind us and we can again lift our eyes above the plane of national full contributions to the strengthening of our institutions. [sentence as heard] We will play our part on the international stage to augment the bargaining strength of the OECS against third countries and groups of countries. As we survey the global landscape, it appears beset with difficulties for our small island-states. An objective analysis paints a worryisome picture. The Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] area faces higher prices for goods and services imported from North America and Europe. Dwindling aid, increasing international rivalry for private capital, both loans and investments, is reducing shares of our two principal markets in Europe and North America and intensifying competition for tourism. It is becoming increasingly clear that the preferential market which our countries and others in the Caribbean community have enjoyed in the EC will, in fact, disappear. Already, trade preferences have increased, the share of Central American exports to the EC to approximately the same level as Caribbean exports. And recent developments arising from the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade signal that bananas and sugar from the so-called (?dollar) countries, particularly Central America and Spanish-speaking Caribbean states, will enjoy an even bigger share of the EC market. Banana growers in our part of the Caribbean will not be competing on a level playing field. The absence of strict labor laws and, therefore, poor wages paid to Central American workers, combined with the resources of the U.S. companies which own many plantations and market the bananas, place eastern Caribbean countries at a severe disadvantage. I need hardly tell this audience that any significant loss of the banana market in the EC by the Windward Islands will have a most distressing effect on the foreign exchange earnings of the eastern Caribbean dollar (?area) and on our (?reserves). In turn, this will adversely affect our ability to pay for the import of goods and services. The combined effect of less foreign exchange and a contraction of the import sector would lead to a consequential reduction in public sector programs and to unemployment. In short, economic decline could stare us in the face. NAFTA offers no more promising an outlook for trade. Mexico's involvement in the free trade area with the United States and Canada threatens to adversely effect Caribbean exports to the U.S. and Canada, especially the assembly industry, textiles, and the apparel industry. The limited access provided to the U.S. market by the Caribbean Basin Initiative [CBI] and to Canada by the Caricom agreement pales into insignificance when compared with the access Mexico will enjoy on the NAFTA. When Mexico's comparatively lower labor costs and its proximity to the U.S. market is factored into the equation, the Caribbean will obviously lose market share. By the same token, hurrying into NAFTA as it stands is not desirable in our opinion. Free trade groups from NAFTA would cripple, if not kill, many of our industrial enterprises, whose production could not match their cheaper prices. In this connection, we must renew our efforts to seek parity with Mexico for Caribbean goods that now enter the U.S. market under the CBI while we negotiate ways to enter NAFTA with agreed mechanisms to relieve the effects of reciprocal free trade with three giants such as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Mr. Chairman, we, together with other Caribbean Basin countries, are not without some collective bargaining strength in relation to NAFTA. CBI beneficiary countries have increased their spending in the United States. Purchases of U.S. goods and services grew from $340 million in 1986 to $11 billion in 1992, providing for 200,000 direct jobs and 1 million indirect jobs in the United States. And with many of our countries, the U.S. enjoys a balance of trade surplus. But we, in the OECS and the wider Caricom, have to forge strategic coalitions or alliances with other countries or groups of countries to promote our interests. In this context, an alliance with other Caribbean Basin countries is imperative. For without such an alliance, large groupings such as NAFTA and the EC, faced with contending interests from Central American countries, on the one hand, and Caricom countries, on the other, may find it very difficult to be evenhanded in their treatment. We may well be the losers. Further, to the extent that Caricom countries could agree a joint position with Central American countries and the Dominican Republic for negotiations with NAFTA and the EC, to that extent we can expect no collective bargaining position. The decision by Caricom heads of government to adopt the recommendation of the West Indian commission and create an association of Caribbean states is extremely important. However, we should guard against the possibility of such an association unintentionally becoming the servant of its most powerful masters and accidentally neglecting the interests of its smaller and weaker members, which is what Caricom states would be. It is essential that the association reflects the consensus and interests of its membership and that it be dominated by no one country or group of countries, that it mediate contending views between different groups, and that it construct a relationship among its members that serves the community of interests. In this regard, Mr. Chairman, I repeat a position which I (?enunciated) last month in Basse-Terre, when in the presence of our colleague, the prime of St. Kitts, I spoke at the 12th annual banquet of the St. Kitts and Nevis private sector. I said then...[pauses] And I strongly favor the location of the headquarters of the association of Caribbean states in Jamaica, which sits almost geographically between the English- and Spanish-speaking Caribbean Basin countries. After all, it was to Jamaica that the great father of Latin American liberation, Simon Bolivar, retreated after his earlier failure to liberate Venezuela from Spanish domination. It was from there that he issued his famous Jamaica Letter, which set a successful plan for the independence of so many Latin American states, including Bolivia, named after him. Both historically and geographically, Jamaica lends itself as a hospitable location for the headquarters of the association. I hope that in this meeting, we, in the OECS, would endorse this suggestion, that Jamaica should be the location of the headquarters and that we could jointly advance the idea in the councils of Caricom and the wider Caribbean Basin area. Another element in our approach to the issue of NAFTA should be the special relationship that Caricom countries have always enjoyed with Canada. As the West Indian commission pointed out in its report, and I quote, together, we are the Commonwealth countries of the hemisphere; that shared history has forged strong ties over the years and provides a natural bond; there is every reason why we should seek to engage the Canadian Government at the highest level in working out our arrangements. To me, to Antigua and Barbuda, it is a significant indication of Canada's continuing goodwill to the Caribbean that last month the Canadian International Development Agency agreed to finance a Caricom study on the likely effects of NAFTA and the strategy options for the community. A Canada-Caricom-heads-of-government conference would be beneficial to this process at this time. Perhaps we in the OECS can take the initiative in trying to structure such a meeting at the earliest opportunity. What about the United States, itself? We have to be cognizant of how Washington works. It is a city of lobbying, whether we like it or not. We will get little movement beyond what the U.S. Government thinks it can sell to Congress unless we help to accelerate that movement ourselves. And to do so, we have to mount a lobby in Washington that includes but does not rely solely on our embassies there. Contact has to be made with every congressman and senator. That could make a difference to how we are treated in NAFTA. We have to inform them, educate them, and win them over, if not all, the majority. Jamaica has had lobbyists in Washington for some time. The Cheddi Jagan government, in Guyana, has had lobbyists since it won the election in 1992. And, significantly, Trinidad and Tobago has announced that it too has employed a firm of lobbyists. We, in the OECS countries, should do no less if we expect to be heard by the ears of Washington. With regard to the EC, Mr. Chairman, in the past, we tended to focus our efforts in Britain, neglecting the reality that many powers over trade and policy have passed to the EC and its executive agency, the European Commission, in Brussels. Lastly, there has been an attempt to strengthen our presence in Brussels, but it needs to be more permanent and in greater numbers. Our collective voting and lobbying strength is important. But to be able to utilize such voting and lobbying strength in Brussels, we require a prominent presence, working in a coordinated way. I know that we have all agreed to have Mr. (Larocque) represent us. I would like, however, in the course of this meeting to suggest that we have to deal with the question of our voting rights, as to whether or not we will vote as one or we will vote with the full impact of our several votes. Increasingly, too, lobbying efforts have become as important in Brussels as the European Commission evolves into a labyrinth of discreet decisionmaking departments. It may serve the OECS well to consider retaining well-placed lobbying experts and, on a joint basis, to supplement the work of closely coordinated missions. Mr. Chairman, as we survey our regional scene, it is striking that Haiti stands out as the country in dire need of attention. Its attempt to establish a democratic system of government after two centuries was aborted by a military coup, supported by a financial elite opposed to economic and political reform. As countries committed to democracy, free and fair elections, and the unfettered expression of the will of the people, it is axiomatic that we find government and military force reprehensible. The weekly slaughter of hundreds of Haitians by agents of the military regime and the suffering of the vast majority of the dispossessed in this society are matters which cause us, as Caribbean people, even greater concern. That there is need for action to remedy the Haitian situation is beyond question. However, as small Caribbean states, we should view with some apprehension any suggestion of military intervention unless such intervention were under the auspices of the United Nations and with the authority of the Security Council. As it stands, I would advised the established principle justifying (?new) intervention under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter a threat to peace does not appear at this moment to apply in the case, which creates a difficulty for us. [sentence as heard] Mr. Chairman, the weekly reports of (?massive) rapes and mutilations and the continuous reports now that the current voluntary embargo is causing the suffering only for the poor, while the Army and its rich financial backers continue to enjoy a good life. Good conscience demands that to use our concerted efforts to call for a realistic remedy to this situation by the United Nations. I hope at this meeting we can agree to make such a call and advance it in Caricom, the OAS, and the United Nations for the benefit of the Haitian people. It only remains for me to say, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of those of us who are privileged to be guests in St. Lucia, what a great pleasure it is to be here. St. Lucians are reputed to be generous by nature and charming by inclination. I have no doubt that before this visit has ended, many here will have found reason to support my testimony. In advance and in anticipation, Mr. Chairman, I thank you, the Government and the people of St. Lucia, for the hospitable environment which we all know we will enjoy. Thank you, very much for being patient with me. [applause]
