This was announced by Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo. Speaking to Christophe Boisbouvier he explained the objectives of the government to end the institutional vacuum created after President Ntaryamira died together with the Rwandan president. [Begin recording] [Ngendahayo] The government decided to make 1 July--Independence Day--as the deadline. It decided that by that date we should have a president duly elected and sworn-in. [Boisbouvier] Who will elect him? [Ngendahayo] Deputies, the National Assembly, obviously. [Boisbouvier] Which party will the candidate who will be elected come from? [Ngendahayo] According to the agreements signed in Kigobe and (?Kazagar) the candidate should come from within the ranks of the Frodebu [Front for Democracy in Burundi]. [Boisbouvier] What if the Uprona [Party of National Unity and Progress] were to oppose this process? Do you have a sufficient majority in the Assembly to force the issue through? [Ngendahayo] In any case the Frodebu has a very large majority in the National Assembly, enabling it to get a constitutional bill through without too many risks. This is the first point. The second is, the attitude adopted by the national army in days to come: either it follows legality, in which case the process is well under way, or it chooses the path of adventure and we then experience problems of a putsch as we did last October.
