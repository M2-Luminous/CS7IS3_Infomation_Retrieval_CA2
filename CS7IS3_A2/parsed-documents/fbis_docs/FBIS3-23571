Vodopyanov: "Russia Needs a Proper Navy"] [Text] During the course of preparations for the Russian Navy's 300th Anniversary celebration, besides pride for its glorious many-century history, military seamen are also experiencing well-grounded concern for the navy's future. It is already a fact that last year, for the first time in many decades, not a single ship was laid down at Russia's shipyards and the completion of ships that they had begun building was terminated or is being conducted at extremely low rates in the background of the massive withdrawal of both obsolete combatants and ships and also those that we could quite well preserve with proper repair and modernization from the navy's combat strength -- this causes nothing other than bitterness for people who are devoted to the sea. How do we explain the situation that has developed -- is it due only to economic difficulties or, maybe, it is due to the sum total of other causes as well? Our correspondent's conversation with Russian Federation First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin began with that question. [Kokoshin] The Russian Navy's difficult situation is explained not only by the complexities of the current situation in Russia and by the political and economic consequences of the collapse of the USSR, but also by past mistakes in the construction of the navy when combatants, basing and ground-based support and maintenance systems were built; that is, everything that is called infrastructure was not developed to the proper extent. We can say the same thing about naval weapons and also about reconnaissance and target designation systems. Another aspect: Even after their acceptance into the inventory, as they say, "we spent a lot of time figuring out how to use" the ships and naturally they could not completely accomplish their combat missions. What is more, at the present time the missile cruiser "Petr Velikiy" is being completed at the Baltiysk Plant. Only presently will all of the weapons appear on the fourth ship of that design that should have been installed on the first. The enormous delays with time periods for the development of the combatants' assemblies and individual elements and weapons systems are also having an impact. So the navy is also a victim of the extremely difficult crisis situation of our economy and, at the same time, of those problems of ship construction that have accumulated over the last several decades. [Vodopyanov] Obviously, the serious situation with housing and other social support issues which have developed in the fleets could also be included here? [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. The trouble is that the ships, including even the outstanding ones -- were developed and essentially they forgot about people. This concerns not only the officers but also the rank and file. And we think that a large number of accidents in the navy, including cases of suicides, are associated with the fact that the crews are in the enclosed area of ship spaces for too long a time and the conditions for full-fledged rest have not been created for them on shore. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, since we were speaking about the development of the navy's infrastructure, this is a logical question: What is currently being done to resolve the problems which you mentioned? [Kokoshin] The development of a basing and life-support system -- that is a long-term program which must be designed for 15-20 years. In the process, we need to proceed from the fact that the idea for the dispersal of infrastructure basing facilities for ship task forces that are tasked for operations in one or several nearby operating areas has become obsolete. A massive strike, even not by nuclear but by conventional precision-guided weapons, will destroy practically all of the facilities, no matter how much we try to separate one from the other. Therefore, I think the point of view of those experts who propose locating the fleets at several bases that are united through life-support technology of ships and weapons and the utilization of the men and equipment for armed combat at sea is justified. That concentration of forces provides a colossal advantage both for the development of the navy's infrastructure and for the development of normal living conditions for servicemen and their families. [Vodopyanov] In the process, obviously we need to proceed from our state's actual conditions and capabilities? [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. Unfortunately, only today are we beginning to really consider money, which you can't say, for example, about the Americans, Germans or British. They will not invest their resources until they become convinced that each dollar, mark, or pound will provide the maximum return. In Russian history, during the reform period Grand Prince Konstantin Nikolayevich -- General-Admiral of the Russian Navy -- and his comrades-in-arms-reformers devoted quite a bit of attention to the analysis of that which we now call "cost-effectiveness". Today, each of our commanders, I am already not talking about the commanders-in-chief, must become an economist. The navy -- and it is the general customer for its arms in the person of the commanders of the highest level, headquarters and other command and control organs, is obliged to know how to analyze what is more advantageous for it. By way of illustration -- will it purchase five new destroyers or modernize ten that are already in the line; lay down a new nuclear submarine or modernize one that has already recommended itself well; order a new cruiser or invest money in the development of the infrastructure and life-support of existing ships?... Of course, to do that, we in the Armed Forces need to have strong economic services and one of our most important missions is to instill in commanders of all levels a taste for painstaking analysis of the monetary resources that we have and in the combat effectiveness of those weapons that we are purchasing with this money. [Vodopyanov] However, to do that commanders need to precisely know what the Russian Ministry of Defense and you, as first deputy Minister of Defense, see as the navy's role in the contemporary conditions; what is the current concept of its construction? It's no secret that even before the impression has been formed that current Russian military doctrine has devoted and devotes inadequate attention to the navy. [Kokoshin] There has always been a dual attitude toward the navy in Russia. On the one hand, they loved it with some sort of special love and Russians I would say have a definite subconscious craving for the sea. No wonder the periods of its isolation ended with access to the seas that wash today's Russia, initially -- in the West and South (the Baltic, Black and Caspian seas), then -- in the East (the Pacific Ocean). On the other hand -- due to our geostrategic position, we traditionally are more a land than a sea power and Russia's military fate has been decided, as a rule, on land. Of course, there were critical moments and sea battles, like Tsushima, that determined the further foreign policy and internal situation of the Russian state. And yet the outcome of wars: the Patriotic War of 1812, and the First and Second World Wars -- were predetermined in the depth of Russian territory. But this occurred not only due to Russia's natural geographic position but, it seems to me, due to the ambivalent attitude toward the navy. It experienced both periods of great enthusiasm and profound crises. And that alternation was repeated more than once in Russia's history -- we must not forget that. Recall that, after Peter the Great, the navy was very rapidly brought into a deep decline by his successors. Then matters were put right to a certain extent under Elizabeth Petrovna but we also cannot say that the navy was in a brilliant situation. It experienced a golden age during the reign of Catherine the Great. It is in this period that the names of Senyavin, Greyg, and Ushakov, whose fame equaled the fame of Rumyantsev and Suvorov, were heard throughout the entire world. Under Pavel I, the navy was still maintained but, under Aleksandr I, the navy once again found itself in a difficult position, they were involved very little with it and, how paradoxical, but the fact is that the name of the Naval Minister, the Marquis de Traverse, was the most hated name for seamen of that time. However, everything was decided not by him, he was acting only as the instrument of the upper levels. Although the role of personality in the navy was always great and its rebirth, at least, of the Black Sea Fleet, in the first half of the 19th century was associated first of all with the name of Admiral Lazarev. Later there was the Crimean War when the navy found itself defenseless against the enemy's armored steam ships and Russian admirals, officers and sailors became heroes of the land defense of Sevastopol. We recall the already mentioned Tsushima and 1918 when a large portion of the Black Sea Fleet was actually sunk... In general, the Russian Navy had a great, at times tragic, history and it is more complex than the history of the Armed Forces as a whole. Yes and in the recent past, during the 1960's, the navy was subjected to a fierce blow when nearly new ships that had far from exhausted their combat capabilities were sent to the scrap heap. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, you have quite legitimately pointed out that we should not forget history, including the history of the navy. But is that being taken into account in the new shipbuilding program? [Kokoshin] I would not say that we have a new shipbuilding program in its traditional sense. I think that there should be an arms development program on the whole where the navy would be a component. This is not only a question of ships but also of coastal missile systems, naval aviation and naval infantry... But the main thing, I repeat -- is the improvement of the basing system and the repair system. It is this development program --without a one-sided slant toward shipbuilding -- that we need. All the more so that this is being dictated by the situation that has developed as a result of the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, in the Black and Baltic Seas and in the Caspian Sea. As for the ships, I, in particular, think that the idea of creating a relatively small aircraft-carrying ship deserves the most rapt attention. In general, we need new inspiring ideas like we need air and the realization of these ideas will allow us to live for years while saving what we have. Let the navy's youth have their say here... [Vodopyanov] But you need to know what criteria will determine the navy's quantitative and qualitative composition in order to advance, as you say, the "ideas" of that same navy youth. [Kokoshin] Russia certainly needs a powerful modern navy, without quantitative excesses, but with high parameters of combat and operational effectiveness; a navy that would be blended into the integrated military doctrine. Under current conditions, it is especially important that all Armed Forces branches and types of troops precisely interact with each other. Of course, right now there is no optimum in this sphere. As for the missions being accomplished by the navy, I think that they are first of all associated with ensuring Russia's security in certain areas and zones that are adjacent to its territory and providing reliable nuclear deterrence, along with the Strategic Missile Forces and strategic long-range aviation. Preservation of its ocean function based upon certain parameters will be one of the navy's most important missions, primarily, in the context of reconnaissance, information gathering, and studying the hydrologic situation. Among the combat missions -- maintenance of the stability of strategic nuclear submarines and the creation of those regimes of the combat service of ships that would permit us to predominate in the most vulnerable nearby ocean zones for Russia and also in certain key areas of the World Ocean in the event of political crises and military operations. [Vodopyanov] But what is the basis for accomplishing what has been planned? Today much is being said and, it seems to us, in a substantiated manner about the inadequately thought through defense industry conversion policy which has brought our military-industry complex to the point of collapse and to the loss of its leading positions. [Kokoshin] I must admit that our conversion policy was not in earnest, although efforts were carried out to shift the military-industrial complex to the output of peaceful production. But we needed to conduct such a program over the course of 10-15 years and mandatorily under the condition of the stability of state rule. We can consider the conversion program that was proposed within the framework of the old system as only a conversion palliative. Under conditions when weakened "civilian" plants "have been attached" to military-industrial complex enterprises, it could have operated only in the presence of directive force. And, of course, the conversion policy must have powerful market stimuli and be built-in to the overall strategy of economic reform and independent of orders from above. [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, right now how can you characterize the state of the industrial complex that supports the navy's needs? [Kokoshin] It is very serious. Essentially, right now we are struggling for the survival of the Armed Forces, including the navy, and for the preservation of industry, although in those amounts which would ensure the maintenance of the army and navy at the required combat readiness. This is an extremely difficult task. When you say that you need to reduce military orders and the number of plants, the director's corps of defense enterprises agrees with that. But as soon as matters directly affect the directors, they begin "to wiggle out of the situation": They say, let's reduce the orders for others, but you don't need to reduce my order. But then again, we have also been compelled to reduce many developments to the limit, any further, figuratively speaking, and we'll have to cut to the bone. For example, we defined Severodvinsk and Sevmash enterprise as the center of nuclear submarine building. Now all orders will go only there. But we need to bring the submarines that are in the Far East up to readiness. We are finishing some at Nizhniy Novgorod and large surface ships -- at Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg... [Vodopyanov] Does it once again turn out that it is the navy that is enduring the greatest damage of all of the Armed Forces branches? [Kokoshin] That is occurring due to its specific nature, due to the duration of the shipbuilding cycle and to the fact that they are entire floating cities in which much of what there is in the Air Force, the missileers and PVO [Air Defense] is combined... Therefore, right now those super-powerful weapons systems are suffering most of all. The specific nature of current industrial production and the fact that there are no strict rules that regulate the conduct of first and second level subcontractors-assemblers -- who are very rapidly shifting to the output of civilian products for which there is demand -- is also having an impact. Military orders have become unprofitable due to the lack of financial resources... [Vodopyanov] ...As a result, if previously seamen frequently complained about a number of low tactical-technical parameters of newly built ships and inadequate standardization of weapons and combat equipment with which they were equipped. Today, the navy is more concerned about the reduction of deliveries of not only new and modern weapons but of even series-produced weapons. Will it not turn out that the Russian Navy will greet its 300th Anniversary not only without new ships but also with weapons of the "era of Ochakov and the conquest of Crimea"? [Kokoshin] You very legitimately pose that question. I think that we need to maintain a course toward preserving in the line even few combat ships but the most modern and actually combat ready, as you say in the navy -- of the first line. Of course, these requirements also relate to aviation and to the other branches of the Armed Forces and especially to the navy. We must be certain: If ships carry the navy flag and are in the line, then we can count on them. Furthermore, there must be reserve ships with reduced levels of combat readiness and with lower manning than those belonging to the first line. Of course, we need to equip both these and the others with modern weapons. But here too there are a large number of obstacles. [Vodopyanov] Could we dwell on this important aspect in more detail? [Kokoshin] In the former USSR, the expenditure mechanism of the entire weapons life cycle -- from development to scrapping -- dominated. Frequently the main thing was to report on the development of a project, say, of a new ship, for which awards and prizes were given. As it turned out later, the ships, weapons systems and life-support, rescue systems and survivability were far from perfect in a number of cases due to this "reporting". Moreover, the overwhelming majority of weapons models were developed without designing for modernization. We are suffering to this day because of that because it is impossible to install new electronics and acoustics systems and modern types of antennas on ships of the majority of designs. But I think that the greatest deficiency in domestic shipbuilding is the absence of a macro systems approach to the construction and development of the navy, including basing infrastructure, when the adjustment of the quantitative and qualitative composition of the navy of the graphically heightened requirements of the naval strategy (let's recall Admiral Gorshkov's "ocean strategy") was implemented in a strong-willed manner and was frequently dictated not by the navy but by the decisions of the military-industrial complex. There was nothing that defined the military shipbuilding strategy -- a state program that coordinated goals, time periods and engineering tasks and was the same for all NII's and KB's [design bureaus], shipbuilding plants, shipyards, and docks. But those same Americans and Germans, who are somewhat wealthier than we are, built ships with a long-range sight. A classic example of the management attitude toward ships are the Iowa Class Battleships. And right now where are our design 68-bis gun cruisers which were distinguished by their beautiful ship architecture and good sea-going qualities?! [Vodopyanov] Today the navy has lost (primarily due to the weakly-developed infrastructure of coastal basing) newer ships, for example, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers "Kiev", "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk", each of which did not serve for 20 years... [Kokoshin] That is because, as I already said above, that we were always rushing after quantity while ignoring the qualitative characteristics of the navy and not paying attention to the expenditures that especially increase during the operation of ships and their basing facilities that have not been perfected. Today we are compelled to consider every ruble --there is a catastrophic shortage of resources. Under these conditions, how do we conduct the optimization of expenditures for the purchase of equipment and weapons, for shipbuilding and repair, and for NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design work]? Therefore, in the near future we will not be able to count on new grandiose projects but we need to resolve more prosaic issues in order to preserve the maximum of what we have in the navy today. And the navy's primary mission in the next 2-3 years is -- survival. I will point out, not vegetation, but survival with the evolutionary accumulation of combat might, through structural and operational reorganization, being inspired by a high idea: By the historical greatness of the Fatherland, and by a consciousness of the need for its Armed Forces and the navy, in particular. We must not forget that the navy is also a special instrument of the state through which not only purely military but also political missions are carried out. I have in mind showing the Russian flag. I am convinced that we must continuously carry out the latter and here there is no place for a bookkeeping approach. A combat ship, especially -- a pretty one (and Soviet, currently Russian, ships are praised for their architecture) always causes admiration and respect. And we need to develop a unique type of philosophy for the utilization of the navy when the navy, without directly entering into combat operations but simply cruising off the coasts or even being beyond the horizon, acts as a powerful factor of restraint of an aggressor and influences political "solitaire" along with other measures and techniques. [Vodopyanov] All the more so that the Russian and Soviet Navy has that experience... [Kokoshin] I have talked a lot with navy veterans who repeatedly sailed in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Undoubtedly, in an entire series of cases, our navy played a very important role when a situation was stabilized at a comparatively low level of escalation of some conflict or other by sending a detachment of our ships. No one is guaranteeing that military threats to Russia's security in the world will be totally reduced to naught. So we need to be realists -- we can't get by without a navy that is proper for Russia. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.
