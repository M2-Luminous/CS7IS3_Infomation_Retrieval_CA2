According to the Hungarian minister, Russia is today the second largest economic and trade partner of Hungary, while the latter holds eighth place in the list of Russia's major economic partners. "Very important for the development of our cultural cooperation are contacts between the religious leaders of the two countries," the Hungarian minister said. He recalled in this connection that Budapest would be visited on March 3 by Patriarch of Moscow and All of Russia Aleksius II. Dwelling on the Hungarian foreign policy's orientation, Jeszenszky noted that integration into the European structures of the North Atlantic treaty Organisation and the European Union were of primary importance for Budapest, as well as the country's active participation in the CSCE process and in the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" programme. Touching on the situation in Bosnia, the Hungarian foreign minister stressed that "the stands of Budapest and Moscow on this question have no serious distinctions". "Russia attaches great importance to relations with Hungary," Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told the press conference. "This is specially noted in the treaty between the two countries, recently signed at summit level." The minister expressed the hope that it would be ratified by the new Russian parliament. "I wish to back my friend Jeszenszky's words about the prospects for relations between Russia and Hungary," Kozyrev stated. "Russia has no hegemonic or neo-imperialist designs in Central and Eastern Europe. The attraction of the peoples of our countries towards each other is perfectly natural," he added.
