Sa'di Mahdi Salih told him the West must understand that the Iraqi people, who stood up to the largest aggressive force in history, are solidly behind their wise leadership. The Iraqis, he emphasized, are determined to defend their country's sovereignty, and have confidence in their political choices. The Iraqis will not stand for any interference in their own affairs. Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the United States is working to perpetuate its control over the international community to advance its own and Western strategic ambitions in the Arab world. He urged the international community to work hard to promote better international relations. Mr. Stevens indicated that his visit to Iraq was useful in that he was able to see firsthand the Iraqi people's distress caused by the relentless sanctions. He was also impressed by Iraq's rehabilitation effort to repair the damage wrought by the aggression. He will use the information gleaned from his visit to Iraq in a political file geared toward British public opinion.
