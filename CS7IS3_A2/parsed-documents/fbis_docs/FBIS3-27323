Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 17 February began massive removal of cannons and other heavy weaponry from Sarajevo. At a meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on 18 February, Serbian leader Karadzic assured Akashi that the heavy weapons deployed around Sarajevo will be placed under the effective supervision of UN peacekeeping forces before midnight 19 February. Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have also agreed to turn over heavy weaponry to the supervision of UN peacekeeping troops by the same deadline, and have already taken action to do so. According to reports, the change in the Serbs' stand has to do with Russia's active mediation. After a meeting on 15 February with visiting British Prime Minister Major, who had gone to Moscow on a "persuasion mission," President Yeltsin explicitly told reporters that Russia could not be excluded from mediation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. President Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin had over the past few days continuously conducted mediations among all conflicting parties. On 17 February, Churkin and Karadzic reached agreement that on the condition that Russia dispatch 800 blue-helmet troops to Bosnia-Herzewgovina, the Serbian armed forces would remove all heavy weaponry surrounding Sarajevo. Russia has consistently taken a tough stance on NATO's ultimatum. A careful study yields three factors behind the Russian stance. First, Russia is extremely unhappy with the way the Western countries have bypassed the UN Security Council -- in fact, Russia -- in directly issuing the ultimatum to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, since Russia has always maintained traditional ties with the Slavic-speaking Serbs, abandoning the Serbs at a crucial moment is tantamount to forsaking Russian interests in the Balkan region. Third, a NATO air strike on Bosnia-Herzegovina would mean the first military operation conducted by the organization in the past 44 years since its inauguration; and to Russia, this is no different from recognizing the eastward thrust of NATO's defense line, which will seriously undermine Russia's strategic interests. In the wake of the Serbs' 17 February announcement consenting to withdrawal of heavy weapons, German Chancellor Kohl has appealed to all concerned that before the deadline of NATO's ultimatum, every opportunity should be taken to seek a political settlement, which British Prime Minister Major has said may avert NATO's possible air strikes. Belgian Vice Prime Minister Claes has urged the United States and Russia to work together to seek a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. France and the United States have expressed cautious optimism, while emphasizing that as far as the Serbs are concerned, it is necessary to "hear what they say and watch what they do" and to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. U.S. President Clinton has again sounded a warning 17 February that should the Serbs fail to hand over heavy weapons before the deadline, NATO will take its air raid plan "extremely seriously." French Foreign Ministry spokesman DeKay [name as published] stressed on the evening of 17 February that the Serbs "should meet all the conditions set in the NATO ultimatum." Reportedly the NATO ultimatum, which was proposed by France, is aimed at ending the war and bringing about peace through exerting pressure on France's neighbor as soon as possible to reverse the stalemate situation in spite of the EC states' energetic mediation; it is also aimed at paving the way for France to regain its status as a political power. To this end, France abandoned the UN banner, which it had consistently upheld in the past, and proposed a direct NATO ultimatum to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Meanwhile, France has also realized that armed settlement can only be the "last resort," and has strived to resolve the crisis and seek political settlement within the scope of a joint action by the EC, the United States, and Russia. It is understood that the foreign ministers of Russia, Germany, Greece, and Belgium and EC officials concerned held a joint meeting in Athens 18 February to continue the search for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. In another development, UN special envoy to former Yugoslavia Aikxy [name as published] held "useful talks" with Muslim leader Izetbegovic in Sarajevo 18 February. Beginning 19 February, UN peacekeeping forces will inspect the vicinity of Sarajevo and examine the removal of heavy weaponry by the Serbs and Muslims. A NATO spokesman declared on 18 February that before the complete withdrawal of the Serbs' heavy weaponry, NATO's determination to conduct air strikes on Bosnia-Herzegovina remains unchanged. It is understood that the defense ministers of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands will meet at Italy's Aweiyanuo [name as published] Air Base 20 February to make the final decision on air strikes.
