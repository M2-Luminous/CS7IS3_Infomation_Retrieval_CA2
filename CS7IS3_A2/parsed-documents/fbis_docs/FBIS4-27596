The merger agreement came when the two parties' heads, Rep. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party (UPP) and Rep. Pak Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party (NPRP), got together on Thursday. But they attached the condition that they would serve as joint representatives of the new party, informed sources said Saturday. The UPP will convene its Executive Council Saturday afternoon to ratify the merger and begin discussions with the NPRP on such matters as the new party's name and reorganization of local chapters. In addition, six independent lawmakers are reportedly poised to join the prospective party -- Reps. Yang Sun-chik, Yim Chun-won, Kim Chin-yong, Chong Tae-yong, Chong Chu-il and So Hun. If they were to join, it would be possible to organize a new parliamentary negotiating body with the incumbent 12 UPP lawmakers and Rep. Pak of NPRP being affiliated. However, it was not known whether another splinter party, the new Korea Party, would also join as its head, Rep. Yi Chong-chan, is keeping mum on the merger. As the two parties have agreed in principle to merge, chances of all opposition parties reaching a "grand union" with the Democratic Party as its central axis have become remoter, observers said. A UPP official revealed, "we agreed in principle on a party-to-party merger after a series of contacts with the NPRP for the organization of a parliamentary negotiating group. If the issue of grand union of the opposition circles arises, we will think it over at that time."
