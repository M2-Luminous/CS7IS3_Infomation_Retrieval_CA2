Novikov: "Strike Committees Are Politicized"] [Text]]While creating strike committees in productions included in the Kirovskiy Zavod Association, the consolidated Kirovskiy trade union committee suggests creating a citywide strike committee as well. In the words of the association's trade union leader, Vladimir Yudin, the task of the strike committee today is not to organize but, on the contrary, to warn about protest actions. The most politically active Kirovskiy Zavod has it no worse than other enterprises of the city. The average wages are close to 200,000 rubles [R]. Only about 4,000 people have been laid off from the tractor and former tank productions, but they receive a stipend of 44,000. For steel smelters who have work orders, the wages are generally twice the average. Nonetheless, the workers, in Yudin's words, are prepared for protest actions, and the steel smelters are guaranteeing their support for the unemployed tractor builders. The reason, in the opinion of the plant trade union committee, is that the labor collectives consider the present economic reforms to be a blind alley. Taxes and prices raised by monopolists will sooner or later destroy the economy completely. The consolidated city strike committee could also put pressure on central and regional authorities in order to develop a new economic policy. The strike committees of specific productions must "apply pressure" on the administrations of the enterprises, but not so as to gain any concessions but so that the employer too will influence the government on his own behalf. In other words--the strike committees are becoming politicized.
