It is very encouraging to meet with representatives of eight organizations which make up our party's Youths Parliament. It is very encouraging because it is irrefutable proof of how you have undertaken a new task; of how a new way to exchange opinions, arguments, and reasons has been established; and above all, it shows you are truly offering youths greater opportunities to participate in politics within our party. You represent imagination, the search for change, the energy and the ability to establish a more open relationship, a more dynamic and authentic relationship with Mexican society. Above all, however, I am very pleased to meet with you at a time when Mexican society is immersed in the most important political process. We live in times of competitive democracy in which each political force, including ours, must present to society its programs, the actions it will carry out, its end-of-the-century vision of Mexico, its proposals, and above all, show each's political force capabilities to promote the transformation and change that Mexican society demands. PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] youths, our option, our party's option, the option you represent -- let there be no doubt about this -- is to promote a profound transformation of our Mexico. In this regard, we must place our party at the front of this process by ensuring it fully assumes a rigorous agenda that will lead us to present new political practices to society and to overcome old vices. We are a party that has the ability of making good use of the efforts we Mexicans have carried out so far. Looking beyond the accomplishments and mistakes, we cannot ignore the efforts Mexican have made in recent years. We cannot, we must not, remain trapped within the boundaries of proposals made six years ago, when the country was facing other kinds of problems. We are and we must see ourselves as the party most capable of making good use of what has been accomplished, as the party with the strength to promote the changes and transformations that society is demanding. We have our mind set on making changes, but we do not plan to start from zero or to build everything anew. Countries are not born every six years. We do not want, we are not planning on remaining where we are now either. We will not succumb to inertia. With our plans for changes we offer new roads while making good use of what we have already accomplished. In my trips throughout the country during these past campaign months, I have been able to establish that Mexico wants a significant change, but in a safe and responsible way. This is why security, responsibility, and changes are the three big components of our plan. We must act in a responsible way because our accomplishments, regardless of how modest they may be, have been made at the expense of big sacrifices; and we must make changes because without changes, progress cannot be made. We represent security because we have experience, expertise, and we will make extensive decisions within the law and a de jure state. We are not promising magic. Our ideas are based on an objective and a real analysis of the progress that has been made and of what is necessary to change. As the century draws to its end, Mexican society also demands responsible work. The next administration, the one that will head the efforts of the Mexican people at the conclusion of this century and this millennium, will have to be responsible and find ways to increase efficiency and fight incompetence and waste. It must be able to react in a timely fashion in the face of injustice; and it must be able to overcome bureaucratic paralysis, arrogance, and the temptation to look at everything from behind a desk. A new phase of progress must begin with a new culture of responsibilities adopted by all but, most of all, the government. A government responsibility or a new culture of responsibility, like the one I am proposing, is something the next government definitely has to adopt to wipe out corruption where it is found, either in influence peddling or the paternalist [patrimonialista] view of power. Security, responsibility and change, because I said one cannot talk of progress without them; while those who say everything is bad are lying, but those who defend the status quo are also mistaken. Mexico needs change with security and responsibility. Mexico demands a profound change at the grassroots level; a change that preserves what is valuable and at the same time allows us to make the progress society is demanding from us. And I intent to head those changes. We must respond to the change of mentalities with new actions -- you yourselves have said so through this tribune. Mexico has changed; it is different. It is an eminently young society; it is demanding. And it is to transformation to which we must respond, with new actions capable of overcoming gaps, extreme poverty, the existing imbalance among our regions, among Mexico's different regions, and the inability that often exists to guarantee compliance with the law. We are, friends, young lawmakers, facing the need for a simultaneous change in politics and society. One cannot view with fear the change Mexico is demanding, nor can this change be accomplished through haggling, simulation, or fabrication. We will bring about a change in Mexico by implementing a firm policy with strict adherence to the law, with security and responsibility, so that our national unity is reinforced and our stability is guaranteed. That is the vision we have of the Mexico that is to come. We have to go from good national economy indicators to a better income for each family, a better savings proficiency, a better quality of life, and most of all, a better future for our children. This is a change, that in politics, will do credit to the great strength of our plurality, and which will only be possible if we all become committed, in good faith, to consolidating our nation as a genuinely democratic nation. With the end of old times, of little competition among parties, we also must relinquish the times of anticulture politics, of authoritarian domination. These changes, within a social transformation, should cause us to forget the excuses that distance us from new opportunities in the poorest communities in the country, especially the Indian communities. We must forget the excuses, which, for centuries, compelled our Indian communities to maintain practically the same levels of welfare and immersed them in the same conditions of poverty and deprivation. We must fulfill our constitutional pledges to provide education, health, and housing for all Mexicans and to overcome inequality, deprivation, backwardness, and destitution. This is how we will reach a new degree of confidence; this is how we will achieve new changes with responsibility; this is how the PRI must rise to the challenge and prove it wants to win the people's trust on its own, and play an essential role in the future. In this campaign I intend -- and I invite you to accompany me in this endeavor -- to draw on the support of citizens and Mexican society to make the changes that will allow us to build an economy that grants opportunities without losing the stability we have achieved. A political life that accepts elections as an instrument to solving competition between parties and increases opportunities for democratic participation. A social policy that efficiently fights poverty and great inequalities with efficiency. Let there be no doubt, my young parliamentary friends, we, you and I currently represent the greatest opportunity to achieve changes in our country. And we fully intend to assume the responsibility we have, abiding by the rules, with security, responsibility, and unity in harmony. I want to remind you young PRI members that events in Chiapas have shown us the urgent need for a political-democratic change. The urgent need for the economy to allow new and better opportunities for everyone, every citizen in every corner of our homeland. Events in Chiapas have shown us the urgent need to overcome generalizations so Mexicans can enjoy specific opportunities in each community where the Mexican citizen lives his daily life -- in the family, the community -- aware that he belongs to a great nation which requires unity and strength for the future. We recognize the urgency of the events in Chiapas as an appeal to start a new phase. The PRI candidate and members are ready. That is my appeal to all of you, friends, young parliamentary members. The events in Chiapas serve as a warning. They emphasize that destitution, deprivations, accumulated insults, and frustrations can no longer be silenced with dilatory answers and new appeals for patience. We must not forget different problems prevail in our communities, our regions because our national geography is different, but it is all part of a single reality -- the reality which prevails in our country in 1994 as we approach the end of the century. This reality is characterized by insufficient family incomes; unemployment; but also that each and every one of us are willing to change. In summary, my proposal is to find new options and new roads to freedom, justice, and democracy for all Mexicans thereby precluding violence, death among brothers, and confrontations. The PRI members in Mexico want, at this hour, to prove there is no valid reason to shed blood; that we must overcome our problems no matter how big they are; and that peace is the only thing which guarantees our welfare. We must make sure no Mexicans needs to turn to weapons to be heard. We have the option of resolving any difference and that option is democracy; that option is the legal state, and that is the option we must choose. Thank you.
