Robaina expressed the island's position after newsmen consulted him on the subject last night, following a three-day visit to the central provinces accompanied by more than 40 members of the diplomatic corps accredited in this capital. The minister said there is no doubt that President Gaviria is a man who carries out a mandate and fulfills his responsibilities, and he is a man with experience who gives guarantees and achieves results. However, he made it clear that Cuba "can hardly say who is the best or the worst candidate" because it is not a member of that organization. I am fully convinced that the members of that organization will know how to evaluate who is the best choice for secretary general, he stressed. Havana was expelled from the OAS in 1962 due to the great pressure exerted by the United States to isolate from the rest of the continent. [sentence as received]
