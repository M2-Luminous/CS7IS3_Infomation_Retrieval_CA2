FR940919-2-00029 FR940919-2-00028 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;375&hyph;001] Texas Gas Transmission Corporation; Filing September 13, 1994. Take notice that on September 7, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas) tendered for filing supporting schedules and working papers in Docket No. RP94&hyph;375, et al. Texas Gas states that this filing is being made to supplement a filing made on August 30, 1994, and noticed as Docket No. RP94&hyph;375&hyph;000. That filing described Schedules 1 through 10, which were supposed to be attached in support of Account No. 191 costs to be direct billed by Texas Gas. Therefore, Texas Gas is submitting Schedules 1 through 10 to correct the inadvertent error caused by not attaching the schedules to its filing made on August 30, 1994. Texas Gas states that copies of the letter of transmittal and attachments are being mailed to all those receiving the August 30, 1994, filing, which included Texas Gas's affected former jurisdictional sales customers and interested state commissions, as well as to all parties on the service list in Docket No. RP94&hyph;125. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
