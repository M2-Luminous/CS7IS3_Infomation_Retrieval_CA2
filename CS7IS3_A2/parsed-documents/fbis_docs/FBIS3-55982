We have done too little to attract the interest of the NATO," head of the Riigikogu [parliament] defence commission Rein Helme said. He added that Estonia has problems with regional cooperation and pointed out the border issues with Russia. Admission to the NATO is impossible in case of such problems, which will have to be either solved or frozen, Helme said. As for the appeal of the Lithuanian president, Helme commented that consultations between parliaments and governments would have been necessary, since the issue concerns the entire nation. The Riigikogu foreign affairs commission is waiting official documents from Brussels, commission chairman Vello Saatpalu said. Saatpalu expressed his amazement at Prime Minister Mart Laar's announcement that Estonia is ready to appeal to Brussels in the nearest future, complaining that the foreign affairs commission had again been excluded from the making of vital decisions. Saatpalu added that this and other incidents indicate a movement from the rule of law to a state of administration.
