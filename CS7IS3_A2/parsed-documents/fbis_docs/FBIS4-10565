FBIS4-10565 "drlat072_h_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Honduras Reina, Armed Forces Chief View Coup Rumors Reina, Armed Forces Chief View Coup Rumors PA1404035694 Tegucigalpa Telesistema Hondureno Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 14 Apr 94 PA1404035694 Tegucigalpa Telesistema Hondureno Television Network Spanish BFN [Report by Hector Ordonez] [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces chief, today ruled out the possibility the military will disrupt the democratic process. Nevertheless, while Discua denies any possibility of a coup d'etat, President Carlos Reina affirms the report. Moreover, Discua said he would rather resign than participate in an uprising. The Reina administration was compelled to organize a news conference to state its position on the prevailing fear among U.S. human rights groups that the Armed Forces will seize power to prevent the abolition of mandatory military service, the privatization of Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise], and the transfer of the Merchant Marine to civilians. The curious thing is the president affirms this new report and the alleged plot that reportedly was prepared against him. [Begin Reina recording] A white book must be published on the two events, which I must interpret positively. The people should have all the details about that unfortunate plan to end the Honduran president's life. Second, I reassert it is a report from human rights organizations, because, according to those rumors, they see a threat to democratic government. [end recording] Other Liberal Party members have been more categorical; the version deserves no credibility. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We must not believe it, much less encourage it. [end recording] Referring to the alleged motives, the president said Hondutel's privatization will be clear; his proposal for a voluntary and educational military service will be presented to Congress no later than next week; the Merchant Marine's transfer to civilians is being discussed, and the Armed Forces have offered no resistance. [Begin Reina recording] I must state, however, with all the chivalry of the world, I have had no problems with the military in connection with strengthening of the authority the people have delegated to the president of the Republic, who is also commander general of the Armed Forces. [end recording] Moments later the president and Discua attended a sports event, and they appeared quite relaxed. The general was categorical: [Begin recording] [Discua] If at any moment Gen. Discua, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, receives a proposal to participate in this type of action, I would rather leave my post than violate my pledge to the Constitution and the laws. [Reina] That represents the new American military, a new doctrine. The coups d'etat are a thing of the past. The new military has faith in democracy, as the general has said, and let there be no doubt he will honor that new model of a soldier. [end recording] Given the forceful statements by the president of the Republic and the Armed Forces commander in chief, the possibility the Armed Forces will obstruct the moral revolution has been ruled out.
