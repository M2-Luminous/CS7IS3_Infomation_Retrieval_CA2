Since their advent, turbomachines have undergone considerable development. Smaller and lighter, they are nevertheless more powerful, more economical, less noisy, and less pollutive. This ongoing improvement over the years has been owing to optimization of the geometric design of compressors, resulting in higher compression ratios; to the introduction of new materials that are resistant to higher temperatures; but also to new manufacturing techniques, particularly the drilling of microperforations by electronic bombardment, which enables the manufacture of higher-performance combustion chambers... Further improvement is nevertheless still possible. And this is what ONERA, together with Snecma, Turbomeca, the SEP [European Propellants Company], and Microturbo, have set out to prove. Their principal objective is to develop numeric codes in three dimensions describing reality with greater and greater accuracy and capable of modeling the complex flows that take place in the components of the motor. Strategic points requiring study are compressors and turbine stages, with the continued object of augmenting compression ratios and efficiencies. As veritable air-churning machines, these two components are the sites of complex aerodynamic flows. Studies have already advanced considerably in this domain, and manufacturers can already optimize the geometry of their compressor and turbine disks through the use of the CANARI software developed by ONERA. CANARI enables the modeling of the flow around an isolated wheel, in three dimensions, and with due regard for viscous effects. This operation requires four to five hours on a Cray. Unfortunately, this tool is applicable to a single wheel and as yet cannot simulate interactions between disks that create a nonsteady flow. Different tools have been developed to deal with this phenomenon. But these are either two-dimensional, or limited to nonviscous flows. "In a about a year, we should achieve a realistic 3D design tool," says Georges Meauze, turbomachines coordinator at ONERA. "Nevertheless, it will be three to four years before it becomes usable by industrialists. It will take that much time to reduce design times to reasonable values." In addition to complex aerodynamic flows, turbines are subject to aerothermodynamic phenomena. Temperatures at the exit of the combustion chamber are very high, and this creates thermal stresses in the disks of turbines, modifying their temperature field, hence their radial geometry. This distortive phenomenon can have disastrous effects on efficiency, with blade losses becoming significant. MATHILDA design software, developed by ONERA, is devoted to this effect and is available to industry. It takes viscous effects into account in three dimensions. These are all tools that must be validated. For this purpose, ONERA has numerous test facilities, that are constantly being improved, to simulate an ever-growing number of elements. It lacks one facility: An installation for simulating thermal effects on a turbine stage. The cost of building a "hot" facility would be excessive; so ONERA is studying the possibility of building a "warm" one... Concurrently, research is being pursued on new materials, principally on superalloys intended for turbine blades and compressor disks...
