By 18 December, nearly 50 km of underwater pipe line had been laid. Meanwhile, a second long-distance natural gas pipe line running from the North China oil field to supply gas to Beijing was put into use in late November after just one test operation. This pipe line's has been raised to 400,000 cubic meters a day. This evidence vividly reflects a series of major achievements by China in the development of natural gas prospecting as part of the oil industry since the start of the "Seven Five-Year Plan." A boom in China's natural gas reserves is arriving, said Wang Tao, general manager of China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, at an advanced symposium on the oil industry held in Beijing recently. Over the past three years, according to the principle of "developing oil and natural gas alongside," the inland oil industry sector has been stepping up geological theoretical study and prospecting related to natural gas. Major prospecting findings have preliminarily revealed three new, large gas producing zones in inland China: 1) the northern Shaanxi gas field, the largest undivided single inland gas field ever discovered in China, covering a total area of more than 2,340 square km; 2) eastern Sichuan, where a number of industrial gas fields have been discovered, and central and southwest Sichuan, where a number of gas wells have been drilled and have proven to be rich in gas; and 3) the Turpan-Hami Basin, Junggar Basin, and Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, with preliminarily proven gas reserves totaling nearly 100 billion cubic meters. In addition, another area rich in natural gas has been spotted and confirmed in the eastern Qaidam Basin, Qinghai. With major prospecting projects being launched in the above areas over the next seven years, China's proven reserves natural gas reserves proven are expected to increase by more than double. China National Offshore Oil Corporation, now with 140 billion cubic meters of gas reserves in hand, is running prospecting projects in the Yinggehai-Southeast Hainan region, which has been identified as the corporation's major natural gas prospecting operation zone. The corporation has drilled three test wells on its own this year, and will drill another six next year. Meanwhile, three oil and gas fields and four oil bearing structures have been discovered and confirmed in the East China Sea, and exploratory work has now begun. China National Offshore Oil Corporation is planning to produce 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas by 1997, and to obtain proven gas reserves totaling 400 billion cubic meters and an annual production capacity of 20 billion cubic meters of gas by the turn of the century. Our country's proven natural gas reserves, newly discovered in the last three years, have surpassed the total amount discovered and proven over the previous four decades. Therefore, China is now ready to speed up exploration for resources.
