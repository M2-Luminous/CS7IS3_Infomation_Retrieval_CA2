No one has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb, which was placed next to one of the marble columns supporting the two-storey building and left a crater about 1.5 meters deep. Security at all NATO offices in Europe was immediately tightened in response to the bombing, Italian officials said. A NATO summit begins Monday morning in Brussels. The NATO Defense College is in the EUR neighborhood, on the southern outskirts of the capital, in the same building as a branch of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura [National Agricultural Bank] and some municipal offices. The building has a closed-circuit camera security system and 24-hour guard service but no one reportedly noticed anything suspicious before the explosion. Eyewitnesses reported seeing four men leaving the site of the attack aboard a gray Alfa Romeo shortly before the bombing.
