The news analyst goes on: As many Asian countries have recognized, the Radio "Free Asia" which the United States is going to start broadcasting is intended to spread the socalled "outlook on the value of American democracy" and bourgeois ideology. National disputes and confrontation have resulted in bloodletting and ruthlessly destroyed the economic and social life now in the region and countries which had been influenced by such radio waves in the past. Through the Radio "Free Asia" the United States is seeking to reproduce such a reality in the Asian region and thereby disorganize and destroy the socialist and independent countries in this region from within. Even if it started broadcasting tricky programmes against Asian countries, the United States will have nothing to gain therefrom. As expressed clearly and repeatedly, the Korean and other Asian people will defend their national sovereignty with the firm stand of masters being responsible for their own destinies, and staunchly struggle against the Yankee-style culture and in defence of their traditions, culture and way of life. The United States must immediately stop the farce of launching into the broadcasting of the Radio "Free Asia".
