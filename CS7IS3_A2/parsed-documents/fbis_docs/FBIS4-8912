The person who spoke with domestic and foreign journalists was Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the executive committee of the Gorazde district. Edib Music reports on the link-up: [Music] Judging by information that we received from Mr. Ohranovic this evening, the situation in Gorazde is further deteriorating. Let us hear what was happening around 2030 this evening, and also earlier in the day: [Begin Ohranovic recording] At this moment the Hotel Gradina and the neighboring building are ablaze. On the right side apartment blocks called [word indistinct] and Panorama are also on fire. Everything is enveloped in smoke. Earlier today, six people were wounded in a building housing a Red Cross refugee center. The chetniks are no longer attacking front lines. They simply wish to kill as many civilians as possible by shelling residential areas. Between 0800 and 2000 today, 26 people were killed and 62 were wounded. It is difficult to bury the dead as there is intense sniper fire over the cemetery. A great problem is drinking water, as there are no springs that we have access to. Poisonous gases were also released today. The people affected are feeling dizzy and faint. The situation along the defense lines is extremely difficult, but we must persevere. At this moment both the right and the left sides are coming under intensive fire; I can no longer say from which weapons. [passage omitted] In every case, the biggest problem is the population without any accommodation who are sheltering in entrances, in porches. This is the biggest problem at the moment. We really do not have the facilities to accommodate at least 10,000 people. This evening the hospital again came under fire, and two people were wounded. Poisonous gases were thrown directly on the hospital. [passage omitted] [end recording]
