The former bank of Italy governor went on to state that he had no intention of getting involved in the polemics, highlighted in the press, over the recent privatization of Comit [Italian Commercial Bank]. However, in answer to charges that Banca Commerciale Italiano had been taken over by a small "hard-core" of stockholders, Ciampi recalled how while 20 percent of shareholders had, indeed, organized, "there always remains 80 percent of shareholders which can organize and find the ways and means to do so. Turning his attention to monetary matters, Premier Ciampi expressed his hope that the lira would return to the European Monetary System (EMS) as quickly as possible. "In 1992" he recalled, "the EMS suffered a crisis much worse than that of the lira" adding how for "national pride adjustments had not previously been made to parities which would have avoided the increase in rates." Looking at the independence of the Bank of Italy Ciampi stated how in his fourteen years at the head of the central bank he had always fought to boost its independence which was achieved "starting in 1981 when the Bank of Italy was no longer obliged to purchase unsold state paper put up for auction and ended with its freedom to set the discount rate."
