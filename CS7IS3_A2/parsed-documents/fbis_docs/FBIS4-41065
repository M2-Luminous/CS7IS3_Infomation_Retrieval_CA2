In an interview with Interfax, he said the idea was first put forward by member of the State Duma Mikhail Poltoranin two months ago. However, Rybkin thinks three main conditions must be met before the proposal is implemented: the economy must show signs of stabilization in the next two or three months; the country's legislative network be arranged in a proper way; and the two houses prove workable. Rybkin said he would be happy to see the terms of office for the parliament and head of state extended after those conditions had been met.
