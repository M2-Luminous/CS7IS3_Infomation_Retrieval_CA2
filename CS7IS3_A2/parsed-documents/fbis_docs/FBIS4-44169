Orbit, owned by Prince Khalid 'Abdallah, is reported to be planning to charge viewers 10,000 dinars for the decoders needed to receive its 20 entertainment channels and the BBC news programs that is seen serving only sheiks and rich business persons. According to the London GUARDIAN, many Arabs are also wondering how free the BBC will be, given that its partner is a distant cousin of King Fahd. The royal family already dominates the media in Saudi Arabia, owns the two leading pan-Arabic dailies, a satellite network covering the region and the international UPI news agency. Plans are said to be also underway for a new pan-Arab FM radio station. As one of the most rigidly censored areas in the world, the decision by the BBC is seen as potentially its most controversial venture in news satellite broadcasting. BBC World Service Radio, funded by the Foreign Office, is recognized for its sensitive handling of news on Saudi Arabia, which is Britain's largest arms market, but executives are claiming there have been no concessions on its Arabic tv service. Orbit was said to have been given no editorial influence, even although Saudi Arabia has been leading many Arab governments against the march of global Westernized culture. The London GUARDIAN also identified that Orbit's access to new cable newtorks is through a "filtering" system, whereby there is a delay between the time signals are received and then transmitted to viewers. The Saudi policy has always been to carefully screen out any material that is objectionable, which will put an extra onus on BBC transmissions if it is to abide by its claim of not allowing any tampering of its news service.
