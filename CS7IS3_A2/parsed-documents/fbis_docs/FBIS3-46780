Kim has standing invitations from both Moscow and Tokyo, and a trip to Russia is possible in the first half of the year since President Boris Yeltsin is expected to name his new cabinet next week. "Even considering the necessary preparation time after that, the Russian visit is possible within the first six months," one official said. A tour of Malaysia, Singapore and other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be arranged more matter-of-factly around Kim's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Indonesia in November. His trip to Japan will be scheduled between the Russian and ASEAN visits, anytime from July to September, the official said. Kim will receive a visit by either Jiang or Prime Minister Li Peng, who will return the call by Kim's predecessor, No Tae-u. Kim, to show his priority on domestic affairs, left the country just once during his first 10 months in office, for the APEC meeting in Seattle followed by a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
