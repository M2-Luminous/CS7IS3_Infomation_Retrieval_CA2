Nevertheless, they do not intend to divert their investments to foreign countries. This is the main finding of a survey conducted on 6 June by Datafolha among 393 businessmen throughout the country. More than three of four of the businessmen polled (exactly 78 percent) said the country will stand to lose if Lula is successful at the polls. Yet a still more considerable number of entrepreneurs (83 percent) asserted that their companies will continue to invest in Brazil. Showing consistency with the idea that Lula will be harmful for Brazil, businessmen even preferred Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] to the PT candidate, even though the former comes only fifth in the electorate's choice as president. PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso is, as expected, the favorite among entrepreneurs, obtaining the endorsement of 65 percent of businessmen. Amin comes in second with 5 percent. Only then does Lula come into the picture (4 percent) followed by Brazilian Democratic Movement Party candidate Orestes Quercia (3 percent). [passage omitted]
