Proceeding from this, the SDPM proposed in the spring of 1991 the alternative draft law "Privatization" providing for its realization for registered public property vouchers with the participation of all citizens of Moldova. The law adopted by parliament in June of the same year contains all the basic provisions of the bill proposed by the social democrats. It was possible, therefore, to avoid the danger of the mafia-type privatization of public property for money. As the process of privatization approached the practical implementation stage, resistance on the part of both the opponents of economic reform and those who are attempting to hand over the people's property to a small group of "moneybags" has grown increasingly openly. A method of the direct robbery of broad strata of the citizens of Moldova via deprivation of their right to real participation in privatization is the displacement of vouchers from this process. Back at the start of 1992 the V. Muravschi government, with the support of certain parliamentary circles, blocked the adoption of the State Privatization Program for a whole 14 months. Subsequently, in the process of its adoption in parliament in 1993, the opponents of public privatization sought revisions to it palpably limiting the possibilities of privatization for vouchers. While paying lip service to the concept of public privatization, the A. Sangheli government in practice blocked its practical implementation. Thus the allocation of funds for the preparation of public property vouchers and their processing and issue to the citizens has been impeded in every possible way. The list of facilities of incomplete construction authorized by legislation for privatization for cash has not been extended. The issue of vouchers to retirees has been blocked thus far. In a whole number of localities the authorities are putting obstacles in the way of properties subject to privatization being put up for auction. The so-called State Property Fund--one further bureaucratic structure designed to torpedo in practice privatization for vouchers--was created beneath the signboard of protection of the property interests of the Republic of Moldova. Finally, the opponents of public privatization have openly gone against their own people, seeking with the assistance of the Ministry of Economics and the above-mentioned Fund the adoption on 29 November 1993 by the Committee for Monetary Reform of a decision on the unrestricted use in the privatization process of the Moldavian lei and convertible currency together with public property vouchers, without limitation of the spheres of their circulation. The SDPM has already observed that because of the continuing decline in production and the absence of the requisite commodity backing the Moldavian lei faces the threat of rapid depreciation. The organizers of such monetary reform, endeavoring to conceal the deplorable results of the policy they are pursuing, have taken an unprecedented step--a cardinal change in the essence of privatization in Moldova and the emasculation of its social focus. In making possible the displacement of the voucher by money the present government is condemning it to devaluation and creating obviously unequal opportunities for the participation in the privatization process of millions of citizens. Public property is in fact being handed over to several corrupt clans. As a result of the above-mentioned step Moldova's production potential will in a short space of time have been grabbed by criminal capital, and the citizens will have been deprived forever of the right to own property created by their labor. The buying up for a pittance of the public property vouchers and their exchange for large blocks of shares will impede for a long term the creation of a securities market--a practical measure under Moldova's conditions en route to the strengthening of the national currency. In the version that is being imposed on us privatization will be undertaken by a narrow stratum of "moneybags," and the process of Moldova's economic recovery will drag on for decades, demanding increasingly new foreign loans, for which our children and grandchildren will have to pay. The SDPM declares that under the conditions of the total lack of control on the part of the paralyzed legislative body the government is directly violating current legislation. The mere fact of the use of wording of the "with subsequent confirmation by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova" type testifies that the present government has gambled on avowedly antireform political forces coming to power on 27 February 1994. The SDPM appeals to the president of the Republic of Moldova for the reversal of the antipopular decisions depriving all of us of the right to property. The SDPM calls on the unions of the Republic of Moldova to come to the defense of their members' real interests. [Dated] 2 December 1993, Chisinau
