FR941125-1-00015 FR941125-1-00007 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 12, 1993, the IEPA submitted a redesignation and maintenance plan for Jersey County as a requested revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP). The IEPA has requested that Jersey County be redesignated to attainment for ozone. On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the USEPA formally designated Jersey County as a marginal ozone nonattainment area. This classification and designation was based on a monitored violation of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in Jersey County in 1988. Jersey County is a rural county located approximately 25 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. Based on the 1990 census, the population of Jersey County is 20,539, with the largest urban population being that of Jerseyville, with a population of approximately 8,000. I. USEPA Redesignation Policy The Act's requirements for redesignation to attainment are contained in section 107(d)(3)(E). These requirements and other USEPA redesignation requirements are discussed in a September 4, 1992, memorandum from the Director of the Air Quality Management Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Directors of Regional Air Divisions. As outlined in this memorandum, section 107(d)(3)(E) requires that the following conditions be met for redesignation to attainment: 1. The USEPA must determine that the area subject to the redesignation request has attained the NAAQS; 2. The USEPA must have fully approved the applicable SIP for the subject area under section 110(k) of the Act; 3. The USEPA must determine that the improvement in air quality in the area is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from the implementation of the applicable SIP, Federal air pollution control regulations, and other federally enforceable emission reductions; 4. The USEPA must have fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section 175A of the Act; and 5. The State must have met all requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D of the Act. To demonstrate that the area has attained the ozone NAAQS, the State must show that the ozone data in the area do not exhibit violation of the NAAQS at any monitoring site in the area during the most recent three years of monitoring at the sites. In accordance with 40 CFR part 50.9, the annual average number of expected exceedances of the ozone standard (0.12 parts per million [ppm], one-hour averaged) at any monitor cannot exceed 1.0 during the three year period. The data used in this demonstration must be quality assured, in accordance with 40 CFR part 58, and collected in accordance with 40 CFR part 50, appendix H. The data should be recorded in USEPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The SIP for the area must be fully approved under section 110(k) of the Act and must satisfy all requirements that apply to the area. These requirements include new requirements added by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The State must meet all requirements of section 110 and part D of the Act that were applicable prior to the submittal of the complete, finally adopted redesignation request. (It should be noted that, based on section 175A of the Act, other requirements of part D of the Act remain in effect until the USEPA approves the maintenance plan and the redesignation to attainment. If the USEPA disapproves the request to redesignate an area to attainment, these requirements remain in effect with no delay.) A SIP which meets the pre-redesignation request submittal requirements must be fully approved by the USEPA prior to USEPA's approval of the redesignation of the area to attainment of the NAAQS. The requirements of title I of the Act, which includes section 110 and part D of the Act, are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I (57 FR 13498). The State must be able to reasonably attribute the improvements in air quality to permanent and enforceable emission reductions. Attainment resulting from temporary emission reductions or from temporary favorable (not conducive to high ozone concentrations) meteorology would not qualify as a permanent air quality improvement. The State should demonstrate that the emission reductions from a past high ozone period (generally the year or period for which the area's ozone classification design value was determined, 1988 for Jersey County) to the period of attainment were due to the implementation of permanent and enforceable emission control measures and were sufficient to explain the attainment of the ozone NAAQS. Prior to the redesignation of an area to attainment, the USEPA must fully approve a maintenance plan (as a SIP revision) which meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. The maintenance plan must provide for maintenance of the NAAQS attainment in the area for at least 10 years after the USEPA approval of the redesignation request. The maintenance plan must contain additional emission control measures as necessary to assure maintenance of the NAAQS (generally this means maintaining the precursor emissions at or below the attainment year levels). The Act also requires (section 175A(b)) a second SIP revision 8 years after an area is redesignated to attainment to assure maintenance of the NAAQS for an additional 10 years beyond the first 10 year maintenance period. The maintenance plan must contain such contingency measures as the USEPA deems necessary to ensure prompt correction of any violation of the NAAQS occurring after the area is redesignated to attainment or exceedance of other triggering levels, such as emissions exceeding attainment levels (this could be caused by emission increases not anticipated in the maintenance plan). At a minimum, the maintenance plan should contain the following elements: 1. Attainment Inventory The State must develop an emissions inventory for the initial period of attainment to identify the level of emissions which is associated with attainment of the NAAQS. This emissions inventory must be consistent with USEPA's most recent guidance on preparation and documentation of emission inventories. The emissions inventory should be based on actual, typical summer weekday emissions of ozone precursors (Volatile Organic Compounds [VOC], Oxides of Nitrogen [NO X ], and Carbon Monoxide [CO]). 2. Maintenance Demonstration A State may generally demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS by either showing that future emissions of the ozone precursors will not exceed the levels of the emissions in the attainment inventory or by modeling to demonstrate that the future mix of sources and emission rates will not cause a violation of the NAAQS. The maintenance plan should be based on the same type and level of modeling used to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS in the SIP. Regardless of which approach is used, the State must project the emissions for the 10 year period following the anticipated time of the USEPA approval of the redesignation request (the State should assume that the USEPA will take two years to complete the rulemaking on the redesignation request). The projected emissions must reflect the expected actual emissions based on enforceable emission rates and typical source activity rates, such as production rates, adjusted for expected source growth. Projected emission reductions must reflect the impacts of permanent, enforceable emission control measures. The assumptions of emission reductions and source growth and techniques used to project the emissions must be clearly documented.
