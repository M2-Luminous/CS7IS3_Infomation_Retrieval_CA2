Azarova; place and date not given: "The Whys and Wherefores" -- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction published in boldface] [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Administration has adopted a comprehensive regional program for epidemiological protection of the oblast population in 1993-1996. We have asked N. Zagorskiy, chief of the oblast epidemiology service, to comment on this issue. Zagorskiy: It is hard to overstate the significance of this program. Everything it envisions is connected with concrete problems crucial to the health of the people. Unfortunately, the number of these problems is growing. This is the reason behind the concern of the epidemiology service and its goal-directed resolutions for overcoming an array of alarming situations. Some of these situations require immediate acting, some do not, however, all of them are equally important. By the way, the program prepared by our specialists falls in line with the program for socioeconomic development of our oblast in many aspects. Azarova: Could you outline the most important aspects of the program? Zagorskiy: There are no unimportant aspects of epidemiological protection of the people. For example, water supplies and the quality of water. Everyone knows that the quality is very poor. It is enough to see the inside our kettles covered with scale. It is necessary to boil water before drinking. Additionally, there are norms for drinking water specified by the State Standardization Office. Our water does not comply with these norms, particularly in the cities of Neman, Bagratinovsk, Pravdinsk, Ozersk, and Baltiysk. The situation in rural ares is even worse in some cases. Contamination of the water system is very dangerous. The September events in the village of Petrovo, Gurev Rayon, where 17 people were infected with viral hepatitis, may serve as an example. Also alarming is the situation in recreational areas polluted with sludge, waste, and sediment. Construction of new water treatment facilities have been postponed almost everywhere. The program provides, among other measures, for the completion of these projects. Azarova: One can have the impression that there is one big dumping ground around: You go to enjoy nature, but instead you see garbage everywhere. The same situation exists in cities and villages. One can feel disaster in the air. Zagorskiy: One such disaster is already under way. It is no secret that there is no facility for reprocessing solid wastes. There are only dumping grounds that spread disease and breed rats. Sometimes, dumping grounds self-ignite, such as the one in the village of Kosmodemyanskiy. Additionally, we should build a facility for utilizing toxic industrial waste currently dumped in forests, open fields, and water intakes. The Yantar factory was requested to conduct construction of such a facility. The program also provides for similar projects in various cities and rayons. Azarova: Recently, the issue of protection against electromagnetic radiation has appeared... Zagorskiy: We addressed this issue long ago, however... Currently, our specialists have managed to convince appropriate authorities that this is a very acute problem. For example, according to the program, the construction of the Kaliningrad television tower is to be moved outside the city limits in 1995. The issue of resettling people who live in zones with increased electromagnetic radiation is currently being examined. Permanent radiation control is being introduced at all border checkpoints of the Kaliningrad Regional Customs Office. Azarova: Nikolay Nikolayevich, what does the new program provide for protection against contagious diseases? According to your statistics, the epidemiological situation has deteriorated due to an array of diseases that, we thought, had disappeared forever... Zagorskiy: The reappearance of those diseases is connected with many reasons: migration of people, appearance of street markets, socioeconomic hardships, exacerbation of hygiene... Each of these reasons has generated its own consequences. Nowadays, we can observe increasing cases of pneumonia and sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis and viral hepatitis. The lack of appropriate hygiene has caused the spread of mycosis and itch. Regarding the latter, it would be expedient to return to the methods applied in the 1930's, and to reintroduce special medical subunits for treatment of this disease. Diphtheria has also been a big surprise to us. We are trying really hard: We vaccinate the people, even in their homes, however, there are still many who have not been vaccinated. The program provides for a complex of measures such as construction of a contagious diseases hospital in Kaliningrad, opening of a convalescent spa for those infected with pneumonia, or allocating special places for burying infected cattle. Nonetheless, the most important thing is to encourage the use of prophylactics among the people. Everybody must change his or her attitude today, and realize that they are the only ones responsible for their health. We will introduce obligatory health insurance and a massive vaccination campaign. The media could be very helpful in propagating our initiatives. The most important thing is that we are all healthy to work for ourselves and Russia's prosperity.
