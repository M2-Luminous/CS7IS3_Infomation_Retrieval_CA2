That meeting was supposed to discuss the disappearance of more than 12,000 Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, soldiers, according to estimates presented by the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz. Aldo Ajello, the UN secretary general's representative in Mozambique, has said in Maputo that the Mozambican Government delegation to the CSC has asked for a postponement to study the report and the number of soldiers said to be missing. The government had initially handed in to the Cease-Fire Commission, CCF, a list of 76,000 soldiers but then, without any explanation, that figure came down to 64,000 men. Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, the second man in the government team to the CSC, had said in mid-April that the figures produced by the government were viable and that Unomoz was using outdated information. Observers in the Mozambican capital admit the possibility that the Mozambican (?Defense Ministry) could have submitted lists containing false or outdated information, including soldiers killed or missing in action, as well as deserters.
