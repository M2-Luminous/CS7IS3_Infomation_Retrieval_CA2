The Congressional Joint Commission on the Budget, working through its technical staff, is conducting a study of the irregular expenditures that the government is making with no legal basis whatever. Federal Deputy Paulo Bernardo (PT [Workers Party], Parana), who made the initial calculations regarding those expenditures, will address the Chamber of Deputies today to denounce Itamar and the ministers for exceeding the appropriations in the General Budget of the Union. The deputy also intends to send an official letter requesting explanations by the ministers and President Itamar Franco. The president and the ministers responsible for irregular budget spending can be punished for crimes of responsibility. Such crimes are covered by the Constitution and by two other laws dealing with public administration. But Deputy Bernardo does not believe that Congress has the political will to demand enforcement of the law. "The budget issue is a policing issue because the administration thinks the legislative branch is `the house of Mother Joan' [meaning not known]," he said. According to the law -- Provisional Measure No. 396 -- the government is to spend one-twelfth of the budget appropriations. Excepted from that rule are budgeted expenditures for personnel, social security contributions, welfare benefits, debt service, and scholarships, teaching manuals, and benefits for government employees, including medical and dental care, as well as expenditures financed by funds originating in external credit operations and their respective counterpart funds. Any other expenditures, excluding subprojects and subactivities that were not already under way in 1993, must not exceed one-twelfth of the amount provided in the budget. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Illegal Spending (in real cruzeiros) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry or department |Cruzeiros | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Agriculture |15.3 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Education |24.9 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Social Security |97.9 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Justice |1.8 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Transport |362 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Industry, Commerce, Tourism |3.9 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Health |1.2 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Finance |3.7 trillion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Army |3.7 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Navy |9.2 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Aeronautics |1.1 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Science and Technology |5.7 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Mines and Energy |277 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Regional Integration |255.9 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Min. of Environment |122.3 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Secretariat of Strategic Affairs |3.0 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Federal Senate |938,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Office of the President |549 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grand total |3.9 trillion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Even Planalto Palace Ignores Law The current budget law, for which President Itamar Franco is responsible, is being ignored even by Planalto Palace, according to the study conducted by the Federal Integrated Financial Management System (Siafi). In addition to what was allowed, the Office of the President of the Republic spent $549 million cruzeiros on the Armed Forces General Staff and the Brazilian Communication Company. "The government issued a provisional measure to regulate those expenditures, but even it is not capable of obeying that measure," Deputy Bernardo complained. The congressman feels that President Itamar Franco has an obligation to see to it that the ministers explain themselves to the National Congress. Responding to a request from another PT deputy, Jose Paulo Pires (Minas Gerais), the Budget Commission's technical staff is also investigating the reasons why the administration overstepped the amounts established in the provisional measure on the budget. "We still do not know how much was spent in total, but we are asking the ministries to supply us with data on that subject," said the chief of the Budget and Financial Oversight Staff, Francisco de Paulo Schettini. Some ministries are reporting that they did not overspend, but spent only what was appropriated -- although that explanation is not being accepted in Congress -- on the grounds that "appropriation" means that public money has already been committed, according to the Budget Commission.
