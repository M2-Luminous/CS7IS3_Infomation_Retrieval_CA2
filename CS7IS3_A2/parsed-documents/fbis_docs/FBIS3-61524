Pankov, Ye.N. Volkova, Z.O. Shirokaya, Hydrobiology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC [(577.34:574.5):621.31](282.247.32)] [Abstract] Radioecological studies of the Kiev reservoir's littoral zone conducted both before (1979-1986) and after (1986-1991) the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident are reviewed, and the importance of the littoral areas due to the development of a many aquatic plants and invertebrates is stressed. A comparison of the radionuclide accumulation levels and parameters in the littoral component would make it possible realistically to assess the impact of radiative contamination, understand the radionuclide dynamics in abiotic and biotic components, and identify the radionuclide accumulation traits in hydrobionts at various trophic levels under the conditions of global and accident-related radioactive contamination of plain reservoirs. The study methods and materials and sampling procedures are outlined. The radionuclide concentration was measured by radiochemistry and _g_-spectrometry methods using an instrument consisting of a DGDK-40A detector, a system of Vektor input modules, and AI-4096-A90 amplitude analyzer. The concentration of long-lived radionuclides ([.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137 [/] Cs) in the ecosystem components in 1979, the accumulation coefficients, contribution, and ratio of long-lived radionuclides in the ecosystem components in 1979, the contribution of [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]134[/] Cs+[.sup]137[/]Cs to the total radioactivity of ecosystem components in 1986-1991, and the radionuclide accumulation coefficients in the ecosystem components in May-Jun 86 are summarized. The study shows that the radionuclide concentration dynamics are due to the washing out of radioactive elements from the 30 km zone around the nuclear plant and depend on the complex hydrological and hydrochemical processes in the estuary of the Pripyat river and littoral zone. Since 1987, strontium made a dominant contribution to the radionuclide content in the water and mollusks while cesium has been detected in fish since mid-1986 and in higher aquatic plants--since 1988.
