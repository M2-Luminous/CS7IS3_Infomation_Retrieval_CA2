What are your views on the chances of this fledgling stratum of society? [Latorcai] Well-functioning democracies and economies base themselves on the bourgeoisie, and the middle class is an essential part of this. Our conditions are still confused, we cannot yet talk about an organized market economy, and the middle classes are still missing. However, we can already see how and where they will be established. One way of establishing them is through the economic policy creating more opportunity for domestic entrepreneurs. [passage omitted] [Pinter] A strong middle class cannot exist without a proprietor group that is becoming richer and more efficient. In your view, does a group like this exist in Hungary? [Latorcai] Yes, it does. To make it bigger, loans have been and still are needed because the personal savings have proved to be too small. In spite of all this, partly as a result of the role of foreign capital, some 35 percent of Hungarian industry is in private ownership and, in 1993, this 35 percent produced 50 percent of the output. This is important and encouraging data when it comes to formulating the ideas of the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] aimed at economic growth. [Pinter] What is the essence of these ideas? [Latorcai] First of all, the stimulation of enterprises. We would particularly like to continue and to expand the support for small- and medium-size enterprises. One method of this would be a new regulation of tax and credit policy and the expansion of help for new enterprises. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In this program, which components criticize the current economic policy? [Latorcai] A change of philosophy is most important in our view. It should be the economy, rather than the budget, that determines the situation of the country and, as far as possible, which also determines the budget. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a new regulation of state finances. In the interest of a more proportionate share of the burdens, we want to move from an income-type taxation toward a consumption-type taxation; taxing the accumulated large assets and, in personal taxation, giving greater weight to family taxation are unavoidable. And while we are talking about the criticism of the current practice: A change of direction has to be implemented in economic policy that will give greater scope to the state's role to the extent that is necessary, but not work against the market processes. A lasting industrial growth is impossible without developing its dynamic branches, therefore, we want to improve the investment conditions, we are planning to change the amortization system, we would like to give tax allowances for investments, and we would expand the preferential loan packages. It is essential to draw up a nationwide program of infrastructure development because this development creates an additional demand in the economy, creates work opportunities, and boosts the domestic market. In privatization, we want to extend the proprietor groups in society, to ensure that the privatization of the state assets is done in a planned, controllable, and visible way. The revenues from privatization should not be used to restore the short-term budget balance because these amounts are needed in the reorganization of the economy, industry, or the given company. We find it necessary to increase the involvement of foreign working capital. [Pinter] Are you not afraid that even your own voters will accuse you of selling off the country? Such comments cannot only be heard from the supporters of parties that are said to be extremists. [Latorcai] I know about this, I can hear it, and I am sufficiently annoyed about it. My reply is that 10 to 12 percent of the national assets are in question. In the vast majority of privatizations and investments with foreign capital, technologies, and factory and labor managements that are more modern than the domestic ones have been implemented, and they have helped our domestic products gain access to the markets of developed countries. The favorable influence the joint ventures have on their suppliers when they insist on deadlines and regular good quality is worth noticing. Having said all this, I must say that, in the interest of increasing the domestic entrepreneurial willingness, the KDNP does not want to differentiate between domestic and foreign investments. This is one of the reasons it is important to involve a large proportion of domestic savings in the economy. A better offer of credits and bank privatization implemented while a modern banking system is established is a short step away from this. [passage omitted] [Pinter] You are also probably familiar with the view that the KDNP's current behavior is like a political conjurer's trick because the party is showing a striking flexibility regarding its participation in a coalition after the elections. Do these views offend you? [Latorcai] The KDNP has become one of the most important factors in Hungarian politics, and it would be strange if its behavior was not surrounded by speculations. The KDNP will certainly not govern together with forces that do not accept the civilized value system that has been established in Europe. In the interest of raising the nation, the KDNP lays great emphasis on creating consensus. I agree with this, and as an economic expert, I know that those who create and implement the economic policy that is our future will need an as broad as possible consensus. Since the KDNP has many values, we can certainly assess the values of other parties, too. We can determine how suitable these values, together, are for serving the nation. To remain in my professional area, the KDNP certainly will not join a partner that lets inflation loose, increases unemployment, and further increases the country's indebtedness, because these kinds of conditions would make the futures of our children and even our grandchildren uncertain.
