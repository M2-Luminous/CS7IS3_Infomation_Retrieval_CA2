On the evening of June 19, a flood peak of the Beijiang River, the highest water level in the past 50 years, struck the Shijiao- Xialingzhou section of the dyke, causing seepage along a three to four-km section. At the critical moment, several thousand local people and PLA soldiers rushed to the site with sand-bags and other material to reinforce the dyke. By 4:00 in the early morning of June 20, the flood peak passed the Sanshui hydrometric station safely and Guangzhou city and the Pearl River Delta survived. In Duan, Luocheng and two other cities of Guangxi, which were most seriously hit by the floods, the regional governor, Cheng Kejie, went to the flood-stricken counties to make arrangements for air-dropping relief supplies to over 6,000 people besieged by the waters. Hunan provincial leaders also went to the flood-hit area and led about two million local people to fight the flood together with 3,000 PLA soldiers. The flood peak of the Xiangjiang River has now passed Changsha city, capital of Hunan Province. But some of Changsha's urban and suburban areas are still immersed in water. In Jiangxi Province, more than three million local people and 120,000 PLA soldiers have spared no efforts to fight the floods. So far, over two million straw bags, 137,000 cubic meters of sand and aggregate, 292 lifeboats and 1,461 automobiles have been used in the battle against the floods. According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the water levels of the four major flood rivers -- the Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang -- have all started to drop slowly, but are still above their warning levels. Since the flood peaks of the Xijiang and Beijiang will affect the Pearl River Delta simultaneously, the delta, one of China's most economically developed areas, is still facing heavy pressure from the floods. Some PLA soldiers have been transferred from Guangxi to Guangdong to help the people there to fight the floods.
