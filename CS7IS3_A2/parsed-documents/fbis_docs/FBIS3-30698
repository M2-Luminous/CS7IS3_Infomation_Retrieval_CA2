Ujazdowski told a press conference on Monday, that a dispute has been going on since the time the PK was established as to whether Polish conservatism is to be a fragment of the Polish right-wing. he maintained that the faction within the PK, headed by the party's leader Aleksander Hall, teetered between the right-wing and the Democratic Union which he described as inconsistent with the target of the PK. Ujazdowski added that a peaceful split was a better solution than an exhausting fight. "In our opinion there is no conservatism beyond the right-wing. The split was a condition for the integration of the right-wing," he said. The Conservative Coalition supports a fast integration of the Polish right-wing parties into one coalition. He declared that his grouping would cooperate with the coalition made up of the Centre Alliance, the Christian National Union, the Peasant Agreement and the Movement for the Republic of Poland and would seek the cooperation of the Christian Democrats party and the Real Politics Union. The right wing needs to be integrated as fast as possible and to create an attractive alternative for the leftist rule. We hope that our efforts will lead to the formation of one grand right-wing coalition, Ujazdowski said. He added that the diversification of the right-wing parties was not an obstacle to their integration. He also reported that the Conservative Coalition is being supported by a half of the Conservative Party local structures, that is some 1,000 people.
