The government has at no point asked for an opinion to permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as foreign military vessels and aircraft in the national territory in accordance with the provisions of Articles 189, No. 7, and 237, No. 3, of the Constitution. 2. In light of the Constitution, the council does not find convincing the government's explanations on the decisions it has made concerning this matter, because the interpretation of the text of the same and the treaties and agreements signed by Colombia goes against the letter and spirit of the Constitution and violates national sovereignty. 3. From the same explanations, it can be deduced the Senate did not grant the permission established by Article 173, No. 4, of the Constitution. 4. Given the de facto situation that was created, it believes U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in Colombian territory without fulfilling the requisites established in the Constitution. 5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the president of the Republic is responsible for the Colombian state's foreign relations with absolute respect for national sovereignty; consequently, it is unusual for the president to state the defense minister gave the authorization without his previous knowledge even though the memorandum of understanding signed by that minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993 establishes that they are acting with due authorization from their respective governments. A copy of this statement shall be sent, along with the letters exchanged between the Council of State and the president of the Republic, to the Honorable Chamber of Representatives Commission To Investigate Charges and to the nation's attorney general so (?they can do their job). Copy to the president of the Republic. [Issued] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 February.
