He said that Karabakh forces are sticking with defensive tactics, and are suffering significantly fewer losses than the enemy. Last week Karabakh detachments lost several dozen men killed, while the Azeri Army lost over 600. In the words of Petrosyan, forces of the army of Nagornyy Karabakh captured 15 light armored vehicles, 8 tanks and 5 IFVs as trophies, and brought down one airplane of the Azeri air forces. According to a statement from Petrosyan the Armenian side also possesses information indicating that Afghan mujahadin are taking part in fighting on the Azeri side east of the rayon center of Mardakert. The Azeri Ministry of Defense evaluates its position more optimistically. In its statement it noted that the offensive has been halted in all sectors, and over the last three days the advancing troop formations lost 16 units of armored equipment in the Terter sector.
