According to official forecasts, the workforce employed in China's collectively-owned enterprises will reach 65 million by the turn of this century. They will then make up 33 percent of all people employed, compared with 23 percent now. In the last fifteen years, since the start of the reform-and-opening up policy, one third of the country's 100 million newly-employed urban workforce have found jobs in the collective sector. More significantly, in the township and village-run enterprises, over 90 percent of the 110 million working staff have been employed in the collective sector. "It is an inevitable tendency to resort to the non-state-owned sector to promote employment," said Zhang Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA here today. Zhang noted that the state-owned enterprises are at present weak in their ability to absorb workers, due to the ongoing transformation of these enterprises' whole set-up. Now the national unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent, he said, adding that he expects the number of unemployed to reach 5 million by the end of this year. "The best way to curb the jobless growth is to give full play to the collective sector," said Zhang, the leading official charged with resolving China's unemployment problem. He explained that the collective enterprises have the advantages of public ownership and the adaptability to the market economy. There is huge employment potential hidden in the collective sector, he said. Experts expect that the proportion of the employed population in the state-owned enterprises will drop from 70 percent to 55 percent by the year 2000, to the tune of 110 million people. While in the collective and other non-state sector, the employed population will double to 90 million, with the proportion in the state's total employed figure rising from 30 to 45 percent.
