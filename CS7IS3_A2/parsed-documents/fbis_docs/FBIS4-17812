This measure of time, to which we are accustomed, can be replaced by the 100-day period which has been adopted in the West, whereupon preliminary assessments of a political leader's activity are made. The ascent of the former leader of the "Communists of Russia" faction in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and currently member of the Russian Federation Agrarian Party, to the post of State Duma chairman, was at first perceived very cautiously and coolly by politicians and the press. However, since his first few weeks of leading the lower chamber of the parliament, Ivan Rybkin has "grown" perceptibly in the eyes of the deputies-democrats and observers, thanks primarily to the striking contrast with Ruslan Khasbulatov. Unlike him, the new speaker does not pull up people who are speaking, he does not get involved in arguments with them, and -- and this is very important for a speaker -- does not put the stress on the wrong syllables. According to an ironic observation by NTV Chief Editor Igor Malashenko following an interview with Ivan Rybkin on the ITOGI program, "this is the first politician in our country who knows the word `definition.'" You can assume how difficult it is for a "communist speaker," as Ivan Rybkin is described by the world news agencies, to balance between the right wing and the left wing in the Duma. In this regard, the most dramatic event for him in the 100 days of his chairmanship has been the vote in the Duma on the package of decisions on the amnesty. On the one hand, the Zhirinovskiyites, the Communists, and the Agrarians would not have forgiven the head of the Duma for defecting while, on the other hand, the presidential and democratic wing was following his stance vigilantly, as if with X-ray eyes. In this tense clash, Ivan Rybkin saved face thanks to the readiness demonstrated by the Russian Federation president's aide Georgiy Satarov to submit to the State Duma sitting the question of amending the decree on a political amnesty, which, however, was not fated to come about. On the other hand, the chairman of the State Duma did not generate irritation among his own supporters either, since he is upholding the material and housing interests of former Russian Federation people's deputies before the Presidential Administration, including the instigators of the 3-4 October events in Moscow. "Magnanimity disheartens opponents, and it is impossible to approach civil peace without the idea of forgetting the past," -- that is how Ivan Rybkin answered my question about whether he considers the transfer of Moscow apartments to the ownership of Ilya Konstantinov and Sergey Baburin, for example, to be moral. However, in his plan to transform his views from communist ones to social-democratic ones, Ivan Rybkin is generating sharp condemnation in the opposition camp. At the March rally in Moscow, devoted to the anniversary of the referendum on preserving the USSR, the speakers publicly renounced their former kindred spirit, which undoubtedly worked to the benefit of the centrist image of the chairman of the lower chamber of the parliament. "I am not the speaker of two factions, but of the entire Duma," Ivan Rybkin said about this. Members of the "Russia's Choice" faction, who at first did not trust the speaker -- who was not "one of their men" by definition -- now clearly sympathize with him. Furthermore, judging by the results of the visit by a State Duma delegation headed by Ivan Rybkin to Finland, I would boldly call his views on economics entirely liberal. At a meeting with the leadership of the Central Union of Industry and Employers in Helsinki, the Duma speaker sharply rebuked the "state parasites, running to Chernomyrdin for money," and promised to use his powers for the adoption of laws on granting only targeted credits, accompanied by clear control of their use. Giving his own assessment of his 100 days of endeavors in the post of speaker, Ivan Rybkin noted with satisfaction in our conversation that the "chamber has not decided to implement the principle of formal majority [formalnoye bolshinstvo] in adopting decisions," and he added that in Russia's history it has actually been the minority which has often turned out to be right. Ivan Rybkin considers the adoption of the federal budget for the second quarter and the joint work with the government on the draft budget for 1994 and 1995 to be on the positive side of the State Duma's activity. In addition, he also singled out serious work done by the chamber, such as the Civil, Land, Electoral, and Administrative Codes, prepared for examination at the State Duma's sitting. For journalists, the most important indicator of a politician's opinions remains his attitude to the press, for which Ruslan Khasbulatov was particularly "famous." Again, unlike him, when asked whether it is not time for the government and the parliament to give up the state press organs, Ivan Rybkin answered that, apart from a few individual deputies, the State Duma does not lay claim to its own press organ, and is prepared to be satisfied with a supplement in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, where adopted laws will be officially published. At the same time, the chamber speaker believes, the State Duma should not "support" the entire newspaper, but should only pay for expenditure involved in publishing the supplement. He also deems it necessary to provide a certain number of hours of broadcasting on state television for the federal organs of power, citing the experience of the BBC state television company in Britain. On the other hand, Ivan Rybkin warned journalists against "going to the other extreme, when individual economic groups make the mass media subordinate to themselves." A fine morning augurs a nice day. May the "weather" in the State Duma speaker's mutual relations with the president, the deputies' factions, and the press remain fine -- previous political storms which raged on the political pinnacle, cost society too dear.
