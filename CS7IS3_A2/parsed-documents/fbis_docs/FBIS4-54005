During the session, the SDPJ, Sakigake, and Seiun agreed to create three panels on "welfare, administrative reform, and tax system reform"; "security"; and "agriculture." They also agreed to draw up plans for overhauling the current tax system by the end of June. The "Minshu no Arashi" [Storm of Democracy], a House of Representatives parliamentary group organized by legislators who broke away from the Japan New Party, is expected to join the Policy Study Council. The SDPJ, Sakigake, and Seiun intend to work out the plans for overhauling the current tax system in line with a set of policy agreements concluded among the ruling coalition parties; the plans are likely to call for abolishing or revamping the consumption tax and raising indirect taxes. The plans to be worked out by the two parties and Seiun, which hold the deciding vote in the Diet, are likely to have a decisive impact on the tax system reform's future. On 23 May, the "Consultative Council on Welfare, Administrative Reform, and Tax System Reform" [headed by Shoichi Ide, chairman of the Sakigake General Council] held its first session in the Diet building to decide that: 1) two project teams on "welfare" and "administration and finance" will be organized; 2) the council will hold discussion from the position of salary earners, consumers, and women; and 3) legislators from the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party will be allowed to attend the council as observers. At the session, the council made clear its position of attaching importance to "administrative reform" by deciding to draw up plans for reforming administration and finances as part of efforts to reform the current tax system. The SDPJ, Sakigake, and Seiun intend to press the government and the ruling coalition parties to reform the current tax system by speedily drawing up plans for overhauling the current tax system in parallel with debates by the Tax System Reform Consultative Council of the ruling coalition parties.
