FBIS4-6514 "dreas077_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 South Korea Patriot Deployment, Team Spirit Issue Viewed Patriot Deployment, Team Spirit Issue Viewed SK2104082994 SK2104082994 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 21 April reacting to the decision to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "North Korea Should Understand the Significance of the Decision on Team Spirit." Asserting that the most effective means to counter the North Korean nuclear issue is firm coordination between the ROK and the United States, the editorial writes military cooperation between the two countries is imperative in the current situation. The editorial welcomes the decision of ROK and U.S. defense ministers to strengthen combined war preparedness writing that it is a very timely tuning of strategy as suspicions surrounding North Korea's nuclear development have not been cleared. Defining the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise as an "inevitable decision," the editorial stresses that "such a security coordination system should remain firm until it is confirmed that North Korea has no nuclear weapons," and that "North Korea should stop trying to avoid nuclear inspections with various excuses." The editorial shows concern over foreign reports that the United States asked the ROK to be armed with modern weapons as the selection of weapons should be decided by the ROK, not the United States. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Reinforcement of Defense Posture is Fundamental." The editorial welcomes the decision of the ROK and U.S. defense ministers to resume the Team Spirit exercise and to reinforce the combined forces saying that it was a "natural," "inevitable," and "appropriate" decision. Regarding the issue of purchasing more modern arms, the editorial writes the decision should be made according to ROK's conditions and abilities, adding that the Yulgok project may be adjusted but should not be influenced by the U.S. defense industry's demands. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Unlimited Armament Competition Is Not Appropriate." Consenting to the theory that military superiority deters war, the editorial writes, however, making the Korean peninsula an unlimited exhibition place of modern arms cannot be tolerated. Noting the remarks of Edward Warner, U.S. assistant secretary of defense, that modern heavy arms will be deployed to the ROK by the end of the summer, the editorial writes the United States is trying to deploy another new weapon after safely deploying Patriot missiles as a result of the "sea of fire" remarks by North Korea. The editorial writes the current situation cannot be described as a crisis, citing Kim Il-song's recent appeasement remarks and the fact that South Koreans were not threatened by the "sea of fire" remarks. The editorial notes that it is the United States that more frequently talks about the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes by warning that "excessive deployment of modern arms might stimulate North Korea's desire to develop nuclear weapons to overcome the gap in military capacity in a single blow."
