Among the 200 soldiers were 80 Vietnamese who acted as the spearhead. These 80 men are Cambodian-speaking Vietnamese; some talk in Cambodian with an accent when communicating with their colleagues on the battlefield. These 200 form the core of the troops in other divisions who have been beaten, killed, or wounded on Route 68 east of Samraong and west of Samraong battlefields, such as Division 11, 9, 3, the new Division 7, and units from the 4th Military Region. All these troops are under the command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, and a dozen other, so-called generals. However, once again the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, in cooperation with the people, have smashed their offensive. In particular on 20 January, our national army scored a direct hit against the frontline command post of the communist Vietnamese's puppets with Long Sopheap and Prum Samen as commanding generals. We killed 47 communist Vietnamese puppets, whose bodies were left on the spot, and wounded some others. We destroyed four armored vehicles, three tanks, six military trucks, and a large quantity of military materiel. Among those killed or wounded were Prum Samen, some generals, and many colonels and majors who were meeting and drinking alcohol. Now Long Sopheap's position is being surrounded and attacked by us; he is looking for a way to escape. The remaining soldiers have been routed and have fled to the west of Route 69. In three days -- 20, 21, and 22 January -- troops of the communist Vietnamese panicked and fled in units, in groups of 10 or 20 at a time, four or five groups a day. Only the special units composed of Vietnamese soldiers speaking Cambodian with an accent remain. Fifty percent of these special units have been killed or wounded; they are either being killed or wounded, or they are fleeing. These fleeing soldiers say that they are not staying to fight; they are afraid of death because this is a place of death. If the commanders want to fight, let them do the fighting themselves.
