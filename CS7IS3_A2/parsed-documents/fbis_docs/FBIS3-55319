Owing to reasons which are easy to understand, I have come to you feeling certain emotions. It was not easy for me to take this podium because the loss of Abkhazia, be it a temporary loss, is a great pain for the whole of Georgia and you, in the first place, for your friends and relatives, and for all Georgians and non-Georgians who have been expelled from Abkhazia. I would like to start by saying I'm sorry. I am the leader of this country and I want to tell you frankly that I bear a very big share of the responsibility for what has happened, for this great disaster and tragedy. Things could have turned out differently had all levels of the Georgian leadership been up to snuff. We did not enter Abkhazia to fight. One cannot fight in one's own country and cannot deploy troops in an area unless there is an emergency there. We entered there to establish order. Unfortunately, the most difficult and unexpected thing has happened. I would like you to include me among the people who are now called refugees. Let me assure you that I am dreaming of returning to Abkhazia, as does each of you who has lost your home. I have the same emotions as each of you. I repeat: I consider myself a refugee until you and I return to Abkhazia. All my colleagues in the present leadership and the Citizens' Union of Georgia feel the same. I profoundly believe that our meeting today and the founding of the Abkhazia branch of the Citizens' Union will not simply be a formal event. We will become a political force which will lead Georgia into a big arena, a force which will guarantee Georgia's unity, integrity, the unity of the Georgian people, the unity of all people living in Georgia, and it will guarantee Georgia's strength and future. If I did not believe in this, I would not spend the rest of my years with this organization. I profoundly believe in this and I also want you to believe. It was said here quite rightly that the first thing to be done in the new year is to establish order in the whole of Georgia. First of all, a real Georgian army should be created. One of the main reasons for the loss of Abkhazia was our failure to create a real Georgian army, a national army. Those who were with me there -- I can see that Batoni [honorific title] Tamaz is present, as well as many others with whom I spent most difficult days, hours, and minutes -- can confirm that there was heroism, bravery, selflessness, and sacrifice, but I cannot say that there was a Georgian army. It was not an army. Judging numerically and qualitatively, if we consider each young man individually, judging by equipment and armaments, we should not have lost that war. Unfortunately, we lost it because there was no single and well- organized force. In my short New Year's interview, I said that one of our priority tasks is to create a Georgian army in the next few months, in the next two or three months. The material and the means to do it exist. The main thing is to ensure good organization. As the head of state and the commander in chief of our army, I want to assure you that I will do everything to have such an army in Georgia. It is not accidental that I am saying this. Why I am saying this I will tell you towards the end. The disaster which has befallen us was not accidental. I want us to look with self-criticism into our affairs and life. We have made so many errors. Did we not create a terrible phenomenon of modern times which is provincial fascism? I often say this and will often repeat it in future. We ourselves brought fascism, fascist forces, to power. We inculcated this ideology for several years. There will be a congress of the Citizens' Union of Georgia where we will show the whole country how this terrible disease was gaining ground in Georgia ideologically, psychologically, and philosophically. I have recently asked my colleagues to select some newspapers, brochures, and books published at the time, so that I could leaf through them. They go even further than Hitler's Mein Kampf. And this was happening here in Georgia. And we were applauding this. Eighty-seven percent voted for this fascism. We were punished. We should have been punished and were punished. The same fascism took root in Abkhazia. Even a worse brand of fascism. If provincial fascism had not existed here, then the Ardzinba regime would not have dominated Abkhazia. Our fascism legitimized that terrible electoral law which in practice meant apartheid, one nation oppressing another and the discrimination of one nation by another. This was fascism at work in Georgia. This was followed by everything we have witnessed, the executions, including Zhiuli Shartava [chairman of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, who was killed in September 1993], the town mayor... [70 second loss of reception] We were robbing them, is it true or not? Unfortunately, all this has happened. Let us also remember how we drove Ossetians out of Tbilisi. After all, these people made up only one or two percent of the population here. You remember how we drove them out, how we fired and dismissed them from jobs, how we evicted them from their homes. And now they are living in the northern Caucasus. These were people who had been brought up in Georgian schools. Many of them wrote poems and stories in Georgian, worked in our laboratories and were engaged in work. I was brought up and have worked with many of them. They were wonderful people. How could we have expelled them from here? How could we have expelled them from the Borjomi gorge [in southern Georgia]. This was one of the areas known for its fertile land and hard-working people. Like gendarmes they [Georgians] took them and expelled them, and now these people are sheltering somewhere. How we tortured Ossetians. They also tortured Georgians, but how we tortured Ossetians. How we gouged out their eyes. How we committed terrible deeds. Was it fascism or not? Yes, it was. This fascism gave Ardzinba that electoral law. It agreed with his aspirations. Therefore, we must say, as I said in my New Year's interview, that the year 1993 was, in a way, a year of purification. This purification must continue. We, the Georgian people, must be purified of sins. The sins which have been committed must be admitted. God will only be on the side of an honest man, an honest people and nation. This is a law of history and this is a lesson of history. I think that we have swallowed a lot of bitter pills in our life, and 1992 and 1993 were years of drawing conclusions from bitter lessons. We have committed many other sins. We want all this to be discussed at the congress of our union. It will be discussed in a manly, direct, and resolute manner. If we do this, the Citizens' Union will become established in our society and will be a guarantor of our country's future. We are making grave mistakes even today and I think this must also be mentioned. Most of you are now living in Tbilisi. I am not talking about hardship. It has affected everyone, both the refugees and locals. I know about many cases of people starving to death. It is difficult to imagine a disaster greater than that. However, let us talk about the New Year. Things are gradually improving but the New Year's fun was killed by endless shooting on New Year's eve. They were shooting from cannons, self-made guns, rifles, machine gun, from everything. One might think that it was the end, or, rather, the beginning of the storming of Berlin, or, rather, that the Berlin operation was under way. It was terrible. I think that in a short while we will restore the kind of order which will allow the whole world to say that it is possible in Georgia, or, rather, that normal people live in Georgia. We are tarnishing our reputation by doing this. [applause] It was a terrible night. The new year is a time of joy, but this time it was terrible. At a meeting with people of Tbilisi I said that those who are confronting us, regardless of their rank, reputation -- and I am not speaking here about illegal armed formations whom I have already challenged to fight a duel -- will not be forgiven. This disaster will be over. [applause] Reclaiming Abkhazia starts in Tbilisi, reclaiming Abkhazia starts in Samegrelo. I shall tell you one more truth. Had we not made so many mistakes in Samegrelo [Mengrelia], had we not given away Samegrelo to those people who did not deserve it, then nothing would have happened to Abkhazia, we would not have lost Abkhazia. Samegrelo was, in effect lost for Georgia and she was paralyzed. This is what Samegrelo means to Georgia. And you know what, the most difficult days...[pauses], I have the right to say that I am one of the refugees. I did not leave Sukhumi for one moment even when we seemingly gained a victory in the month of March nor when we were being defeated. Many of you probably left [Sukhumi] at the end and I was one of those people who escaped in the nick of time. To tell you the truth, I was dreaming of not leaving it [Sukhumi]. It just did not work out. I still think I was right to leave. But I witnessed...[pauses] When we had the biggest crisis, we should not have been defeated. We had everything that we needed: manpower, arms, and the population of Sukhumi was disposed to fight, but units after units disengaged themselves from combat posts. There are people from Sukhumi, they will confirm it. Is it not true? They used to disengage themselves and flee. I shall not forget one session. We used to gather every night at 0200 and sum up the day's results until 0300 to 0400. I shall never forget this session. I shall not give away the name of the young man, he may not be alive or perhaps he is hiding in mountains; the Sukhumi funicular, the key strategic center -- if it is within your view then you control Sukhumi -- a 60 to 70-strong unit was standing there. I asked at the session what the situation was like at the funicular. The leader got up and told me, do not worry, everything is well, it is guarded safely. The next morning, before the dawn, at 0500, I was told that the unit had disengaged itself and left the funicular. In half an hour mountain peoples and others went up there and occupied the funicular. Thirty-five of the best youths fell in the battles to recapture the funicular, but in vain, because it had already been captured by others and it was the beginning of the fall of Sukhumi. Battalion after battalion used to disengage themselves from combat positions and at the end as we had no other option. Jaba Ioseliani, myself and two or three more men, we were begging with our hands up -- I cannot use a gun, I am not a shooter -- standing in the street: Please, units, get back, get back -- but they were fleeing like a flock of sheep. What had happened? Why were they fleeing? Because there was an order from the ex-president, if Sukhumi falls, Shevardnadze's government will fall too. Is it not a betrayal? That is why I am saying that we must look into our hearts, our sins, our misfortune. Had we been united, a united Georgia, or had Loti Kobalia come in good time -- we had given him arms; Kitovani and others had given him and others three-fourths of the arms; they had given them everything there was, they were armed to the teeth and he did not budge. It was so easy to cross the Kodori river, there were only 1,500 men there. Karkarashvili had crossed over and back. They [Kobalia and his army] did not want to cross over. They were dreaming that Sukhumi would fall and they would come back to power. It is a dirty careerism. It is authentic fascism. It was the real cause. Of course, there was a betrayal from Russia's reactionary forces which helped the rebels, supplied them with arms and plans but despite all this, Sukhumi would not have fallen by any means, had it not been for the betrayal. Citizens' Union of Georgia must become the force which will tell everybody the truth, whenever, whatever the difficulties may be, however unpalatable the truth may be, it will tell the truth and it is for the first time that I am telling the truth about the Sukhumi disaster. The key cause lies in ourselves, our betrayal, the dual nature and the duplicity of some Georgians who had allowed the unity of the country, the fate of the country, the salvation of Sukhumi and Abkhazia for the fall of a dream for a career. This is the trouble. You know, we have been punished but not forever. They are dead ringers, like the two drops of water, the only difference being in the fact that in the first instance the matter is Abkhazians and in the second one it is Georgians. This is what the ideological preparation was like for what became to be known as the Abkhaz tragedy and disaster as well as the tragedy which had taken place in Georgia. I am saying all this because the session of the Citizens' Union of Georgia is analyzing everything now and will tell the truth, the whole truth. Georgia is now once again in the limelight not only because of the Sukhumi affair previously and other events; it is once again in the limelight. Why? Because fascism as such, is emerging as an event not only in one small corner and country but also on a larger scale. The fascist force has come to the fore in Russia. When I was in Ashgabat, I felt a terrible alarm by the leaders of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, our neighbors, and many others who were voicing a big fear over the emerging of the fascist force so boldly, obviously, in such an up-front manner, so unexpectedly in the arena. When they looked around, they said that Georgia had the greatest and most interesting experience in fighting fascism. I said then and I say now that we have sorted out our fascism, we have defeated our fascism and now we must all unite in the CIS so that fascism does not win in Russia. If fascism were to win in Russia, it will be the burial of not only Russia, but Georgia as well. It will be a disaster. We shall not be able to stay away from these processes. Therefore, the example of our fight, I do not mean only a physical fight, literally, but an ideological fight as well; and destroying fascism is our duty as it will help everybody. Fascism is one of the greatest dangers for the today's world in the same way as is separatism about which I used to talk much before and am still talking. They have comprehended in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and other countries that separatism is charged with an equally explosive bomb as an atomic one. They have just comprehended it. Can you imagine what will happen in Kazakhstan where it is 40 percent Kazakh and 60 percent other nationalities? What will happen if separatism spreads its wings there? Or what will happen in Ukraine where there are 15 million people of other nationalities and at that in the best organized and highly developed regions? What will happen if separatism is revived there as well as in other countries? Here, too, although bitter but still, an experience of fighting separatism has been accumulated in Georgia. I mean aggressive, fascist separatism but all this is the past. We must still talk about today and tomorrow. I have said already and it is my analysis, not just an accidental phrase that the year 1994 must become the year of the beginning of a great turn, a turn towards progress, it must become the year of a serious turn. I have confidence. This is the result of our analysis and the conclusion from that analysis. When proving this, I am also pinning hopes on the formation of such a strong political force as the Citizen' Union of Georgia. I trust that the Citizens' Union will be able to offer the public and Georgia solutions for the crisis. It must happen at our congress which will probably take place in February: how to bring Georgia out of the economic and political crisis, the social hardship and many other disasters that descended on us. There are solutions for it. The main thing is to find these ways properly and show people that we are not predestined, that the situation is not that hopeless; and that if we do not give up, if we get down to work and choose proper ways, there are solutions and the country will be saved. I hope that the citizens' Union will be the very political force which will create such a program and present it to the public. The Citizens' Union, as I have already told you, will present to the public an analysis of the events which took place in recent years. It will be a serious analysis and serious summary. The Citizens' Union must manage -- and I am sure we shall all unite in order to achieve this -- to offer the public the program of restoring justice in Abkhazia and returning to Abkhazia; not by using slogans, demagogy, populist appeals and drumming more support and creating a heroic name for oneself and so on, but a realistic, scientific program for reclaiming Abkhazia. I am sure we shall manage it. I have said many times and I am repeating once again that there are two solutions. They were there before and remain in force now. There are two solutions. We cannot afford refusing political means for settling the conflict, if they [political means] correspond to our interests. I know the disposition of some of you. Please, do not take offense if I am say this because several times our hopes had been dashed and it cost us very dear, the aftermath was grave. Still, life keeps changing, there are slightly different conditions now. International organizations are more active and there are more hopes for their support. We have new friends, Georgia has new friends -- they have emerged, supervisors and observers of this process -- the United States of America, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Russia simultaneously with those negotiations held under the auspices of the UN. Deep in my heart I believe that Russia herself, in the long run, has been assured; anyway this is my impression judging from the conversation with the president, that Georgia's losing Abkhazia means the beginning of Russia's disintegration. I had been saying this for a long time before but unfortunately not everybody heard it and failed to hear it properly. If Russia were to follow democracy and the Russian president assured all of us -- the leaders of the CIS countries -- that there was no other solution and Russia's current constitution provides with a possibility that Russia will develop in a democratic way, then Russia must become our ally in reclaiming Abkhazia. Our first and foremost task is the speediest return of all refugees. As soon as the refugees return, as soon as everybody returns to their homes -- some houses had been burned to the ground, some survived, most of them have been looted and destroyed, we shall still restore them, all of us, together -- then the Abkhaz issue will be resolved because then, only elections must follow it and you know very well what the results of the elections will be. There are other terms as well. I consider joining the CIS as one of the important events. Let them say whatever they please and smirk wickedly, I still think that I was the first to have taken this step. I am right in my choice. I have not made a mistake and in Ashgabat I got assured once again that my colleagues and myself and those who think in the same way as I do, those who share my point of view, that we are right. We have not made a mistake. At the closed session of the heads of states it was said that the CIS would be a viable organism only if it creates appropriate guarantees for the territorial integrity and the stability of the countries. A specific mechanism has already been created, it is being created. There is such a phrase in the document which all of us signed together, we all signed it unanimously. This is one of the guarantees that the situation will change. I must say that many countries did not understand our stance in connection with Abkhazia at the beginning stage, especially the central Asian countries; there was a misinterpretation in the beginning in Ukraine, and in Russia, of course. Today, as everybody has already seen what aggressive separatism means in reality and in action, nearly all these countries are on Georgia's side. It is a very important event; not to mention anything about the world support. Friends, we all owe -- and I am not saying it in order to just pay tribute -- we really owe the refugees. We know how hard it is for you and even more for those who are not here, who could not come. I know all about it very well. Probably we must settle whatever needs settling. Unfortunately the coupon has no value but we must still double, triple the payment so that people heave a little sigh of relief and humanitarian aid will be reinforced. I shall have the possibility to specially summon the vice-premier, Batoni Irakli Menagharishvili -- many of you know him. I have delegated to him to create a system which would be just so that not a single gram of medicine or food be lost and that it reaches refugees in the form in which it is sent from the United States, France, Iran, Israel, Germany, and other countries. There will be a little help in the immediate future. Many organizations are being established abroad whose aim is to save Georgia and her democracy. You know that the former secretaries of state, Shultz and Baker, have set up such an organization which includes quite influential people. Former President Carter expressed the wish to become an honorary chairman of the organization. A movement is starting in the Federal Republic of Germany and so on. But I think that by the time they do their job, we shall have returned to Abkhazia. There is one threat... [pauses] Maybe as a nickname, we shall call the Citizens' Union the organization for returning to Abkhazia. This threat, as they say, has been inborn with our people and it is still there -- the split. There is no time for anybody's ambitions. Let nobody seek and attempt drumming up popularity at the expense of the people who are living in hardship, let nobody attempt it. I think that all of you who are present must agree with me that there are two ways. I told you about one way. There is another way. It is not accidental that I started to talk about creating an army, a real army, an army which will not desert positions without an order from the commander in chief. If necessary, it will die, but will never retreat. Unless there is such an army, the other way, the way of a military solution is very difficult. We can talk endlessly that there is only a military solution, but we will achieve nothing without a real force, unless there is a real army which has been trained morally, psychologically, and militarily. Such an army is being created. Work to achieve this is under way. A little time is necessary. However, I want you to know that this is still on the agenda. People who are calling on the Georgians to arm themselves and go today are wrong because it is not so easy. All this is in the center of our attention and we are working to achieve this. I think that in 10 or 15 days you will learn about some of the measures which will lead us to the creation of an army that will fight until the last drop of blood and achieve its task. [applause]] A few more words now. I welcome...[pauses] I wanted Batoni Lorik Marshania [ethnic Abkhazian who was in the pro-Georgian Abkhazian government] to be with us today but he is away on a special assignment. I am very glad that his daughter, Kalbatoni [honorific title] Ada, delivered a speech. She did it in a very good, clever, and resolute manner. You know that her father and herself had to share the same fortune with each of you, and with us. It is good that there are Abkhazians among us. There are many Abkhazians in Moscow, Kiev, Sochi, and other towns with whom I am maintaining ties and I will never break these ties. I believe that the Abkhazians who have the right position are our brothers, they are and will remain our flesh and blood. We will live together. This is a law. I do not have in mind here one or two people or the group which has led us to this disaster. I have said it before and, on behalf of our union, I will state again at this meeting that the democratic state of Georgia binds itself to guarantee not only the preservation, but also the development of the national identity of the Abkhazians and Ossetians. This may be in the form of autonomy or another form of statehood. We will together arrive at a decision which will be acceptable for the Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians, and other peoples. We give them a full guarantee of human rights protection and full equality in our free, independent, and democratic Georgia. Everybody should know and understand this. We, the Georgians, are a hot-tempered people, but we are also a generous people. We will return to Abkhazia, however, we will return not for new bloodshed or vengeance, but to restore the justice of history, so that Georgians live together with Abkhazians and other peoples on that land and so that our children and grandchildren build a better and more beautiful Abkhazia within Georgia. And this is how I would like to finish. It is possible that, -- one group has told me this recently, so it is not my own idea -- it is possible that a political process will not bring us the necessary result. The creation of an army may be delayed, which may result in other negative aspects. Your apartments and homes in Abkhazia are being misappropriated. I would not rule out that the whole of Georgia will rise. I want this to be broadcast by television and to reach the UN and all other organizations. The whole of Georgia will rise. I will lead it. It would be hundreds of thousands, millions of people. They may be unarmed. We will start from the Inguri River -- there will be hundreds of thousands, millions -- and we will reach the Psou River. Even if we are unarmed. This would be an unprecedented march, such as the world has never heard of. It would be a demonstration of the Georgians' will. The whole world will learn who and what the Georgians are. Half of us could perish. That is possible. But nothing is more supreme and sacred for us, including the Union of Georgian Citizens, than Georgia's unity, integrity, and happy future. This is how I would like to finish my speech.
