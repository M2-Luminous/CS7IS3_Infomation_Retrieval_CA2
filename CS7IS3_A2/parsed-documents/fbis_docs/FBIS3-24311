God Grant It a Good Crop!"] [Text] Spring has always been a time of hopes and expectations for the tillers of the land. Now that the shelves of delicatessen stores are becoming more desolate and the consumer basket of foodstuffs for the majority of common citizens is becoming scantier with every passing day, an increasing number not only of villagers but of city folks, too, turn their mind's eye to the future harvest. Will we succeed in making it a full-fledged one, in the environment of the most severe economic crisis and an acute shortage of many material and technical resources? How will the villagers be able to counteract a shortage of motor fuel and lubricants, fertilizer, pesticides, and finally, the deficit of monetary funds, apart from pure enthusiasm and the perennial patience of the peasants? After all, the well-being of each family, of each of us, depends on this to a significant, if not decisive, degree. This is why the editorial office resolved to approach, so to say, the main agrarian of our state--Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of Ukraine Yu.M. Karasyk--with a request to discuss the specifics of the forthcoming field work and the way in which problems associated with them are being solved. [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych, at the beginning of March in years past, newspapers were usually replete with reports about kolkhozes and sovkhozes completing repairs of machinery, about machinery already being at the ready at leading farms, and so on. This year, the weather has made its contribution to the heap of economic problems in which the rural areas are drowning. In a day or two, it will be time to talk about going out to the fields. However, this is perhaps not the main peculiarity, is it? [Karasyk] Why in a day or two? In the south, spring field work is already getting under way at full tilt. Soil is being prepared in the fields for spring crops, and moisture is being sealed in Crimea, Kherson Oblast, Odessa Oblast, and in some locations in Transcarpathia. Neither we nor the meteorologists could have predicted this abrupt warming up--in Crimea and the Kherson area, the temperature already reaches 17-18 degrees during the day. Meanwhile, the reserves of moisture in the soil are catastrophically small because of a winter without snow; in the south, they do not exceed 60 percent of the optimal norm. It has come to signs of dust storms already being noted at some localities in the region--the wind picks up and blows away the topsoil, the most fertile layer. Under the circumstances, it is very important to retain, as much as possible, at least the paltry resources of moisture that are still found in the soil. To this end, it is necessary to reduce the length of conducting field work to the bare limit and emphasize mainly its quality. Here is one of the peculiarities of this spring for you, and unfortunately, not the most important one. [Simakovich] Does the main peculiarity concern perhaps the lamentable condition of winter crops? [Karasyk] Absolutely correct. The severe freezing temperatures of November literally came down on the soil unprotected by snow and did irreparable damage to areas planted in winter crops. It is particularly regrettable that the southern regions, the main suppliers of winter wheat grain, have suffered the worst. In Crimea, about 90 percent of the area planted in winter crops will have to be replanted, and in the Kherson area--up to 70 percent. The state of affairs is not much better in Zaporozhye and Nikolayev Oblasts. By all signs, replanting will come to no less than 30 percent in Ukraine as a whole. This is not all yet. In the fall, the farmers did not manage to turn over 4 million hectares of the fallow land because of a shortage of fuel and the early onset of freezing temperatures. Judge for yourself what volume of work must now be performed in the spring, and that within the shortest period of time possible. [Simakovich] How will the farms cope with the enormous amount of work, and in the environment of an acute energy crisis, the now chronic shortage of mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and so on? [Karasyk] Well, everything does not look as dramatic as you imagine. The point is that all measures are now being taken with a view to urgently transporting the necessary quantities of gasoline, diesel fuel, oil, mineral fertilizer, and spare parts to the southern zone. [Simakovich] However, I hope that this is not being done at the expense of other oblasts. [Karasyk] Of course not. I do not want to be overly optimistic, but I do count on reserves of motor fuel and lubricants for the successful conduct of the full volume of spring field work being found in Ukraine. [Simakovich] Yuriy Mykhaylovych! Increasingly loud voices are now referring to the insolvency of an overwhelming majority of farms, to kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers, too, just having no funds to settle for motor fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery. Where is a way out of what would appear to be a hopeless situation? [Karasyk] This is how the issue was raised: How to conduct spring field work without additional credit? In Ukraine as a whole, 30 trillion karbovantsy are needed to this end. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes simply do not have that kind of money. Under the circumstances, the government resolved to allocate a budgetary loan of sorts to the rural areas. In general outline, this is how it will look. The state undertakes to supply the farms with fuel, mineral fertilizer, pesticides, and spare parts. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes settle for this later with the output produced, that is to say, they receive all resources against a pledge of products. Calculations indicate that only 25 percent of the output produced on the farms will be required to pay back this loan, and the farms will dispose of the remainder on their own. This is the only acceptable scenario under the conditions of a payment crisis. [Simakovich] What if yet another round of increases in the price of refinery products occurs? [Karasyk] The course has been set for strictly fixed prices for motor fuels so that this will not happen, and so that prices for agricultural products will cover outlays on fuel. Thus, one liter of gasoline should cost no more than 4,150 karbovantsy, and diesel fuel--no more than 3,900 karbovantsy. [Simakovich] However, the fate of the harvest hinges not only on the availability or absence of motor fuel, but also on a multitude of other components. [Karasyk] Correct. However, first of all I would like to inform the readers that refinery products are already reaching rural areas. I think that the fertilizer situation will change substantially, too. Last year, one-half of the usual amount of mineral fertilizer was given to the land. This will not recur now. The government has proceeded to sharply reduce rates for gas and electricity for enterprises manufacturing mineral fertilizer. Therefore, it will now be profitable for the chemical industry to manufacture it, and for the peasants to buy it. I will add that Russian rubles have also been allocated to purchase phosphoric fertilizer and spare parts for agricultural machinery in Russia, and potassium fertilizer in Belarus. Finally, within days, the United States will be opening for us a credit line for the acquisition of pesticides. [Simakovich] So, does it turn out that rural areas will not be left one-on-one with their problems? [Karasyk] Of course they will not. Nonetheless, the picture does not look as rosy as we would like it to. Last year, nature was a great help to us. However, only selfless, high-quality work, excellent seeds, and the timely performance of all technological operations of the spring complex may save the crop this year. Previously, we did not have the experience of operation in the extreme conditions of a payment crisis. We are now acquiring this experience. In this instance, it is very important for the state to keep its word and not dash the hopes and expectations of the peasants.
