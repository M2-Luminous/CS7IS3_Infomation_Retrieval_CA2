The powers of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the 12th term are coming to an end early. Its deputies were elected in the spring elections of 1990. These elections were a powerful impulse which awoke the disappointed and indifferent people and evoked their natural inclination for freedom, democracy, and justice. Everyone wanted changes in society because they understood well that they could go on living lies and deceit no longer. People went to polling stations with these thoughts. There were a few names on the ballots, and for the first time in the 70 years of Soviet power the voters got an opportunity to choose and thus influence the development of their country. The voters attached hopes for changes in society and for a better future for Ukraine primarily on the Supreme Council. Unfortunately, under the conditions of Communist Party diktat and the muffling of even the smallest manifestations of democracy, it was extremely difficult for the patriots of Ukraine-democrats to become deputies. For this reason, representatives of the Communist Party nomenklatura--secretaries of oblast, city, and rayon committees, executive functionaries of state organs, military commanders, kolkhoz chairmen, and "Red directors"--gained a majority in the Supreme Council. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, they got together in the notorious "Group of 239" and dictated their will to the Supreme Council and all of Ukraine. In turn, on 6 June 1990 the democratic minority formed an official opposition in the parliament of Ukraine--the People's Council. It consisted of fewer than one-third of the total number of deputies; however, it was precisely due to its vigorous activities that we succeeded in ensuring live radio broadcasts and TV coverage of all meetings of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, which for the first time gave people of Ukraine an opportunity to see and hear the free, truthful word and alternative political views. It was precisely due to this information that the people of the entire Ukraine were awakened. What quite recently had appeared to many to be the unshaken and mighty Communist Party machinery in the center and localities began to yield one position after another. From the first days of its activities, the People's Council has stated unequivocally that it would fight for the acquisition of complete political and economic independence for Ukraine. The Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, the Law on the Economic Independence of Ukraine, the Decree on Military Service by Citizens of Ukraine in the Territory of the Republic, the Decree on the Introduction of Ukrainian Time in the Territory of Ukraine, and the Supreme Council's confirmation of historical national sacred notions of Ukraine--the blue-and-yellow flag, the trident coat of arms, and the anthem "Ukraine Has Not Perished Yet"--as state symbols became the greatest achievements of the People's Council. Of course, the Act of Proclamation of the Independence of Ukraine, dated 24 August 1991, which was ratified by the people at a referendum on 1 December 1991, was the foremost accomplishment of the People's Council. This was a truly triumphant victory. There has been no case in history in any country in which the opposition, in the minority, won a victory in the parliament. We won it in a peaceful manner because we drew on support from the entire nation. However, this victory did not come out of nowhere--it was based on the great self-sacrificing labor and self-denying struggle of past generations for the freedom of Ukraine. We are proud of being directly involved in this sharp historical turn in the fate of our people. Despite considerable obstacles, we have taken resolute steps along the path toward freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, we do not have justice yet because we have not had the opportunity to qualitatively change the authorities in Ukraine, beginning with the Supreme Council and down to the rural councils. Economic reforms cannot be implemented by the forces of the old apparatchiks. These reforms should be preceded by radical political changes, primarily in all branches of state power. Their implementation may only be ensured by the people in new elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the local organs of state government and self-government. The People's Council sets for itself three main tasks: FIRST. Acquisition of state independence by Ukraine. SECOND. Removal of the Communist Party from power and the creation of a democratic society. THIRD. Creation of an efficient market economy. The first two tasks have been accomplished in the main. The third task is much harder to accomplish. It is precisely a market economy that should ensure an increase in production and welfare worthy of the people. Unfortunately, the life of the people has become harder. The reasons for this are many. First, the party-nomenklatura majority in the Supreme Council of Ukraine has continuously blocked the adoption of economic laws which would reform the socialist economy, make it multisectoral, and introduce the free development and greater pace of production in urban and rural areas on the principle of equal rights for various forms of ownership. Second, it so happens that the old nomenklatura, retaining command posts in the economy, has disposed of state property as if it were theirs, has plundered Ukraine, and has profiteered from the wretched condition of the people. Third, a situation has developed in which the monopoly of state property prevails in Ukraine while a strong executive authority is absent. This has brought about an unprecedented rampage of organized crime and corruption, which has primarily affected the power structure. Corruption and organized crime, which have brought about the plundering of the national wealth, pose the main threat to Ukraine and its independence. The democrats are not to blame for the massive rampage of the mafia, the decline in the standard of living of the bulk of the population, the slump in production, and other adversity. After all, the democrats are not the ones to control the economy and make the policy of the state because there are very few of them in the Supreme Council; there are almost none in the Cabinet of Ministers, and they have not been heard from in a majority of oblasts, rayons, and cities. From the Supreme Council, the administration of the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers to the rural councils--everywhere, with minor exceptions, the same people who governed 10 or 20 years ago are still governing. Thus, the assertion that power in Ukraine is in the hands of the democrats is not true. It is exactly the other way around. The widespread myth that the democrats are to blame for everything has been created by that same party nomenklatura which remains in power, takes advantage of power for personal enrichment, and behaves in keeping with the logic of a robber who has himself stolen but is the first one to yell "Stop, thief!" at the marketplace. Therefore, the removal of yesterday's people from power is the main task in Ukraine. We should begin with the Supreme Council, the new composition of which is to be elected soon. People should be elected as deputies on account of their political positions, activities in building the state, dedication to the principles and ideals of an independent Ukraine--individuals who were together with the people in this struggle, those who advocated and still advocate free, democratic development, welfare, and an affluent life for the people. What the Supreme Council will be tomorrow depends on who the people elect now--such will be the laws the Supreme Council will adopt and the government that will lead Ukraine. Therefore, look carefully at who and which forces support a candidate and what political platform he subscribes to. Do not make the wrong choice, because a mistake will cost both you and Ukraine dearly. Think well and remember the wise expression: "Each nation has the rulers it deserves." So, do everything to ensure that the deputies elected by you will care first of all for the people and for Ukraine. Remember that in the preelection struggle two main forces will clash first of all: those that are in favor of Ukrainian statehood, those that rely on the will and strength of their own people and want to live as masters of their native land and transform Ukraine into a strong and rich country, and those who are against Ukrainian statehood, for whom the people of Ukraine are merely a source for their personal enrichment. Being a member of the Ukrainian parliament is a lofty and honorable position. However, it is necessary to view it is a means to serve the Motherland, which provides an opportunity to be of greater use and do more good for your people, rather than as an end in and of itself. People should not come to power who are burdened by the sins of the past or the thirst for profits, but rather highly educated people with great integrity, wise and patriotically minded politicians for whom concern for the Motherland and the people constitutes the main goal. The people are the only source of power. Your fate and the future of Ukraine are in your hands, citizens!
