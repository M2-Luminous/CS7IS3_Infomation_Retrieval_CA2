FR941212-0-00055 FR941212-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 RIN 2125&hyph;AD39 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; Technical Amendments AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments. SUMMARY: This document amends the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) to provide nomenclature changes that will revise and update certain regulatory references and terms. Additionally, amendments are being made to revise existing hazardous materials classifications and descriptions to conform with the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods. Finally, a Schedule of Limits chart pertaining to motor carriers' financial responsibility has been removed because the information it contained was duplicative of that in another chart elsewhere in the regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective January 11, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Brad A. Trullinger, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;5764, or Mr. Raymond Cuprill, Office of the Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;0834, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), is the agency within the DOT that has been delegated with the responsibility of developing and promulgating regulatory requirements for the transportation of hazardous materials. The RSPA has issued regulations which identify, define, describe and classify hazardous materials. These requirements are codified, generally, in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) at 49 CFR Parts 171 through 180. The responsibility for enforcement of certain aspects of the HMR is delegated to the appropriate modal Administration, and for highways, this responsibility rests with the FHWA. The FHWA consistently incorporates hazardous materials terminology, descriptions, and classifications that are promulgated by the RSPA into the FMCSR, as appropriate, in order to maintain uniformity between the requirements of the HMR and the requirements of the FMCSR. The RSPA published a final rule on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52402), entitled Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards; Changes to Classification, Hazard Communication, Packaging and Handling Requirements, Based on United Nations' Standards and Agency Initiative. This rule comprehensively amended the hazardous materials communication requirements in the HMR, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, which are codified at 49 CFR Part 107 through 180. Descriptions of certain hazardous materials currently found in Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 are incompatible with the RSPA's final rule which incorporated certain aspects of the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, into the HMR, now codified at 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180. Hazardous materials such as explosives, poison gases, and radioactive materials heretofore have been classified in the FMCSR using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of Parts 171 through 177 of the HMR, that were in effect prior to the implementation of the United Nations' Recommendations. Therefore, in order to effectively carry out its responsibility for enforcement of certain parts of the HMR, the FHWA has initiated these technical amendments to the FMCSR to provide for regulatory consistency and uniformity. Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers, 49 CFR Part 387, was published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1981 (46 FR 30974&hyph;30987). This part set forth requirements for motor carriers transporting non-hazardous property, and/or hazardous materials or substances, to maintain minimum levels of financial responsibility. The levels of financial responsibility vary, depending upon whether the cargo being transported is a non-hazardous material, or a hazardous material. Qualifications of drivers, 49 CFR Part 391, was published in the Federal Register on April 22, 1970 (35 FR 6460). The requirements in this part establish minimum qualification standards for drivers who drive motor vehicles as, or for a motor carrier engaged in interstate commerce. This part includes limited exceptions for drivers who are otherwise qualified and regularly employed, and were hired before July 1, 1975. A driver is not subject to the requirements of this part if the driver continues regular employment, is transporting certain material considered to be hazardous, and transports that hazardous material in Intra- state commerce. Driving of Motor Vehicles, 49 CFR Part 392, was published in the Federal Register on December 25, 1968 (33 FR 19732). Among other things, this part requires drivers who drive a motor vehicle to stop at all railroad grade crossings, and to utilize, in lieu of flame producing devices, emergency reflective triangles or other such devices, when transporting certain types of hazardous materials. Transportation of Hazardous Materials; Driving and Parking Rules, 49 CFR Part 397, was published in the Federal Register on March 13, 1971 (36 FR 4876). This part requires motor carriers to have in place various procedures, policies, and documents during the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicle. Part 397 classified hazardous materials using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of the HMR. These classifications, in place since 1971, included explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, and gases. The FHWA is making appropriate conforming changes to 49 CFR Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 of the FMCSR, that reference any hazardous material classification or description, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations, the RSPA's adoption of changes to the HMR reflective of these recommendations, and the need for international uniformity of these regulations. In addition, the FHWA is appropriately making nomenclature changes in 49 CFR Part 387 of the FMCSR, to indicate that all references made to the ``Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety'', will now read, the ``Federal Highway Administration.'' All text references in Part 387 referencing the ``Bureau'' will read the ``FHWA.''
