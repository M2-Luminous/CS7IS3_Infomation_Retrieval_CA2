The speedy membership of NATO by Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others could, in the opinion of Western politicians, have signified an intensification of extreme nationalist ("pro-empire") sentiments in Moscow. In addition, pragmatists in the Pentagon fairly assumed that NATO's accelerated expansion eastward would rapidly have reduced to nothing the military value of the alliance, having converted it (considering the principle of unanimity in all decisionmaking) into a second CSCE. The quite indefinite and nonbinding conditions of participation in the Partnership program had to satisfy all. It was not even considered necessary to consult the former members of the Warsaw Pact, including Russia, in advance, about a framework document being offered for signature immediately. As a result, all NATO's future "partners" were unhappy to this extent or the other. But, whereas the other East European countries subscribed to the program, nonetheless, Russia, unexpectedly for the West, refrained. The Russian military, as perfectly pragmatic people, saw no specific advantages for the army in the signing of the framework document. But, it is not the military that determines foreign policy in Moscow. When, in March, the decision to subscribe was adopted, the Ministry of Defense officially supported it. But, in April, Kozyrev's promised visit to Brussels for the signing was postponed indefinitely. Formally, in connection with the American aircraft's attack on Serb positions near Goradze without prior consultation with Moscow. But the main thing, obviously, was to obtain support in the "opposition" ranks for the Social Accord Treaty. Western politicians found themselves in an absurd position: Without Moscow's participation, the none too intelligible program finally became totally meaningless. In the course of the session in Brussels during 24-25 May, the NATO defense ministers did everything possible to keep the Partnership afloat, and the Russian defense minister helped them as best he could. General Grachev announced that "Russia will subscribe to the program without any prior conditions," and Western politicians publicly welcomed this. True, at the same time Pavel Grachev once again confirmed that Russia would like to "unconditionally" sign the framework document only simultaneously with a supplementary protocol or agreement that sets forth in detail the mutual obligations of NATO in respect to Russia and of Russia in respect to NATO in the political and military spheres. He also proposed a system of permanent consultations. "Now NATO must decide whether it accepts our partnership or not" (Pavel Grachev in Brussels, reverse translation from the English). In any event, Russia's formal affiliation to the program has, evidently, been postponed until NATO understands what kind of protocol, in fact, Russia needs. Meanwhile, nothing is preventing preservation of the pro-government majority composed of the former "opposition" that took shape in the course of the first Duma vote on the budget. The Partnership can wait. Especially since the framework agreement is open for signing at any time.
