Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that before the evacuation started, the Army declared the area a closed military zone. Our correspondent and four other representatives of the media were among the first to be arrested. The Qiryat Arba' settlers showed passive opposition to the evacuation. Some 20 of them were arrested, and the rest fled to the surrounding hills.
