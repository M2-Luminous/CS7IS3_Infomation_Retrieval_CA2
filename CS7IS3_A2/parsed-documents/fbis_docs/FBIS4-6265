We feel it an utmost honor and joy to be in the presence of high-level delegations and goodwill missions of various countries, and delegations of overseas compatriots with the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song in attendance. Authorized by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, and on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and the government of the republic, I warmly welcome and extend my deep thanks to the foreign party delegations, foreign goodwill missions, and friends who are here in our country to join in the joy of our people on the occasion of our nation's auspicious April holiday. In addition, I warmly welcome and give fervent fraternal greetings to the congratulatory delegations and figures of overseas compatriots from different regions and organizations who came here to deliver unanimous greetings from overseas compatriots to the great leader. Since he embarked on the road of revoluion, the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song has victoriously led the Korean revolution with his outstanding and tested leadership and tireless efforts of devotion for a long time. In doing so, he performed immortal exploits for the country, the revolution, the times, and history. Even today, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song -- with extraordinary wisdom, excelled leadership, and lofty popular traits -- is vigorously leading our people's struggle for socialist construction and the national reunification on a correct road of victory, and is directing big efforts for the country's ever-lasting prosperity. Thanks to the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song's outstanding and tested leadership, our people are powerfully demonstrating the superiority of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style; are effecting a constant upswing in socialist construction; and are valiantly advancing toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country without the slightest vacillation under the complex and difficult conditions created by the continued challenges and obstructions by the imperialists and reactionaries. Independence, peace, and friendship are basic doctrines in the foreign policy our party and republic's government have consistently carried through. Our party and republic's government, as in the past, will invariably and consistently implement the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship, and thus actively contribute to the peace and progress of mankind and the world's cause of independence. At this meaningful place filled with a sense of boundless admiration and warm friendship for the great leader, I propose a toast to our fatherland's everlasting prosperity, to our nation's eternal happiness, to national reunification, and to the completion of the chuche revolutionary cause. I also propose a toast to the long life and good health of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people, who is observing the 82d anniversary of his birth; to the health of delegations of foreign parties of various countries; and to the health of foreign comrades and friends who came to congratulate the auspicious holiday of the nation.
