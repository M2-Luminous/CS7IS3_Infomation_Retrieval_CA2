The spirit of a so-called Baltic-Black Sea alliance hovered in the lobbies of the Seimas where the meetings took place. The first step has been taken. The curtain was raised a fraction on the eve of Leonid Kravchuk's visit by Rostislav Bilodid, Ukrainian ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania. He said: "I am a supporter of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance, but would not like to narrow this to just a political concept. I interpret it more widely. After all, there is so much in common in the characters of our people. In short, we should be closer to one another. Ukraine is committed to cooperation with Lithuania." In the ambassador's opinion, both countries jave a lot of work to do in the economic sphere. Today Lithuania's share of exports to Ukraine stands at 8-10 percent. This is too small, R. Bilodid noted. Ukraine, in his opinion, should become a profitable export market for Lithuania. In his view, this republic has hitherto focused too little attention on the region to its south. Specific steps have already been taken. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys and Rostislav Bilodid have initialed a treaty between the two countries' governments on encouraging investments and providing bilateral export guarantees. Leonid Kravchuk also assigned a special role to economic relations in his speech to the Lithuanian Seimas. In his opinion, economic and trade links have not attained the necessary level. Both countries could cooperate with mutual profit in any sphere. The Ukrainian president offered to export to Lithuania ores, coal, coke, rolled iron, metal goods, electrotechnical instruments, and cars. In its turn Ukraine would like to receive from Lithuania consumer goods, footwear, clothing, and chemical and electronics industry products. There are big opportunities for cooperation in the field of transport. Ukraine would like to have access to the Baltic Sea and to other North European countries via the port of Klaipeda. Lithuania, Leonid Kravchuk proposed, could also take advantage of the potential of Ukraine's Black Sea ports. It is clearly not easy to implement such an extensive cooperation program in the context of "conventional" agreements. Hence politicians in both countries have seized on the idea of creating an alliance. At any rate, neither Leonid Kravchuk nor Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas denied this idea at the press conference held after the signing of the friendship and cooperation treaty. True, Leonid Kravchuk did stress that the talk of an alliance meant not military blocs of any kind but only cooperation in the sphere of economics and culture. And Algirdas Brazauskaks added that such initiatives in no way denoted the formation of military blocs; on the contrary, they were a step toward pan-European cooperation on security matters. Both presidents give a high assessment to the "Partnership for Peace" program recently signed by Lithuania. Here the idea of an alliance between Baltic and Black Sea countries takes on a whole new aspect. Leonid Kravchuk recalled Ukraine's initiative on the creation of stability zones in regions of Central and East Europe. He expects it to cover all countries in the Baltic and Black Sea regions. This initiative, the Ukrainian president said, coincides with other security system projects. It was noted at the press conference that the initiative for forming a Baltic-Black Sea alliance is supported by Poland, France, and other countries. Thus it would appear that the idea of an alliance has more than just an economic content. For example, Leonid Kravchuk noted that Ukraine is connected with the Lithuanian people historically; the roots of this friendship go back into the distant past. Cooperation began as far back as the days of Kievan Rus, which played a large part in Lithuania's formation. "In its turn the Great Lithuanian Principality of the 14th century helped Ukrainians to preserve their traditions, language, and religion and did not allow that unique culture to die," Leonid Kravchuk said. "At that time our countries were part of a single state, and deep ties were formed between our peoples which today are taking on a new significance." Such good relations with Lithuania could not help provoking questions about relations between Ukraine and Russia. Leonid Kravchuk expressed the conviction that, if his country adheres to the trilateral agreement on nuclear weapons signed in Moscow, friendly relations will not change. At the same time he singled out the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which in his opinion has to be resolved before there can be any question of discussing a solution to other problems. Relations with Russia, he said, have a special significance in our foreign policy, and they will have a real content if good will is shown on both the Ukrainian and Russian sides. The idea of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance probably suits the hearts and minds of the Lithuanian opposition, which fervently opposes any alliances with Russia. Thus Vytautas Landsbergis described Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Lithuania as "the summit of today's actualities." "We have long understood that Ukraine's fate is also vitally important to Lithuania's independence," the Lithuanian opposition leader stressed. "Today Ukraine is seeking support, and it is important for us to support that aspiration."
