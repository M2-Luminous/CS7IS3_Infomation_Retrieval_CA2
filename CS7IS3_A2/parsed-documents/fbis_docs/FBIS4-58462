I think, [applause] Your Excellency, that your foreign minister did not give you a present. But I believe that your being here amid this audience and this process to sign the agreement illustrates the prominent and leading role in the peace process played by your country under your leadership. I believe that the signing of the agreement in Egypt is very significant, because Egypt paved the way for reconciliation in the region. I hope that on your next birthday we will meet in the same hall with the same gathering to witness the signing of not only the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, but an agreement involving all the territory [applause]. By then we will have laid the foundations for three new pyramids: First, agreement on self-rule for the Palestinians; second, agreement for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, and I hope the Palestinians and Israel will cooperate; and third, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We all believe that we can achieve a comprehensive peace soon by making progress in the coming dialogue and negotiations. I believe that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin know how much Russia wants peace in the region. This region is near to Russia. The trip from Moscow to this region is a four-hour flight, while the journey from Moscow to Vladivostok takes eight hours. We are eager to achieve peace and stability in the region. Russia would like to be a sponsor of this process along with the United States. I hope that this day will mark the start of the implementation of this agreement. There will be difficulties on the way but they must be overcome with good faith and resolve. I congratulate you on this great effort today and I reassure you that Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European Community, and the whole world will be on the side of Israel, the Palestinians, and Arabs in the peace efforts. Thank you. [applause]
