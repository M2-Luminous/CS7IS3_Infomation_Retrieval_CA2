This center, he said, should be supported by the rest of the Arab states in order to influence the position of the United States, which sees itself as a peace partner. Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B yesterday before his departure from Amman to Tunis, Abu-Sharif said the Security Council resolution that condemned the Hebron massacre was general. However, he said, employing it appropriately according to a detailed plan may create more pressure for the evacuation of settlers from the occupied territories. He stressed that in the aftermath of the mosque massacre, the Oslo and Cairo agreements should be reconsidered and some points on the transitional and final stages should be discussed. He admitted that the Palestinian and Arab campaign of protest against the massacre did not rise to the level of the event, adding that despite its tragic nature, this massacre was a chance for the Palestinians and Arabs to intensively pressure the United States into forcing Israel to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy.
