German Constitutional Protection Office Investigates Russian Soldiers"] [Text] The Saxony Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution [LfV] is investigating whether members of the Russian troops stationed in Germany or their relatives have any contacts with the party of Russian right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The reason for the investigations: Saxony's government wants to prevent Russian followers of Zhirinovskiy from getting together with German neo-Nazis. LfV President Mathilde Koller told BILD AM SONNTAG: "We are investigating whether CIS soldiers stationed in Germany have any contacts with Saxon neo-Nazis or whether they are producing propaganda among German right-wing extremists for Zhirinovskiy's ideas." According to official information, 24 percent of the members of the Western Group of the former Red Army in Germany voted for Zhirinovskiy at the parliamentary elections. At the moment, there are still 31,440 soldiers and 37,730 civilians in eastern Germany.
