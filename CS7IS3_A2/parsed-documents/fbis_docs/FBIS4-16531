This was disclosed by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk at a news-conference in Kiev last night upon his arrival from Moscow. As he revealed, at a meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Friday agreement was reached to set up a Russian naval base in Ukraine. However, as Kravchuk emphasized, it will be "a base, rather than bases," and its site, in his words, will be chosen at state level bilateral talks. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, who attended the negotiations on the navy division, told newsmen that, in his opinion, such a base could be leased to Russia for up to five years. Kravchuk stressed that before the lease treaty takes effect it must be ratified by Ukraine's parliament. He argued that Ukraine claims 15-20 percent of the Black Sea Fleet's ships and recalled with reference to the Yalta accords that Ukraine would be entitled to one half of the fleet, if it were divided. However, as he remarked, Ukraine is ready to sell Russia its portion of the fleet, which, as he explained, Ukraine does not need to guarantee its defence potential. He voiced displeasure with the Black Sea Navy Commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin. He said he would be prepared to revoke his approval of Baltin's appointment to the post of commander and would do so if "the process of negotiations drags on." "If not, I will have nothing to do with the Russian Black Sea Fleet Commander," he said. As he explained, on Friday the defence ministers of Ukraine and Russia were told to instruct the subordinate units to resolve all conflicts and abide by the achieved accords in their future actions. All conflicts similar to those in Odessa have been settled for good. This view is shared by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia alike, he declared. He reaffirmed an invitation to Yeltsin to pay an official visit to Ukraine after the preparation of a comprehensive friendship and cooperation treaty. He voiced hope that such an accord would be ready in the first half of 1994. Another round of talks on the Black Sea Navy division was scheduled for 22 April in Moscow.
