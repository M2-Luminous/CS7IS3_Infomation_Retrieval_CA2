FR941011-2-00142 FR941011-2-00091 4. Simultaneously with the deposit of Securities in a Trust Series, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor registered certificates for units (the ``Units'') that will represent the entire ownership of the Trust Series (owners of such Units are hereinafter referred to as ``Unitholders''). The Units in turn will be offered for sale to the public following the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the Trust Series and clearance by the securities authorities of the various states. Applicants intend to offer each Trust Series to the public initially at prices based on the closing sale prices of listed equity securities and the asking prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities selected for deposit in the Trust Series, plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained therein, if any, plus a sales charge. 5. With the deposit of the Securities in the Trust Series containing zero coupon obligations on the initial date of deposit, the Sponsor will have established a proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obligations and equity securities in the Trust Series. The Sponsor will be permitted under the Trust Agreement to deposit additional Securities, which may result in a potential corresponding increase in the number of Units outstanding. The Sponsor anticipates that any addition Securities deposited in the Trust Series after the initial date of deposit will maintain the proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obligations and equity securities in the Trust Series. The original percentage relationships between zero coupon obligations and equity securities will be set forth in the prospectus and in each Trust Agreement. 6. Each Trust Series that contains zero coupon obligations will be structured to ensure that, at the specified maturity date for that Trust Series, the initial investors in such Trust Series will receive back at least the total amount of their original investment in the Trust Series, including the sales charge. Thus, the principal value of the maturing zero coupon obligations in each Trust Series will at least equal the original purchase price of the Units of such Trust Series. Zero coupon obligations deposited in the Trust Series will be non-callable or callable at par. 7. The Trust Series will redeem Units at prices based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations, if any, and the closing sale prices of listed equity securities and the bid prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities. 8. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for the Units. The existence of such a secondary market will reduce the number of Units tendered to the Trustee for redemption and thus alleviate the necessity of selling portfolio securities to raise the cash necessary to meet such redemptions. In the event that the Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market, the Trust Agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct the Trustee to sell zero coupon obligations from any Trust Series that contains zero coupon obligations until equity securities have been liquidated in order not to impair the protection provided by the zero coupon obligations, unless the Trustee is able to sell such zero coupon obligations and still maintain at least the original proportional relationship to Unit value. The Trust Agreement also will provide that zero coupon obligations may not be sold to meet Trust expenses.
