An address on the current international situation in the light of the Geneva negotiations was delivered by Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic. Here is a report by [name indistinct]: [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] On the ground the situation is characterized by Muslim attacks on our positions and the stage-managing of bloody incidents in Sarajevo, the most tragic of which took place in Markale, and which has already been proven to have been perpetrated by the Muslim side. However, this incident was one of the heaviest blows on us by the international community because the blame was put on us as usual, Karadzic said, adding: [Karadzic] "On 6 February this year [passage indistinct]. Both sides were to hand in their heavy weapons -- Sarajevo was thus to be taken off from the world headlines, as the Muslim side in Sarajevo heavily used it for its propaganda against us. "As you know, on 9 February the ultimatum was issued, which more or less contained what we had agreed with Mr. Akashi, and so we adjusted our actions to be exclusively in accordance with the agreement with Mr. Akashi. However, there was no firm will to withdraw the weapons or partly to place them under control, because our agreement with Akashi did not set that out. However, the international community assessed -- maybe Russia did it on its own or in cooperation with others -- that a dangerous moment came as the Serbs had not withdrawn their weapons seven days prior to the expiration of the ultimatum, and that NATO would inevitably strike [passage indistinct] and that it would be good to make a compromise with the Serbs. A compromise was made when Churkin arrived bringing a message from President Yeltsin to President Milosevic and to us here saying that the Russians were guaranteeing the cease-fire, and we then reached a situation whereby we could accept that proposal. Thus, in addition to the United States, we ushered Russia and Russian diplomacy through a wide-open door to the resolution of that problem. You know what happened afterwards. "After the ultimatum -- which is the ultimate form of pressure, the worst pressure, the hardest threat -- U.S. diplomats came to us. The ultimatum may have been in the service of opening a door [word indistinct] success for the U.S. diplomacy. And the U.S. diplomacy, as the United States is biased first to the benefit of the Muslims and then of the Croats, started working with the Muslims and the Croats. Back on 9 and 10 February we were informed in Geneva by Mr. Redman, the U.S. envoy [passage indistinct] because of our entire history in 20th century and then we thought that this was a solution. "The difficulties that arose in connection with a European Union proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three parts started being overcome as a possibility to divide Bosnia into two parts emerged. We had earlier heard some presumptions in the European circles about Bosnia-Herzegovina being divided into two parts in several options: one option was this -- that the Croats and Muslims should unite into one state with the Serbs remaining in another one. The second option was that the Muslims should go with the Serbs and set up a Serb-Muslim state, i.e., some kind of a state, or to join Yugoslavia, and the third option was that Bosnia should be divided between the Serbs and the Croats, because of some tendencies in the Tuzla basin to join Yugoslavia, while in Zenica (?and Cazin) there were tendencies to join Croatia. That option would not have been favorable for the Muslims, neither were we crazy about this option, as we deem that the antagonizing of our ethnic communities would have continued. There were some other options of division into two states. "Considering the new campaign and partial military successes by the Muslim side, there was the danger that Croats might lose all their territory, which was not in our interest, despite the fact that we have been enemies almost throughout the 20th century. We believe that we should reach a solution satisfactory for all three nations, and only such a solution can be lasting and stable. A solution which would possibly harm Serbs or Croats would be particularly unfavorable, because the basis of the stability in the Balkans is in the relations between Serbs and Croats. "Realistically, and from a political point of view, that is a signature of two sovereign nations and their legitimate representatives which regulates the life of those national communities in their territories. Therefore, that signature has suspended any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- a unitary one, a union or any kind of [word indistinct]. Simply, from the legal and political point of view, since the signing, Bosnia-Herzegovina has been in the status [word indistinct]; Bosnia-Herzegovina is now material from which everyone makes what they believe they should and can make." [Correspondent] Meanwhile, we have strengthened our relations with Russian diplomacy. [Bosnian Serb] Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha visited Russia. Our delegation stayed in Russia for three days. We had a meeting with Churkin, worked on the possibilities of opening Tuzla airport and on the resolution France insisted on for Sarajevo. The results are obvious, by the mere fact that the resolution became acceptable for us, that is, less unacceptable than it was. Karadzic had the following to say about the current positions: [Karadzic] "As far as the conference is concerned, we have been bypassed, not to say expelled, or left behind like orphans. They met there and are now creating their own state. But for us, this has more good than bad sides: we do not have to accept what we did not take part in preparing, we do not have to join it in this form. We can open up a completely new process of negotiating as the situation created by the signing is completely new to us. "Nobody has the right nor can call on us to join, as we are not a nation to be attached, we are just as much sovereign as the Croats and the Muslims are. They have to recognize the same rights to us, the same rights that they have given themselves. And [word indistinct] documents that Mr. [name indistinct] mentioned as being a base for their (?setting up), that is the sovereign right and the state-building right of those two nations." [Correspondent] Karadzic then warned that the European Union [EU] promised to lift the sanctions to reward the willingness to cooperate and concessions given by the Serb side. However, the European Union has not fulfilled this. In connection with the future of the peace process, i.e. the continuation of peace negotiations Karadzic said: [Karadzic] "We are in a situation whereby we shall continue negotiations although Resolution 820 is still in force; this resolution is exclusively in connection with our rejection of the Vance-Owen plan. The acceptance of the EU plan in two different forms has not made anyone think about suspending Resolution 820. That is a resolution that is strangling the Serb people, strangling entire Yugoslavia and [words indistinct], all the documents, oil for humanitarian purposes, and so on. "We have to decide whether we shall join any kind of conference that was prepared without us, whose official documents were examined, prepared and adopted by the two sides in our complete absence. Then, decide whether we shall join any international conference if the international community does not make some goodwill gestures and recognize the Serb willingness to cooperate. We are not asking them to abolish the sanctions and say that Serbia is not guilty, although it is clear to the entire world now that Serbia is not to blame. But we want them at least to fulfill their basic promises, i.e. comply with agreements which forced us to make some political and territorial concessions. We are not asking them to make a final judgement about the inadequacy of the sanctions, that Serbia is not to blame, that it is not responsible and is not involved in fighting. We are asking for a practical approach to the Serbs in their carrot-and-stick policy. In one hand they are holding a [word indistinct], in another one a stick. We are wondering what they are offering the Serbs. In both hands they are holding a stick. If they had three hands they would be holding three sticks." [Correspondent] In this report, we would like to single out one more segment from President Karadzic's address. It refers to a decision by the United Nations Security Council providing for the deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia: [Karadzic] "The latest decision by a committee granting the right to the Secretary General to accept Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina is leading us to believe that a big Balkan conflict is being prepared. If this conflict becomes necessary to the international players, full conditions for a big Balkan war will be created by the deployment of the Turkish troops. We are calling on the Secretary General never to invite a neighboring country, no country -- former occupier -- to deploy their troops here neither as observers, technicians, such as technicians [passage indistinct]. "Reasons of good taste should guide the German Government to keep its hands away from the remainder of Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The greater German state policy and diplomacy have left their fingerprints all over the ruins of Yugoslavia. The history will show it, Germany is to blame and is responsible for the redefining of the outcome of World War II. Let it be the concern for Britain and France, for Slovenia and Croatia, that again came under the German influence and which enabled Germany to win World War II at the negotiating table. Our concern is that this should not refer to us. We won World War II, we have won this war, and we want Germany to stay away from us. "Now to speak about Turkey. If Turkish troops are deployed, even if in our neighboring country -- the Muslim-Croat federation -- we will then demand that the Yugoslav troops, troops of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as a UN member and as a neighboring country, be deployed on our side."
