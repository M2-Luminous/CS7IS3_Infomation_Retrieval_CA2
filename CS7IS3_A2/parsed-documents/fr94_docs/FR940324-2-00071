Promoting Non-use of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore, the CMHS strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free project and work environments. This program supports one of the tenants of health care reform that appropriate and adequate care be provided by trained providers. It also supports the HHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to our customers. Part II_Programmatic Goals and Scope, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date The goal of this program is to enhance the Nation's ability to have an impact upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic by training the traditional mental health care providers and other health care workers who often are first-line providers of mental health services, such as medical students, primary care physicians, and the clergy and other spiritual providers. Applicants will be expected to propose a comprehensive training program that addresses the needs of traditional providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers and marriage and family counselors), other first line providers of mental health services (e.g., medical students, primary care physicians), and nontraditional providers (e.g., the clergy and other spiritual providers, alternative health care workers, counselors). Training programs proposed must target at least 5 provider groups. The program must address the neuropsychiatric and the psychosocial aspects of HIV/AIDS; coping with HIV/AIDS; and approaches to prevent the spread of HIV infection. Applicants are expected to explore the programs offered by their local HRSA AETCs and other health care provider educators and, where appropriate, establish linkages.
