"Guizhou has two pillar industries, cigarettes and liquor," he said. "But we must have a new understanding and adopt new approaches on this question. Their production should not be blind. What counts is not large production capacity and a big volume of output. The important thing is to improve factory management and raise product quality to make what you produce suit market demand." Guizhou Province has its own advantages such as rich natural resources and military technologies for its economic development, he said. Attending a group discussion by Guizhou deputies to the National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese capital this morning, Zhu asked Guizhou to proceed from its reality, readjust its industrial structure according to market demand, speed up the construction of communications facilities and work in a down-to- earth manner. Joining deputies of Jiangxi Province in a group discussion, Zhu stressed the importance of agriculture, especially grain production.
