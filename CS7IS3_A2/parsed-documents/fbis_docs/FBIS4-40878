This statement was made in an interview with INTERFAX by the President of the Belarussian [Belarusian] Academy of Geopolitics Professor Valentin Akulov. In addition, in his opinion, the West violated the Helsinki principles when it recognized new republics formed in ex-Yugoslavia. Thus, a key argument of opponents to changes in borders does not stand up to criticism cannot be seen as an obstacle to a Confederation of the Peoples of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. In the opinion of the professor, the idea put forward in Moscow a few days ago by public groups from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine can be put into practice already this year through referendums in the three countries. Supporters of a confederation speak for joint armed forces and a common ruble space but separate parliaments. The leader of the Russian Consolidation Party (one of the advocates of a confederation) Aleksandr Tikhonov is expected to raise the matter during his Tuesday meeting with the speaker of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin.
