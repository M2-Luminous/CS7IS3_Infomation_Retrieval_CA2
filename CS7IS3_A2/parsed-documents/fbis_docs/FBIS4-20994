FBIS4-20994 "jptdd014__l94054" JPRS-TDD-94-014-L JPRS Narcotics 13 February 1994 EAST ASIA MALAYSIA Kerinchi Community Described as `Heaven' for Drug Kerinchi Community Described as `Heaven' for Drug Traffickers, Users 94WD0247A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in Malay 13 Feb 94 p 8 94WD0247A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA Malay CSO [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Feb--Kerinchi Kampong [community] is still "heaven" to drug traffickers and users, although police have made many raids and arrests in the area. Because drug use and trafficking in the area are sometimes conducted openly, discontent has emerged among residents, who worry that their children will be snared by the unhealthy activities. Some city residents call the community "the drug users' kampong." Several kampong residents say they often encounter drug traffickers in the act of selling drugs to kampong teenagers. Drug traffickers are also found roaming the apartment area looking for prey and trying to entice new users so that the drugs they sell will be in demand. As a result, many of them use drugs on the steps of the apartment houses without any fear, ignoring the people passing back and forth. A kampong resident, who did not want his name publicized, said he once rebuked a group of teenagers using drugs on the steps of a four-floor apartment house, but he merely incurred their anger. Not only that, he said, but they also dared him to report their drug use to the police. He added that the drug users not only gather on the apartment house steps, but foul the area with their vomit, urine, and excrement. Moreover, residents worry about the growing number of thefts of clothing, shoes, and sandals, which they believe are stolen by drug users. "We want those users to be arrested immediately, before the holidays, if possible," residents added. Observation of the kampong by UTUSAN MALAYSIA found that traffickers and users choose strategic places for carrying on their activities without police interference. The location believed to be used by them for their activities is somewhat hidden from public view and near a squatter kampong in the area. Another resident said that every night without fail there are teenagers who gather and cause unpleasant conditions for residents. "There are more of them on the nights of public holidays and on weekends," he said. He added that he once rebuked the behavior of the teenagers, but five window panes and some sandals were stolen from his house, too. Kerinchi Kampong is the area most wanted by people looking for rental houses because of its strategic location halfway between Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya. As a result, many young people rent apartment units and squatter houses in the area. Earlier, Second Senior Assistant Commissioner (PKP2) Hassan Mutalip, chief of the Kuala Lumpur Criminal Investigations Department, said that last year police conducted many raids and arrested dozens of drug traffickers and users in the kampong.
