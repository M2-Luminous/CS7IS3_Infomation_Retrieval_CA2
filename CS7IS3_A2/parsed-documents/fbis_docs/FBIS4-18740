Boudewijn, how concrete are these evacuation plans at this moment? [Van Spilbeek] Well, Danny, maybe it is worth mentioning first that for such emergency situations in Zaire, Rwandi, and Burundi, there are always evacuation plans readily at hand, which can be implemented within a very short period of time, 24 hours or so. However, the situation now is that the 3d Paratroopers Battalion from Tielen and also the 1st Paratroopers Battalion from Diest have been called up and they are ready to depart right away. [Verstraeten] It is an international action? [Van Spilbeek] Yes, because the French, who have Foreign Legion paratroopers in the Central African Republic, which is not far from Rwanda, are ready to intervene if necessary. And we learned from a very reliable source that concrete measures are under way for the French, Belgian, and possible U.S. forces to implement an evacuation. [Verstraeten] How will tasks be divided? Who is going to do what? [Van Spilbeek] The Belgians would send the 1st or the 3d, or maybe both, Paratroopers Batallion. The 1st Para knows the situation well because these men returned only a few weeks ago from Rwanda, where they had stayed for four months. The French would also help in this operation. And the Americans would probably provide large transportation planes, and maybe even troops. [Verstraeten] Do the Belgians already have aircraft in the area? [Van Spilbeek] Yes. There is already one Sabena aircraft in Bujumbura in Burundi. Furthermore, this evening, there will be the regular Bujumbura-Kigali flight, and there is already one C-130 in Nairobi and, in addition, there is also one C-130 at the airport of Kigali itself. [Verstraeten] Yes, but this airport, and this may constitute one of the practical problems, what is the situation at Kigali airport? [Van Spilbeek] Yes, this is a key problem. Rwanda is located in the middle of Africa, so an evacuation has to proceed from the airport. A company of Belgian blue helmets was there to guard the airport, but it was armed with very light weapons only and lost the airport to the the Rwandan Army. This means that the airport is currently unsafe. Moreover, the Rwandan Army has proved that it is quite capable of downing aircraft since, two days ago, it downed its own president. [Verstraeten] So what are the solutions, what can they do? [Van Spilbeek] There are two possibilities: Either they could be diverted to another airport, but this would imply several hours by truck or jeep to get to Kigali, and this could increase danger for the people in the capital; or, the second possibility could be, as was done in 1978 in Kolwezi in the Zaire Shaba province, just to drop the men. After all, they are paratroopers. [Verstraeten] They are now waiting for the go-ahead by the ministers? [Van Spilbeek] Yes, indeed. Such an operation requires quite some coordination, with Paris and with Washington. Obviously, the Council of Ministers has to be informed about everything and agree with it. So, the decision will problably be made this afternoon at 0300 hours [0100 GMT] [Verstraeten] Thank you, Boudewijn.
