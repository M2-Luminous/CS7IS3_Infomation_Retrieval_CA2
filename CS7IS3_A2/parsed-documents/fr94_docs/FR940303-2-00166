FR940303-2-00166 FR940303-2-00093 Section I: Introduction This Eighteenth Annual Report to Congress summarizes the 1993 activities of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding implementation of applicable Sections of Title V: ``Improving Automotive Fuel Efficiency,'' of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (15 U.S.C. 1901 et seg. ), as amended (the Act). Section 502(a)(2) of the Act requires submission of a report each year. Included in this report are sections summarizing rulemaking activities during 1993 and a discussion of the use of advanced automotive technology by the industry as required by section 305, Title III, of the Department of Energy Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;238). Title V of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to administer a program for regulating the fuel economy of new passenger cars and light trucks in the United States. The authority to administer the program was delegated by the Secretary to the Administrator of NHTSA, 49 CFR 1.50(f). NHTSA's responsibilities in the fuel economy area include: (1) Establishing and amending average fuel economy standards for manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks, as necessary; (2) Promulgating regulations concerning procedures, definitions, and reports necessary to support the fuel economy standards; (3) Considering petitions for exemption from established fuel economy standards by low volume manufacturers (those producing fewer than 10,000 passenger cars annually worldwide) and establishing alternative standards for them; (4) Preparing annual reports to Congress on the fuel economy program; (5) Enforcing fuel economy standards and regulations; and (6) Responding to petitions concerning domestic production by foreign manufacturers and other matters. Passenger car fuel economy standards were established by Congress for Model Year (MY) 1985 and thereafter at a level of 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg). NHTSA is authorized to amend the standard above or below that level. Standards for light trucks were established by NHTSA for MYs 1979 through 1995. NHTSA set a combined standard of 20.6 mpg for light truck fuel economy standard for MY 1995. All current standards are listed in Table I&hyph;1.
