The conference discussed ways to conscientiously implement the national party school work conference with the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and, based on Jilin's reality, ways to study and address the new issues on the current party school work, to thoroughly probe the new measures and new ideas for the reform and development of party school work, and to promote Jilin's party school work in a down-to-earth manner. He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, attended and gave an important speech at the conference. He said: Cadres at all levels should attach importance to and intensify study and take the initiative in arming their minds with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization are in a crucial period for major change. Correctly understanding the situation we are faced with, addressing the issues on the way of advancement in a timely and effective manner, and arming cadres with new concepts and new knowledge constitute the most important link. Leading cadres, in particular, cannot assume the important leadership task if they do not intensify study because "those in the dark are in no position to light the way for others." In today's historical conditions, our intensive study, with the focus on new historical tasks, chiefly includes Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; theories on the socialist market economy and the knowledge on linkage to the world market economy; knowledge on modern science and technology; and the laws and regulations reflecting China's economic and political activities of the present stage, especially economic laws. Party schools at all levels should conscientiously implement the theory of integrating theory with practice and fully develop their role as "fronts" and "furnaces." They should help cadres at all levels embrace the new ideas and concepts and the way of thinking needed in developing the socialist market economy; help cadres probe the new ideas for reform, opening up, and development of the socialist market economy; and help cadres uplift spirit and establish and maintain a good mind-set. Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership and regard the work to make party schools successful as an important link of strengthening party building. Strengthened leadership of party committees over party school work is an important guarantee to make party schools successful. Party committees' leadership over party school work chiefly consists of five aspects: timely relay of the guidelines of the important policy decisions and instructions of the party Central Committee and local party committees, guidance for party schools to understand and adhere to the correct orientation for running schools and educational principles, and steadfastness in taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guiding principle for running party schools; formulation of the plans for leading cadres at all levels and reserve cadres to undergo training at party schools and guidance for party schools to appraise and examine the performance of cadres during their study at party schools in line with the principle of combining training with use of cadres and the requirements on cadres in the new period; conscientious selection of cadres and establishment of rationally structured and united leading bodies which have good political quality, adhere to the party's basic line, have a high level of understanding of Marxist and Leninist theories, and know the work of party schools; and supervision and inspection of the work of party schools, timely study of and timely solutions to the major issues party schools encounter, participation in and guidance to party schools' research on some major theoretical and practical issues; and mobilizing party committees and governments to support party school work, adhere to the principle of "letting party committees run party schools," and invest willingly in gradually improving the teaching conditions of party schools. In conclusion, He Zhukang hoped that comrades of party committees and party schools would seize the opportunity, uplift the spirit, hold the heavy tasks entrusted by this era, and raise the education of party schools to a new level.
