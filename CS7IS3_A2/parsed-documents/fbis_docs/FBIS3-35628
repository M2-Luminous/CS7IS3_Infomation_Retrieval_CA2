Ukraine Is Creating It Contrary to Common Sense, Striving To Finally Divide the Black Sea Fleet by Any Means"] [Text] Of all the former union republics which had outlets to seas (the Baltic countries, those in the Caspian region, and Georgia), only Ukraine plans to call itself a naval power in the very near future. If the economic crisis in the republic were not so profound, by the start of the new millennium it would be able to create its own fleet from scratch, as it were. Its scientific potential, the shipbuilding capacities in Nikolayev, Kherson, Kiev, and Kerch, the ships laid down at the time of the "indivisible" Union, and the related enterprises producing turbines, arms, and optical and electronic equipment make it possible to implement a shipbuilding program which meets the needs for defending the republic's sovereignty from the sea. But the backbone of the Ukrainian Navy, which has already been created, goes far beyond the tasks of a coastal fleet. Taking into account the aspirations with regard to dividing the Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine's future fleet is altogether seen as an ocean-going one. A Fleet of Which Ukraine Never Dreamed Since it proclaimed the policy of creating national armed forces, Ukraine has followed the principle of having its "own fleet, albeit a small one," capable of defending the republic's coast against military and economic invasion and fulfilling the functions of an emergency rescue service at sea. These tasks are within the capabilities of a brigade -- two ships to guard the area of water, several onshore missile and artillery systems, and a combined (ground-attack fighters and helicopters) air regiment. Even now, however, the Slavutich -- the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy -- and the patrol combatant Sagaydachnyy are clearly confined to the Black Sea in their actions. Like the "Slava"-class guided missile cruiser which is being prepared for sea trials, they need ocean expanses. Ukraine has on the stocks and berthed in shipyards a whole number of other ships whose building is incomplete, including the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser Varyag, for which the Black Sea, figuratively speaking, is like a puddle. Having also gotten half of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Navy will outdo even the German Bundesmarine in terms of strength. Personnel -- from seaman to admiral -- are also finding the Ukrainian Navy cramped. First, the number of potential seafarers who have taken the oath is far greater than the number of vacancies in the Ukrainian Navy today. Second, the Black Sea Fleet is a kind of forge of cadres, and forms Ukraine's mobilization reserve. Third, in previous years a large number of the republic's citizens served in the Navy -- which under conditions of a shortage of employment can very quickly create competition for contract service in the Ukrainian Navy. Finally, an additional influx of personnel can easily be predicted if the decision to split the Black Sea Fleet "50-50" is implemented. In addition, Ukraine is hurriedly building up the forces of the marines on the Crimean Peninsula. Doctrinally the tactic of using marine landing forces has not yet been agreed upon, the Ukrainian Navy does not have the means of getting them to possible landing sites, with the exception of one "Zubr"-class MDK [small amphibious warfare ship], and more and more people originally from Western Ukraine, who make up the backbone of the Ukrainian Marines, are turning up around Sevastopol and other points where the Black Sea Fleet is based in Crimea. These guys with a sleeve badge in the form of a wolf's jaws have already been used repeatedly as a "detonator" for various kinds of provocations: The takeover of apartment blocks constructed by Black Sea Fleet sailors, the armed "resubordination" of individual Black Sea Fleet units, and so on. Ukraine also has a training base which is surplus to the requirements of a coastal fleet. This is, first, the Naval Institute based on two higher naval schools, which trains shipboard cadres. Second, the center for retraining flight personnel in Nikolayev and the center for training carrier-based pilots in Saki. Some Get the Tops, Some the Bottoms To the nonspecialist a fleet means ships, ships, ships.... But in actual fact, without the umbilical cord of mooring cables connecting ships to the shore, such a fleet will exist for just 30 days -- a ship's maximum period of endurance in terms of fuel, water, and food. This was why Ukraine's power minister and first naval commander in chief, who quit the military-political arena not so long ago, campaigned in favor of dividing up the Black Sea Fleet into "tops" and "bottoms": our bases, your ships. Clearly, Russia does not want ships without bases. Anyway, the fleet's onshore backup has never attained civilized norms in the three centuries of its existence. Moving the fleet, which works in the interests of the whole Commonwealth, to unadapted berths overnight would mean ruining it once and for all. The Ukrainian military department was aware of this, but the demand for just such a "division" has been implemented with a persistence worthy of better application. This has essentially meant ousting the Russian Fleet, which, having no other bases on the Black Sea, would inevitably leave most of the Black Sea Fleet's ships and vessels to Ukraine. Similar submerged rocks are also inherent in dividing the Black Sea Fleet "50-50." With the sole difference that half the fleet at once passes to Ukraine's jurisdiction, while the rest will then be divided by the same method of ousting. With the present move toward supposedly outwardly more civilized relations with the Black Sea Fleet sailors following the changes in the Ukrainian military department, the tactic of "tops" and "bottoms" has not lost its topicality. The "tops" (in other words, the creeping privatization of the Black Sea Fleet's onshore infrastructure) are being gathered with the help of those same marines, whose place in Ukraine's military doctrine has not yet been defined. Facilities which at first sight have no bearing on the Black Sea Fleet's combat readiness are being transferred to Ukrainian jurisdiction: the marine engineering service, the housing stock. Moreover, in garrisons remote from the chief base. And yet the fleet is a multinational structure. The loss of components, albeit not the leading ones, leads inevitably to the breakdown of the entire "organism." There will be no housing on the bases leased by the Black Sea Fleet (there was, at last, talk precisely of leasing during the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia last year), and the onshore infrastructure will not be developed -- in the very near future neither Ukraine nor Russia will have any need of the ships themselves. "To Execute, and No Pardon" The "joint operation of bases," being imposed by the Ukrainian side, essentially deprives the Black Sea Fleet of any prospects for the future: Disagreements will be sure to arise even between the closest neighbors if, for example, the status of one spade between two is not enshrined in a corresponding agreement. The crack is being widened by the information blockade and the imposition of the "only correct" information in the Ukrainian interpretation of it: Central Russian publications, including KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, do not reach Crimea, television broadcasting is limited in terms of time and the number of programs, and the press center of the Ukrainian Navy -- the ideological mouthpiece for the division of the Black Sea Fleet -- has a staff many times greater than that of the press center of the Black Sea Fleet. It is no wonder that, given this distribution of forces in the "fourth estate," justification is found for any tricks by the Ukrainian marines, by their commanders who pit their subordinates against the "cursed Muscovites [moskalivy]," and by higher officials who are impatiently awaiting the "black redivision" of the Black Sea Fleet. Alas, we have to state that in the Ukrainian fleet, which essentially has not yet come into being, hatred for everything "non-Ukrainian" is cultivated far better than common sense and the age-old friendship of the Slav peoples. We who have prepared this material and who represent both branches of the peoples who grew out of the single Slav root find it all the more unpleasant to be aware of this. For, in tracing the dynamics of the situation, we do not rule out the least favorable development of events. The intensity of passion in Crimea and in the Black Sea Fleet and the deepening crisis in Ukraine's economy and policy are such that it will only take the slightest provocation (these, let us dare to assert, are not excluded from the arsenal of the "political" struggle for possession of the peninsula and the fleet) and blood will flow. So far the signal has not been given for a general "offensive" against the Black Sea Fleet, and individual "battles" of local significance are being waged. These include "freezing" the Black Sea Fleet's accounts in Ukrainian banks and levying all kinds of taxes and customs and other duties, whose total, if it has not exceeded the Ukrainian "share" of the funds once allocated to maintaining the fleet, at least long ago became commensurate with it. Even the food and fuel imported from Russia, with which Ukrainian seamen satisfy their needs, are requisitioned. The sums recovered in this way go into the Ukrainian Navy's budget. In these conditions the Black Sea Fleet sailors should campaign to ensure that there is no tax on air imported from Russia. In other words, both the republic's leadership and the Ukrainian Navy Command are doing everything to ensure that, instead of the Black Sea Fleet on the southern flank of the CIS, there is a weak Russian fleet based in unadapted places and an enlarged Ukrainian fleet capable of operating far outside the Black Sea. At the same time the Ukrainian side disregards the fact that the division (in fact, the ruin) of the Black Sea Fleet will result in an imbalance of forces in the region -- which will infringe Russia's legitimate interests. This means that, in carrying out its sentence in respect of the Black Sea Fleet ("to execute, and no pardon"), Ukraine could come up against the fact that its "ocean-going coastal" fleet will not protect its personal interests, which are defended today, albeit to its own detriment, by the Black Sea Fleet.
