The claim to the Viminale [Interior Ministry] was put forward yesterday, not for the first time, by means of this crude and undiplomatic statement by Luigi Rossi, [League Secretary] Bossi's spokesperson. It is a longstanding claim, and also, naturally, a farsighted one. In order to build federalism, the Senator [Bossi nickname] is convinced that majority agreements, alliances, and documents are useful but not sufficient. A political authority endowed with broad, far-reaching, and autonomous power is needed. And, it goes without saying, the interior minister is not lacking in power. He gives orders to the police (whose chief he must in fact trust), and he supervises the secret services. Above all, he appoints, transfers, promotes and, if necessary, removes questers and prefects. The prefecture, the state's "long hand" in the outskirts, is the League's number-one enemy. A centralized power rests with thee prefects. In order to dismantle this power, therefore, can a better weapon possibly be found than occupying the Viminale? Will there ever be a better opportunity than this to place Bobo Maroni [League lower house floor leader], the bandwagon's [League nickname] statesman par excellence, at its head? [passage omitted]
