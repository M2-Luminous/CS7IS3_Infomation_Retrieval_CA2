Here is correspondent Cha Man-sun reporting from the IAEA on current movements. [Announcer] Correspondent Cha Man-sun. [Cha Man-sun] Yes. [Announcer] How is the IAEA viewing North Korea's announcement of withdrawing its membership? [Cha] The IAEA interprets North Korea's announcement of withdrawing its membership as giving up its rights and duties as a member state, and the refusal of inspections for assuring the continuity of inspection as a rejection of all inspections in accordance with the nuclear accord. The IAEA is greatly concerned that the continuity of inspections might be broken in North Korea. IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that although the agency has not received an official notice from North Korea, it will discuss countermeasures this afternoon after analyzing North Korea's real intention. According to an IAEA source, the nuclear accord, which went into effect in 1992, is effective as long as North Korea does not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The source said it is of grave concern that North Korea might stubbornly insist that as a non-member state, it is not obliged to comply with the nuclear accord it signed with the IAEA. The source said that while the NPT has 164 member states, the IAEA has only 122, and since many countries that are member states of the NPT are not IAEA members, at present, withdrawal from the NPT is more of a concern than IAEA membership to the international community. [Announcer] Is North Korea's NPT membership still effective? [Cha] The IAEA thinks so. Before I go into further detail, let me tell you about the official procedure of withdrawing IAEA membership. When an IAEA member state intends to withdraw, it has to notify the depository country, the United States. Then the United States will notify the IAEA Secretariat, the Board of Governors, and all member states. Therefore, North Korea may withdraw from the IAEA immediately after an official notification to the United States. Paragraph 1, Article 3 of the NPT from which North Korea has withheld its withdrawal, stipulates that NPT member states are obliged to sign a nuclear accord with the IAEA. North Korea became an IAEA member in September 1974, an NPT member in December 1985, and signed a nuclear accord in December 1991. The IAEA believes that the nuclear accord signed with North Korea is still effective because Article 26 of the nuclear accord signed between the IAEA and North Korea stipulates that the accord is effective as long as the country concerned is a member of the NPT. Therefore, North Korea is obliged to accept IAEA inspection in accordance with the nuclear accord. On the other hand, two inspectors, who have remained in Yongbyon since 18 May, checked the refueling without any restriction until 13 June. What measures North Korea will take regarding the inspectors today is of great concern.
