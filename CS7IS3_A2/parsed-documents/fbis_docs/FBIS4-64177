The delegation included officials of the Trade Ministry and the adviser on economics of the Romanian Embassy in Lithuania, Dan Tiron, who is also a trade representative of Romania in Estonia and Latvia. The agreement was signed on Friday in the Foreign Ministry. The previous years were marked by a sensible decrease of barter between the two countries which makes up only some several hundred thousands lats. The new deal provides the most favoured nation treatment in trade between both countries. It means a remarkable reduction of rates of duties from both sides. According to the forecast by the state Minister of Foreign Trade and E.U. Affairs, Olgerts Pavlovskis, Romanian footwear, clothes, fruits, wine and other goods will again become accessible in Latvia soon.
