Then these features are transformed to enable free use of Carpenter and Grossberg's ART2 [Adaptive Resonance Theory 2] ANN for automated radar target identification of aircraft. In the computer simulation experiment, the total number of learning patterns selected was eight and the number of input features was six (three parameters each for the engine inlet and the tail); after numerous self-regulation training cycles, the technique was able to accurately recognize four aircraft targets--Concorde, DC-10, 707, and 747--with a minimum warning line (i.e. threshold value) of 0.3. The one figure shows the polarization ellipse, while the one table compares values for the six features of all four aircraft calculated via reference [1] with those calculated by the authors' method.
