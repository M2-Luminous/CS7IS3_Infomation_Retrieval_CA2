FR940607-0-00005 FR940607-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;202&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8925; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation Model 400A and 400T Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes, that requires inspection to detect damage of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), and modification, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of damage to wire harnesses due to abrasion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of control of the fuel supply to the engine or loss of control of the retraction/extension system for the MLG and MLG door. DATES: Effective July 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Beech Aircraft Corporation, Commercial Service Department, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Larry Engler, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ACE&hyph;115W, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4122; fax (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5965). That action proposed to require inspection to detect damage of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), and modification, if necessary. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 59 Model 400A and 400T airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,060, or $110 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;11&hyph;09 Beech: Amendment 39&hyph;8925, Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;202&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 400A airplanes having serial numbers RK&hyph;1 through RK&hyph;41 inclusive, and Model 400T airplanes having serial numbers TT&hyph;2 through TT&hyph;19 inclusive; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent loss of control of the fuel supply to the engine or loss of control of the retraction/extension system for the main landing gear (MLG) and MLG door, accomplish the following: (a) Within 200 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, perform a general visual inspection to detect damage of the wire harness in the wheel well of the MLG in accordance with Beechcraft Service Bulletin 2479, Revision 1, dated November 1993. (1) If no damage is found, no further action is required by this AD. (2) If damage is found, prior to further flight, modify the wiring in accordance with the service bulletin. Note 1: This service bulletin references Chapter 20&hyph;00 of the Aircraft Maintenance Manual and Air Force Technical Order P/N T.O. 1&hyph;1A&hyph;14 for further service information regarding procedures for modification (removal and splicing) of the wiring. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Wichita ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Wichita ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The inspection and modification shall be done in accordance with Beechcraft Service Bulletin 2479, Revision 1, dated November 1993. (NOTE: The issue date of Revision 1 is indicated only on the title page; no other page of the document is dated.)
