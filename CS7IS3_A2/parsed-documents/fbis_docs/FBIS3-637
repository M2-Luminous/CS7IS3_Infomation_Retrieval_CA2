Dolley, a ULIMO member of Liberia's newly instituted transitional national assembly, said the fighting was a political and tribal struggle between Krahns and Mandingos in the organisation. The most violent fighting took place in the Bong mining region 75 kilometres (about 45 miles) north of Monrovia and at Tubmanburg, the headquarters of the movement 60 kilometres (37 miles) to the north. The situation remained "chaotic" at Tumbmanburg, he said, though it had calmed down at Bong. The crisis began on February 28 when Thomas Ziah, a Krahn and one of two ULIMO representatives in the State Council, refused to support his fellow ULIMO member of the collegiate presidency, the Mandingo Mohamed Sheriff as candidate to head the institution. In reprisal, ULIMO president Alhaji Kromah, a Mandingo, sacked Ziah on March 3 and ordered that all Krahn fighters in the movement be disarmed. ULIMO's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, a Krahn, then declared on March 6 that he had replaced Kromah at the movement's head. The row also prevented the investiture of the State Council on Monday under a peace plan underwritten by the United Nations and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) last year to end Liberia's three-year civil war. The two sides finally compromised by replacing Ziah by another Krahn, Dexter Tahyor. Dolley called on ULIMO's political and military leaders to "settle their differences in a peaceful and orderly manner." ECOMOG, a multinational African peacekeeping force despatched to Liberia by ECOWAS in 1990, has this week made a start in the disarming of the country's rival factions.
