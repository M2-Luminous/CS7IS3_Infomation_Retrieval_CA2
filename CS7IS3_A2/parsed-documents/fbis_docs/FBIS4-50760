At the 27th conference held by the state's World Trade Council, participants saw another new horizon, that is, China at the other side of the Pacific Ocean. During the past few years more and more American businessmen are targeting China to expand their business. Seizing the right time, New Jersey World Trade Council, chose China as its conference theme and invited some 500 people from business, trade, government and other parties interested in exploring U.S.-China business to the meeting on Tuesday [17 May]. The conference, sponsored by the non-profit council, received great support not only from the American side, but also from the Chinese Consulate General in New York and Zhejiang Province of China, New Jersey's sister state. Robert P. Evans, chairman of the council noted that he held great honor to organize such a conference. At the beautiful conference venue called Birchwood Manor in Parsippany, New Jersey, governor Christine T. Whitman said the conference was a special time and event for her state while expressing welcome to Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United States and Ambassador Zhang Weichao, consul general to New York. In a brief interview with XINHUA, she said outreaching was a major part of the future of her state and China was a potential market of the future, so China was very important for New Jersey. "International trade means economic growth," she said. New Jersey, though small in size, sold products worth 11.5 billion dollars and its export was the 11th last year in the United States. With 20 of FORTUNE 500 biggest companies and 12 biggest service companies within its territory, the garden state will greatly develop its export in the future. In the early years of 1980s, New Jersey has become sister state with China's Zhejiang Province. To further their cooperation, Zhang Qimei, deputy governor, led a 50-member delegation to this special and unique opportunity with some 400 projects seeking partnership. Also at the one-day trade show, noted American companies such as AT&T, Citibank and KPMG Peat Marwick introduced their products and services to their Chinese counterparts. At the conference with the theme "China, The Next Great Business Frontier," participants featured presentations focusing on the business, investment, trade, legal, economic and social-political climate in China and agreed there existed great opportunities. Commenting on the conference, a senior Chinese conferee who attended lots of symposiums on China said it's rare to see such a professional conference which attracted so many American businessmen. The Chinese companies should go deep into American main stream society to do their business in this way. Just as Ambassador Zhang Weichao noted that this conference was very unique and unprecedented in the way that it had chosen China as the theme country. The large turn-out was also unprecedented. "It fully reflects the great enthusiasm and desire among the both business communities in exploring business opportunities and in strengthening bilateral cooperation." he added. Since the conference was convened at the very moment before the Clinton administration to decide whether to unconditionally renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status, most of the people at the meeting called for the separation of the issue from other unrelated matters. They also expressed their support for China's MFN status. Delivering an international luncheon address in the afternoon, Ambassador Li Daoyu thanked those people who made their efforts in developing Sino-U.S. trade and business relations and hoped that they make further efforts to help settle the issue. "China, The Next Great Business Frontier" was the theme of the meeting and also the desire of most participants at the meeting. While driving back on the Garden State Parkway to New York, this reporter also hoped that meetings of this kind will pave another "highway," which can carry more American businessmen, just like the speeding cars rushing by, to do their business with China. The desire is there, but more efforts would help their dreams come true.
