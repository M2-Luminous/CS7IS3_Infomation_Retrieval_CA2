The training will focus mainly on reform of the fiscal and taxation, finance, foreign trade, and investment systems and on establishing a modern enterprise system. Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, announced this in Beijing at the ongoing National Work Conference on Training Cadres at Enterprises. Chen Qingtai said, as this year is a critical year for promoting the establishment of a socialist market economic system and as the reform is approaching the homestretch, there is a need to train a contingent of entrepreneurs who are adapted to the socialist market economy and to greatly raise their political and professional quality to enable them to contribute to the reform and development of the economy and enterprises. Main points of the current training program include: stepping up training of plant directors and managerial personnel to lay a good foundation for forming a contingent of socialist entrepreneurs and for raising industrial and economic levels; helping cadres involved in economic management to gain a better understanding of the socialist market economy and to bring about transformation of functions at government departments and to effect changes in enterprises' operation mechanisms; strengthening study of existing reform measures so that the broad mass of cadres involved in economic work and cadres working at enterprises will understand and support reform and promote the smooth progress of reform. Chen Qingtai said the commission plans to basically complete training of major leading cadres at state-owned large and mid-sized enterprises: 20,000 by the end of February and 100,000 by the end of May; the commission will strive to basically complete training of major leading cadres at the nation's enterprises by end October. Chen Qingtai pointed out: It is necessary to step up enacting laws for training of cadres involved in economic work and cadres working at enterprises; with macroguidance, to gradually establish mechanisms for training whereby enterprises will voluntarily offer their own training programs; to conduct bold experiments; and to constantly promote the development of training work for cadres working at enterprises amid reform.
