"This information is a complete lie," a Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman told AFP of a Khmer Rouge radio report on Sunday which said government officials had travelled to Vietnam "to beg for 20 truckloads of mercenaries to come to the aid of defeated government troops in Battambang." Khmer Rouge radio had said government defeats at Anlong Veng and Pailin -- guerrilla bases in Cambodia's north and northwest taken by government troops but lost again to the Khmer Rouge -- had made the recruitment of new soldiers impossible. The guerrilla faction often blames Hanoi for interfering in Cambodia, where dozens of ethnic Vietnamese, including women and children, have been victims in bloody attacks blamed on the Khmer Rouge.
