These experts, which were appointed by a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, say that between 25,000 and 50,000 people were killed. This is a frightful figure, although it is smaller than what had initially been announced -- a few weeks after the aborted coup, some observers said hundreds of thousands had been killed. The massacres took place in the wake of the aborted coup by the army. Philippe Retiens [not further identified] spoke to Monique Mas: [Begin recording] [Retiens] The coup was seemingly carried out by the majority of army officers. That is to say, the Army was responsible, actively or passively, for the coup, contrary to what sources close to the Burundian Army said. They held that a few specific units were responsible. [Mas] Who is behind the massacres that followed the aborted coup? [Retiens] The responsibility is shared. Hutus killed Tutsis in reprisals. Especially when the news of the death of President Ndadaye was announced, many Tutsis were killed. Moreover, massacres were carried out by the Army, sometimes with the help of Tutsi civilians. [Retiens] What is the situation in the country today? [Mas] It remains quite unstable, especially in Bujumbura. [end recording] [Announcer] The international inquiry commission's final report will be published by April.
