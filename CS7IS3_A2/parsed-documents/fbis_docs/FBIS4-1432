W. de Klerk in Pretoria -- live] [Text] [De Klerk] Ladies and gentlemen, having visited a number of polling stations and having been fully informed about the electoral process this morning, I can say that one is glad to be able to say that at the biggest percentage of all polling stations things are going well. However, logistical problems are experienced at quite a number of.... [pauses] I would like to call upon, first, all my followers, but also all South Africans to please be patient and to assure that they bring out their vote. The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] -- I've just spoken to Judge Kriegler -- they're doing their level best to solve the logistical problems. They have all sorts of contingency plans in order. The government is rendering full assistance with regard to all the requests that we've received from them. Planes will be made available, helicopters, to deliver polling papers wherever there's a shortage. What is necessary is that we now stick to it, and that we exercise patience. We have received requests to declare tomorrow also a public holiday. I am sympathetically looking at that request, but we are at the moment talking to organized business in order to also get their views with regard to the implications. If that can help to solve the problem, we will sympathetically consider it, and an announcement may be made later this afternoon. The National Party will render its full assistance to the IEC in trying to solve the logistical problems, and the IEC need, I think, the support of all the parties. They are in charge of the election, but without the support of the parties and the public they also have a very difficult task. So let us help, let us be helpful, let us cooperate, and let us make use... Can I lastly say that, to the best of my knowledge, extended hours is being considered for tonight and, if need be, tomorrow evening until very late, so that each and every South African willing to bring out a vote can do so. [Unidentified official] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to ask your questions, can you just wait for the loud speaker. First question? [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] the security forces involved at the moment in a clamp down on certain party elements in the wake of the recent bombing attacks? [De Klerk] Good progress is being made, and the moment they fell that announcements with regard to the progress won't negatively affect the rest of their investigations, they will do so. But I can say positively that progress has been made and is continuing at the moment. [Correspondent] Does that mean...[pauses] Has there been some sort of a clamp down [words in distinct] reportedly have been a number of arrests. [De Klerk] We're not talking...[pauses] It depends on how you define a clamp down. We are bringing the perpetrators of the last series of bomb attacks to book, and we are having success in doing so. It is not a blind clamp down in any sense of the word that people are being arrested just because they are right. People are being arrested because they are suspects with regard to specific crimes. [Correspondent] We're hearing reports about people being told that they can't vote because someone in another area can't vote, and polling stations being closed, and people being turned away, hour after hour, because ballot papers aren't there. Do you think that there is a growing perception among many voters that this is becoming not a free election, not a fair election? [De Klerk] It is true that in a number of instances, for reasons that the IEC can explain to you -- we are not in charge of this election, it is being run by an independent agency -- that polling papers were not available at a number of polling stations, that therefore there was a problem with the distribution. It is for those reasons that steps are being considered such as lengthening the hours of voting today and tomorrow, such as flying in withdrawing ballot papers from certain ballot stations, flying it in, delivering it to the places where shortages have occurred or where it was delivered late. The IEC chairman assured me that they are getting on top of the problem with regard to the polling stations where they have problems, and I therefore don't think that it will affect the freeness and fairness of the election. What is required is patience and understanding by the voters negatively affected. [Correspondent] If the far-right feels they are not being properly represented, as indicated by the bomb blasts, what can a government of national unity do to prevent a situation similar to Northern Ireland in the future in this country? [De Klerk] Well, first, I think your premise that the far-right can in any way rightfully claim that they not being accommodated is a wrong premise, because the Freedom Front [FF] is participating, and all the feed-back that I'm getting is that in droves, even in areas which used to be totally CP [Conservative Party]-dominated, in droves, people who voted for the CP in the last election who voted no in the referendum, are coming to the polls and they're voting either for us or for the FF. Therefore those who are not now participating is really a small minority of the far-right, which in itself is a minority among the whites, and they're not representative of a large group of people. Second, if we have to deal in future with elements such as the IRA -- I'm told the IRA is really controlled by 300 people; I don't know whether it is true or not, but somebody told me that on a visit to England, that it is really a handful of people -- then we will have to act very firmly against them. It would be terrorism, and we would have to take every possible step to assure that they don't destabilize the country against the will of 99 percent of all South Africans. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] After a string of political pardons, could we be assured that if the bombers are caught they wouldn't be running free in a matter of a few months or a year or two, for political expediency? [De Klerk] Could you just repeat that please? [Correspondent] I said, after a spate of political pardons, and people being released for sabotage, can we be assured that if these bombers are caught they will not be released in a matter of months or a year or two for political expediency? [De Klerk] Well, in terms of the agreed-upon constitution, no cut-off date with regard to indemnity and releases for political crimes can go beyond December 1993. It would therefore require an amendment of the constitution with a two-thirds majority of Parliament, before that cut-off date can be shifted. [Official] Thank you. The gentleman over there, and after that, Conrad Burke. [Correspondent] Mr. President, reports [words indistinct] there were ballot papers in Botswana, for instance, where the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] sticker was not there [words indistinct] If people did use the ballot papers without the IFP stickers, would those ballot papers not be regarded as spoiled papers? [De Klerk] That question must be directed at the IEC. If you want an opinion from me, I would venture to say that they should be regarded as spoiled ballot papers. It has also been decided by the IEC when the decision was taken that the IFP would be accommodated by way of a sticker; that if that sticker is placed onto the paper in such a way that it obscures or intrudes on the space of any other party, that would also be regarded as a spoiled ballot paper. So on the basis of that, I would say yes. The IEC, of course, has wide jurisdiction, and one of the solutions which could be looked at, where the stickers are not available timeously, would be as has been done overseas, to allow voter to write the name, IFP, onto a ballot paper and in that way to indicate that he or she would like to vote for the IFP. But this is a matter in the hands of the IEC. I can only offer an opinion. [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Mr. de Klerk, you've been to a range of polling stations. Is it your impression that the voters have been suitably educated, that they know what's going? [De Klerk] Yes. Wherever I went, I inquired of the persons in charge of the polling stations whether they had any particular problems, and their reports to me indicated that things were going smoothly, and that they did not experience any particular difficulties. They were forced to make some difficult decisions: people unqualified to vote coming and insisting they would like to vote -- that sort of thing occurred. But with regard to the problem of illiteracy and so on, I get the overall impression that the people in charge are being very helpful and that they assist such people. It is having an effect, and other factors too, on the tempo of voting, and Judge Kriegler said it is going slower than they expected. [Burke] Just to follow up. Have you had any contacts with Mr. Mandela? [De Klerk] Yes. I've spoken to him twice in the past hour telephonically on this issue, on the request which is supported by his party with regard to the declaration of tomorrow as a public holiday, and I will, when I take a decision, also communicate with him again. [Correspondent] Could you comment on your feelings when the flag changed last night? Did you have some feelings at one time at least about the old flag? Can you comment on that? [De Klerk] Well, the old flag will always have a special place in my heart, but I'm part of the school which rather likes the new flag, and I don't have any problem with it.
