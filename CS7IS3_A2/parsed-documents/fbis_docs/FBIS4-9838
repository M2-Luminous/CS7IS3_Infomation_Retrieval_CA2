[passage omitted] Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Juan Jose Rodil Peralta issued a strong statement condemning the killing, which adversely affects the state of law in Guatemala. Rodil Peralta added this killing demonstrates those responsible for numerous acts of violence in the past are still on the loose. Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, said she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft, as certain versions have reported. She added there was no attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their weapons into the car, damaging it badly. According to another version, unidentified gunmen were following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior minister. Gonzalez' body was taken to a funeral parlor, where several people have come to express their condolences, including lawyers, former magistrates, and other Guatemalan political personalities. Gonzalez's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow, after being honored at the Constitutionality Court.
