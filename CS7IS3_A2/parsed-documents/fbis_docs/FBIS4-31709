"These were open, polemical, at times hard talks, but there can be no solution without dialogue," said Milan Kucan polemically, openly, and hard, but also with a sigh of relief because the two presidents did meet after 20 months; the malicious will establish that in this unsettled period Zagreb meanwhile had more meetings with Bucharest than with Slovenia, which is at its doorstep and its neck. In these belated discussions, Tudjman, as usual -- regardless of the fact that it has only been several years -- viewed the whole thing with the inevitable historical distance, while the Slovene president mostly spoke of the dark Balkan present and the uncertain European future. To what extent these things are out of joint in a completely unnatural way is best witnessed by Tudjman's choice of words, when, speaking of contentious interchanges, spoke out as if the nonaligned summit in Cairo were still on: "Neither Slovenia nor Croatia have any expansionist or imperialist demands in relation to each other." In the international diplomatic vocabulary such terms ended up on the ideological trash-heap of the defeated state-ology long ago, but evidently the Croatian president feels great only when he uses great words that sound dark and dire. The uninformed would think that it was Rabin and `Arafat who met, rather than the leaders of two states whom the world keeps reproaching for arguing like two sulky children competing in inventing evidence of greatness. During the time of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Slovenia and Croatia seemed to many like Siamese twins that were about to start a happy family as soon as they ran away from the hateful Belgrade family, and then they started to look at each other across the Sutla River as if across the banks of the Jordan. In their renewed greed, some Italian politicians have proclaimed Slovenia a small provincial region, but Croatia also suffers such slander all the time, even when Istria is not at issue. The blindness of self-sufficient triumphalism can then perhaps be described no better than by Kucan's ineffective lamenting over the newly liberated and newly established states' childish habit of extolling themselves too much while speaking of everyone else in an unreasonable way. The Slovene president did not say so publicly, but evidently the Slovenians justifiably feel nauseous when Tudjman talks about Croatia as the "super-state" with "super-democracy" and "super-economy" that all the countries of former communism can look up to, never -- or only seldom -- looking over his shoulder and into the neighbor's yard, in which fruit trees (the agreement with the European Union, the Partnership for Peace, the Council of Europe, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid to Poland and Hungary] program), which he keeps specifically promising to Croatia, have already grown. After the unwrapping of the "Croatian-Slovene package," which started after the first unfruitful visits of the "European threesomes," and became inevitable as soon as Slovenia got rid of foreign supervision and European observers, Ljubljana thought too soon that it had run away from the Balkans, while Croatia hoped too soon that it would replace Serbia as a new regional superpower, primarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the outlaws in its own backyard -- and then as the fortress wall of something long gone by, such as the stories about "the bulwark of civilization" and "the dividing-line of the worlds." This language is still spoken, although there are few who believe in this kind of delirious dream, while in the meantime Slovenia has also realized that its TV's and water heaters do not fascinate European consumers just because it has decided to proclaim itself Europe and has preached everywhere that it has no ties with or obligations to "those Balkans." Ljubljana and Zagreb kept arguing over a dry river bed until they realized -- if they realized -- that both live in the shadow of an unpredictable neighbor who, deep down, hopes that hundreds of kilometers on both sides of the disputed former river will again become his property. In that framework, some of Berlusconi's ministers inadvertently did a great favor both to Croatia and Slovenia, who were constantly looking too high and too far, over and above their heads, and which in many ways still come within the same mirror, as there can be no imperialism without an empire, and both Croatia and Slovenia occasionally suffer from the delusion that by contemplating their own navels they are contemplating the navel of the world.
