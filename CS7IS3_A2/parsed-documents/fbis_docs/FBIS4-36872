He said something to the effect that this generation of revolutionaries, who have led the revolution and the liberation movement since 1964, must hand over the banner to the younger generation. Abu-Mazin expressed doubt that the generation of the revolution would be able to transform and govern a state. He emphasized that the Palestinian leadership needs new blood to continue the road forged by the generation of the revolution with their blood, sweat, and sacrifice. They raised the banner of struggle in the sixties; now the younger generation must continue the march until the objectives are achieved. [passage omitted] Abu-Mazin's remarks are sound, wise, and logical. He is addressing his call to the current leadership. who began the revolutionary march as young enthusiastic men who are wiser now that they are over the age of 60. He is convinced that the building of a state needs younger leaders to take over the responsibility. He does not belittle the role that his generation has played in leadership, a role that will always be an object of admiration by our people and a model of sacrifice to be emulated. However, he realizes that this is the code of life and the logic of history. National interest dictates that the leadership be handed over to a generation of Palestinians who have relentlessly fought the occupation for over 27 years. They are able to deal with their problems and issues with pragmatism and equilibrium. Over the past decades the leadership has faced many challenges. It has taught the young generation the meaning of steadfastness and defiance. It has refused to submit to blackmail or to surrender under the most difficult circumstances. It has believed in the homeland's sacred mission and has carried it out with honesty. It has safeguarded rights and has not abandoned principles. Abu- Mazin's call to the leadership to give the younger generation a chance to shoulder responsibility stems from his awareness that there is a need to find a formula for transferring leadership, for he fears that a clash might occur between the new and old leaderships in the struggle to establish a democratic Palestinian state. Abu-Mazin adds that a new Palestinian leadership has emerged, whether or not the current leadership admits it or not. Abu-Mazin's remarks reaffirm the leadership's awareness of the new developments on the Palestinian land, developments that require new and modern formulas to solve the problems not only with the Israelis--the enemies of the past--but also among the Palestinians themselves. There is a dire need to maintain the unity of the national ranks, prevent any breakup of these ranks, and to build new concepts based on solid ground so that the masses will be one hand building the homeland for the sake of which we have sacrificed so long.
