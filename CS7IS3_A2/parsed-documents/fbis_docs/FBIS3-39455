FBIS3-39455 "drweu033__a94022" FBIS-WEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Germany Bundesbank Expects DM2 Trillion Debt in 1994 AU1602094194 Hamburg DPA in German 0806 GMT 16 Feb 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1602094194 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] In spite of the strict austerity measures, public debts will soar to gigantic heights this year. According to Bundesbank estimates, federal, laender and municipal debts, including those of the Federal Railways and the Trust Agency, could "reach almost 2 trillion." In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank says that at the end of 1993, debts increased to 1.74 trillion German marks [DM] -- that is, 56 percent of the GNP. With a predicted debt volume of almost DM2 trillion at the end of this year, public indebtedness would "jump" close to the "critical limit" laid down in the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria, which says that public indebtedness may only be a maximum 60 percent of economic achievement. The total public expenditure in 1993 was some DM140 billion higher than revenues, which increased the deficit by DM30 billion over 1992. New indebtedness was almost DM160 billion due to cash reserves being formed from "stockpiling credits." For 1994, the Bundesbank expects the shortfall in public funds "to stabilize at the 1993 level." According to the Bundesbank, a further increase in the government budget deficit will be prevented by the increase in fuel tax and pension contributions, as well as by strong efforts to cut expenditures. Although consolidating public funds during a recession is particularly difficult, there is no alternative to this approach. The way out via a further increase in taxes and social insurance contributions is "practically blocked": Germany is among the countries "with the highest rates in taxes and contributions," the report says.
