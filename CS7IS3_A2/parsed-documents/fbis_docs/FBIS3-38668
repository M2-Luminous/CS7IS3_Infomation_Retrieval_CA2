Does this not mean, however, that if you want to take over the government, this would require revising the Wiesbaden party congress resolution that rules out Bundeswehr operations as combat missions? [Scharping] No, not at all. I also said in Munich that we did not give up sovereign rights when we joined the United Nations. Therefore, we ourselves decide whether and to what extent we participate in UN measures. This is the only central difference with the Federal Government. We, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and a government headed by it will not send the Bundeswehr to combat missions anywhere in the world. [Ellgaard] If you took over the government, would you maintain compulsory military service? After all, this is a problem in view of the current thrift measures. [Scharping] Of course. Compulsory military service is a very central element for the democratic anchoring of the Bundeswehr, and it is part of the political culture in Germany. I think that it must remain in existence. [Ellgaard] Mr. Scharping, yesterday's pictures, the massacre in Sarajevo, shocked the world. Does the West not finally have to make a military intervention now? What is your position? [Scharping] It is the same position as that of the U.S. secretary of state. We must step up the pressure, but military intervention would worsen the bloodshed rather than stop it. [passage omitted]
