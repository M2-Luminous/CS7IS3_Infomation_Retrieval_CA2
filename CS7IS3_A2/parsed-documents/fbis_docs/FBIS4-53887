The decision was laid during the working visit to Vietnam by Ms. Helle Aid Degn, minister of development cooperation of Denmark. Following is our radio comment on the decision and relations between Vietnam and Denmark: This decision positively contributes to the national construction of Vietnam. Vietnam faces many difficulties and still lacks the capital for national development, especially in the construction of standard infrastructure. Since 1992, when Denmark resumed its cooperative relations with Vietnam, relations between the two countries have developed significantly. Denmark added Vietnam to its list of regular aid recipients. Denmark has also granted $14 million to Vietnam. The grant will be used to renovate and develop projects which shall be assisted by Denmark such as the Hoang Thach Cement Factory, the La Nga Sugarcane Factory, and the Dalat Water Supply Program. The Danish Government was pleased with Vietnam's maintenance and effective use of these projects. Ms. Helle Aid Degn, during her stay in Vietnam, agreed with the Vietnamese Government that bilateral relations between the two countries have developed. She also met with Vietnamese senior officials to map out the long-term strategy for cooperation between the two countries, mainly in the field of maintenance, the process of sea products, manufacture and distribution of cement, and in water supply programs. Denmark will also help Vietnamese programs on eradication of famine and alleviation of poverty, environment protection, and mother and child care. The decision to wipe out Vietnam's debt is also a long-term strategic cooperation between the countries and it creates favorable conditions for long-term and stable cooperation in economy and trade between Vietnam and Denmark.
