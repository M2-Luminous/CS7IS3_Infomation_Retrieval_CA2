Li Peng's Government Work Report will be focused on the relationship between reform, development, and stability. It has been reported that the "Securities Law (Draft)," which was set to be one of the main points on the agenda of the current congress, will not be submitted to the congress for deliberation. Instead, the "Budget Law" and "Law for Protecting Taiwan Investment" will be submitted to the congress for deliberation and approval. Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report (Solicitation of Opinions), drafted by the State Council's writing group, has been distributed to the ministries, committees, and provincial groups. It is said that this year's government report will comprise around 17,000 characters, more or less the same as last year. It will consist of seven parts: First, a review and summary of last year's work. Second, the tasks laid down for this year's economic development. Third, reform. Fourth, strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation and checking inflation. Fifth, spiritual civilization, education, and social order. Sixth, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Seventh, the international situation and diplomatic work. Reportedly, the 20-character principle will run through Li Peng's Government Work Report. Li Peng will also talk at length about the relationship between reform, development, and stability. An authoritative person said that the original theme of "reform" may eventually be changed to "stability." Many local officials have complained about the setbacks encountered in implementing a series of reform measures introduced this year. It is estimated that many of the CPC Central Committee's policies will be censured at this year's congress. For this reason, the central authorities made preparations long ago. On the one hand, senior officials were sent to all localities before the Lunar New Year to do persuasive work. On the other hand, the media's reportage of the congress will be kept under strict control and "stability" will be the top priority. The dates for this year's NPC and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] have been brought forward. It is said that the authorities intend to bring the dates of the two annual sessions forward, to be held annually after the Lunar New Year to make plans for the new year. The authorities hold that post-Lunar New Year is the appropriate time for holding the sessions. If the dates are brought forward it will be difficult to draft the Government Work Report and prepare the statistics. Accommodation for NPC delegates is more or less the same as in previous years. The only difference is that more delegates will stay in official and Army guest houses rather than the Xiyuan Hotel and other starred hotels as in the past. Beijing Hotel will "exclusively" receive the Guangdong delegation this year. The Shanghai delegation, the most conspicuous one, will stay in the Army's heavily guarded Jingxi Guesthouse.
