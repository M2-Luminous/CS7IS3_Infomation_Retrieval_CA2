Homeland police spokesman Col Dave George could not immediately confirm or deny the claim, saying officers did not enter brief detentions for questioning into a common register. The ANC Eastern Transvaal region said in a statement deputy regional secretary Phillip Radebe, his driver Mandla Mholongo, and regional organisers Ephraim Mogale and Piet Mello were arrested at Moretele 2 on Sunday and taken to Hammanskraal security offices. They were interrogated, kicked, punched, burnt with cigarettes and warned not to set foot in Bophuthatswana again, and were then released. The four had gone to Marapyane village at Moretele 2 to attend an ANC meeting. Voter education material such as calenders, pamphlets, stickers, ballot papers and personal notebooks were confiscated, the ANC said. Col George said the men should forward their complaints through police headquarters or lawyers.
