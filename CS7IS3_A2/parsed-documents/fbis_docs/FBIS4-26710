Their annual import and export volume reaches 830,000 tonnes, up 117 times from the figure of 1988 when the vehicle transportation between the two sides opened. The port vehicle transportation has become a key transportation force with which the province delivers its goods to foreign countries. In 1988 when the province started to open its vehicle transportation to the Russian Federation, only 7,000 tonnes of goods were transported. Along with the ceaseless expansion of the border trade between the two countries, the transportation volume has increased by a big margin. Over the past six years, more than 1.8 million tonnes of goods were transported through these ports by vehicles. Of this, more than 1.33 million tonnes of goods were transported through Heihe and Suifenhe ports. So, these two ports become the province's two largest ports with vehicle transportation with the Russian Federation. There are international regular passenger bus services linking up Heihe and Dongning ports with the Russian ports opposite to them. Some of the ports have also temporarily opened passenger bus services. So far, 23 international vehicle transportation enterprises with more than 850 vehicles have been established in the province through examinations and approvals. When examining and approving the foreign transportation enterprises and the vehicles used for foreign transportation, the provincial communications department has broken down the barriers between different trades and made efforts to develop big container vehicles, refrigeration vans, tank trucks, and [words indistinct] goods transportation vehicles so as to gradually rationalize the vehicle transportation structure. The infrastructural facilities of the province's border county towns and border ports are extremely weak. With the strain on construction funds, over the past years, the provincial communications department has built the infrastructural facilities in these towns and ports in a well-planned manner and in the order of priorities. The Ministry of Communications, the province, and the localities jointly invested more than 10 million yuan to build goods transportation storehouses in Heihe, Suifenhe, and Tongjiang. So, these three ports have basically obtained 30,000-tonne storage capacity and semi-mechanized loading and unloading capability. The port transportation conditions have ceaselessly improved. Dongning-Sanchakou, Luobei-Mingshan, and Mishan-Shangzhi highways and [words indistinct] project have been made available to the users.
