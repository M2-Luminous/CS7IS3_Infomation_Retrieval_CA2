Guo said China had studied Britain's latest funding proposals and would seek a meeting with the British side after the lunar new year. "A meeting of the (JLG's) Airport Committee is inevitable," he said. "After the new year, I suppose the experts on the two sides can meet and exchange views to pave the way and set the conditions for a meeting of the Airport Committee." He said China would contact British representatives to arrange the date and details of the meeting. This was the first time Beijing had officially responded to Britain's fourth and latest package, which proposes pumping more than $60bn into the Provisional Airport Authority and Mass Transit Railway Corporation to finance the airport and railway projects. Britain's earlier proposal which was rejected by China involved injecting only $45bn. Beijing has yet to make an formal counter- proposal to meet its aim of lowering debts and increasing government equity. Guo would not give Beijing's view of the British proposal, but said an in-depth study was continuing. Meanwhile, Zhou Nan, the Hong Kong chief of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA), last night reiterated the importance of sticking to the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport.
