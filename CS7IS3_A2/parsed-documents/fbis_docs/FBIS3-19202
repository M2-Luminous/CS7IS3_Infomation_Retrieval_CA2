However, there are no spectacular Austrian investments such as Volkswagen (passenger cars) or Philip Morris (tobacco sector). It is mainly small- and medium-sized Austrian companies that are investing in the Czech Republic. They not only participate in local companies there, but also build factories from scratch. Therefore, Austria's presence in the republic is wide-ranging both in regional terms and regarding industrial branches, Altenburger says. Shift of Production Austrian companies are shifting certain production to the Czech Republic, because wages there are only about one-sixth of those in Austria. However, labor productivity is also lower. Wages differ strongly depending on sectors and regions. In Prague there is overemployment, skilled workers are scarce. Following coupon privatization, Austrian companies have the opportunity for capital participation in these transformed companies, which need capital because this kind of privatization does not yield money for the companies. Therefore, management is often interested in foreign capital. Generally, participation is conducted by means of increasing capital in the form of machinery or equipment. Foreigners can also buy company shares from investment funds, from banks, or via the stock exchange. In 1993, foreigners where, however, restrained: Instead of the expected $1.2 billion, they invested only $561 million. According to the Czech National Bank, this is linked with the separation from Slovakia and with the recession in the West. Furthermore, foreigners waited for the end of the first wave of coupon privatization in autumn. Since 1990, $2.1 billion has been invested: Germany leads with $641 million, followed by the United States ($572), France ($259), Belgium ($145), and Austria with $126 million (1.5 billion schillings). In 1993, the largest investor was the United States with $255 million, followed by Germany ($82 million), and Austria with $55 million, which corresponded to 9.7 percent of foreign investments.
