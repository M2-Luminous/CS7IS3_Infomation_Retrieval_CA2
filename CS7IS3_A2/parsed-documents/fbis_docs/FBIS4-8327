By taking this step, he added, the court had showed that it had its place in the republic's constitutional system. "That the court decided differently from parliament I certainly do not see as a wrong towards parliament." he said. Kasal said he firmly believed that the defamation clause should not have stayed in the criminal code "for all time." Another deputy chairman of parliament, Pavel Tollner, said that he personally welcomed the Constitutional Court's verdict. However, he added, the provision had in practice remained unused in the application of the criminal code. Chairman of the Left Bloc deputies' group Jaroslav Ortman said today's decision showed that the demands of Left Bloc deputies during parliamentary debate of the amendment to the criminal code were right. Left Bloc deputies had proposed that the clauses on the defamation of the republic and its representatives be left out. Dalibor Matulka, formerly a Left Bloc deputy but now in the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), agreed with Ortman, adding that he was surprised that President Vaclav Havel had not proposed that the court abolished Article 103 as well, which concerned the defamation of the president of the republic. Pavel Kulicka (Liberal National and Social Party, LSNS) said that his club welcomed the decision of the Constitutional Court, and Rudolf Opatril, press spokesman for the Bohemian and Moravian Centre Party (CMSS), said the same. On November 10 last year parliament passed an amendment to the criminal code, and voted to keep the provisions on the defamation of the republic and its representatives in it. Havel subsequently signed the code but proposed that the Constitutional Court reconsider the defamation provisions.
