The delegation included Deputy Prime Ministers Gagik Martirosyan and Gagik Shakhbazyan, Transport Minister Henrik Kochinyan, Davit Shakhnazarian, the chairman of the National Security Department, the head of the president's office, Shagen (Kara-Muntyan), and other government officials. Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the other guests were given a hearty welcome at Tbilisi airport by Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, the chief of the head of state's office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, and other officials. A face-to-face meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and Levon Ter-Petrosyan lasted for almost one and a half hours. At the same time, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and officials from the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Georgia discussed with the other guests a number of economic issues that are pressing for the two countries. After this, the full delegation was received by Eduard Shevardnadze. The head of state told members of the Armenian delegation that a good tradition had developed. We are meeting each other to examine problems facing us and, for me, every such meeting is a step forward toward achieving objectives that have been set, and toward strengthening traditional friendly ties between our two neighboring countries and peoples. Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan thanked the Georgian leader for allowing this visit to be organized at short notice. The Armenian president said that apart from personal relations that are playing a productive role, an effective mechanism for interstate relations had been created. Levon Ter-Petrosyan announced that during the face-to-face meeting with Eduard Shevardnadze, they examined issues relating to economic cooperation problems and aspects of regional conflicts. It was stated that both countries supported the implementation of an idea of Caucasian dialogue and a meeting between the leaders of the Transcaucasian states with the participation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The talks discussed problems relating to the organization of the delivery to Armenia of bread products and fuel, in particular, gas. The sides agreed that grain intended for the people of Armenia would be delivered to them as soon as possible by rail from the seaports of Batumi and Poti. Special interstate treaties would be very important to speed up this process. In this connection, it was admitted that agreements reached at the level of broker firms and organizations were often not very effective and could even delay the process of delivery. Eduard Shevardnadze supported taking quick measures to establish unhindered work of the railway and other transport, on which the situation in neighboring countries depends to a large extent. He also addressed other problems, stressing the importance of a (?common) approach by the two country's official leadership toward solving regional problems. Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency, Zurab Kervalishvili, the first deputy prime minister, Security Minister Igor Giorgadze, the chief of the head of state's office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, the chief of the Customs Department, Viktor Lordkipanidze, and the chief of the head of state's Information Bureau, Ramaz Sakvarelidze, took part in the talks. The sides signed a protocol on the implementation of the accords reached during the talks. On the same day, the delegation from the Republic of Armenia returned to Yerevan.
