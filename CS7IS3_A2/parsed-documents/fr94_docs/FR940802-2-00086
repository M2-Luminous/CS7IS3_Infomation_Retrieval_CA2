FR940802-2-00086 FR940802-2-00050 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 52&hyph;002] Issuance of Final Design Approval System 80+ Design; ASEA-Brown Boveri-Combustion Engineering The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a final design approval (FDA) to Asea-Brown Boveri-Combustion Engineering (ABB&hyph;CE) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52, Appendix O, for the System 80+ standard design. This FDA allows the System 80+ standard design to be referenced in an application for a construction permit or operating license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, or in an application for a combined license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. In addition, ABB&hyph;CE has completed the technical review stage of design certification pursuant to the applicable requirements of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 52. The staff performed its technical review of the ABB&hyph;CE Standard Safety Analysis Report-Design Certification (CESSAR&hyph;DC), certified design material, and technical specifications in accordance with the standards for review of design certification applications stated in 10 CFR Section 52.48 that are applicable and technically relevant to the System 80+ standard design, including the exemptions and applicable regulations identified in Section 1.6 of the final safety evaluation report (FSER). On the basis of its evaluation and independent analyses, as discussed in the FSER, the staff concludes that, subject to satisfactory completion of the System 80+ design control document (DCD), ABB&hyph;CE's application for design certification compiles with those portions of 10 CFR Section 52.47 that are applicable and technically relevant to the System 80+ standard design. Therefore, the staff and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards will use the System 80+ design and will rely on it in the administrative review phase of the design certification rulemaking process in accordance with 10 CFR 52.51. A copy of the FDA has been placed in the NRC's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20037, for review by interested persons. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 26th day of July 1994. For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William D. Travers, Deputy Associate Director for Advanced Reactors and License Renewal, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
