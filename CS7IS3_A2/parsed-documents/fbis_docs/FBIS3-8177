In the ambassador's view, the verdict of the court is unjust because neither Lysenko nor the Ukrainian Security Service carried on spying activity to the detriment of Poland. He treats the detention of Lysenko as "the activity of influential circles that are acting against the reconciliation of the two states." The ambassador expects that "in democratic Poland, justice will prevail." Udovenko revealed that the Ukrainian embassy had held secret talks on the Lysenko case with 15 influential personalities in Polish political life. The Ukrainian side was concerned that the case did not worsen mutual contacts. He said that, inter alia, the visit of the State Protection Office [UOP] head to Ukraine had not yet ensued on account of the trial. The ambassador expressed thanks to Lysenko for "endurance and patriotism, and for not agreeing to be recruited by the UOP." The major himself, present at the news conference, told journalists that he was blackmailed and encouraged to change his citizenship, and to pass on state secrets to the Polish side.
