He praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree ordering the foundation of a committee to regulate the implementation of the treaty. An analogous committee has already been formed in Tatarstan. The vice-president said his republic's treaty with the Russian Federation was the first document in Russia's history which established constructive cooperation between a region and the centre. He noted that the Tatarstan commission already has a specific programme for the agreement's realisation. For example, Tatarstan plans to play a role in federal-level economic programmes, such as the ones for the production of Tu-204-200 aircraft, cars, and oil-tankers. Yeltsin's decree is a significant step forward in the implementation of radical reforms aimed at turning Russia into a truly democratic federation, Likhachev commented.
