[passage omitted] During the visit, a joint statement was signed in which the sides called good relations between Russia and Germany a most important factor of stability and security in Europe. Protocols on mutual exchange in training soldiers and officers and on cooperation in the sphere of environmental conservation were also signed during the visit. [passage omitted] German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed, in particular, the importance of Russia participating in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. He called Russia a most important partner of NATO's. Pavel Grachev, in his turn, stated that he regards this program as a document for the transitional period. "This period began with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and will end when the countries which belonged to it, and also the states formed in place of the Soviet Union, find their place in the world community," he said, in reply to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "They should become independent states, both in economic and political terms, carrying out a course for democracy, peace, and cooperation." Speaking of the role of NATO in the system of European security, P. Grachev noted that it was not just the North Atlantic alliance which should take part in it, but also all international organizations on the continent -- the CSCE, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the European Union, and the West European Union. The main role here, however, should belong to "the main peace-keeping organization" -- the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He did not exclude NATO's integration into the common European process right up to this organization being transformed into a unified structure. "Time will tell what this structure will be like," P.Grachev said. He spoke out in favor of Russia's cooperation with the North Atlantic bloc and for its integration into it. Touching upon the intention of a number of East European states to join NATO, the Russian minister stated: "We will not foist our will upon other states. We do not have the right to do that, but we would like to see on their part the desire to cooperate with NATO and not to be integrated into it." Having noted that the final decision on the ceremony to see off the ally's troops from Berlin would be taken at the highest political level, both ministers stressed that this should happen in a "worthy manner." "We would like to leave Germany as friends," P. Grachev said, "all the more so since the Western Group of Forces have formed good relations with the German side." Volker Ruehe in his turn said, in reply to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, that he would like to see every Russian soldier returning home as an ambassador of Germany's. The date for the completion of the withdrawal of troops, should, in his opinion, not just remind one of the past but also allow one to take a look into the future where cooperation between the two countries will be developed anew. In Berlin, Pavel Grachev and Volker Ruehe laid wreathes at the memorial in Tiergarten to Soviet soldiers and at the memorial to those who tried to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944. Having ended his official visit to Germany, Pavel Grachev will spend another two days on German soil. He will hold meetings with the command and men of the Western Group of Forces.
