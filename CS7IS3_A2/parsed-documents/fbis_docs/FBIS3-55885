Lukyanov is convinced that social stabilization largely depended on the policies pursued by the Russian president and was possible if the hopeless shock therapy was brushed away. Leader of the Democratic Party, Nikolay Travkin, told Interfax that the current State Duma was the weakest legislative body in Soviet and Russian history. He said that the Soviet parliament was the strongest. The radical moods have triumphed and society has elected the most radical deputies to the parliament, he said. He noted, however, that the deputies' rigid organization and experience were the new parliament's strong points. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Democratic Party, who scored the greatest number of votes among the deputies representing political parties (23 percent), does not intend to discuss the October events or the legitimacy of the adopted Constitution as opposition deputies propose. "We must carry on," he told Interfax. Speaking about possible candidates to the post of the State Duma's chairman, Zhirinovskiy said that he would not vote for anyone except the representative of his faction, Vladimir Gusev. (Gusev was born in 1932. He is the vice president of the scientific and industrial corporation "Promyshlennik"). Yegor Gaydar, the leader of the Russia's Choice faction, said in an interview with Interfax that he did not support the idea of setting up a parliamentary commission for investigating the events in Moscow on October 3 and 4. He believes that the establishment of such a commission would violate the principle of division of power. He also said that his faction would support the candidacy of Russian ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir Lukin (the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc) to the post of the State Duma's chairman, although his faction was ready to support any other acceptable neutral candidate. Another representative of Russia's Choice, Mikhail Poltoranin, stated that his faction would propose the candidacy of Sergey Kovalyov, a prominent human rights activist who led Russia's Choice during the elections. Poltoranin believes that if Kovalyov fails to score enough votes, his faction would vote for Lukin. Chairman of the Karelian parliament and member of the Federation Council, Viktor Stepanov, believes that the post of speaker has been reserved for Moscow's representative. He also believes that this post will be contested by First Vice Premier Vladimir Shumeyko and ex-chairman of the Moscow Council Nikolay Gonchar. Stepanov told Interfax, however, that the choice of the parliament speaker was the most acute problem and that debates would last for several days. Stepanov does not rule out the possibility of creating factions in the Federation Council. In his opinion factions will be created on the basis of territorial and political principles. He also noted that representatives of the republics would pursue the policy of broadening and strengthening federalism. President of Kalmykia and member of the Federation Council Kirsan Ilyumzhinov supports the idea of setting up a parliamentary commission for investigating the events in Moscow last October. He told journalists that the government's actions during those events must be qualified as anti-constitutional. Ilyumzhinov believes that the Federation Council must ensure the consolidation of society, which is blighted with a deep crisis. "If economic recession continues and living standards continue to fall, social tremors will become inevitable," he said.
