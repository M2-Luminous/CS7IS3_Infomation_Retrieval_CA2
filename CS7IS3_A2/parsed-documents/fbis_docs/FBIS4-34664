The article cites the Agriculture Ministry's tobacco enterprise union as saying that the eight cigarettes factories are at full production capacity. The article points out that 14,468,900 packs of cigarettes were distributed to the population between 1 June -- when cigarette sales were deregulated -- and 16 June. The demand for unregulated cigarettes on the national market, initially high, has decreased. This has helped market stability.
