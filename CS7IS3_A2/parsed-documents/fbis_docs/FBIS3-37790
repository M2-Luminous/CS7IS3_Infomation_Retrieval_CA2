The Russian Federation was represented by special envoy of the Russian president and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. The negotiations decided to make use of the success achieved by joint efforts in settlement around Sarajevo and continue close interaction with the aim of immediate search for ways to settle the Bosnian conflict by all the warring sides, head of the German Foreign Ministry's political department Juergen Chrobog told a news conference here today. The meeting praised possible achievement of understanding between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croats, said the German diplomat. Possible uses of heavy armaments pulled back from Sarajevo in other Bosnian regions were described as a major problem. The meeting participants agreed to concentrate on the expansion of security zones, achieve stable truce in Sarajevo through efficient separation of the warring units, prevent the use of pulled back heavy armaments in other regions, ensure free access to the city of humanitarian convoys and restore normal life in Sarajevo with the help of U.N. units. In the opinion of experts, it is necessary to replace U.N. personnel in Srebrenica and Jepa and ensure free access of humanitarian convoys to the area, immediately open the Tuzla airport for the delivery of humanitarian cargo, achieve truce and pullback of artillery and ensure access of humanitarian aid to Mostar, achieve efficient truce in central areas of Bosnia and ensure free access of humanitarian cargo in Maglaj. Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Bonn working meeting discussed a summit on Bosnian settlement, whose idea was considered during a telephone conversation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl late last week, the German Foreign Ministry's political department head said participants in the working meeting will inform the state heads of the meeting discussion and results. The politicians will decide what kind of meeting should discuss Bosnian settlement. The issue was not discussed in detail, meeting participants need some time to think.
