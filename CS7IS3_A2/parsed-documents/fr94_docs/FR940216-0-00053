FR940216-0-00053 FR940216-0-00010 In past proposals, EPA has evaluated the formula fuel by assigning levels for unspecified parameters at their level in baseline gasoline, as defined in section 211(k)(9)(B) of the Act. However, such an interpretation would not eliminate the problems described above, since the oxygenate type would remain unspecified. Hence the requirements of a formula could be met by a range of fuels, each based on different oxygenates, even if unspecified parameters were to be set to baseline levels, and this range of fuels would exhibit a range of emission performance levels. While the Complex Model attributes identical effects to oxygen in different chemical forms for most pollutants, it incorporates emission effects that depend on the type of oxygenate used for nonexhaust benzene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde emissions. EPA therefore ran the complex model for several fuels, varying the type of oxygenate and holding other parameters not specified by the formula at statutory baseline levels. The VOC emission reductions from baseline levels for all such formula fuels were less than 15 percent. EPA therefore based the VOC emission requirements for Phase I reformulated gasoline on the 15 percent reduction minimum performance standard, since this standard is more stringent than the requirements of the formula. For toxics performance, EPA separately evaluated the emissions performance of fuels that met the formula requirements and contained statutory baseline levels of unspecified fuel properties for VOC control regions 1 and 2, since nonexhaust benzene emissions would differ in these two regions. EPA also evaluated such fuels with different oxygenate types. The results are shown in Table II&hyph;3. These results include both summer and winter effects, weighted based on the share of vehicle miles traveled in each season. Table II&hyph; 3._ Phase I Toxics Emissions Performance of Formula Fuels 1Oxygenate type 1Percent reduction from CAAB levels 2VOC control region 1 2VOC control region 2 ETBE 11.82 11.65 Ethanol 13.16 13.01 MTBE 16.33 16.15 TAME 16.81 16.67 The results indicate that whether a formula fuel (with unspecified fuel parameters at statutory baseline levels) meets the 15% minimum performance requirement of section 211(k)(3)(B) depends on the type of oxygenate used. If EPA were to impose the formula requirements of section 211(k)(3)(A), the results presented in Table II&hyph;3 indicate that not all gasolines which could be certified as reformulated would achieve at least a 15 percent reduction in toxics mass emissions, even if unspecified fuel properties were set at statutory baseline levels. If EPA were to require a 15 percent emissions reduction in accordance with section 211(k)(3)(B), however, all fuels would achieve this minimum level of reductions. EPA therefore believes that the formula requirements of section 211(k)(3)(A) are not as stringent as the performance standard set forth in Section 211(k)(3)(B). The minimum performance standard for Phase II is even more stringent than the Phase I standards. EPA has therefore determined that the performance standard is more stringent than the formula for both VOCs and toxics, for both Phase I and Phase II. EPA must therefore set its Phase I requirements for both VOCs and toxics to be no less stringent than the 15 percent emission reduction performance standard required by section 211(k)(3)(B). EPA has considered whether it should require greater reductions in toxics mass emissions than that required by the 15 percent minimum performance standard. However, the Agency has concluded that more stringent toxics requirements are not cost-effective, as is discussed more fully in Section VI. Hence EPA has set the Phase I toxic emission performance standard at the minimum 15 percent reduction from baseline levels required by the Act. Compliance with this standard must be demonstrated using the appropriate emission models throughout Phase I. Under the authority of section 211(k)(1), EPA believes that the greater flexibility and reduced cost afforded to gasoline refiners and importers by an averaging program allow EPA to require a greater reduction in toxics emissions than is required under section 211(k)(3). As discussed in Section VII, the Agency believes it appropriate, when the air toxics standard is met on average, that it be 1.5 percentage points more stringent than standards met on a per-gallon basis. EPA estimates that the approximate 1.5 percentage point margin will be sufficient to recoup any compliance margin refiners would have otherwise had to maintain to ensure achievement of the toxics requirements in the absence of an averaging program. In sum, the tighter averaged standard should have the potential to increase the environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program while not increasing the cost of obtaining those benefits. As a result, the air toxics performance standard when met on an annual average basis is set at a 16.5% reduction from baseline levels. F. Applicability (1995&hyph;7) The Simple Model described in this section is effective beginning January 1, 1995 with the beginning of the reformulated gasoline program as a means by which fuel producers can certify that their fuel meets the requirements for reformulated gasoline. The Complex Model described in Section IV will not be required to be used for fuel certification until January 1, 1998.
