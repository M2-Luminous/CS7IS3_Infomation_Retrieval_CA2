At St. Petersburg's Pulkovo-2 airport, where the head of the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry arrived today, he told journalists: We shall withdraw our troops from Estonia solidly and in a worthy manner on the basis of an agreement which, if it is concluded without delay, will allow our forces to be withdrawn by 31 August 1994. Unfortunately, no signals have yet been seen from the Estonian side indicating that they intend to conduct the talks seriously, Andrey Kozyrev said. The minister stressed that Russia is capable of settling its relations with Estonia by itself. However, Russia welcomes it when other states help in resolving problems, as happened during the talks with Latvia. Carl Bildt and the leaders of other countries played a positive role in achieving a compromise. Andrey Kozyrev called attention to the fact that after the withdrawal of troops from the Baltic states, the question of observing CSCE norms and international standards in the sphere of human rights will remain urgent. We consider, the minister said, that Sweden and other states are not extraneous to this question. We are against human rights' problems being turned into just bilateral questions. Russia, Kozyrev noted, favours setting up in the Council of cooperation of Baltic Sea states the post of commissioner for human rights and ethnic minorities who would have quite a lot of work to do in the Baltic region. Speaking of links with Sweden, Andrey Kozyrev described these relations as good. The Swedes, he said, display a business-like approach in partnership within the framework of the CSCE and at a regional level.
