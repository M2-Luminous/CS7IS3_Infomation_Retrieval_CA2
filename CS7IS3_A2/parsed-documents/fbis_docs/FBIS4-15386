Speaker of the upper chamber Vladimir Shumeyko said that this ends the dispute over the prosecutor general. The Federation Council snubbed the Russian president on Thursday by reinstating Kazannik as the prosecutor general which it could not do as Kazannik was not nominated by Boris Yeltsin. According to the Constitution, it is the Federation Council which appoints the prosecutor, but the candidate is to be nominated by the president. Kazannik resigned after freeing anti-Yeltsin rebels according to the Duma-proclaimed amnesty and Yeltsin accepted his resignation. The president then appointed Alexey Ilyushenko as acting prosecutor general. After the Federation Council refused to sack Kazannik, Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin's aide, said the decision did not mean that he would be reinstated. Ilyushenko would remain acting prosecutor general, according to him. Most observers said the decision of the upper chamber was based on political grounds, not on juridical ones.
