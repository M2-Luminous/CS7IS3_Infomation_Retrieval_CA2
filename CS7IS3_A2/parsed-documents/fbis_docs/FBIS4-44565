Comprehensive inspection, readjustment, and checking of the generator's equipment and system states led to the generator's performance in every phase attaining its design requirements. At 1915 hours on 25 March 1994, the No. 2 generator attained full power for the first time. During the process of debugging operations, the Guangdong Electric Power Industry Corporation, Hong Kong's Zhonghua Electric Power Company, and Guangzhou Pumped-Storage Power Plant provided substantial support and coordination. This was especially true of the Guangdong Power Grid and the Hong Kong Zhonghua Electric Power Company's Jiulong [Kowloon] Power Grid, which, under the difficult conditions of a valley in electric power demand during the spring season, carefully arranged for the grid connection plan and guaranteed that the debugging of the No. 2 generator proceeded smoothly. According to the original debugging plan, the No. 2 generator will continue operating in a full-power state and, after undergoing all types of performance tests, demonstration operation, and maintenance work, will be placed into commercial operation.
