But the Region's Electric Power Supply System Is Under Threat"] [Text] The report about an emergency shutdown of the fourth power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant, which was carried by news agencies and Russian television on 4 May, is not true. At any rate this is what Georgiy Kaurov, chief of the Atomic Energy Ministry information administration, said. In a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent, he explained that the planned shutdown of the power bloc to replace spent fuel cells occurred much earlier -- on 29 April -- and did not have any bearing on any emergency situation. Nonetheless, this interest in the shutdown of yet another power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant has been aroused not only by the Chernobyl syndrome. The power plant produces 60-70 percent of the Kola peninsula's electric power. The second and third power units were shut down for emergency repair even earlier. Presently, only the first power unit -- the oldest one, which was put into operation back in 1973 -- is operating at its design capacity (440 megawatts). This power unit was involved in what was probably the most serious accident at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant: on 2 February 1993, a hurricane broke the supply of external electric energy; two emergency diesels units that powered cooling system pumps were also put out of action. For two and a half hours the reactor was cooled by the natural circulation of water in the circuits. In terms of security, the current situation at the power plant is not comparable with that one, but not so in terms of the threat posed to the region's electric power potential. The situation has been exacerbated by perennial failures of consumers to repay debts. Last September they nearly caused a shutdown of the nuclear power plant and a disconnection of debtors from their power supply.
