He reported that the president met last night with congressional party leaders, but the national defense issue was not even mentioned. President Franco never considered resorting to the constitutional instrument of declaring a state of national defense to solve the political crisis with Congress and the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. This was stated by Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa, who added that reports indicating that the state of defense decree is supposedly already lying on the president's desk are false. The situation in the country is entirely normal, he added. The subject was not even mentioned during the meeting held last night in Planalto Palace between President Franco and 13 party leaders. The party leaders guaranteed President Franco that they would not attend the congressional session today to approve Provisional Measure No. 434 on the conversion of salaries into Real Value Units [URV's]. Last night President Franco ordered Fernando Costa to inform the media that the government makes no agreements with the STF, that the president of the Republic will not disrespect the law and the Constitution, and that the day for converting public employees' salaries into URV's is the 30th of each month, and not 20th as the STF wants.
