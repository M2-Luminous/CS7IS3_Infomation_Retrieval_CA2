Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski took part in the meeting, which ended in the early hours of the morning. [Correspondent Witold Orzech] The trade unionists have sent a letter to Trade and Industry Minister Marek Pol, registering their vote of no-confidence in the boards of all coal companies. They think that the boards are not coping with the current situation. The Miners Solidarity has also called on the minister to take measures aimed at removing the causes of conflicts and tensions in the mining industry. The hard-coal miners' assessment of the agreement between their colleagues in the lignite-mining industry and the government was sceptical. They adopted a resolution that the strike at 16 hard-coal mines in Katowice province and three zinc and lead mines should continue. Karol Luzniak, the hard-coal section chairman, announced that miners from several other mines will join the strike starting at 0600. Marian Krzaklewski expressed the hope that the national industrial action starting today will prove successful for both Solidarity and the government, that the strike will make the government understand that it should not aim at confrontation with the union. As a result, when the government finally comes to understand this, [Finance Minister] Mr. Kolodko will have not 60 but 120 or more days of peace, Marian Krzaklewski said. He did not rule out the possibility of using the strike fund for payouts to strike participants.
