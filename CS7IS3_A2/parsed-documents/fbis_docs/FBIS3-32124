[Cavagnari] The current investment in the military area is 0.5 percent of the GDP, and it is believed that this is not enough to maintain a military force with satisfactory operational capabilities. Now that the Armed Forces' reorganization and the updating of its equipment with new technology have been proposed, that percentage should be increased to 2 percent of the GDP if possible. It is made clear, however, that this gradual increase over five years must not obstruct social priorities. [Neri] Does the PT hopes to restart all the military programs? [Cavagnari] Of the programs that must be continued, only the nuclear and the Calha Norte programs are considered controversial. The first one is controversial by its own nature; it is the nuclear submarine. The Calha Norte program because it enlarges the military presence in an area sensitive to environmentalists. [sentence as published] But the two programs are necessary for Brazil. I also will propose the continuation of the space, AMX (aircraft), and Antarctic programs. [Neri] Why are the nuclear and Calha Norte programs important? [Cavagnari] In addition to developing scientific and technological training, the nuclear program will give the country the possibility of getting the means (nuclear submarine) for a more effective defense of the maritime border. The Calha Norte program will help reinforce the defense of the northern border region. Currently, both the border region north of Solimoes-Amazonas and the maritime border are the two most sensitive areas of the national territory, and are poorly defended. [Neri] Does the PT hope to create a defense ministry? [Cavagnari] Brazil is the only country in the world that does not have a defense ministry. Its creation aims to guarantee unity for carrying out the defense policy by putting aside the confrontation of the specific interests of each force -- Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is clear that this initiative also will contribute to consolidating the Armed Forces' subordination to the civilian power. There is no doubt that this will contribute to the rational use of the budget based on a single defense policy. [Neri] How are the Armed Forces behaving in the current political crisis in the country? [Cavagnari] They have had exemplary behavior. They made an explicit declaration that they will make the greatest effort not to run away from democracy. [Neri] With the end of the national security doctrine and the cold war, does the Armed Forces have enemies now? [Cavagnari] Brazil is a country that has threats, no question about it. But the threats are to the environment, to biodiversity. There is no doubt that the obstructions to Brazil having access to advanced technology are threats to national interests. But they are threats that do not justify the use of force. What happens is that those that threaten have a military capability so disproportional in relation to us that we cannot consider it a threat that must be eliminated by force. [Neri] Do you believe a better use of the Armed Forces could be made to prevent them from being inactive? [Cavagnari] The Armed Forces must be used for what they were created for -- that is, national defense. They must be prepared and trained for that. This does not prevent them, however, from cooperating under certain circumstances in other nonmilitary activities. They can be used at certain times, under certain critical situations, even in public security. They can be used in the construction of roads and dams but not as part of their main activities but as a complement, as simple civil cooperation. [Neri] What is the current profile of Brazilian officers? [Cavagnari] In technical terms our officers are well prepared. Unfortunately, we are experiencing difficulties and even the development of that training is jeopardized. In terms of political thoughts, I would say that Brazilian officers are evolving, maturing. They are losing some authoritarian way of thinking in Brazil and they already are admitting that Brazil must be thought of within the framework of democracy. [Neri] Do you think the officers are currently more democratic? [Cavagnari] I would say there are increasingly more officers who accept democracy. Those who do not accept democracy, those who are authoritarian by nature, are becoming a minority among the military. [Neri] Some Armed Forces members oppose the demarcation of Indian reserves. What do you think of this? [Cavagnari] They react because of the size of the land granted to the Indians. They react because they cannot accept that Indian lands do not allow a military presence in them. They cannot accept that national sovereignty cannot be exercised on these lands. They are right, especially regarding border areas. [Neri] What do you think must be modified in the Constitution regarding the Armed Forces? [Cavagnari] We must eliminate the words "law and order." The Armed Forces should only defend the fatherland and the government powers. In the case of national defense, the objects of defense are the national territory and interests. Within the constitutional order the objects of defense are the political institutions of a democratic state of law. The reference to order (foreseen in the current Constitution) allows the government to use the Armed Forces against any law-threatening movement, sometimes, unjustifiably. [Neri] Is there less Armed Forces resistance to an eventual triumph by da Silva? Is there any risk of insubordination? [Cavagnari] There is no risk of insubordination in case of his triumph. Da Silva's acceptance rate is increasing while the rate of rejection is decreasing. He has an acceptance rate higher than in 1989. [Neri] Why have you joined the PT? [Cavagnari] I have been cooperating with the PT since 1987. In 1989, when da Silva ran in a second round of voting, I was invited, together with other people, to prepare a draft of the PT's policy for the military. I maintained that contact. I have not officially joined any party, but among all the Brazilian political parties, I prefer the PT. I agree with many of its policies and disagree with a few others. [Neri] What are the issues you disagree with? [Cavagnari] I do not favor nationalizations as much as other PT groups. I do not defend government monopoly as much as other PT groups do. As for foreign capital, I am a bit more liberal than other PT groups. Curriculum Vitae Complete name: Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho Born: 21 August 1934 in Paranagua, Parana.
