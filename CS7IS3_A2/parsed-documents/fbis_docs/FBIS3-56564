In an interview with the news agency BELINFORM, Kebich said that "on the contrary, (Belarus's) more modern fixed assets than in Russia, highly skilled labour, and well developed transportation and industrial infrastructure will ensure that the merger of the two monetary systems will become a long-term condition of the stabilisation of the common currency." The announcement followed a statement by former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two systems is detrimental to Russia. Kebich believes that the dispute is caused by "the very monetary approach towards complex economic processes in the economy of the transitional period. Certain circles are tossing up an idea that only a monetary system can affect the economy, while ignoring other factors which are equally important." Speaking about inflation in Belarus, Kebich stressed that the devaluation of the Belarusian coupons is partly caused by the huge debts of Russian consumers to Belarusian enterprises, as well as by a big discrepancy between energy prices in the two republics. Earlier today Belarusian First Vice-Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich said that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is beneficial to both republics. The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in progress during the entire last year. On many of them agreements have been reached. "We are working within the framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy," Myasnikovich said. He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary policies in CIS states. In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been completed.
