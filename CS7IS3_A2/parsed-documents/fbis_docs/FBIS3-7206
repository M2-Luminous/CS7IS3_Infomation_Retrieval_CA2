IAEA Director General Hans Blix, whose inspectors visited North Korea from March 3 to 14, urged the Security Council to encourage North Korea to accept a short-term inspection to accomplish that goal. British UN Envoy David Hannay indicated that the council members would respond positively to Blix's recommendation, telling reporters it remains important that the IAEA complete its inspections as originally intended. The members were expected to confer on a draft resolution calling on North Korea to permit the inspections to be completed. Blix briefed the council on North Korea's recent refusal of inspection of a key facility at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, which he said increased suspicion of its intentions. IAEA inspectors were denied permission to collect samples at a radiochemical laboratory to help them determine whether reprocessing activities occurred there, which could imply diversion of plutonium for military use. North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang, in a broadcast monitored in Tokyo on Friday, blasted the IAEA for adopting a resolution at its recent board of governors meeting referring the issue back to the UN Security Council for actions that could include sanctions. Quoting from a statement issued Thursday by a spokesman for the General Department of Nuclear Energy, it warned that if the IAEA does not immediately retract the resolution then North Korea "will be left with no other choice but to take practical measures commensurate with the widening partiality of the agency." The statement said North Korea is under no international legal obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections since it now has a "special status" by virtue of its temporary suspension of an earlier declaration of intent to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It insisted that the latest IAEA inspection "was enough to fully confirm that nuclear materials has not been diverted."
