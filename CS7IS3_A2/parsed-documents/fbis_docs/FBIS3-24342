Finoheyev, candidate of technical sciences, H. Bodner, candidate of economic sciences, V. Kolesnyk (Simferopol): "The Current State of and Prospects for Employment of Repatriated Crimean Tatar Population"] [Text] The Republic of Crimea has elected the path of introducing radical changes in the socioeconomic life of its population. The development of the resort and recreational, agricultural, and industrial complexes, as well as the service industry, are under way, and the region's productive forces are growing. The degree to which these resources are utilized fully and effectively, especially the republic's manpower resources, will greatly determine the future development of the region. The transition to market relations has ushered in certain changes in the situation. Some branches of the Crimean economy are still experiencing a manpower shortage, but, at the same time, there is a growing reduction in labor forces both in the sphere of material production and in a number of branches of the nonproductive sectors. In addition, the employment problem is being exacerbated by the return to Crimea, their historical homeland, of the Crimean Tatars and citizens of other nationalities. The attempt to solve problems associated with the return of deported citizens and providing them with jobs is encountering many difficulties caused by a large number of economic, social, demographic, psychological, and other factors. In particular, data on the labor potential of the citizens who have returned from their place of residence in deportation is either lacking or needs to be more precise. It is important both in qualitative and quantitative terms to determine trends in changes in this population's structure and reproduction. All this creates a need for more intensive scientific study of the problems pertaining to the utilization of human resources and the creation of new economic, legal, and organizational forms and methods of providing the population with jobs. In view of this, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian Scientific-Research Institute of Labor of the Ministry of Labor of Ukraine and the Committee for the Affairs of Deported Nationalities of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea are jointly conducting scientific studies for the purpose of finding ways to solve the task of utilizing the labor of deported citizens who have returned. This article does not examine the question of employment as it relates to all deported peoples who have returned to the peninsula, but only as it relates to citizens of Crimean Tatar nationality, who predominate among the returnees (91%). The Crimean peninsula has attracted many tribes and peoples since ancient times. The population of the Crimea has never been ethnically homogeneous. Diverse ethnic communities formed and coexisted here for many centuries. According to the census conducted in April 1921, the Crimean Tatars made up 25.9% of the Crimea's total population of 721,000. Although by the beginning of 1939, the number of Crimean Tatars had grown to 218,000, their proportion to the total population of the Crimea fell to 19.4%. In prewar 1940, the number of residents of Crimean Tatar nationality totalled 220,000. The peoples of the Crimea were harshly tested by their common struggle against fascist aggression. During these same years, beginning with August 1941, 50,000 German residents of the peninsula were resettled inland, and in May 1944, 188,000 Crimean Tatars were deported to the eastern regions of the USSR. Somewhat later, 14,000 Greeks, 12,000 Bulgarians, and 11,000 Armenians were also deported. The obvious outcome of this was that there were virtually no Crimean Tatars in the Crimea in the years following the war. Only since 1967 did Crimean Tatar families begin returning to the Crimean Oblast as part of an organized resettlement. This process progressed slowly and was not consistent in nature. The years 1987 to 1989 were characterized by intensified migration of Crimean Tatars to the Crimea, primarily from the Central Asian republics. In the ten years between two censuses (1979-1989), the Crimean Tatar population in the Crimea increased by 33,000 and reached 39,400 [as published] persons to constitute 1.6\52000060100f the total population of the Crimea. The year 1989 marked the beginning of a mass return of this deported people. Between 1990 and 1992, 134,000 Crimean Tatars returned to their homeland, and the total number of citizens of Crimean Tatar nationality living the Crimea reached 204,000 or 7.7% of the peninsula's total population (see table). It is difficult to predict how the process of repatriation of this deported people will proceed, inasmuch as there is no exact figure indicating the number of Crimean Tatars expected to return. Existing data are of a contradictory nature. Moreover, they are founded more on emotion than on well-considered estimates. The majority of those who have returned reside in Crimea's rural districts and have begun to build homes. Many of them work in various spheres of the national economy and are engaged in socially useful work. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Dynamics of the Size of the Crimean Tatar Population According to Data | |from Censuses, Archival Documents, and Literary Sources (at the beginning | |of 1993) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Size of population (thousands) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Years |Total |Including Crimean |2000060100f total number | | | |Tatars | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1897 |546.6 |186.2 |34.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1921 |720.8 |186.7 |25.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1939 |1,123.8 |218.2 |19.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1940 |1,169.2 |220.0 |18.8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1970 |1,813.5 |2.0 |0.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1979 |2,135.9 |5.4 |0.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |2,455.0 |38.4 |1.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |2,458.6 |70.0 |2.8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |2,549.8 |113.0 |4.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |2,599.8 |154.0 |5.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |2,639.1 |204.0 |7.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The legislative acts and decisions relating to various aspects of the repatriation of the Crimean Tatars attest that a certain amount of attention has been devoted to the problem of restoring the constitutional rights of deported peoples and to the return of the Crimean Tatars to their homeland. The implementation of these directives has produced a number of positive features: -- a Plan for the Settlement and Employment of Crimean Tatars in the Crimea has been worked out; -- the rayons of Crimean Tatar settlement and the yearly quotas for their distribution have been defined for the years 1991-95; accordingly, a Plan for the Distribution of Productive Forces has been drafted, the number of needed jobs calculated, and the necessary social and consumer infrastructure determined; -- restrictions on residence permits for Crimean Tatars have been lifted; -- plots of land for building individual houses are being allotted; -- the following enterprises have been created to provide jobs for Crimean Tatars: a) two state farms: the Ahrarnyy State Farm in Pervomayske and the Vodopiynyy State Farm in Chornomorske rayons; b) two collective farms: the Avdet Collective Farm in Rozdolne and the Batan Collective Farm in Lenine rayons; c) the Krymahrospetsbud-2 trust and the BPMK [expansion not given] in Simferopol and the PMK [Mobile Mechanized Column] in Yevpatoriya; d) the Berekety agrofirm in Simferopol; e) the Seltemp building association and seven small enterprises (Simferopol, Bakhchysaray, Yalta, Krasnoperekopsk); -- construction is under way of a pedagogical school to train elementary school teachers of Crimean Tatar nationality; -- one of the deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea is a Crimean Tatar; there is a Crimean Tatar deputy to the Crimean Supreme Council; -- law enforcement organs, statistical institutions, and other organizations have lately begun to devote serious attention to repatriation affairs. The Ministry of Labor of Ukraine is financing scientific-research projects studying the employment of Crimean Tatars in the economy of the Crimea. All these things will undoubtedly produce an effect in the near future with respect to solving questions pertaining to raising the living standard and providing jobs for Crimean Tatars. Still, despite the work that has already been done in the realm of resolving the problem of the return and settlement of the Crimean Tatars, a number of measures outlined in the directives remain unimplemented. National employment policy is formulated at the state level, and its objective is to guarantee equal job opportunities for all citizens of the state, irrespective of nationality and place of residence. The processes of privatization, destatization, and development of various forms of ownership that are under way are producing a growing shift of blue- and white-collar workers from state-owned enterprises, institutions, and organizations to collectively owned entities and into the sphere of private enterprise. This movement of labor reserves requires state regulation and the safeguarding of social guarantees for citizens. There are now manpower reserves in the cities of the Crimea. As a result, the problem of jobs for the population is becoming increasingly acute. In light of this situation, the interdependence between the interests of society and those of the individual is very important. It should also be kept in mind that at this stage of the development of the Crimea's economy, a number of factors that complicate the placement of laid-off and unemployed workers will have a perceptible negative effect. One such factor is the increase in labor resources owing to the return of the Crimean Tatars. That is why those government organs and their structural subdivisions that deal with matters of employment have a special task: to assist citizens in exercising their right to work more rapidly and in filling the demand for manpower; creating new jobs; providing support in the job market for those categories of citizens who are poorly protected (young people, women who are raising children, persons approaching retirement age, invalids); preventing a high unemployment rate and alleviating the negative effects of unemployment. In order to study the composition of the returning able-bodied population by sex, age, educational level, and professional skills, as well as to discover the principal causes of unemployment, to determine the number of people who want to find work as soon as possible and the length of time it takes to find a job, and other data, this study included a survey conducted with the help of a questionnaire administered to both employed and unemployed residents of the Crimea. In April and May of 1993, 1,500 questionnaires were distributed among the Crimean Tatars. In addition, the text of the questionnaire was published in the newspaper YAN"Y DYUN'YA, which appears in the Crimean Tatar language (circulation 15,000). Unfortunately, however, the question of jobs has not yet become a top priority for the Committee [for the Affairs of Deported Nationalities], nor for its local representatives, nor even for the Crimean Tatar people themselves. As a result, by 1 July 1993, we received back only 48 of 1,500 questionnaires and 25 letters in response to the questions published in the newspaper. This insufficiency of data prevented us from compiling a full description of the composition of the returning able-bodied population on the basis of the questionnaires. It was possible to discern only one trend: those who want to return to the Crimea are willing to take any kind of job, while those who have already returned and are now residing in the Crimea, want to find work in the professions they worked in earlier. Since the passage of the Law of the UkrSSR "On the Employment of the Population," the same job placement services as those serving all unemployed citizens have been finding jobs for persons of Crimean Tatar nationality -- in other words, priority is given to their professional qualifications. Another fact that cannot be ignored is that Crimea's labor resources are unequally distributed on a large part of the peninsula. As a result, it is not always possible to take into account the specific features of individual cities, rayons, let alone individual groups of residents, when solving general economic tasks. This, unquestionably, affects employment and creates new problems in the utilization of manpower. Hence, reducing territorial disparities in terms of the employment rate is assuming greater urgency, especially in this phase of Crimean Tatar repatriation and job placement. Equalizing employment rates by territories does not mean establishing absolutely equal indices, but rather ensuring that the demand for jobs among the population is met to an equal degree everywhere. An analysis of Crimean Tatar employment in territorial terms shows that the majority of them work in Crimea's rural districts (85% of the total number of working Crimean Tatars). An analogous indicator characterizing the employment of the total population in the rayons measures 41%. Nearly 7,000 Crimean Tatars are employed in the cities (1.1% of the total number of people working in cities and 15% of the total number of working Crimean Tatars). The reason that such a small number of Crimean Tatars work in resort cities is that fewer members of this ethnic group live in these cities, which, in turn, stems from the fact that they received residence permits much later. Thus, only 19 Crimean Tatars work in Yalta and 148 in Alushta. An analysis by the republic's rayons indicates that the overwhelming majority of Crimean Tatars works in Bilohirsk Rayon. Here, the Crimean Tatars account for 2.5% of the total number of those employed in the Crimea, while the analogous indicator for the Crimean Tatar population measures 10.2%. Many Crimean Tatars also work in the Krasnohvardiyske (7.5% of the total number of employed Crimean Tatars), Dzhankoy (7.4%), Kirovske (7.1%), Saky (6.9%), and Bakhchysaray (6.8%) rayons. A study of Crimean Tatar employment by branches of the economy showed that the largest number of Crimean Tatars are employed in the republic's agricultural sector -- 26,700 of 46,000 persons, or 58.1%. Many Crimean Tatars work in the health care field (3,200 or 7.0%) and in industry (2,600 or 5.8%). On the average, the predominating fields in which Crimean Tatars are employed in the cities are industry (16.7% of the total number of Crimean Tatars employed in cities), transport (16.4%), construction (13.8%), and health care (13.4%). As we know, an increase in the size of the able-bodied population produces the need for a corresponding increase in jobs. This will not pose a problem in areas of compact Crimean Tatar settlement, where the development of agricultural production, as well as of the processing and other industries and of construction, will proceed hand in hand with the development of a social infrastructure, which will create jobs in the fields of public education, medicine, culture, and art. A significant portion of those engaged in intellectual work who settled in the cities and large population centers (especially resort centers) is encountering difficulties in finding work. This problem as regards this and other forms of employment will continue to worsen as the construction of housing is completed and the need to provide jobs for a large number of Crimean Tatars grows. In all probability, the process of economic stabilization will take a long time, and the unemployment rate will rise. Engineering and technical personnel and white-collar workers are already encountering difficulties in finding jobs. As a rule, they will be forced to undergo retraining and change their professions. The number of unemployed in the job market will also increase in large measure on account of the Crimean Tatars. The problem of providing jobs for Crimean Tatars can be largely solved by compact settlement. These are the regions where the necessary enterprises should be established and new jobs created. Consequently, the priority directions should be: -- utilizing existing employment reserves, that is, filling vacancies and jobs where possible; -- developing a social infrastructure in the areas of Crimean Tatar settlement, which includes: a) meeting the needs of the population for retail services, public catering, and consumer services, and ensuring that the number of these meet the necessary standards; b) expanding and rebuilding a functional network of preschool institutions, general-education schools (where necessary -- in the native language), and medical, cultural, and artistic establishments; -- increasing the production capacities of construction organizations and enterprises manufacturing building materials; -- intensifying the development of agriculture and organizing a modern base for preserving and processing production; creating the necessary conditions for the effective utilization of Crimean Tatar labor in the agroindustrial complex, raising their interest in the results of their work, taking stock of and applying the national skills of the Crimean Tatars in the development of traditional occupations -- vegetable growing, tobacco cultivation, orcharding, viticulture, sheep breeding, horse breeding (mainly in areas of compact settlement); promoting the development of subsidiary, private farm, and leased farm enterprises; -- promoting greater specialization in the light and food industries and increasing the output of these industries to the level needed to meet popular demand; -- developing (along with state ownership) and strengthening of collective, joint-stock, cooperative, and other forms of ownership; -- stimulating the growth of enterprises with any form of ownership that are engaged in providing various services to the population; -- increasing the level of economic development in a number of rayons located in the steppe region of the peninsula by increasing the number of ettlements and developing a production infrastructure and new agroindustrial complexes in them; -- reviving national folk crafts, etc. In order to alleviate the unfavorable economic and demographic situation, increase the employment rate, and improve the effectiveness with which labor potential is utilized, we feel that we can recommend to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea that it pass a resolution granting the right to all citizens who possess a Crimean residence permit to obtain employment at any enterprise in the Crimea regardless of place of residence. An investigation of such a complex and many-sided subject cannot pretend to offer a comprehensive analysis of the questions studied, nor guarantee the accuracy of its conclusions. Some proposals have been put forward as subjects for further discussion. In addition, future studies need to be adjusted to take into account the time that has passed and the practical materials that have been gathered.
