FR940114-0-00008 FR940114-0-00003 Similarly, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Belgium into the United States as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced in the world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest or FMD exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Belgium does not currently export casein to the United States. Consequently, we believe that declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and FMD will have no significant effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States. The effect of declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen will probably also be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen exports totalled $46.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and $89,000, respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Belgium, we believe that due to the relatively small size of the Belgium market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Belgium will have a minimal impact on the United States market. Five United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration standards (they have fewer than 100 employees), have expressed interest in importing bovine embryos and semen from Belgium. APHIS expects the value of the anticipated imports to be minimal in comparison to the domestic production of these entities. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
