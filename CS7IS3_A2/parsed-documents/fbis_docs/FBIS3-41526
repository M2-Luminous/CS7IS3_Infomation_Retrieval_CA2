The Vienna Convention provides a framework containing an agreement in principle to cooperate in protection of the ozone layer and the Montreal Protocol classifies actions to phase out the ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons, CFC, by the end of this century. As a party to the protocol, Myanmar will be spared from the trade restrictions imposed by the protocol and will be allowed to import controlled substances within a 10-year grace period for limited domestic use for refrigeration and air conditioning. Additionally, the protocol will provide Myanmar assistance to obtain ozone friendly technology and financial assistance to affect the necessary readjustment. Furthermore, Myanmar's accession to these important instruments underlines its commitment and responsibility to protect the global environment. Since the establishment of the National Commission for Environmental Affairs in February 1990, the Union of Myanmar signed in June 1992 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.
