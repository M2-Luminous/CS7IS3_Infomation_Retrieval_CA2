This seems to be the opinion of the Alliance for Overall Germany -- Voters Association of East Germans, Central, and West Germans (BGD) [Bund fuer Gesamtdeutschland -- Ostdeutsche, Mittel, und Westdeutsche Waehlergemeinschaft], which has its seat in Duisburg. Thus, it considers unification with the former GDR just one step on the path toward the creation of "Overall Germany," which would include, among other areas, Memelland, Eastern Prussia, Gdansk, Pommerania, Western Prussia, Eastern Brandenburg, Silesia, and the Sudeten region. "German Reich Continues To Exist" The BGD basic program says it clearly: "The German Reich did not cease to exist as a subject of international law in 1945. It simply lost its ability to to act as a result of military occupation." At the federal party congress in Miltenberg in April 1993, the strictly rightist splinter party hungered for retaliation: "The annexation of foreign territory and the driving of people away from their homes" must be "made good again" because it is a "most serious strain on any community of peoples," a "crime." However, things have not yet gone that far. Therefore, the BGD is smelling betrayal of the people and hostile lobbyists at the levers of power in our country. The basic program whines about the destruction of the "cultural and ethnic identity of the German people" by "multicultural changes." In the party newsletter (the new title: UNSERE DEUTSCHE HEIMAT [OUR GERMAN HOMELAND]), BGD Chairman Horst Zaborowski throws another piece of wood on the fire: "Not once in our 2,000-year-old history," he complains, "has the simultaneous foreign rule over the German people in its material and intellectual substance been achieved as perfectly as in our days." At the end of 1993, in the same newsletter, the 67-year-old ex-businessman added to his views. In his article "Freedom for Germany," he emphatically called for "getting rid of the restrictions that have been imposed on the German people since 1945." In Zaborowski's view, the fact that "for the last 45 years," German history "has been limited to the period from 1933 to 1945 and, in the process, has been distorted" is due to the "biggest manipulation in human history." "Sheep on the EC Pasture" The process leading toward the European Union (EU) is a thorn in the side of Zaborowski and his followers. Even though the BGD is running in this year's elections to the European Parliament, it categorically demands Germany's departure from the European Union (Zaborowski: "conceived as a prison for our German people"). It fits into the picture when, in a memorandum to the members, retired priest Walter Fischer from Sangershausen smells a "new conspiracy against Germany": "From the inside by the controlled media, from the outside by constantly reminding us Germans of the brown [fascist] period and degrading us to humble sheep on the EC pasture." However, the theologian seems to like being reminded of his eight years in the "Hitler Youth." These years "gave me, who was permitted to become a soldier because of a cardiac defect, much of what I wish with all my heart for our poor, misguided rock and pop youth -- namely, love for my homeland, discipline, comradeliness, courage, and idealism." It also fits the picture when the BGD organ UNSERE DEUTSCHE HEIMAT makes propaganda for maps produced by Publishing House for Folklore and Research Into Contemporary History [Verlag fuer Volkstum und Zeitgeschichtsforschung] in Vlotho. Its owner, Udo Walendy, is a former Bundestag candidate of the NPD [National Democratic Party] and already belonged to the NPD Presidium at a time when this right-wing extremist party had just been established in 1964. In his publishing company, Walendy has published, among others, the book The Auschwitz Lie by Nazi propagandist Thies Christophersen. Rhyming Racial Teachings The BDG organ has also printed poems by Renate Schuette, who has repeatedly published her effusions in papers of the terrorist FAP [Liberal Workers Party]. In her collection of verse, entitled Racial Teachings, it says: "Tempting someone to mix races/is large-scale genocide/Many proud empires have died early/when they succumbed to this mania." [German-language original rhymes] There are also links with the monthly DER SCHEINWERFER. In a 1990 study conducted by the Protestant Students' Community in Bonn, the paper is accused of containing "anti-Semitic, racist, revisionist, and antidemocratic articles." Among the permanent employees of the editorial office, one finds Siegfried Neubacher, BGD district chairman of Upper Franken and candidate in the elections to the European Parliament. Neubacher's Bavarian land association is headed by Mathias Weifert, 33 and a representative of the younger generation, who is studying sociology with Professor Lothar Bossle in Wuerzburg. Bossle, a former confidant of Franz Josef Strauss [late Bavarian minister-president], moves in BGD circles and is a very controversial man because of his dubious connections with the military dictatorship in Chile and the Mun Sect. However, Bossle is still suitable as a conservative pretense for the BGD, which is rolling about in brownish waters.
