Laar said that Russian MPs have been very active at a parliamentary seminar in Helsinki on Russia's chances of becoming a member of the Council which "demonstrates extraordinary interest in obtaining the status of full member", Laar said. "Such interest is very positive from our standpoint as the Council of Europe has unanimously accepted an attitude that Russia cannot become a full member before its troops are withdrawn from the Baltic states completely and without conditions," Laar stressed. He also added that even if a member country should make any amendments to the stipulation, Estonia would not change its views. "It has been clearly said in the Council of Europe that as long as Russia continues talking about seizing other countries and pursues the near-abroad policy, Russia's becoming a member of the Council is hopeless," Laar said while adding that as any decision needs to be passed under consensus, "even one is a soldier on the battlefield". Only today, the Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who is a member of the Russian delegation said that Estonia would soon be reabsorbed by Russia, REUTERS reported from Helsinki.
