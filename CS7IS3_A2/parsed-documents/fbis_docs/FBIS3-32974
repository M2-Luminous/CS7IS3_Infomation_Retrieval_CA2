The king of laundry has landed in Argentina. With $40 million tucked under its arm, the Italian firm Antonio Merloni SPA, a world leader in the production of household appliances, has just entered a joint venture with the local company Adzen SA in order to establish itself in the country. The company has two plants in Italy: one in Ancona and another in Peruggia, where 1.5 million washing machines and 700,000 refrigerators are produced. And now Merloni has decided to establish itself in Moreno, Buenos Aires, where it will build a 40,000-square-meter plant on a 13-hectare lot. Indeed, the Merloni Company has no small ambitions. It plans to produce 450,000 washing machines annually, which, according to market studies, would exceed the annual national demand. Here are the facts for a business which moves more than $150 million annually. In 1992, there were 280,000 washing machines sold throughout the country, a volume surpassed in 1993 by the sale of 340,000 units.
