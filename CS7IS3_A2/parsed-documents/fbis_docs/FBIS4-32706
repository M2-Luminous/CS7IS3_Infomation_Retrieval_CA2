He made this statement just when mutual dialogue for solving the Greek-Macedonian dispute had started in New York. Taking over the wheel of the Greek Government, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou strongly accused his predecessor for accepting such discussions, and he threatened to break them off unless Macedonia changed its name. To show how resolute he was to break "Skopje," and thus force it into unilateral concessions, he imposed an economic blockade, believing that this was the way to provide an excuse for breaking off the dialogue. Strongly affected and damaged, the Macedonian side clearly stated that it would not accept any further negotiations under the Greek embargo. At the same time, there was a constant inflow of information from New York and Washington that negotiations had not actually been broken off and that we might even expect some good progress soon. All this indicates that, unlike the violent propaganda confrontations between the two states, their diplomats were clandestinely doing their jobs. That was something that encouraged and pleased us within the overall situation. Regardless of mutual relations, the misunderstandings, threats, and conditioning, dialogue is indispensable, we might say unavoidable, and it represents the only way to overcome problems between two states. Malice, blindness, and egoism in policy usually causes damage to one's self if reality is ignored. In this case, that is exactly what dictates policies and it does not admit speculation and bluffing. The fact that the Republic of Macedonia is an independent and sovereign state, a member of the United Nations, building relations with all its neighbors in a democratic manner cannot be easily ignored or repudiated. It is also a fact that Macedonia and Greece, as the closest neighbors, cannot go on living in isolation and antagonism, because otherwise they will contradict their official proclamations advocating new relations in the Balkans, such as good neighborly relations, open borders, mutual confidence, and respect. Because of all this there is no other alternative for Macedonia and Greece but to accept and respect European standards in constructing mutual confidence. Anything else would mean the continuation of the Cold War, which, unfortunately, is still widely accepted in the Balkans. In this context, the pressure of the international community and the United Nations aims at a more rapid normalization of relations as a precondition for a wider stabilization of the region. The main question is: How can this be achieved? Normally, the international community would not like to take over the role of an outside arbitrator and judge of who is right and what should be done, but prefers to leave it up to the two sides to search for the most suitable solutions through direct mutual negotiations. However, it is doing its best to prevent either of the two sides from cheating, damaging, or doing injustices to the other. It does not want either of the two to feel like a winner or a loser, but that there is a genuinely acceptable formula for the two sides. The mediating activities of the international community are aimed in this direction and its assistance is of enormous importance. If this approach toward the solution of the Macedonia-Greek dispute is accepted, there are no grounds for any versions or claims about instant recipes for the settlement of the dispute, that is, there are no precise proposals about the name, the flag, or other issues on which the Macedonian side is allegedly expected to take a stance. The aims of Greek propaganda are impossible to accept, we can even say they are cliches. They are trying to create an impression that the whole dispute is over these problems and that Macedonia is the one that should demonstrate good will, after which Greece will decide what it can and what it cannot accept. It is indicative that so far all such speculations and alleged proposals were designed by the Athens media. Or, as they say, like a hungry chick dreaming of corn. It seems that Macedonia's tentative diplomacy shares the responsibility for this impression, because it does not want to be involved in such speculations and it does not have time properly to expound its own position regarding the negotiations and the real essence of the dispute. It could do so and thus eliminate the doubts and misunderstandings that worry part of the Macedonian public. In the absence of complete information on what the negotiations are about, bombarded by the abundant Greek propaganda, our public, as well as some opposition parties, are convinced that secret negotiations are being held and that Macedonia's national and state interests are being betrayed. This is particularly related to the change of the name and the state's symbols, and the top Macedonian leadership is being accused of making concessions "to someone, somewhere." In a word, there is an impression that the complex dispute consists exclusively of Greek demands, and the outcome of this Macedonian-Greek dispute will depend on whether or not these demands are met. It is not taken into account that the Macedonian position is not to negotiate issue by issue on Greece's desires and claims, but wants to put it together as a package, dealing with all the issues that can contribute to the normalization of relations, which would ultimately open a space for overcoming individiual disputed questions. This agreement, it was affirmed, would be based on the principles of the German-Polish agreement after the World War II, tracing the long-term development of mutual relations and a global respect for the interests of the two states. Naturally, other questions would be discussed within this framework, and Athens has been avoiding them like the very devil, being related to various discriminatory measures and laws toward Macedonia. These measures are anachronisms in the international legal system. This is the only approach that provides opportunities for getting out of the current dead end, which has been created by senseless demands that can by no international standards or principles be subject to negotiation between the two states. Only by a full and principled establishment of overall relations and by creating a real climate of confidence and mutual respect can the current Greek- Macedonian dispute be solved to the satisfaction of the two states, which coincides with the efforts of the international community and its mediating endeavors. There remains the hope that Greece and Macedonia will find the strength and wisdom to fight for a model that will open up new perspectives in their mutual relations, and also in Balkan relations in general.
