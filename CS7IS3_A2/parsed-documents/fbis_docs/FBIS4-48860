A report from the Liberian capital Monrovia said Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo faction of the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] is planning to launch a Muslim holy war in Liberia and turn the country into an Islamic state. The report said Koromah has mandated a delegation of the Mandingo faction currently touring Islamic states in the West African subregion to seek support for the venture. Koromah's delegation has already met Nigerian authorities on the replacement of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, General Inienger, with a Muslim. ULIMO's representative to the Transitional Legislative Assembly, Mr. Morris Dukuly, is heading the delegation which is lobbying for the waging of the Jihad War in Liberia. At the same time, the Liberia Council of Churches has called on an emergency meeting of its members to discuss the Alhaji Koromah's faction plan in Monrovia. The Liberia Council of Churches has condemned such an intent by the Koromah Mandingo faction and called for strong resistance to it.
