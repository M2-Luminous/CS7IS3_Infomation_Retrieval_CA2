SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. The Company was a savings and loan holding company whose primary asset and source of income was the United Savings Association of Texas (``USAT''). As a result of the recession in Texas beginning in 1986, USAT's financial condition deteriorated, and on December 30, 1988 it was placed into receivership. The assets of USAT were sold to an unaffiliated third party and the Company received no consideration for the loss of its primary subsidiary, thereby generating a substantial tax loss. In light of this tax loss, the Company determined not to liquidate, but instead to acquire an operating business. 2. The Company's efforts to acquire an operating business have been substantially hindered due to claims asserted against it by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (the ``FSLIC'') and its successor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ``FDIC''), which term as used herein includes the FSLIC. The FDIC asserted an approximately $534 million claim against the Company in January 1989 for failure to maintain the net worth of USAT (the ``Net Worth Claim'') and an approximately $14 million claim concerning certain tax refunds alleged to have been received by the Company (together with the Net Worth Claim, the ``FDIC Claims''). In addition, the FDIC has asserted the existence of possible other claims (the ``Indemnified Claims'') against the Company and certain former officers and directors of the Company and USAT. The Company may have indemnification obligations to these former officers and directors. The FDIC has not alleged a dollar amount for any Indemnified Claims. Although the Company disputes the FDIC Claims and the Indemnified Claims, their existence constitutes a large contingent liability against the Company's assets, thus making it difficult for the Company to acquire an operating business. 3. During 1989 and 1990, the Company was in continuous negotiations with the FDIC in an attempt to reach a resolution of the FDIC Claims and in early 1990 the Company reached a tentative agreement. However, in December 1990 the FDIC rejected the Company's settlement offer and informed the Company that no counter proposal would be offered. In mid-1991, the Company again contacted the FDIC to determine whether a settlement could be reached on the FDIC Claims. Beginning in July 1991, the Company and the FDIC's representatives again began negotiations and in August 1991, the Company offered a proposed settlement. Although the FDIC has not responded to the Company's settlement proposal, in December 1991 the FDIC requested, and the Company provided, an agreement to toll the statute of limitations for the period expiring July 31, 1992. This would give the FDIC adequate time to review any possible claims against the Company that might reflect on a global settlement. This tolling agreement was subsequently extended eleven times, initially through September 30, 1992, then eventually through December 30, 1994. During this tolling period, the Company has engaged in continuous discussions with the FDIC staff and as part of that process has furnished the FDIC with documents and financial records for their review.
