The aircraft in question is the multipurpose light fighter aircraft L-159. A prototype should finished by 1996. According to the military experts, this will contribute to increasing the combat readiness of the Czech Army, and the financial savings are not negligible. The subsonic L-159 aircraft, based on the L-59 type, should be part of our army within four years. It should carry substantially more weaponry in seven holders under the wings. If attacked, it is capable of aerial combat, and it will be equipped with a stronger engine, the U.S. F-124, and other modern systems. The new Czech combat aircraft will be deployed at the tactical air bases in Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou. The need for new aircraft results from the transformation of our Air Force, which will lead to 250 pilots leaving the force and a reduction of military aircraft by more than 30 percent. Of the total of 138 aircraft, 77 combat aircraft are being eliminated. They are mostly older machines, the elimination of which should limit types of aircraft, including the modern MiG-29 aircraft, that are not compatible with the NATO equipment. Moreover, according to Pavel Strubl, the Air Force inspector, operation is very uneconomical because of the small numbers involved. Additional purchases are not planned, and therefore until the reequipment, the Czech Air Force will keep its MiG-21's and MiG-23's, while the void in the fighter force will be filled by the SU-22 and SU-25 fighter bombers. The lifespan of most of these aircraft will expire in the coming years but the Air Force intends to keep them in operation until they are replaced. An acquisition of modern supersonic aircraft is expected after the year 2000.
