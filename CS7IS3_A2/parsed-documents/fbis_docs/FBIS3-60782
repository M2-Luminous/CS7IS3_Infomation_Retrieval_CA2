FRAPH members, accompanied by soldiers in uniform, sought to "avenge" the murder of businessman Issa Paul, treasurer of their organization in Soleil. His burned body was found this morning. FRAPH members burned the houses of people they believe could be linked to Paul's murder. Although it is presumed that there are several dead as a result of the FRAPH attack, Haitian radio only confirmed two. Representatives of FRAPH, an organization that became public when the return of constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was being negotiated, even captured citizens. The soldiers in uniform did not intervene and appeared to be protecting FRAPH members, the radio reported. FRAPH is made up of armed civilians, mostly former members of the Tonton Macoutes (paramilitary police) that existed during the Duvalier administration.
