In particular, it has been confirmed that the armed forces of the ROK and the United States have been able to pinpoint the location of about 2,300 multiple-barrelled rocket launchers North Korea has deployed underground along the ceasefire line, and that they have secured new shells which can destroy such launchers. On 17 May one high-level military official in the government said: "We have stockpiled special shells, including laser-beam guided missiles, which can neutralize North Korea's underground gun batteries which pose a big threat to Seoul and its vicinity." He continued to say that such new shells are capable of destroying concrete walls that are more than two meters thick. This official added: "The U.S. Armed Forces are developing higher accuracy equipment which can destroy such underground batteries with improved accuracy. Existing equipment is sufficient for keeping a check on North Korea's underground batteries." In the meantime, as far as diplomatic efforts are concerned, the ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out a step-by-step way of imposing sanctions in such a way as to immediately refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council if the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] reports that it is difficult to verify whether nuclear material has been taken because of North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel rods. If imposing sanctions against North Korea is impossible with China's exercise of its veto power, an international joint sanction between the ROK, the United States, and Japan may be imposed. It has been learned that with a view to increasing the efficiency of the sanctions, the ROK Government is devising a way to have Russia join in the sanctions against North Korea. As part of this strategy, the government will make efforts to see an adoption of a ROK-Russian joint statement or joint declaration on the basis of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in Russia in early June. On 17 May, a high-level government official stressed: "If there is a report from the IAEA team saying that it is impossible to secure nuclear transparency because North Korea has already replaced its nuclear fuel rods, referral of this matter to the UN Security Council and following through on procedures to impose sanctions will be inevitable."
