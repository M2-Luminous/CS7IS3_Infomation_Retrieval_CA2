He said one can speak of a failure by the United Nations, but this does not mean giving up. Philippe Harrouard reports from the Foreign Ministry: [Harrouard] A failure by the United Nations, a challenge to the international community: As usual, the Serbs are playing a double game, but we must neither give up, nor call for escalation. Alain Juppe was bitter when he received us this morning. The minister added: No withdrawal of UN troops, no lifting of the arms embargo, and let's stop shilly-shallying and going it alone -- an allusion to the United States and Russia. Specifically, the United Nations must vote for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of the Serbs from Gorazde. [Begin Juppe recording] We cannot accept the violation of international law, which is clear in Gorazde, as a result of Serb aggression. Therefore, the Security Council must order a cease-fire, as we have asked, a withdrawal of Serb forces, an exclusion zone, and the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. We believe that such a resolution by the Security Council can be voted on forthwith. I cannot see who could oppose it today. [end recording] [passage omitted]
