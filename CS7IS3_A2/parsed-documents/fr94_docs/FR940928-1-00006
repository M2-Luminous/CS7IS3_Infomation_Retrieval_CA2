FR940928-1-00006 FR940928-1-00003 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [CA&hyph;64&hyph;1&hyph;6504; FRL&hyph;5080&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of California; Approval of the Maintenance Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area and Redesignation of the San Francisco Bay Area Ozone Nonattainment Area to Attainment; Approval of Emissions Inventory; Approval of NO X RACT Exemption Petition AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR). SUMMARY: On November 12, 1993 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the San Francisco Bay Area ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment. The ozone nonattainment area includes the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano (part), and Sonoma (part). Under the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas may be redesignated to attainment if sufficient data are available to warrant the redesignation and the area meets the other Clean Air Act redesignation requirements. In today's action, EPA is proposing to approve the State of California's submittal because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. In addition, EPA is proposing to approve the nitrogen oxides (NO x ) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption petition submitted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) on April 15, 1994 under section 182(f). Finally, EPA is proposing to expedite the approval of the annual and peak season 1990 inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions required by section 182(a)(1) by parallel processing the emissions inventory.
