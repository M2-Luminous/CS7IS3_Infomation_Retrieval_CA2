He mentioned the viewpoints of the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher on the danger of the explosion of war in Kosova and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] if the efforts for the realization of the project on Greater Serbia still continue. President Rugova hailed the commitment of President Clinton for a broad intervention in Bosnia in order to defend security areas. On this occasion, he drew the attention that if violence and repression are legalized, there will be problems in the Balkans and the whole of Europe and that the principles of the international institutions and the United Nations not to reward violence and aggression, but the efforts for peace, agreement, and understanding will be devolved. President Rugova said that if a top international summit is held with the United States, the European Union, and Russia on the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia, we will persistently ask that Kosova unfailingly be part of this solution, because it was a federal unit of former Yugoslavia with equal status to other units and, being a nerve center of the crisis, it will be a continuous danger if not solved on the basis of the political will of the people and in the Balkan context. President Rugova reiterated his demand that Kosova be placed under the protection of the international community and expressed his hope that the peaceful policy of Albanians will be rewarded.
