The second popular audience, expected to be held on 21 April, will solve various problems that are still pending. It is to be specified that at the 12 April popular audience, four major issues were solved and accommodated. Of all the four problems, one seemed to have remained contentious. That was the issue of the Olympic market. Despite this, the king intervened to end the conflict by proposing that the Thai Bunrong company recognize that the Olympic market is 50 percent owned by traders. The king of Cambodia further said that this does not mean that the Thai Bunrong company or the government bow to traders, but it would achieve compromise and social stability. He further said that many foreign companies plan to invest in Cambodia, and the obstacle blocking this is the Khmer Rouge [KR] group. King Norodom Sihanouk also specified that if all Cambodians agree to compromise regardless of their party affiliation, Cambodia will quickly develop, and many foreign investors will bring a lot of capital to invest in Cambodia.
