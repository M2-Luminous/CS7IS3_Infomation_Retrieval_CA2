In a statement to PETRA after the meeting, Buwayz said he felt full readiness on the part of the prime minister to reach a new concept for Jordanian-Lebanese relations with the aim of developing cooperation and coordination between the two sisterly countries. He said: We, in Lebanon, greatly appreciate the fraternal Jordanian people. We have great interests with Jordan that need to be organized for the benefit of both countries and people.

Regarding the current Lebanese stand vis-a-vis the peace process, Buwayz said: Now that approximately three and a half years have passed since the Madrid conference, we cannot say that these talks have reached the sought level or achieved the sought results. We cannot also say that the Israeli side deals with these talks in the required way. New problems and challenges surfaced during this period. Buwayz said: Despite all circumstances, we believe that this peace should be given a chance. We also believe that the Israeli side should prove it is still committed to the principles of peace in terms of its fairness and the implementation of the international resolutions and the principle of land for peace. Regarding the most prominent developments in the trial of those accused of involvement in the assassination of Jordanian diplomat, martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, which began recently, the Lebanese foreign minister said: It is known that the competent Lebanese departments arrested the suspects moments after the crime was committed. We can say that Lebanese judiciary, which is known for its fairness and independence, will deal with this subject with all seriousness and it has issued the indictment. We have no doubt that the court will issue a fair decision. The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, minister of state and acting minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman.
