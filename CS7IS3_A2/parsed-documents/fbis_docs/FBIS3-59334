It made more specific and systematic the goal of a establishing a socialist market economy as proposed at the 14th Party Central Committee and is an important breakthrough and development in theory and practice; it will be the guiding principle for conducting reform of the economic system reform in the 1990's. I. Draw Up the General Framework for Establishing a Socialist Market Economic System, Design the General Blueprint for Further Reform 1. To establish a socialist market economic system is to make the market play the fundamental role in allocating resources under the State's macroscopic regulation and control. The basic prerequisite for establishing the socialist market economic system is to associate the market economic functions of perfecting resource allocation and improving efficiency with the goals of public ownership to safeguard social justice and promotion of getting rich together. It should reflect the general regulation of the market economy, learning from and absorbing the successful experiences of foreign countries, as well as reflecting the essential characteristics of the socialist system. The general law of market economics is: All commodities and all key elements of production including land, capital, labor force, and technology should go into the market. The market operation system will play a basic function in allocation; property rights and relationships must be clear, profit substances pluralized, and enterprises become independent legal persons and chief entities in market competition with self-operation, self-responsibility for profits and losses, self-development, and self-restriction. The government will carry out indirect regulation and control through economic means, to foster a good market situation, protect society's overall profits, and accomplish the public's goals. Economic relationships must be legalized, enterprises must operate in accordance with the law, and the government administer by law. For initial establishment of the socialist market economy system by the end of the century, there is much work which must be done, so we must grasp the key points, and first of all establish the basic framework of the new system. 2. The basic framework of the socialist market economic system is composed of five links. A. Establish a modern enterprise system which is suitable to the market economy, forming a vigorous microscopic base in which public ownership is the main body, while multiple economic compositions develop in the interim. B. Establish a national unified market system, to achieve close associations between rural and urban markets, connections between the domestic and international markets, and promote perfected allocation of resources. C. Establish a perfect macroscopic regulation and control system which mainly uses indirect means, shifting the government's role of administering the economy, and guaranteeing healthy operation of the domestic economy. D. Establish an income distribution system in which distribution by work is the dominant factor, giving priority to efficiency, giving consideration to fairness, encouraging part of our regions and part of our people to get rich first, going the way of getting rich together. E. Establish a multi-level social insurance system, providing social insurance for urban and rural residents which is appropriate to China's situation, to promote economic and social stability. Just as it is stated in the "Decision": "These principle links are organic main entities which are associated and mutually restrictive, and compose the basic framework of the socialist market economic system." Meanwhile, it also clarifies the basic special features of the socialist market economy. We must accelerate reform measures around these key links, to establish the basic framework of the socialist market economy. 3. Correctly learn and grasp the key and mutual links for establishing the socialist market economic system framework. The basic and key link in establishing the socialist market economic system and a modern enterprise system appropriate to what the market requires is clarification of property rights and relationships. This is because the enterprise is the main entity of the market, and the modern enterprise system is the basic system in the socialist market economy system. Without a modern enterprise system, the socialist market economy would be a river without water, a tree without roots. Because the enterprise is an economic entity which is composed of the various key elements of production, key elements of the market, the whole market system including labor force, capital, and technology are prerequisites to establishing a modern enterprise system as well as the certain result of modern enterprise economic operation. Among these key elements of production, the person is the most vigorous element. To be complete in establishing a modern enterprise system, in order to arouse and bring into full play the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of labor, we must establish a reasonable income distribution system, smash egalitarianism, and implement earning more for more work. This will reflect the principle of giving priority to efficiency, giving consideration to fairness, and forming the market economy's system of operating by motivation. Only in this way can we improve labor productivity and economic efficiency. We should realize that in the process of developing the socialist market economy, the market is not a universal: Establishment of a perfect and efficient macroscopic economic regulation and control and a social insurance system cannot be replaced by enterprise action and the market operation system, because enterprises and the market do not have, indeed cannot possibly have, macroscopic regulation and control functions, or a system of social insurance. The macroscopic regulation and control system is the regulator of the socialist market economic system, while the social insurance system is the market economic system's safety valve and stabilizer. It is only by establishing a perfect macroscopic regulation and control system in which indirect measures are the dominant factor, and by establishing a multilevel social insurance system, can we ensure that the socialist market economy will be systematic, complete and unified. By having this type of new system, we can enhance economic and social stability, and ensure that the domestic economy will operate regularly and healthily. II. Give the Highest Priority To Arranging Property Rights and Relationships, and To Establishing Modern Enterprises; Clearly Set Forth the Concept of "Legal Person Property Rights" 1. The market conditions required for state-owned enterprises to achieve self-operation, and self-responsibility for profits and losses. In 1984, in the "CPC Decisions On Economic System Reform" it was made clear that state-owned enterprises should achieve self-operation and take responsibility for their own profits and losses, but so far this goal has not been accomplished, because two difficult points have yet to be resolved: One is that the market conditions required for enterprise self-operation have not formed, and the second is that we haven't found the specific pattern for enterprises to accomplish responsibility for their own profits and losses, so we haven't resolved the theoretical and practical problems concerned in enterprises' property rights. Enterprises' self-operation requires a market condition, and establishment of that condition is the result of a series of reforms which support the system. To establish a commodity market, we must reform the planning system, the circulation system, and the price management system. Going a step further, a commodity market alone is not sufficient for enterprise self-operation; there must also be key element markets as well, chief of which are the capital market, the labor force market, and the technology market. This in turn calls for reform of the investment system, the financial system, and the labor and personnel matters system, as well as a social insurance system. According to a survey by a relevant department, there are several basic special features in China's market conditions, as follow: First, there is a very great difference in degree of development between the commodity market and the key element markets. The commodity market developed more rapidly, the key element markets more slowly. Second, there is a considerable difference in market conditions confronting large, medium, and small enterprises. Small enterprises face better market conditions, so have greater rights to self-operation; the market conditions are worse for large and medium enterprises, especially backbone enterprises which produce important products, so they have a lesser degree of self-operation. Third, there are sizable differences in the market conditions faced by enterprises' from different industries. Enterprises in industries which produce investment type products and manufacture consumer products enjoy better market conditions, since they have greater rights to self-operation; enterprises in sectors which produce raw materials and basic industries face less favorable market conditions, having fewer self-operation rights. Fourth, there are major differences in market conditions across different regions. Markets in special economic zones and development areas developed better than did markets in other areas. From the four differences listed above, we can see the achievements of past reform as well as the backward links in the reform process; we can confirm that there is a practical base for continuing to go forward as well as confirm the key points of further reform. On this basis, we can determine the channels by which to exchange the enterprise operation system. 2. Reform of state-owned enterprises demands a breakthrough in the theory of property rights. Regardless of whether profit or loss, both are embodied in enterprise property rights. Enterprises must achieve self-responsibility for profits and losses, must become the main body of their property rights; if the property of state-owned enterprises comes into the category of public ownership, how can enterprises become the main body of property rights? This is the urgent problem we must resolve to realize the pattern of state-owned enterprise taking responsibility for their own profits and losses. Theoretical circles and executive departments carried out a useful probe of enterprise property rights reform. Generally there are three ways in which it is worded: 1) Legal person property controlling rights; 2) legal person ownership; 3) legal person property rights. Concerning enterprise legal person property controlling rights: According to the regulations of the "Enterprise Law" and "Transformation of the Public Ownership Industrial Enterprises Operating System," enterprises share ownership, using it and levying penalties in accordance with the law. Discussions have shown that many people are confused about this concept: Although the "General Regulations of Civil Law" confirmed that the right of separation was an independent property right of civil affairs, people still viewed it as an administrative right, which was an enterprise activity right not touching upon property rights and relationships. Therefore, it is difficult for enterprises to accomplish value-preservation and value-addition of state-owned capital, and self-responsibility for profits and losses. Concerning enterprise legal person ownership: Legal person ownership, the structure which deals with shareholder rights in the legal relationship between enterprise and investor, is now the general rule of civil law and commercial law in each country. Enterprises share in legal person ownership as independent civil affairs main entities, and independently engage in legal activities, undertake legal responsibility, and can eliminate investor direct involvement in the enterprise's production and operations activities. Legal ownership is only a legal form; it cannot change the nature of the enterprise's ownership. That is determined by the characteristics of the shareholders who actually control the corporation. Concerning enterprise legal person property rights: In this, the enterprise has independent controlling rights to property that the state has authorized the enterprise to operate and manage in accordance with law. Legal person property rights are an association of operational rights and the legal person system. Enterprise operational rights are spoken of in comparison with state ownership, setting the focal point on the relationship of property, rights and responsibilities between the enterprise and the state. Legal person property rights are spoken of in comparing the enterprise's other civil affairs rights, setting the focal point on the relationship of rights and responsibilities between the enterprise as an independent legal person and the enterprise's property. What is the difference between legal person property rights and enterprise operation rights? One is that operation does not include profit rights, while "enterprise legal person property rights" includes related content concerning profit rights. Another difference is that after affirming the concept of enterprise legal person property rights, the state will not accept responsibility for enterprise debts. Explaining enterprise legal person property right helps to understand correctly and implement further enterprise operational rights, and helps to clarify property relationships, protect state ownership, and accomplish value-preservation and value-adding for state owned assets. So, the "Decision" used the wording of "enterprise legal person property right." 3. Establishing the modern enterprise system is the direction of state-owned enterprise reform. What is the modern enterprise system? What are its basic special feature? According to international experience and China's practical situation, it first of all clarifies property rights relationships. When an enterprise has the legal person property right, it can become a legal person entity, assuming responsibility for civil rights and responsibilities. Second, it permits enterprises to self-operate, taking responsibility for their own profits and losses in all legal person property, paying taxes in accordance with regulations, taking responsibility for asset value-preservation and value-adding for investors. Third, investors undertake limited responsibility in the amount of assets they invest. Fourth, enterprises organize production and operation according to market demand, and in market competition, only excellent will win while the bad will fall by the wayside; there will be no indirect government intervention in enterprise operations. Fifth, it will establish a scientific enterprise organizational structure and management system, establishing a mutual encouragement and restrictive operating system among owners, operators, and employees. The corporation system is the major legal pattern of the enterprise system under the modern market economic system. The basic special features of the enterprise legal person are: One, it has the status of an independent legal person, the same civil action abilities as a natural person, to sue and countersue; two, it takes responsibility for its own profits and losses, a company of the shareholder investment form assumes independent civil responsibility; third, it is a totally independent economic entity for taxpaying; fourth, it adopts a regulated system of cost and financial accounting. 4. The fundamental conditions for enterprises to be the main entity of market competition. The risky and competitive special features of a main entity in market economy activities determine that for the enterprise to be the main entity of market competition it should have two fundamental conditions. One is that enterprises determine their own activity and direction according to market demand, determining its own combination of enterprise production key elements and operations. Enterprises determine as they will what to produce, what to operate, how to conduct production and operations. The second is that enterprises can independently bear the consequences of market activity, which is that the enterprise should become the main entity in legal property rights, having independent property rights and responsibilities. 5. The advantages and pattern of the corporation system. In reorganizing the state-owned enterprises we can eliminate the original legal framework for public ownership enterprises. The advantages to this are: One, the enterprise will take its own responsibility for profits and losses, getting out of the strange circle which confronts state-owned enterprise reform. State-owned enterprises are being remolded on the corporate system, in which the state, representing the public as shareholders, undertakes limited responsibility for enterprises according to the amount of its investment, and entrusts operations to directors; enterprises take responsibility for their profits and losses on the basis of legal person property right. The biggest restriction on enterprises is self-responsibility for profits and losses; this responsibility can prevent enterprises from abusing ownership, with loss of state owned capital. Second, it helps in clarifying property rights relationships. Remolding into the corporate system requires clarification of property rights relationships between government and enterprises, confirms the government's ownership organs, and sends representatives of shareholders to attend board of directors meetings. Third, it creates the conditions for separating enterprise from government and for enterprise self-operation. The corporate system remake requires separation of government from capital, unification of capital and enterprises, and this furnishes the preconditions for separating government from enterprises. Meanwhile, the separation of ownership rights from operating rights is assured by a clear, stable system of regulations and by the enterprises' internal organizational structure. It will provide reliable organization and system conditions for freeing enterprises from inappropriate governmental administrative interference, and will protect enterprise self-operation. Fourth, it is only after enterprises have taken responsibility for their profits and losses that they will really be able to face the market. For public ownership enterprises, the state does indeed take joint responsibility for their profits and losses. Moreover, this is done without looking into the responsibility for profits and losses. Therefore, enterprises face more toward government rather than the market, so even should the government want to push them, they might not be able to. After enterprises assume responsibility for their own profits and losses, facing the market will become an internal requirement for an enterprise looking to survive and develop. Fifth, the responsibility system for profits and losses by enterprise operators and employees will be better implemented, promoting enterprise efficiency and improved benefits. Because the owner goes into the enterprise, property rights restrictions will be more strict, making it easier to confirm responsibility for profits and losses of operators and employees, establishing a more efficient system for incentives and restrictions. In addition, it will serve to increase flexibility in enterprise operations and promote fairness in competition among various kinds of enterprises. The corporate system can take a different pattern: A small number of natural monopoly industries and public welfare industries can be remolded into state single capital corporations and multiple investment entities can be remolded into limited responsibility corporations or joint stock corporations in accordance with law. The joint stock system can better regulate the relationships between the state and enterprises, and is the efficient form suitable for development of the market economy. We must create the conditions, positively and reliably extending the range of experimental sites, regulating it and letting it develop in a healthy manner. There can be only a small number of joint stock corporations in the market. Implementation of the corporate system should stress replacing the operational system, with steady expansion via experimental sites. III. Current Emphasis Should Be on Developing a Production Elements Market To Establish a Unified Open Market System; Markets for Labor Force and Capital Are Important Components of the Elements of Production, With New Breakthroughs and Developments, Both Theoretically and Practically 1. Current emphasis on development of a production elements market. The "Decision" noted that "current emphasis must be on developing a production elements market." Why must this be emphasized? The weak link in current market construction is the serious backwardness of the elements market, which does suit the needs of establishing the socialist market economic system. At present, direct financial markets occupy only about 10 percent of the gross capital used in China, with the capital market in a preliminary stage. The circulation of the labor force is still fundamentally unchanged from the pattern of the original system. The actual turnover rate of scientific and technical achievements is not very high; for example, only 5 percent of the scientific and technical achievements in the electromechanical industry received widespread popularization. Production elements bring a very low price in the market. This has become a barrier to the establishment of a national, unified, open market, a barrier to making maximum use of the market's fundamental role of resource allocation. Bringing all production elements into the market is an essential requirement of the socialist market economic system, a vital part of establishing and perfecting the market system, as well as a key problem in perfecting resource allocation. The production element markets include those for capital, labor force, technology, and land. Without development of the element markets, reasonable circulation of production markets would be impossible to accomplish, and it would certainly be impossible to really achieve perfected resource allocation. 2. A clear proposal for the concept of a labor force market is an important breakthrough in economic system theory and practice. In the past, theoretical circles, and especially economic departments, always used such concepts as "labor services market", the "labor market" and "labor employment market." The "Decision," clearly proposed the concept of the "labor force market." Actually, the labor force market is one type of production element market, an important component of the market system; only when the labor force market is proposed with perfect assurance can we accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic system. Now that the people are the masters of the state, how can the labor force be seen as a commodity property? The chief reason such a problem exists lies in confusion over the two ideas of labor force and worker. In fact, the labor force is not equivalent to the worker. The concepts of labor force and worker have connections as well as differences. Labor force refers to labor capability of the worker; worker refers to the main entity of labor which is the person. The workers exchange their labor abilities in the labor force market but not their persons. In the process of this exchange, the two sides negotiate supply and demand equally and make mutual choices for mutual benefits. Workers have different levels of personal talent, so they have different levels of working ability. Ownership of the labor force lies with the main entity of labor, that is, the person, and this supplies both the possibility and the practical base for the existence and development of the labor force market. As the only active element, the labor force plays an important role in production elements. If the other production elements go into the market, with only the labor force kept out, it will be impossible to establish a unified open market system. Only when the labor forces goes into the market, and the qualifications and value of workers receive a fair evaluation, can enterprises and workers carry out two-way selection on a free will basis, and thereby promote perfected allocation of labor resources and the entire resources of society. It is irrefutable that there actually exists a considerable amount of the labor force market in our economic life. China has a big population, an abundant labor force resource, so the contradiction of labor supply exceeding demand will exist for a long time. According to figures supplied by relevant departments, by the year 2000 China will face the employment pressures of 320 million people, so it is urgent and essential that we speed up the creation and development of a labor force market. At present, China's labor force is still in a stage of preliminary development. Looking at the main entity of market competition, establishment of this has been blocked in all state-owned sectors, due to the fact that the labor and personnel system has not yet implemented complete reforms. There is still basically a lack of guaranteed rights and benefits for the market main entity. Looking at the market operating system, the pricing standard for the labor force lacks unity; over quite a large area, wages reflect neither the cost of the labor force nor the labor force supply and demand situation, so the operating system for market regulation does not function. Looking at market competition order, there is a lack of essential measures to protect competition, regulate and control the market, and provide legal supervision. Looking at the market service system, the social protection system is not completely established, with a very low degree of social benefits, such as employee training, medical benefits, job-related injuries, retirement insurance, and unemployment compensation. Therefore, it is only through further reform, accelerating the creation and development of a labor force market, that we can possibly deal with the massive employment pressures in future economic development. Affirming the concept of a labor force market will not affect the working class's master position. Admitting a labor force market does not mean that workers are a commodity. Workers have the right to exchange and retain their labor force, have the freedom to choose jobs; this merely reflects the fact that workers are masters of their own labor force, so as to accomplish equal labor and employment opportunities. Under capitalism, private ownership of the means of production brings a separation of the workers from the means of production, obliging workers to sell their labor force to become employed, so the individual ownership rights of the labor force change in nature. Under socialism, workers exchange their labor force with collective workers, and participate in democratic management, achieving true private ownership of the labor force. When we speak of the master position of the working class, we mean the whole working class, and the individual worker is not equal to the whole working class. The individual worker's exchange and retention of his own labor force doesn't mean he has lost the status of being a part of the working class. 3. Positively and reliably develop the capital market, to promote socialist modernization. A. Capital must be converted into social wealth. Is capital allowed to exist in the socialist market economy? This is a big and important problem which must be resolved in economic reform and development. Since the "three big remoldings" in China, the economic category of capital has almost been cancelled, replacing it with funds, viewing capital and the capital market the same as capitalist and capitalism. In a situation where multiple economic compositions simultaneously co-exist, admitting the existence of capital is helpful to development of the domestic economy. At present, the different development speeds of the different economic components is closely relate to whether they operate according to the regulations on capital circulation. For example, some enterprises earn fake profits while actually losing, some "three forms of capital enterprises" have fake losses while actually earning profits. Privately owned enterprises seek as much depreciation as possible, while some state owned enterprises rarely mention it if they mention it at all, with the result that some state owned enterprises "rest on their laurels," their capital funds going down while their assets to liabilities ratio rises greatly, their average profit level dropping, and the capital value-addition increases slowly. This is one important reason why in recent years there has been a steady decline in that proportion of the domestic economy that is state owned. Under capitalism, currency is converted to capital, with capitalists use this capital to occupy surplus value. Under socialism, the question is not whether to create surplus value, but who will possess the newly increased surplus value? Will it be converted to social property? Will it benefit the people and society? When we engage in the socialism market economy, capital value-addition means the expansion of owners' capital which includes, chiefly, public ownership. It is helpful in developing socialist productive forces, in increasing the comprehensive national power of socialist countries, and in improving people's living standards. Converting national funds into national "capital" establishes the relationship between the state and enterprises according to "capital" ownership rights. This aids in separating enterprises from government, in managing enterprises well, and also helps the state strengthen macroscopic regulation and control of enterprises through the economic means of investments and loans. Enterprises engage in operational activities through the means of capital, and have to make up losses through capital; if they make profits, it will become the owner's benefits. The enterprise's purpose is to capital value-addition. The initial step in establishing a system which keeps enterprises within boundaries is to have powerful restrictions on capital. This is the only way to avoid the phenomenon of "eating up all the benefits" and an "enterprise tending to be a empty box." Allowance for the existence of capital must create changes in the ownership pattern. As positive promotion is provided for the state ownership economy and the collective economy, there must at the same time be encouragement for development of individual, private, and foreign investment joint ventures in order to establish a pattern of taking public ownership as the dominant factor, absorbing the simultaneous development of multiple economic components. Some public ownership enterprises which took in investment from employees and collective enterprises, issued B stock and H stock, the enterprises and the legal person blended as one. This is just as the "Decision" said, that "with property rights moving and reorganizing, more and more economic units will have mixed property ownership, and will establish new a property ownership structure." This is a development in ownership theory and practice. Allowance for the existence of capital must create changes in the distribution system as well. The "Decision" declared: "Encourage deposits and investment by urban and rural residents, allowing production elements which are a part of individual capital to participate in distribution of profits and benefits." We must adhere to a system in which distribution according to labor is at the center, with simultaneous existence of a multiple distribution pattern. This requires that two relationship problems be handled well: One, the relationship between distribution by work and distribution by capital; and two, the relationship between state owned capital and privately owned capital. Not only should we encourage a part of the people in some areas to get rich first, but we must also try to avoid division into two opposite extremes, while we gradually accomplish getting rich together. B. The capital market should positively and reliably develop security and stock capital. The capital market can also be called the long term fund market, which is the market for fund debits and credits or security exchanges of medium and short term capital markets over one year. The money market can also be called the short term capital market. Since reform, there have been major changes in the domestic income distribution pattern. The proportion of resident deposits in national gross deposits has risen to its current figure of more than 70 percent from 23.55 percent in 1979. The huge amount of resident savings are largely in the form of deposits. Thus, at the same time we are stabilizing savings, we should positively and reliably develop security and stock capital. Regulate the structure of the capital market, with step by step regulation of stock market expansion. This will improve the proportion of enterprise self-owned capital, which can appropriately strengthen enterprises' ability to undertake financial regulations by the central bank. Currently, banks bear most of the debt load for state-owned enterprises, so when money is tight, there is a direct effect on enterprises' production and operational actions. Because China's state-owned enterprises do not now have a true self-restrictive operations system, in their pursuit of output and development speed, enterprises do not consider the costs of collecting capital in the market; but financial macroscopic regulation and control is direct control of credit and not indirect control of the currency supply. In this situation, it is easy to keep direct investment separate from changes in market demand, so the market's perfected resource allocation function cannot be brought into full play. We must establish a credit rating system, and regulate the issuance of stocks and securities to promote healthy development of the capital market. IV. Macroscopic Regulation and Control Is Chiefly Through Economic Means, Bringing Into Full Play the Enthusiasms of Central Authorities and Localities 1. The socialist market economy requires a perfect macroscopic regulation and control system. The socialist market economy system must emphasize bringing the market's basic resource allocation function into full play. But on the other hand, it must be understood that the market is not universal; it is spontaneous, blind, and sluggish, so we must strengthen macroscopic regulation and control. Establishing a macroscopic regulation and control system will compensate for the market's shortages. Therefore, the market mechanism function and macroscopic regulation and control are linked to one another and they supplement each other; each is indispensable. The "Decision" stipulated that macroscopic regulation and control must stress "maintaining a general equilibrium in the gross economic total, to perfect the economic structure and lead to steady, rapid, and healthy development of the domestic economy while promoting comprehensive progress of society." In addition, it made it clear that "macroscopic regulation and control is chiefly by economic measures," establishing a macroscopic regulation and control system by means of further reform, without reverting to the old, planned economic system. To establish a macroscopic system for regulation and control, it is necessary to establish a system which is both mutually supportive and mutually restrictive among plan, finance, and revenue and expenditures, to strengthen combined coordination of economic operations. A very important question is just what kind of role will the central bank play in macroscopic regulation and control. At present, the policy objectives of the central bank are not only to assume the huge burden of supporting economic growth, it is also responsible for stabilizing currency. In addition, it must always make economic development its highest priority, with an expansion tendency in currency policy, and this weakens its function of stabilizing currency. The "Decision" specified quite clearly that: "The prime objective of the central bank is to stabilize currency value, regulate the total currency supply, and maintain the international balance." Confirming the central bank's policy objectives was beneficial to stabilizing currency and controlling inflation. 2. In the near future, we must take major, important steps in revenue, finance, investment, and planning system reform. The key points of revenue system reform are: 1) Establish a tax division system; that is, change the current local revenue contracted system into one that establishes a central tax, shared tax, and local tax on the basis of an equitable division between the central government and localities' rights; 2) reform and perfect the tax system, and spread more widely the circulation tax system in which the value-added tax is the dominant factor, on the principle of a unified tax law, a fair tax burden, a simplified tax system, and an equitable division of power; 3) reform and regulate the double entry budget. The focal points of financial system reform are: 1) The People's Bank of China must operate as a true central bank, regulating and controlling the currency supply primarily through economic means; that is, changing from relying chiefly on management of the scale of credit to the use of such measures as the deposit reserve rate, the central bank credit interest rate, and open market business to conduct management; 2) the current specialized banks must be converted into commercial banks; 3) we must organize policy type banks, separating policy type business and commercial type business; 4) reform the foreign exchange management system, and with the market as the foundation, establish a controlled system for a floating foreign exchange rate with a unified and standard foreign currency market. The focal points of investment system reform are: 1) Change the main entities of investment in competitive type projects from government to enterprises, giving enterprises self-determination in policy and strategy, and gradually establishing risk responsibility for legal person investment and bank credit; 2) replace the current administrative examination and approval with a system of registering projects and putting them on file, a major and important reform in the transition from the planned economy to the market economy; 3) encourage and take in investment from every sector for the construction of fundamental projects. The focal points of planning system reform are: 1) The plan must be based on the market, usually an oversight plan; 2) The mission of planning work is to establish a logical development strategy, achieving the purpose of regulation and control and industrial policy, with accurate economic forecasts; 3) Put macroscopic, strategic, and policy-oriented key points in prominent positions in medium and long-range planning; 4) Establish new domestic economic business accounting and a macroscopic system for economic oversight and estimates. 3. Alter the role of government by reasonably dividing the central government's rights and the economic management rights of localities. Is it first level macroscopic regulation and control or second level macroscopic regulation and control? What we refer to as macroscopic regulation and control is regulation and control of the gross economic output. Therefore, macroscopic regulation and control rights must be concentrated in the central government; localities should not be making decisions concerning the issuance of currency, setting fundamental interest rates, and regulating and controlling major tax rates. This is the only way that we can assure a balanced gross economic output, perfect the economic structure, and establish a national, unified, open, market system. To maximize the enthusiasm of localities, the "Decision" set essential management rights for each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government: 1) Fix regional laws and regulations, policies and plans which are in accord with the nation's laws, regulations and macroscopic policies; 2) replenish local taxes, increase local revenue, and regulate activities in these localities through local revenues and budgets; 3) fully exploit local resources, promoting economic and social development in these localities; 4) organize and construct rural and urban cooperative banks to support regional economic development. Transforming the role of government and reforming government organs is urgently needed if we are to establish the socialist market economic system. The "Decision" set out clear regulations on the function of government economic management, that it is "chiefly, to establish and carry out macroscopic regulation and control, do a good job of constructing the infrastructure, cultivate a market system, regulate societal distribution and organize social insurance, control population growth, protect the environment, and manage state owned assets in order to accomplish the objective of developing the national economy and society. We must transform the role of government administrative departments, simplify the administrative structure, strengthen the role of social administration, and not intervene directly in the production and operational activities of enterprises.
