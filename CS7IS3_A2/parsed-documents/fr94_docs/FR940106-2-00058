FR940106-2-00058 FR940106-2-00033 3. Rented Home Blood Glucose Monitors Historically, Medicare-allowed payment amounts for the rental of DME have been set at approximately 10 percent of the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for rented home blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 10 percent of the special payment limits for purchased new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the special payment limit for a rented monitor would be $5.70 each month. The total payment for a rented monitor would not be allowed to exceed the lower of the actual charge or the fee for the purchase of the monitor. B. Applicability The initial special payment limits we propose would apply to standard home blood glucose monitors furnished on or after the effective date of the published final notice and before January 1, 1994. For standard home blood glucose monitors furnished in calendar year 1994, the special payment limits would be equal to the initial special payment limits increased by the 1994 covered item update factor (the factor used to update other items of DME). The covered item update for 1994, and each subsequent year, is defined in section 1834(a)(14)(B) of the Act as the percentage increase in the CPI&hyph;U for the 12-month period ending with June of the previous year. For each calendar year after 1994, the special payment limits would be equal to the special payment limits for the preceding calendar year increased by the covered item update for the calendar year to which the limits would apply. C. Payment for Home Blood Glucose Monitors We propose that payment for home blood glucose monitors be equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the monitor or the appropriate special payment limit, as described in section A above. III. Regulatory Impact Statement A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_ •An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; •A major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or •Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. This proposed notice would reduce unnecessary Medicare program expenditures for standard home blood glucose monitors. Currently, payment under the Medicare program for home glucose monitors is equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge for the item or the fee schedule amount for the item. Under this proposed notice, payment would be equal to 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge or the appropriate special payment limit proposed by this notice. We are proposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors for Medicare beneficiaries of $57 if the monitor is furnished within the continental United States and $65 if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. We estimate that imposing special payment limits for purchased new home blood glucose monitors would produce savings of $5 million annually, or $25 million from FY 1994 through FY 1998. This notice would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this notice is not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all suppliers and manufacturers of home blood glucose monitors are considered to be small entities. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.
