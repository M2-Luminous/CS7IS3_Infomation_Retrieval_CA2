During the party Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech in which on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government he first extended heartfelt regards and lofty respect to specialists, scholars, and intellectuals working on various fronts and in various fields. Gu Jinchi said: The broad masses of intellectuals are forces relied upon by our country in conducting socialist undertakings and also the important forces of conducting reform, opening up, and economic construction. He urged the broad masses of intellectuals to bring their enthusiasm and creativeness into full play, to turn as soon as possible the scientific and technological results into practical productive forces, and to make more contributions to accomplishing the second-phase pioneering work. He also urged party committees and governments at all levels to continuously and correctly implement in an overall way the policy on intellectuals by grasping the central tasks of respecting knowledge and talented personnel. They should often listen to the opinions, suggestions, and voices raised by the broad masses of intellectuals and bring into full play their important advisory role in making scientific policy decisions and in participating in or discussing governmental and political affairs. The departments of organizations, propaganda, personnel affairs, and united front work; as well as science and technology commission and association should realistically assume their own responsibility and make concerted efforts to intensively encourage the society as a whole to support the work on intellectuals' affairs and to vigorously create a new situation in the work in this regard.
