The downconverter shows a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain of greater than 11 dB. I. Introduction Recent progress in the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology has stimulated the development of low noise amplifiers (LNAs) at 94 GHz-band and above [1-3]. HEMT mixers [4] and dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs) [5] have also been developed to realize W-band low noise converters (LNCs). An LNC incorporating a HEMT LNA and a HEMT mixer has been reported [6]. We have recently developed a 94 GHz-band LNC by combining a HEMT LNA, a HEMT mixer and a DRO. Though all the three downconverter components have planar circuit configurations, they are connected together via waveguide interfaces as an initial step to check the downconverter performance. The LNC showed a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain of greater than 11 dB for 94 GHz-band. In this paper, the HEMT LNA, the HEMT mixer and the DRO using a Gunn diode are described as well as the overall performance of the LNC. II. HEMT Devices We have developed both InP-based InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs (InP-HEMTs) and AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs (P-HEMTs) for W-band applications. Figure 1 shows the top view of the HEMT chip with a T-shaped 0.1 � m x 50 � m gate. The chip size is 150 � m x 170 � m and the thickness is 70 � m. The bonding pads of each electrode are designed as small as possible in order to reduce stray capacitances. The chip layout and size are the same for both types of HEMTS. Figure 1. Top View of HEMT Chip The InP-HEMT shows a minimum noise figure of 2.7 dB with an associated gain of 5.4 dB at 94 GHz when biased at Vds=1.0V and Ids=6 mA. The cutoff frequency ft of this device is as high as 260 GHz, when biased for a maximum gain. The P-HEMT exhibits a minimum noise figure of 3.9 dB with an associated gain of 5.0 dB at 94 GHz when biased at Vd=2.0 V and Ids=11 mA. III. Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) Both InP-HEMT LNA and P-HEMT LNA have been developed. These LNAs are 5-stage single-ended MIC amplifier chains with waveguide input and output interfaces. Finline waveguide to microstrip transitions fabricated on teflon-glass substrate with a relative dielectric constant Figure 2. Inner View of LNA r = 2.1 and a thickness of 0.13mm are used for the waveguide to MIC transitions. The insertion loss of each transition is about 1 dB at 94 GHz. The single stage unit amplifier is built on a KOVAR metal carrier which measures 5mm long and 10mm wide. The input and output matching circuits including the quarter-wavelength coupled lines for DC block and quarter-wavelength RF chokes for DC bias are formed on ceramic substrates with r = 5 and thickness of 0.1mm. The loss of these circuits is estimated to be 0.2 dB. The unit amplifier has been designed and fabricated for the minimum noise figure. After embedding the unit amplifier in the 5-stage amplifier housing, a small circuit trimming has been performed to obtain a minimum overall noise figure. Figure 2 shows an inner view of the LNA. Comparison of the measured noise figure and gain between the InP-HEMT LNA and P-HEMT LNA is given in Figure 3. The InP-HEMT LNA shows a noise figure of 4.6 dB and a gain of greater than 20 dB at the center frequency f[.sub]0[/], while the P-HEMT LNA shows a noise figure of 6.2 dB and a gain of 21.5 dB at the same center frequency. The InP-HEMT LNA has proved to be superior to the P-HEMT LNA in terms of noise figure. Figure 3. Measured Gain and Noise Figure IV. HEMT Mixer Devices for mixers should have a higher breakdown voltage than for LNAs, since they are subject to a relatively high power LO drive. We have chosen the P-HEMT for the mixer application, judging from the fact that its breakdown voltage is much higher than that of the InP-HEMT. The mixer developed in this work is a drain mixer with LO drive at the drain and RF drive at the gate. The IF signal of 3 GHz is obtained from the drain through a choke circuit for LO and RF frequencies. The gate and drain matching circuits are fabricated on a 0.1mm thick ceramic substrate with r = 5. The IF matching circuit including a drain bias choke is formed on 0.1mm thick alumina substrates to reduce circuit size, since the IF frequency f[.sub]IF[/] is chosen to be 3 GHz. All the circuits are integrated on a metal carrier as small as 5mm x 10mm. Figure 4 shows an inner view of the HEMT mixer with RF and LO port waveguide-to-microstrip transitions and a coaxial IF output connector. Figure 5 demonstrates a measured conversion loss of the HEMT mixer at the center frequency f[.sub]0[/] as a function of LO power. The LO frequency f[.sub]LO[/] is chosen to be f[.sub]0[/]-f[.sub]IF[/]. The conversion loss is measured to be 5.1 dB for an LO drive power of 10 dBm, at which the IF output power at 1 dB gain compression point is found to be -2 dBm. The SSB noise figure of the HEMT mixer is 11.5 dB at a 7 dBm LO drive. Figure 4. Inner View of HEMT Mixer Figure 5. Conversion Loss of HEMT Mixer as a Function of V. Dielectric Resonator Oscillator (DRO) Figure 6 shows a schematic circuit configuration of the frequency-stabilized DRO with a drop-in isolator for better load pulling. Figure 6. Schematic Circuit Configuration of DRO Dielectric resonators operating at a higher order mode may be preferable for stabilizing a 94 GHz oscillator, considering that the higher order mode operation enables us to employ a larger size resonator than those of the TE[.sub]01[/]� dominant mode, thereby giving a higher Q-factor and an easier handling. The use of whispering gallery mode resonator is an example based on this idea [5,7]. Higher order mode resonators are, however, very position sensitive with respect to their coupling to the circuit. We realized the necessary coupling of higher order mode resonator by adjusting the coupling position carefully and adding a mechanical tuner. In this way, we could make our DRO temperature stable between -5 to 40�C . The exact mode number of the resonator is not determined yet. Figure 7 shows the inner view of the DRO. The Gunn diode used is an InP Gunn diode (NW-50) manufactured by Acrotec. The diode is packaged in a pill which measures 0.8mm in diameter and 0.9mm in height. The dielectric resonator is a ceramic disk with <graphic> </graphic> [Text] r = 24.6, a thickness of 0.4mm and a diameter of 3.2mm. The resonator is attached with an adhesive on an MIC substrate made of ceramic with <graphic> </graphic> [Text]r = 5 and a thickness of 0.1mm. The adhesive not only deteriorates the coupling condition but also affects the oscillation frequency. Thus a mechanical tuner is added to the DRO housing for fine oscillation frequency adjustment. The frequency can be adjusted by plus or minus 10 MHz. Figure 7. Inner View of DRO with Top Cover Removed [Text] Figure 8 shows the measured oscillation frequency and output power vs. temperatures from -5 to 40�C. The frequency change is 100 MHz and the output power varies from 6.7 dBm to 7.9 dBm. In this temperature test, the oscillation has been found stable for OFF and ON of bias supply. Figure 9 shows a measured spectrum of the DRO. Figure 8. Oscillation Frequency and Output Power of DRO as a Function of Temperature Figure 9. Spectrum of Oscillator Output Signal VI. Low Noise Downconverter (LNC) Figure 10 shows a block diagram of the 94 GHz-band LNC. Since the purpose of the present work is to assess the feasibility of LNC, the developed InP-HEMT LNA, P-HEMT mixer and DRO are connected via waveguide interfaces. The waveguide isolator is used to ensure the LNA performance. The band pass filter is employed to eliminate the image signal at which the LNA has more than 15 dB gain. Figure 10. Block Diagram of LNC Figure 11 shows the assembled downconverter. Figure 12 demonstrates the measured noise figure and conversion gain of the downconverter. The noise figure is 4.9 dB and the conversion gain is greater than 11 dB at the center frequency. Figure 11. Outer View of the LNC Figure 12. Measured Conversion Gain and Noise Figure of LNC VII. Conclusion We have developed two types of HEMT LNA, a P-HEMT mixer, a dielectric resonator oscillator using the planar circuit technology and successfully combined these components to build a 94 GHz low noise downconverter. The downconverter incorporating the InP-HEMT LNA has shown a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain of greater than 11 dB at 94 GHz-band. Our work in the next phase will include waveguide-interface-less connection of the planar circuit components and the development of HEMT DROs. Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank S.
