Lu Ping said: We hope to cooperate with the British side so as to achieve the goal of smooth transition. However, if the British side does not cooperate I believe that, through our concerted efforts and though this means the work will be a little more difficult, it will conform with our common aspirations and will surely guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition. Lu Ping added: I have full confidence in this. Lu Ping stressed: Since reform and opening up, China's economy has thrived and its overall national strength has continuously increased. This is an important guarantee for Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term stability and prosperity. Speaking about the Hong Kong airport issue, Lu Ping said: We hope that the question of financial arrangements for the airport can be settled at an early date. Our principle is that we hope it entails low input and produces good efficiency so that it will not leave an enormous financial burden for the government of the future special administrative region [SAR]. The guests asked a question about the post-1997 civil servants and Lu Ping reiterated: Except for the 20 or so senior officials, I hope that all the other civil servants will remain in their original posts. I hope everyone will work with their minds set at rest. He said: As for the 20 or so senior officials, since they will have to be nominated by the government of the future SAR and appointed by the central government, we have no right to interfere in the matter now. Regarding the question of real estate prices which is currently a concern to Hong Kong people, he said, we are concerned with this question from the angle of hoping for smooth transition. If real estate prices are too high, it will affect both the livelihoods of Hong Kong residents and Hong Kong's status as an international financial and trading center. He added: We hope that Hong Kong's real estate prices will go down slowly. Lu Ping said: The year 1997 is a mere three years away. The time is very short and yet a lot of preparatory work has to be done. What we will do is create better conditions for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong after 1997 in political, economic, and other areas. Lu Ping said: The work of the Preliminary Work Committee is also intended to accumulate experiences for Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. He believes that Hong Kong people will definitely be able to exercise good rule over Hong Kong. Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, simultaneously met with the 66-person delegation of the Alumni Association of the Hong Kong Pui Kui Middle School headed by Zhang Huafeng. They came from Hong Kong, Britain, Australia, the Philippines, and other places. Liao Hui explained to them in detail China's consistent policy for Overseas Chinese affairs.
