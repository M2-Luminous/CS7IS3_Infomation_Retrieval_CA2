During the meeting, Kubo pledged that the SDPJ, as a member of the ruling coalition, would do its utmost to resolve the issue of the bases on Okinawa. He said: "We regard the issue of the bases on Okinawa as a problem that should concern the whole nation. We will work to resolve the issue." Kubo arrived in Okinawa the same day to solicit opinions. Concerning the passage of a bill on special measures for promoting diversion of military-occupied land, Kubo said: "We could not have expected the current Diet confusion. Nevertheless, the passage of the bill is a commitment." In this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would make an all-out effort for the legislation. Okinawa hopes that the bill, which will be submitted as a legislator-sponsored bill, should be enacted during the current Diet session. At the meeting, Governor Ota referred to the crash of a U.S. F-15 jet fighter which occurred on 4 April, saying: "The prefectural office has asked the Governments of Japan and the United States to work to resolve the issue of the bases before 1995, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. Since you work in the center of the ruling coalition, I hope you will tell the government about the crash." Also, with regard to U.S. Forces' facilities such as the Naha Military Port, whose return has been agreed upon by the Japanese and U.S. Governments, Ota said: "I expect the government to satisfy the Okinawan people by achieving tangible results." In response, Kubo said: "The Hosokawa government has expressed deep regret over the war since its inauguration. We understand the Okinawan people's feeling." He then noted that the Hosokawa government would tackle the Okinawa base issue as its own task and that the SDPJ would discuss it at a meeting of party members of prefectural assemblies to be held in Okinawa in June. After the meeting, Kubo headed for the spot where the F-15 fighter crashed for inspection. On the way, he was informed of another crash by a helicopter belonging to U.S. Forces, and he was apparently shocked by the fact that Okinawa is always exposed to danger. At the spot, Kubo looked at the burnt fuselage of an F-15 fighter while being briefed on the crash by Okinawa City Deputy Mayor Eiken Kayo. Kubo said: "Duties of the government include protecting the lives and assets of the people. I will report the accident to the government. We have to consider what measures should be taken to resolve the issue of the bases."
