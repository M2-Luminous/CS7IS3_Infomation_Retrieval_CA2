Breaking his silence, Liberal precandidate Ernesto Samper told this daily newspaper that only the Attorney General's Office and the nation's president can judge Moreno's conduct. "The proper persons to assess the conduct of Minister Luis Alberto Moreno, who, along with Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana, met with Presidents Rafael Caldera and Ramon J. Velasquez in Caracas, are the attorney general and the president, rather than the very Conservative candidate who accompanied Minister Moreno on his trip to Venezuela," Samper said. Although Pastrana claimed yesterday that he did not know whether Moreno's trip to Caracas had been officially authorized by President Gaviria, he did say that simply speaking with a chief of state or president-elect does not constitute improper meddling in politics. He also denied that the fact that Moreno has invited him to a number of public meetings constitutes active campaigning for his presidential candidacy. Pastrana answered reporters' questions at the conclusion of a meeting with members of the Conservative National Leadership who paid him a visit at his political headquarters. Despite Pastrana's reply, the Samper campaign, via spokesman Marco Julio Gutierrez, continued its accusations of partiality on the part of the minister of development and added more photographic evidence to the petition submitted to the Office of Attorney General seeking Moreno's removal. At a meeting of deputies, members of the Samper bench concluded that the government should address the issue of the minister's work in Pastrana's behalf. [passage omitted]
