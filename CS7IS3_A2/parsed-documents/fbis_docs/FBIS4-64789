Send me the document in all the languages immediately." Gianfranco Fini is on the phone, standing in the middle of his office in Via della Scrofa, almost radiant. He has just discovered the mystery behind the European Parliament motion. It seems that the motion that won majority approval in Strasbourg and which calls on Italy to stand by the "fundamental values that informed the foundation of the Community after the horrors of fascism and Nazism" was not worded quite like that after all. The reference to fascism and Nazism is present, in fact, only in the Italian version. "From what I have just heard," explains Fini with mounting satisfaction, "the speaker of the European Parliament has just ordered an inquiry." [Caviglia] So in your view, the motion is little more than a gaffe? [Fini] Let us say that someone has obviously been acting in bad faith. But even before I knew about this addition, I said from the outset that the Strasbourg motion is nothing but a left-wing initiative designed to give the Italian "comrades," who were so soundly beaten at the election, a last-minute helping hand. The only statement made by a government official came from the French foreign minister, who has said quite clearly that he will judge the Italian government by how it behaves and what it does, not by the names of those forming it. This does not worry me at all. However, I concur absolutely with Scalfaro's reply. [Caviglia] Nevertheless, you have had some problems with the foreign press, including papers that are not left-wing. [Fini] A distinction must be drawn here between those that are in bad faith and those that are ill-informed. There are papers that do not even have a correspondent in Italy and merely copy what the Italian dailies write. As soon as the government has been finalized, I will ask for a meeting with the foreign press, and you will see that everything will go more smoothly afterwards. [Caviglia] So Italy runs no risk whatsoever of international isolation? [Fini] None at all. The debate has arisen partly with an eye to the Italian political battle and partly in view of the European elections. There are fears of a heavy defeat for the Left in France and Spain. It will all die down once the government has taken its first foreign policy measures and everyone has realized there is no need to worry. Anyway, all they need to do is look at what the four MSI [Italian Social Movement] deputies are doing in Strasbourg. The one thing that cannot be said is that they have been singing the praises of fascism. One is Pino Rauti... [Caviglia] Who, nevertheless, still regards himself as a fascist, does he not? [Fini] He is the one to ask about that. [Caviglia] And what about your views on Europe? Is there not a risk that they will widen the rift between Italy and Strasbourg as well? [Fini] The functioning of the European Union is an extremely serious matter. Political unity is practically nonexistent in Europe. There is strong financial, but not economic unity. Anyway, who is to decide what Europe must be like? The German central bank or the national parliaments and the various peoples? Italy is paying the price of a European policy without originality, which in some cases has even sacrificed our national interests. We do not want to withdraw from Europe, but Europe as it is emerging is serving the interests of its peoples less and less and those of the financial centers more and more. [Caviglia] And what about your relations with the Right in the other countries? Which is preferable: Chirac's Right or Le Pen's? Kohl or the Republikaner? [Fini] Everyone knows I have no political regard for the Republikaner in Germany. As far as France is concerned, in a European context I certainly prefer Chirac's Right to that of Le Pen. It is more difficult to judge at the national political level. [passage omitted]
