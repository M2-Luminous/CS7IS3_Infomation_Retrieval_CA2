Thai and Indonesian officials and their private sectors in particular were delighted about the outcome of the meeting. Their Malaysian counterparts, who before the meeting were said to have difficulty joining the project, turned out to be more willing than expected to make necessary adjustments. The Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai governments will consider all business councils' proposals under the growth triangle project before submitting their decisions to the third ministerial meeting in May, in Medan, Indonesia. Ministers from the three countries agreed to accept the private sector's proposals at the meeting yesterday. They also signed "agreed minutes" as a record of what they discussed. Thai and Indonesian private sectors have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly invest in the growth triangle. The Malaysians need to sort out some problems before joining the move. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Panitchaphak and National Economic and Social Development Board Secretary-General Dr Phisit Phakkasem as well as the Thai private sector were pleased about the outcome of the meeting. Dr Suphachai said the meeting agreed to endorse the Asian Development Bank's [ADB's] study on the growth triangle, but recommended the bank's study, which will be submitted to the third ministerial meeting, should take into consideration the following issues: -- The ADB's report should emphasise the competitiveness of this scheme with other projects; -- it should look at the possibilities of investment from investors outside the region; -- it should have much more details of energy and power investment -- its comments should contain more details. Dr Suphachai said the meeting also adopted the business councils' proposals. Before the third ministerial meeting begins, the governments are to come up with decisions on the business councils' proposals, if not all of them. "I can say that the success of the project at this meeting came as a result of sincerity shown by the three countries. In the past we thought about our government first," Dr Suphachai said. Tun Daim Zainuddin, minister coordinating the project for Malaysia, said he would submit all business council proposals to the Malaysian Government as soon as possible. He thought the Malaysian Government would come up with some decisions on three joint proposals between Thailand and Malaysia. These proposals are to open the border for 24 hours a day, to reduce from five cents to one cent a kilo the fee Malaysia charges on marine product imports from Thailand, and use of Thai packaging containers to carry Thai marine products. He said although the Malaysian Government could not open the border between Thailand and Malaysia for 24 hours, it might lengthen the opening time. Thai investors should join Malaysian investors to produce packaging containers, Mr Zainuddin suggested. Before reducing the fee on marine product imports, the Malaysian Government would look at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because it was afraid that the change would run counter to the pact. A cut would have to apply to all countries not just Thailand. However, he said the border opening hours and marine product packaging problems would be resolved before the third ministerial meeting. Malaysia would have answers on these issues for Thailand. If the Malaysian Government could not accommodate such proposals, it would have strong reasons. Malaysia wanted to see tourists from the region require only border passes, not passports, when entering one another's countries. Mr Hartarto, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade, said his Government would consider all proposals to remove trade and tariff barriers for Thai and Malaysian investors. But their removal would be within the framework of the GATT agreement. He said Thais would be the first to invest in Indonesia under the project. Kasit Phirom, the Thai ambassador to Indonesia, said he would go to Medan to help Thais examine investment in Medan. He will ask the Transport and Communications Ministry and Thai Airways International to consider new flights for investors in the region. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, during his trip to Indonesia on February 6 and 7, will discuss with him ways to help Thais who want to invest in Indonesia. Mr Kasit said he would look at the investment laws of the two countries, investment locations, promotion and transport. He will discuss investment promotion methods with the Tourism Office, commercial consultants in Indonesia, THAI, and companies already involved in Indonesia such as Charoen Phokphan or Bangkok Bank. The Thai Embassy will hold an exhibition in Indonesia twice, one in Surabaya and another in Medan. The exhibition in Medan will be in the first half of this year. Dr Phisit said the second meeting of the project was successful because these countries had the same level of development.
