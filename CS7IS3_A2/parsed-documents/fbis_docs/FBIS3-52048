Recent revelations from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, one of the historical leaders of the revolutionary process, regarding failed negotiations for the solution of the dispute, have brought to the table this affair, which was broadly discussed by local specialists over recent times. The accusations that on 25 May 1978 then U.S. President James Carter leveled against Cuba for alleged participation in the attack by Katanguese troops on the Province of Shaba in southern Zaire, shattered the possible start in New York of the Cuba-U.S. dialogue. According to Rodriguez, he was to hold a secret meeting that day with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to begin the search for a solution to the crisis between the two governments, which at that time was already two decades old. "That battle -- he said -- ended with the clarification of the truth: Cuba had not participated whatsoever in the adventure (in that African country), but the opportunity to start negotiations had passed." Three lusters after the failed negotiation attempt, Rafael Hernandez, head of the Inter-American Relations Department at the nongovernmental American Studies Center (CEA), is one who believes that the regional situation is very favorable for normalization of the ties between Cuba and the United States. The Latin American countries have gradually improved -- since the beginning of the 70's -- their relations with the island, the majority recognize Cuba's determination for national independence and sovereignty and even advise that Washington's policy hinders international free trade and is counterproductive and harmful for the Cuban people, he says. In his article "Learning From the Cold War: The U.S. Policy Towards Cuba and Vietnam," which recently appeared in the CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA magazine, the analyst remembers that even today Cuban exiles interfere in the adoption of a rational policy by Washington toward Havana. The most dramatic impact of a new U.S. policy toward Cuba would be precisely on the conduct of the U.S.-Cuban community, he warns. In a panel discussion held in mid-December 1993, on the 15th anniversary of the CEA, the investigator returned to the subject and spoke about the possible solution of the conflict between the two countries. The analysis -- he said back then -- must start from two basic premises: The impossibility of sidelining the antagonistic interests and values that separate Cuba and the United States (beyond the greater or lesser will for a diplomatic arrangement) and the fact that the accounting of costs and benefits in a general scenario of negotiation is not to be reduced to something as simple as balancing a checkbook. According to his criteria, the main cost Washington will have for mending its diplomatic agenda with Havana is dealing with attitudes and predispositions established over three decades in the security and foreign relations organizations and in Congress. Also, [Washington] will have to recognize the Cuban Government in fact and by law and return to Cuban sovereignty the Guantanamo Naval Base, a naval and aerial resource in the Caribbean it has held for almost a century. However, he adds, that last action will allow an improvement in the relations and an exploration of forms of constructive coexistence between the armed forces of the two countries and will ease -- in fact -- cooperation in topics such as the struggle against drug trafficking, naval and aerial security, among others. Other benefits the White House could obtain at the negotiating table are the awakening of a political basis of interest groups -- especially economic -- which up to now do not work as lobbies [previous word in English] due to the rigidity of the U.S. policy toward the island. Also, the total or partial lifting of the blockade will benefit the U.S. private sector and eliminate a point of discord with Latin America and several industrialized countries and a tense topic in the deliberations of international organizations. The solution of the conflict with the northern neighbor means for Cuba immediate benefits: The mere reduction of the hostility favors its national interests, makes possible access to new markets and the flow of capital, and broadens the surface of bilateral contact. However, rapprochement with the United States also has costs for Cuba, says Hernandez. In the first place, the rapprochement between the two countries, although seen as necessary in purely economic terms, may divide national consensus on the political and ideological planes at a time when cohesion is of strategic importance. Also, the presumed irruption of U.S. capital in the Cuban economy -- amid a process of reforms -- could be counterproductive. That, without ruling out the possibility that Washington may seek to influence the business community with regard to Cuba by counseling or tutoring the monetary flow so as to favor determined political processes. In any event, the topic of U.S.-Cuban dialogue is currently moving only in the field of speculation. Cuba, recently said Foreign Minister Robaina, cannot decide whether it will make changes in those ties, because its definitions have already been established and it is Washington who has to alter its policy.
