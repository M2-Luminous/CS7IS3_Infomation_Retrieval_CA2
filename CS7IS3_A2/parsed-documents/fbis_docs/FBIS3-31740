A faxed communique from the Higher Military Council of the Romanian Army stresses that the meeting examined the attacks contained in the press communiques of the leadership of the Greater Romania Party [PRM] and in the slanderous and insulting articles published in the magazines owned by Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor -- ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA -- against generals and high-ranking officers in the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense, including the minister of defense. The speakers reported on the real situation in various spheres of military activity, about which these publications made denigrating allegations. The Higher Military Council considers those accusations totally groundless and an unprecedented act of political pressure aimed at hampering the implementation of the principles of reform in the military as well as the development of normal activities in the army. The Higher Military Council also expresses its trust in the ministry's leadership and in the military cadres unjustly insulted and accused, the communique mentions among other things. The Army Higher Military Council assures Romania's president, the other democratic institutions of the state, and the country's citizens that the army will remain an element of stability and support for the democratic progress of Romanian society, while persisting in continuing its own process of restructuring and modernization, despite all the inherent or artificially created hardships because of irresponsible actions -- the faxed communique from the Army Higher Military Council points out in conclusion.
