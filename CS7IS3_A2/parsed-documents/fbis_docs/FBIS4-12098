The source said that one of the secret agreement's provisions was Israel's agreement to allow 35 Palestinian deportees, all Fatah members, to return to the occupied territory. It is believed that these deportees will constitute a part of the security and administrative apparatus of the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The agreement also provides for the revival of the Hebron Municipal Council under the chairmanship of Mustafa al-Natshah. According to the same source, a list of the names of the 35 deportees is being prepared in Tunis. It is believed that the list will include names whose repatriation was requested by the PLO and rejected by Israel last year. The list, which will be submitted to Israel tomorrow, is expected to include Muhammad Dahlan, former official in charge of Fatah in the Gaza Strip; Jibril al-Rajub, former official in charge of Fatah in the central sector of the West Bank and current director of the commander in chief's office in Tunis; Samih Subayhat and Marwan al-Barghuthi, two Fatah activists who occupied the post of Bir Zayt University Students Union chairman at different times; Akram Haniyyah, former editor of the paper AL-SHA'B and current personal adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat; and Ahmad al-Dik, formerly a prominent Fatah figure in the West Bank and son-in-law of the late Khalil al-Wazir (Abu-Jihad). It is believed that by agreeing to allow the repatriation of 35 deportees, Israel was trying to compensate for the killing of six Fatah members in Gaza last Tuesday. [passage omitted]
