Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the Serb forces, described as "not allowable" and "one-sided" a decision made by Michael Rose, commander of the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia to open the bridge "brotherhood and unity" beginning Monday [28 February] noon. "If needed, we will resort to military means" to prevent the opening, he said in a statement issued this evening. He pointed out that the bridge should be opened under an agreement to be signed by Serbs and Muslims, with the mediation of UN special envoy in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. According to a UN plan to restore peace in Sarajevo, the bridge will be open on Monday and so will be the roads linking the city with the outside. Opening of the bridge "brotherhood and unity" would connect the Muslim-dominated inner-city area in Sarajevo with the part held by Serbs for the first time since the Bosnian capital came under siege in April 1992. Earlier reports reaching here said the United Nations expected the bridge to be guarded by UN peacekeepers and Serb and Muslim troops. Meanwhile, Milovanovic also said Serbs neither agreed with the UN-announced new ways for humanitarian relief operations. He was referring to Sunday's decision by the United Nations to move relief convoys through Bosnia without asking for permission from the warring factions. The Serb general stressed that any relief convoy and other UN vehicles should not move through Serb-held territory without permission, warning that otherwise, serbs will "prevent their movement with weapons." He accused UN peacekeepers of having shipped weapons and ammunition to Muslims in the past and added that no humanitarian worker has been killed on Bosnian Serb territory. Earlier reports said that a relief convoy will be heading for Sarajevo Monday, moving through lands controlled by Muslims, Croats and Serbs without asking for permission as expected by the United Nations. Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN troops and the aircraft of the north atlantic treaty organization will provide air cover and use arms if it is intercepted.
