Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent jamming of the aileron or elevator, accomplish the following: (a) Within 500 hours time-in-service or 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, perform an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves, in accordance with Saab Service Bulletin 340&hyph;51&hyph;012, dated November 10, 1993. (b) If a cove has conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net), no further action is required by this AD for that cove. (c) If a cove does not have conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net), prior to further flight, perform a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the elevator or aileron cove, in accordance with the Saab Service Bulletin 340&hyph;51&hyph;012, dated November 10, 1993. (1) If no delamination is found, repeat the detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 hours time-in-service in accordance with the service bulletin.
