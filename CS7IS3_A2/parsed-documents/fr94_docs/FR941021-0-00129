(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of DOE awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.

(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority wned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product. (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement. (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.
