Bolotina, Surgery Department of the Moscow Medical Institute; UDC 616.379-008.64:617.58-002.4]:615.246.2+615.38] [Abstract] Recent studies showing the important role of hemostatic and hemorheologic impairments in the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy and the development of purulent necrotic lesions in the lower extremities in diabetic patients prompted an examination of the efficacy of hemosorption in treating diabetic gangrene patients and an attempt to ascertain its role in correcting the hemostatic disorders of blood circulation. To this end, 159 diabetic patients with trophic and purulent necrotic foot and calf lesions were observed, and 18 male and 12 female patients were examined. Diagnostic tests were used for analyzing the hemostatic system. Extracorporeal hemosorption was conducted together with conservative therapy which included carbohydrate metabolism correction by means of subcutaneous insulin injection and hemo- and rheocorrector treatment, antibacterial and immunotherapy, etc. Hemosorption facilitated an increase in the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic plasma activity and improved peripheral circulation, making it possible to expand indications for ``minor'' foot amputations and lower the number of high amputations to 13.3%. On average, the use of complex therapy with hemosorption shortened the diabetic ulcer preparation by 5-7 days. Figures 3; references 8: 7 Russian, 1 Western.
