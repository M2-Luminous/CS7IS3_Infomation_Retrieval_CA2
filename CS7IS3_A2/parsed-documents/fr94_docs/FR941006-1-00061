FR941006-1-00061 FR941006-1-00013 Based upon the studies and practices noted above, the FHWA has determined that three years safe driving experience with the vision deficiency not only allowed for sufficient adjustment by drivers to the condition, but also provided for the longest period of experience for which records were uniformly available from which to predict future performance. As noted above, the California study was limited to a two-year base period because, like many jurisdictions, the accumulation of accurate driver histories does not exceed three years. The use of a three-year base period improves the predictability of the future period because the longer the period, the more likely the elimination of random anomalies. (See Bates and Neyman, University of California Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Therefore, the FHWA believes it has required and applied a sufficiently long period of safe driving to project continued safe driving over a future period of the same duration. The FHWA accepted only those drivers with no chargeable accidents for the three-year period of most recent driving experience. This translated into no chargeable accidents, as verified through motor vehicle records, in approximately 300 million vehicle miles travelled (VMT), as reported by the applicants. Although the FHWA certainly could not conclude that this rate would remain at zero, some of the studies noted above concluded that the correlation between the accident experience of the same individual over two different time periods was strongest when the rate of accidents was lowest. Moreover, the FHWA is confident that the chargeable accident rate of the general commercial driving population over three years could not be less than 0. In fact, the chargeable accident rate for the year 1991, the year prior to the inception of the vision study, for the general truck driving population was 0.46 per 1 million vmt. If the waived drivers were not permitted to continue to drive, they would have to be replaced by other drivers. These ``replacement'' drivers come from the general commercial driving population, which includes new, inexperienced commercial drivers. The FHWA has established that the chargeable accident rate for the general commercial driving population for the year 1992 well exceeds that of the drivers participating in the vision waiver program. Information about the past performance of new, inexperienced commercial drivers, many of whom are younger in age, does not exist. Studies have shown, however, that younger drivers of passenger vehicles produce the highest accident rates. Consequently, the agency required a three-year experience factor for applicants to the waiver program as a means of eliminating a similar risk posed by inexperienced commercial drivers. See Wyckoff, D. Truck Drivers in America, D.C. Heath & Co., Lexington, Mass. 1979. The good driving record demonstrated by the waiver applicants not only required the absence of chargeable accidents over a three-year period, but also the absence of serious traffic violations and no more than two minor traffic violations. According to the California Driver Record Study mentioned above, this is the best predictor of future safe driving. The requirement of three years safe driving experience with the vision deficit severely limited participation by the highest accident-risk age group. Each driver's application was individually examined, any missing information was required to be furnished, and each driver was measured against the waiver standards to assure that all the conditions were met, i.e., individualized determinations were made on the basis of complete data submitted by each applicant, to determine eligibility for participation in the waiver program.
