Clinton had had quite a fruitful trip, yet naturally it was not without unaccomplished tasks. The further establishment of the loose relations between the United States and its West European allies was the U.S. President's first achievement. Since the cold war ended, with the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, the disintegration of the the Soviet Union, and the changes in the balance of strength on the European continent, West European nations' wish to run their own business independently has been rising with each passing day. At the NATO summit in Brussels on 10-11 January, the United States "delegated power" and the summit approved that the West European Union may, when necessary, use NATO's armaments to execute actions without participation of the United States. This decision suits the reality of West Europe today, so all the member nations were very happy about it. To the United States, this decision stabilizes relations across the Atlantic Ocean and also safeguards U.S. interests. The second achievement was the signing with Russia and Ukraine a treaty on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in Ukrainian territory. According to the treaty, Ukraine is to destroy 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,500 nuclear heads deployed in its territory. Clinton felt relieved. One should know that this was a thorn in the side of the United States that it had always wanted to remove. Now they have done it, at last. The third achievement was the meeting with Syrian President al- Asad in Geneva, Switzerland, in which he urged Syria to reach an agreement with Israel on the Golan Heights. This gesture was meant to show the world that the United States has played a role in the peace process in the Middle East. Clinton scored on diplomacy. Of all the unaccomplished tasks, the most conspicuous one was how the "peaceful partnership" plan could be implemented. This plan was put forward by the United States and approved at the NATO summit. It was designed to slow down the pace of four Central European nations, namely, Poland, Hungary, Czech, and Slovakia, joining NATO and not to cause Russia to feel insecure about the NATO's eastward expansion. The four Central European nations thought the United States was not friendly enough and was quite unhappy about it, though there was hardly anything they could do. But ironically, there have been criticisms on this plan from among NATO member states. German Chancellor Kohl hinted that the future European Union may consider accepting Central European countries first. French President Mitterrand put it point-blank by emphasizing that the "peaceful partnership" plan had not been put forward by France and France rementioned the concept of a "Federation of European States," which is to include Central and East Europe nations. That this plan has already caused such controversy since it was set forth just a few days ago seems to indicate that greater fun is yet to come!
