In his letter, Alojz Englis stressed that the Finance Ministry fundamentally violated trade union rights by a decision calling on the trade unions that are members of the confederation to present their account books outlining their assets to appropriate tax bodies by 31 March. Englis pointed out that he will inform the international trade union headquarters about this, and, if the Finance Ministry does not change its stance, he will forward an official complaint to the International Labor Organization about the violation of trade union rights in Slovakia.
