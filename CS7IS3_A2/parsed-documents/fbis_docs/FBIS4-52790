Mr. J. Gwyn Morgan, EU ambassador to Vietnam-head of the delegation of the Commission of the European Communities, was speaking at a press conference held in Hanoi in May 11 afternoon on the occasion of seminar entitled Single European Market organized in the city from May 11-12. The seminar provided information about the single European market, the role and functioning of the EU, including EU-Vietnamese bilateral relations, legal matters, technical standards, marketing and distribution of which main branches are textiles, garments, processed food and food processing, seafood, tropical fruit and vegetables, footwear, leather and leather products. The seminar was held by EC with assistance from the Societe General de Development S.A., OAV (the German East Asia Association), Ernst and Young, and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Trade. In the years 1986-1990, the two-way trade value between EC and Vietnam increased 100 million ECU every year. In 1993 alone it exceeded one billion U.S. dollars, Mr Morgan noted. He said he hoped before autumn a framework agreement of cooperation between the EU and Vietnam would be signed. First of all, he said, a coordination office of EU will be opened in Hanoi in June this year. On EC programme relating to Vietnamese non-refugees from camps in Southeast Asia, he said the programme would conclude at the end of Nov. 1994. That does not mean the EU will not continue to be concerned in the international and bilateral efforts to the Vietnamese Government to help the refugees return, he stressed.
