He said that because of inadequate financing the agency cannot afford rapid checking of the reactors. "The government can economize on everything, except safety at nuclear facilities," Adamchik said. He said safety at first generation power units was discussed at an international conference in Obninsk held under the auspices of the International Nuclear Energy Agency. In addition to Russia it was attended by 12 West and East European countries as well as Japan. The conference stressed the burning need to modernize first generation stations depending on the economic and political situation in each country.
