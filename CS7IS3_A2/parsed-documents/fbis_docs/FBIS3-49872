"It seems that what certain people within the UN system try to do is always always find a new fresh general not as creative as the previous one," Sacirbery said during a BBC interview. "It seems any time a commander in Bosnia finally is convinced that the status quo needs to change, that's when someone decides the commander himself needs to be changed." Sacirbey was reacting to France's annoucement Tuesday that it was pulling out General Jean Cot from ex-Yugoslavia by the end of March and replacing him with another general. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had asked for Cot to be replaced before his mandate ends on June 30 and had criticized the general for asking to be given the power to order air strikes. Sacirbey said Western powers have continously overlooked their stated commitment to Bosnia. "It seems everyone is eager to forget the commitments made by NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)," he said. According to a UN Security Council resolution adopted in May 1993 Butrus-Ghali is the only person that can call for NATO air strikes in former Yugoslavia.
