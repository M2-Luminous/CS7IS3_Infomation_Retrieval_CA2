Here is a report by Robert Rakar: [Begin recording] [Rakar] Immediately upon his election, the new interior minister, Andrej Ster, in an interview for our radio station said that he was very satisfied with the outcome of the vote and especially with the number of votes in support. Regarding his future work in the ministry he said: [Ster] The tasks are not in short supply. In addition to the present ones new tasks will arise daily. The fact is that a conflict replacement or replacement that would drag on over a longer period of time in uncertainty could very much delay if not interrupt some pretty important projects that are currently underway in the ministry. I see my role primarily here. I have absolutely no illusions about the capabilities that I have. I intend to work to the best of my ability and knowledge, together with a ministry team that I believe is rather good. [passage omitted] [end recording]
