In two of the three communiques, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN appeals to the nation and international communities. They are classical communiques by Subcommander Marcos. Nonetheless, one of them attracts more attention because the EZLN openly criticizes the government, pointing out that the reports saying peace agreements have been reached are false. The EZLN says that the first stage of the dialogue has concluded, but this only means precisely that, the first stage of the dialogue has concluded. No specific agreements have been reached for signing a peace agreement. The communique points out that consultations continue to be held in Lacandona jungle, in the EZLN-controlled communities, and that these consultations will continue. The important thing to remember is that one must not think this first dialogue has led to the signing of specific agreements. The EZLN points out that a lot still remains to be done. Regarding this communique which circulated today in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation, was here in San Cristobal de las Casas. First, he met with the coleta [natives of San Cristobal de las Casas] community to discuss the problems that have arisen within this dialogue process causing serious unhappiness among many of the residents of the area. They have had problems with their normal lives, and now they have another problem stemming from the land squatters. Let us listen to what Manuel Camacho Solis had to say in the news conference when he referred to all of this and settled some doubts on the most recent EZLN communique dated 15 March, which we received here today. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am going to be very brief, as I am about to leave and return to Mexico City. I want to report on two very important points. The first refers to the meeting I had with the various groups from the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, where there has been a certain amount of tension. We have reached an atmosphere of cordiality, however, and we have searched for the path of reconciliation for everyone, and all the groups fully support the entire peace dialogue process occurring in the State of Chiapas, particularly the city of San Cristobal. Concerning the dialogue, I would like to take advantage of my visit here to strongly insist on a point that the media has not made sufficiently clear and which could cause confusion. The point is: The EZLN presented its list of demands. The government, through me, made a counteroffer. This counteroffer is being presented to the communities for consideration. At no time, has it been said... [pauses] nor can it be said that these are the points of the agreement. We have made a lot of progress because we were able to establish a dialogue, but these discussions are most important. If the situation is not sufficiently clear, this could create the wrong idea among the communities with regard to the good will there has been in the entire peace process. I want to ask you to help us with this clarification because otherwise the wrong idea about the nature of the process could be reached. Now, the most important thing is that there are two basic issues: One, this is a process of searching for peace, which we are going to pursue regardless of the circumstances. Two, this is what allowed us to hold a dialogue. The dialogue is of great value. We are not going to stop talking under any circumstances. We have learned that the EZLN is a serious organization with leaders that have clear political ideas, and this factor is going to help us overcome any confusion and tension which is sometimes generated by the wrong interpretation of public messages. I repeat: There was a list of demands; the government countered with a proposal that is being presented for consultation and approval by the communities. Second, we are pursuing the path of peace, dialogue, and a political solution which will not be changed. This commissioner is fully committed to overcoming any confusion and continuing to move forward on the path the State of Chiapas and all of Mexican society wants. I think this clarifies the two important points. The situation in San Cristobal is clear; the points of conflict will be resolved. This afternoon, I met with all sectors of society. Therefore, the correct atmosphere for the peace process prevails here. The other central point is about the meeting, which I think is very important, to clearly establish that we respect the procedures and what we talked about in San Cristobal with the EZLN. Thank you very much [end recording] [passage omitted]
