The results of the first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of the general election showed that the last apartheid system, which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born. The vast number of black people being oppressed under the racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they, together with white people, have become masters of the country. The success of the first multiracial general election in South Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of the South African people and the African people as a whole, but was also an event of great historical significance in, and with far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We extend warm congratulations to them. In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people of South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to fight for South African black people's equal political and economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties, underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts. However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of most political parties cherished the spirit of racial reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process of peace and democracy in South Africa. Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations, other international organizations, and the international community as a whole have also made positive contributions to supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because the struggle of the South African people won extensive support and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving people inside and outside the country, the situation in South Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's progress. The success of the first whole-people-involved election in South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the course of racial reconciliation and national peace and stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace, and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.
