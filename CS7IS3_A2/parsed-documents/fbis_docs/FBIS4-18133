Several members of the commando are well-known members of the FLNC [Corsican National Liberation Front]-Historic Channel, a source close to the investigation in Paris explained. They apparently include a journalist from the Marseilles press and a nationalist wanted for a 1988 Christmas murder committed in a bar in Ajaccio, who went underground after being sentenced in absentia. Should the operation mounted by the island's gendarmerie and police, backed up by the RAID [Research, Assistance, Intervention, and Dissuasion Unit of the national police force], on the night of Sunday 27 March in Bonifacio be seen as a kind of tit-for-tat response, as is being suggested in Corsica by some observers who think that the government has so far tried to play for time by handling the nationalists carefully? On 16 February, the FLNC-Historic Channel announced the end of the truce in assaults which it had observed since 22 June 1993. [passage omitted] However, the first major operation by the FLNC in Corsica failed on Sunday 27 March because of the steps taken by Police Chief Jean-Pierre Lacave. Several dozen men were asked to take part in a major assault intended to destroy the village of Piantarella (26 residential apartments) built in the tourist center of Sperone, which contains the island's only big golf course. The operation seems to have been meticulously organized and the deployment of these men involved the use of land and sea resources. But police headquarters had specific information which justified the dispatch of the RAID to Corsica. Impressive Arsenal In all, 120 police and gendarmes were involved. First, four individuals responsible for neutralizing the guards were detained, then 10 others who were to plant explosives in the development. Shots were exchanged without anybody being injured. Some members of the commando group were probably able to flee. During the day, two vehicles, one of which had been set on fire, and an 11-meter motor boat, also set on fire -- it had probably been used to bring some of the commandos to the spot -- were discovered in the area. An impressive arsenal was seized: 60 bottles of butane gas, around 60 kg of explosives (dynamite and plastic explosives), six assault rifles, and 10 handguns, grenades, and detonators. The success of this operation, the first of its kind since Corsica has suffered clandestine nationalist violence, suggests that following the lengthy period of dialogue launched by Pierre Joxe and continued by [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, the government is now determined to put an end to erroneous methods which do not have the public's approval. The supporters of the FLNC, who are found within Cuncolta Naziunalista and its satellite organizations, gathered outside the Ajaccio police headquarters where the 14 people detained are being held. During the night of Monday 28 March, they were dispersed by the police, who used tear gas in response to stone-throwing and trash can fires. The detained activists will be transferred to Paris to appear before the 14th section of the public prosecutor's office responsible for terrorist cases.
