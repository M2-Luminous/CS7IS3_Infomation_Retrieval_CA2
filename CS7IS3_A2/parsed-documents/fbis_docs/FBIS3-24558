Aliyev and G.A. Mamedova (Azerbaydzhan State Petroleum Academy, Baku, Azerbaydzhan) under the ``System Control Using Incomplete Information'' rubric] [Abstract] The objective of the article is to develop methods for identification and optimum control of fuzzy systems and using the methods in an existing coking process. Equations for identification of fuzzy functional and dynamic systems are derived. Theorems on the exact solution of fuzzy equations are given (without proof). Equations describing optimum control of fuzzy dynamic systems are presented. The results were used for identification and optimum control of a coking process (processing of heavy residual oil for producing oil coke). The method proposed for systems described with fuzzy difference equations is based on minimizing a fuzzy functional using regular and expanded arithmetics operations. To solve identification problems for systems described with fuzzy relational equations it is proposed to use an identification method based on exact solution of fuzzy relational equations. The method for optimum control of systems with a fuzzy criterion is based on modification of a fuzzy analog of the dynamic programming method for deterministic systems with fuzzy control restrictions. The proposed method was used for developing a fuzzy model of the coking process and for stating and solving the problem of termination control of the coking process. References 6
