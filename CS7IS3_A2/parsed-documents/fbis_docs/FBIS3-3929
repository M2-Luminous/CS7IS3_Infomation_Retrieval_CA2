Some enterprises in the coal, metal, electricity, machinery and petro-chemical industries would be helped to meet their debts, pay wages and maintain normal production. The reports said the State Council would select which enterprises would be helped. Meanwhile, the State Economic and Trade Commission would join hands with other ministries in searching for a solution to the problem of so-called triangular debts, those owed by enterprises to each other. Documents compiled for NPC delegates acknowledge more state firms were running at a loss and that the chronic problem of triangular debts had worsened. The Ministry of Labour said an acute problem of the economy was growing losses in a considerable number of state enterprises. Worst hit were enterprises in the coal, textile, military, forestry and mechanical industries. The number of cases of suspension, or part suspension, of production has grown. "Some enterprises were only able to provide enough for the living expenses of workers. Some even failed to do this," the report said. Much had been done but the problem had not been solved. The State Council met earlier this month to discuss the issue and called for prompt action to maintain stability. The report said the Government would take immediate steps to solve livelihood issues facing the people while intensifying reform of state firms. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security reported an increase in public petitions last year over work-related matters. In Liaoning, a major bastion of state enterprises, some workers were not paid for up to two months. The provincial governor, Yue Qifeng, warned such problems could not be allowed to continue. Mr Yue said their state firms carried triangular debts of 46 billion yuan (HK$40.8 billion) last year, up from 36 billion yuan in 1992. Although no strikes took place in factories, the governor said more people have petitioned the Government for assistance.
