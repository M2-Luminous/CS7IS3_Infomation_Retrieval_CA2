FR940303-2-00172 FR940303-2-00093 Fleet average fuel economy for all MY 1993 passenger cars combined and for all light trucks combined exceeded the levels of the MY 1993 standards. Daihatsu terminated sales of its passenger cars and light trucks in the United States after MY 1992, the first major Asian manufacturer to do so. This manufacturer accumulated substantial CAFE credits during its 5-year marketing span in the United States, but the sales of this company's products reached such a low level that it apparently decided it was economically infeasible to remain. While one Asian manufacturer exited the United States market, another, Kia Motors, entered. Kia, a South Korean manufacturer, produces the Sephia sedan. It planned to test market a few thousand in MY 1993, with sales slated for October 1993 at 50 dealerships. Kia Motors also builds the Festiva model for Ford. Mazda reported a domestic passenger car fleet consisting of its 626 and MX6 model vehicles which are built in Flatrock, Michigan. These domestic-built vehicles do not appreciably affect the domestic fleet CAFE. The characteristics of the MY 1993 passenger car fleet reflect a continuing trend toward increased consumer demand for higher performance cars. (See Table II&hyph;3.) Compared to MY 1992, the average curb weight for MY 1993 decreased 62 pounds for the domestic fleet and decreased 14 pounds for the imported fleet. The total new car fleet is 36 pounds lighter than it was in MY 1992, primarily because of the larger share held by the domestic fleet. From MY 1992 to MY 1993, horsepower per/100 pounds, a measure of vehicle performance, increased from 4.48 to 4.56 for domestic passenger cars and from 4.66 to 4.72 for imported passenger cars. The total fleet average for passenger cars increased from 4.56 in MY 1992 to 4.62 horsepower/100 pounds in MY 1993, the highest level in the 38 years for which the agency has data. Average engine displacement decreased from 192 to 184 cubic inches for domestic passenger cars and 139 to 136 cubic inches for imported passenger cars. The size class breakdown shows an increased trend towards compact and midsize passenger cars and a decrease in subcompact and large passenger cars for the overall fleet. The domestic fleet shift is almost exclusively from subcompact and large passenger cars to compact and midsize passenger cars. The shift of imported cars to both the midsize and compact sizes is particularly pronounced. The imported share of the passenger car market declined slightly in MY 1993, but imported compact cars increased to 36.6 percent of the imported fleet in MY 1993 from just 32.0 percent in MY 1992 and now make up nearly 15 percent of the total new passenger car fleet.
