This law, of a constitutional nature, extends the mandate and power of the Disciplinary Board for Magistrates [JHM] beyond the implementation of the new Constitution approved by referendum. The law, which also represents a vote of confidence in the five JHM members for the outstanding job they have done so far despite a series of limitations, modifies the previous legislation in this respect; that is, in referring to the creation of this body as well as that vetoed by the President of the Republic which, although it had the same purpose, did not have constitutional validity. The scope of the new law will from now on, therefore, allow the JHM to definitely appoint the 18 Supreme Court justices, the 250 Appellate Court justices, and the 750 magistrates, including lower court and provincial judges. The new law also establishes that the JHM will terminate its functions once the National Council of Magistrates is established. This will entail a lengthy process, at least 18 months, until its seven members are elected. Obviously this is too much time to wait to begin the process of normalizing a state branch in which more than two-thirds of its officials are in their posts only provisionally, since the democratic institutions were dismantled on 5 April 1992. In practice, this means complete functional and individual instability without any support or guarantees regarding the government. This reveals an urgent need for the normalization of the Judicial Branch, whose utmost expression should not only be one of full independence, but also of absolute equality in relation to the other state branches. For this and other reasons, we pointed out a few days ago in this same column the need for a transitory solution, such as the one just approved: "...the appropriate path that should be taken is to grant the JHM a law, approved by Congress, which is broad and explicit enough to allow this body -- composed of exemplary lawyers -- to on this single occasion handle the problem that has surfaced by officially appointing the great majority of the judges currently on duty." Moreover, our judicial branch's many vices and defects -- which, it should be pointed out, have not been corrected, and have probably been made even worse by the circumstances -- have perhaps their worst expression in its absolute submission to the other branches, especially the Executive Branch, which under circumstances such as the current ones is implacable with magistrates who are not subservient. The problem is particularly serious as in the coming months the country is expecting a series of important cases to be heard by the Judicial Branch. Its reform, therefore, as well as the reform of the Attorney General's Office, must not only be complete and definitive, but also carried out as soon as possible. Aside from the basic aspects of the restoration of national institutionality, there are also some details of a practical nature. As we had noted previously, neither Peruvian citizens nor foreign investors have guarantees for their transactions in a juridically unstable country, "where the full autonomy and separation of the public branches is not freely exercised."
