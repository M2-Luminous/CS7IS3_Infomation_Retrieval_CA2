Salim Salih, Presidential Council member and YSP assistant secretary general, was scheduled to participate in the meeting. But political sources have said that Salim Salih has not gone to Sanaa. At a meeting in Aden two days ago, the Yemeni Council of Ministers decided to form a number of committees to implement provisions of the Document of Pledge and Accord. The council also decided to present a plan to arrest escaped suspects and prisoners. The work of these activities is connected with eliminating armed manifestations from the cities and returning military units to their positions. The work also includes drafting laws and regulations to codify relations and to define the powers and duties of the Presidential Council and of its president, vice president, and members in accordance with the Constitution. It further includes reviewing the Council of Ministers law and the Presidential Council bylaws. At an ordinary session held two days ago, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution mandating implementation of the Document of Pledge and Accord. On the other hand, Yemeni tribesmen kidnaped three Dutch engineers last Friday and demanded rent in return for the utilization of their lands by oil companies operating in Yemen. Official sources have said that the "Jaham" tribe has detained the three Dutchmen in the Khawlan area, located 100 km east of Sanaa, the capital. The same tribe last year kidnapped a U.S. diplomat and then released him unharmed. The Netherlands Foreign Ministry has said that its embassy in Sanaa is working with the Yemeni authorities to secure the release of the three engineers.
