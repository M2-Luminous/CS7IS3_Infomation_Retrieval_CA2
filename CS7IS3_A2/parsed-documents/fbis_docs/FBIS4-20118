This was nominally 3.6 percent more than last year, but 0.3 percent less after adjusting for inflation. The increase in overall labor productivity (real GDP per working person) was again 0.2 percent lower than the year before. In the course of the year the economy picked up steadily, as we have already reported, and grew by 0.8 percent during the fourth quarter. The fact that the recession was at least partly alleviated in Austria is shown by the growth of private and public consumption (plus 0.8 percent and 2 percent respectively in real terms). In foreign trade with goods the national economy lost 3.3 percent in real terms in exports and 3.5 percent in imports. Including services as well as "invisible goods," the exports undercut the level of 1992 by 1.7 percent in real terms; imports, on the other hand, rose by 0.2 percent. Prices for the available volume of goods and services rose by 3.2 percent in 1993, which was again less than those for the GDP at 3.9 percent. Given slightly declining import prices and slightly rising export prices, the terms of trade for domestic foreign trade once again improved compared with 1992. Construction Sector Experiences Revival The Association of Austrian Industrial Construction Enterprises (VIBOe) sees feeble signs of a recovery. While in 1993 they registered only a nominal increase in turnover of 1.7 percent to 123.875 billion, 1994 started out well. In January turnover amounted to 5.198 billion schillings, thus being 10.8 percent higher than in January 1993. Of that 2.91 billion schillings went to crafts and 2.288 billion to industry. The "traditional" winter unemployment in the construction sector continued to decline. At the end of January 1994 75,686 persons were employed, which is 2.4 percent more than during the same month last year.
