Regardless of the outcome of the elections, the club sets for itself the task of defending the interests of the middle class, which is where 43 New Initiative candidates belong. Mikhail Zhuravlev, formerly a deputy chairman of the city soviet commission on law and order issues, pointed out in the conversation with journalists the positive points in other blocs' programs in this respect, adding, however, that realization of all programs is possible only if the authority is free of corruption. Candidate Vitaliy Skoybeda (also a former deputy) said that his initial reluctance to run disappeared when he looked at the lists of other blocs--which, in his opinion, are not overflowing with the intellectual elite--and he now intends to enter the battle for a deputy seat.
