FR940208-1-00013 FR940208-1-00005 326 IAC 3&hyph;2.1 326 IAC 3&hyph;2.1 provides reporting requirements and specifies the facility operating conditions under which emission testing should be performed. The rule also prescribes specific testing procedures for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. It specifies that sources should use emission test methodologies set forth in 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix A, and 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix B. This is incorrect. The rule should cite 40 CFR Part 60, appendix A, rather than 40 CFR [part] 61, appendix A. In addition, the rule allows the State to authorize alternate emission test methods, changes in test procedure, or alternate operating load levels during tests. Such ``Commissioner's discretion'' is not acceptable to USEPA, for the reasons described below in section III. 326 IAC 3&hyph;3 326 IAC 3&hyph;3 prescribes sampling and analysis procedures for coal and fuel oil. Sources with total coal-fired capacity of 1500 or more MMBTU/hr actual heat input must collect composite samples daily, in accordance with specified American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedures. Sources with total coal-fired capacity between 100 and 1500 MMBTU/hr actual heat input must draw coal samples at least 3 times per day and at least once per 8-hour period, but may composite and analyze these samples monthly. It is not acceptable for facilities of this size to perform only monthly coal analysis to determine compliance. Monthly analysis will not ensure that the short-term SO 2 NAAQS will be protected. 326 IAC 3&hyph;3 does not specify coal sampling analysis procedures to be used by facilities with total coal-fired heat input capacity less than 100 MMBTU/hr. These small facilities are required by 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 to report coal analysis data, as collected pursuant to 326 IAC 3&hyph;3, but it is not clear whether each facility must use the coal sampling and analysis methods prescribed for the larger facilities or is expected to provide its own alternative method. This rule also allows ``Commissioner's discretion'' in prescribing and in performing alternate fuel sampling and analysis procedures. The USEPA believes that such discretion is unacceptable for the reasons described below in section III of this document. 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 sets forth general SO 2 emission limits for fuel combustion facilities with a potential to emit 25 tons per year or 10 pounds per hour of SO 2 . Facilities are also required to comply with specific emission limitations pursuant to 326 IAC 7&hyph;4, if applicable. 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 introduces SO 2 emission limits for oil-burning facilities. Facilities combusting residual oil may not exceed 1.6 pounds SO 2 per million British Thermal Units (lb/MMBTU) of SO 2 , and facilities combusting distillate oil may not emit more than 0.5 lb/MMBTU of SO 2 . 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 continues to state that facilities combusting coal may not emit more than 6.0 lb/MMBTU. Facilities which use both coal and oil simultaneously as fuel must adhere to the SO 2 emission limit for coal alone. Facilities which use both oil and any fuel other than coal simultaneously must not exceed the SO 2 emission limit for the oil alone. This rule allows facilities to meet their SO 2 emission limits by combining their usual fuel with lower-sulfur fuels. However, this rule fails to couple the lb/MMBTU emission limits with any applicable averaging time. The rule should require compliance with the emission limits on at least a three-hour basis in order to assure compliance with the short-term SO 2 NAAQS. Since the averaging time applicable to these emission limits is not made clear either in this rule or in other portions of Indiana's SO 2 SIP, 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1 cannot be approved. 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 specifies that compliance or noncompliance with emission limits can be determined by a stack test in accordance with the test methods in 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix A. Continuous emission monitoring data collected pursuant to 326 IAC 3&hyph;1 may be used to determine compliance with emission limits. 326 IAC 7&hyph;2 also requires facilities to report the results of fuel sampling and analysis. Fuel combustion sources with total coal-fired heat input capacity of 1500 MMBTU/hr or greater are to keep records of average daily coal sulfur content and SO 2 emission rate (in units of lb/MMBTU). Sources with total coal-fired heat input capacity between 100 and 1500 MMBTU/hr need only record and report average monthly coal sulfur content and SO 2 emission rate. Monthly coal analysis is not acceptable for facilities of this size. Long-term averaging does not assure compliance with the short-term SO 2 NAAQS, since shorter periods of high emissions may not be detected. Sources with total coal-fired heat input capacity less than 100 MMBTU/hr may submit either calendar month or annual average coal sulfur content and SO 2 emission data. While it may be reasonable for very small sources to have less stringent sampling and analysis requirements, the calculation and reporting of an annual average alone is not acceptable. This would not be an acceptable determination of continuous compliance.
