FR940826-2-00007 FR940826-2-00005 [A&hyph;588&hyph;833, and A&hyph;351&hyph;825] Notice of Postponement of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Stainless Steel Bar From Japan and Brazil AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kate Johnson or Irene Darzenta, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4929 or (202) 482&hyph;6320, respectively. Postponement On July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued affirmative preliminary determinations in the antidumping duty investigations of stainless steel bar (SSB) from Japan (59 FR 39739, August 4, 1994) and Brazil (59 FR 39732, August 4, 1994). On July 26, 1994, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido); Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi); Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo) (the three respondents in the Japanese investigation); Abe Bright Shaft Mfg. Co., Ltd.; Pacific Metals Co., Ltd.; Tohoku Steel Co., Ltd.; Yamashin Steel Co., Ltd.; and Kansai Metal Industry Co., Ltd. (other Japanese exporters), requested that the Department postpone the final determination in the Japanese investigation until 135 days after the publication date of the preliminary determination in the Federal Register , in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673d(a)(2)(A)). Daido, Aichi, and Sanyo are Japanese exporters which accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. On July 26, 1994, Acos Villares, S.A. (the Brazilian respondent), an exporter which accounted for a significant portion of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States, requested that the Department postpone the final determination in the Brazilian investigation until 135 days after the publication date of the preliminary determination in the Federal Register . In both of these investigations the respondents requested a postponement in order to permit the Department to align all of the related SSB investigations on one timetable, and thereby alleviate the administrative burden on all the parties. On July 29 and August 1, 1994, petitioners submitted comments opposing respondents' request for a postponement of the final determinations. In those submissions, petitioners claimed they would be adversely affected by a postponement because importers would have the option of posting a bond in lieu of paying cash deposits of estimated antidumping duties. Petitioners also asserted that there is no increase in the level of administrative convenience for any of the parties if the final determinations are postponed. The Department's regulations provide that upon the receipt of a proper request, the Department will postpone the final determination unless there are compelling reasons to deny the request (19 CFR 353.20(b)(1) (1994)). After considering the respondents' and petitioners' comments, we find that petitioners will not be adversely affected by a postponement of the final determinations. The preliminary results have already been issued and suspension of liquidation is already in effect. In addition, several of the SSB investigations have already been postponed. Given the complexity of these investigations as a whole, and the resulting increased burden on the Department to review and analyze the documents submitted in these investigations, aligning all the SSB investigations will ease the administrative burden on the Department. Therefore, in the context of these investigations, we have determined that the fact that respondents will be able to post a bond in lieu of paying an actual cash deposit for a slightly longer period does not rise to a compelling reason for denying the respondents' requests. Therefore, we are postponing the final determinations on Japan and Brazil to the full extent authorized under section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act. The final determinations will be issued not later than December 19, 1994, which is the due date for the previously extended investigations of SSB from India, Spain, and Italy. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments must be submitted in at least ten copies to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than November 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 15, 1994. In addition, a public version and five copies should be submitted by the appropriate date if the submission contains business proprietary information. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. If requested, hearings are tentatively scheduled on November 17, 1994, at 2:00 p.m. for the Japanese investigation and on November 17 1994, at 3:00 p.m. for the Brazilian investigation. Both hearings will be held at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 1414, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington D.C., 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time. This notice is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(d)) and 19 CFR 353.20(b)(2). Dated: August 16, 1994. Barbara R. Stafford, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21121 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
