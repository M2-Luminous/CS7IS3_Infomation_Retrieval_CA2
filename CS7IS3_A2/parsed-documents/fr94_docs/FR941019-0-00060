FR941019-0-00060 FR941019-0-00008 C. Election of Directors The Commission proposed a number of revisions to the proxy disclosure requirements relating to the election of directors, primarily to focus the requirements on information directly relevant to the qualifications, background, and relationships of directors and to eliminate information that is not pertinent to the election of directors. The proposed revisions included eliminating detailed disclosure concerning the investment adviser (including a certified balance sheet of the adviser), 16 the investment advisory contract, 17 and brokerage commission practices. 18 Commenters generally supported the elimination of this information on the basis that it has become ``boiler plate'' and is not relevant to the election of directors. The Commission is adopting its proposal with no changes and eliminating these requirements. 16 Rules 20a&hyph;2(a)(1)&hyph;(4) and 20a&hyph;2(a)(9) [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(a)(1)&hyph;(4) and (9)]. 17 Rule 20a&hyph;2(a)(6) [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(a)(6)]. 18 Rule 20a&hyph;2(a)(7)[17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(a)(7)]. The proxy rules currently require disclosure of whether a director presently has any relationships with fund affiliates. 19 The Commission proposed to expand this disclosure to require information concerning whether the director previously had a material interest in, or relationship with, the investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, or any of their respective affiliates. The Proposing Release requested comment on whether disclosure of past relationships should be limited to a specific period of time. Many of the commenters supported the proposed disclosure of past relationships. Of those commenting, most recommended limiting the disclosure of past relationships to the preceding five-year period, the same period as currently required for disclosure of business experience of directors and nominees under item 401(e) of Regulation S&hyph;K [17 CFR 229.401(e)]. 19 Rule 20a&hyph;2(a)(5) [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2(a)(5)]. The Commission is adopting the proposed disclosure of past relationships of directors and nominees with related parties and is limiting the required disclosure to past relationships that existed during the preceding five-year period. 20 The Commission believes that a five-year period will provide material information concerning past relationships. 20 Subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) of item 22. The Commission is adopting other modifications to the disclosure requirements it proposed for directors and nominees. These modifications, incorporated in item 22(b), include a description of non-routine litigation, specifically tailored for funds, in which a director or an affiliated person is a party adverse to the fund or any of its affiliated persons. 21 Another modification affects the current requirement for a list of all boards of directors on which a director serves. 22 As noted in the Proposing Release, disclosure of this information often results in long lists of other directorships of a director in the same fund complex that do not provide useful information to shareholders concerning the qualifications and competing responsibilities of a director or a nominee. The Commission proposed that, in lieu of providing the list, the proxy statement identify the fund complex and the number of directorships. Commenters generally supported this revision to the disclosure of other directorships, and the Commission is adopting the modification as proposed. 23 21 Subparagraph (b)(5) of item 22. 22 Item 7(b) of Schedule 14A requires this information by reference to item 401(e) of Regulation S&hyph;K. 23 Instruction to item 401(e) of Regulation S&hyph;K. As adopted, a fund is required to state, if applicable, that a director serves on the board of other funds in the identified fund complex and to specify the number of the boards on which the director serves. The amendment is applicable to disclosure documents and reports by all issuers (not only funds) that are required to provide the information about fund directorships called for by item 401(e). Item 401(e) would continue to require disclosure of information concerning service of a fund director as a director of companies that are not registered investment companies.
