FBIS4-24300 "drafr125_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Former High-Ranking MK Officers Appointed to SANDF Former High-Ranking MK Officers Appointed to SANDF MB2806192594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1419 GMT 28 Jun 94 MB2806192594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Cape Town June 28 SAPA -- The chief of staff of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing], Siphiwe Nyanda, has been appointed acting chief of staff of the South African National Defence Force [SANDF] with the rank of lieutenant-general. He is one of nine senior MK officers whose placement in top positions in the integrated SANDF were announced by Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise on Tuesday [28 June]. He said the curriculum vitae of officers from the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], were still being examined, and that the SANDF placement board would decide on where they should be accommodated. The former chief of the Transkei Defence Force, Major General T T Matanzima, had been appointed general officer commanding Eastern Province, with the same rank. Other appointments were (SANDF ranks): chief of Service Brigade: Lieut-Gen Lambert Moloi; chief of personnel SANDF headquarters: Major-Gen Andrew Masondo; chief of Army Staff: Maj-Gen J Tshali; chief director of logistics SANDF headquarters: Maj-Gen A Ismail; deputy chief of staff intelligence: Maj-Gen P Tshikare; commander of SA [South African] Army Command: Maj-Gen N Ngwenya; director inspections with special responsibility for human resources and women's rights: Brigadier J Molefe. Brigadier M Motau had been assigned to military intelligence. Mr Modise said the men were MK stalwarts who had held command for many years. Their ranks were based on their experience and their contribution to the democratic transformation in South Africa. Mr Modise also confirmed the positions of the present chiefs of the Army, Air Force and Navy, Lieut-Gen J H Pretorius, Lieut-Gen J Kriel and Vice Admiral R C Simpson. Other appointments -- including chief of staff intelligence -- would be made as the integration process proceeded. Mr Modise said Gen Nyanda's appointment would be made permanent after he had completed a training course over the next three years or so. There had been bitter complaints from the public and within the defence force about the standards of the non-statutory forces, and the SANDF was "accommodating these complaints". "We are going to empower our people to enable them to hold these jobs and acquit themselves in a manner in which we would like them to acquit themselves," he said. Chief of the SANDF General Georg Meiring said he was "quite happy" with the appointments. He expected the personnel of the SANDF to swell to about 120,000 over the next year with the incorporation of the homeland and non- statutory forces. This would then be rationalised over a period of three years back to the present "affordable" 91,000. Asked about the former head of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, Mr Modise said the senior appointments announced on Tuesday were not all those that had to be filled. "So when we reach him a decision will be taken and an announcement made," he said. The now-disbanded NPKF had been worth it in the sense that it was meant for a good cause. "They never had a chance really," he said. "It was originally planned to train them for nine months, but in effect they were trained for eight weeks." The issue of MK members being turned away when they tried to join the SANDF was a very serious one. The lists that had been drawn up as stipulated in the constitution would be looked at again. "Constitutionally there was a cutoff date, but we are doing everything we can to bring them in."
