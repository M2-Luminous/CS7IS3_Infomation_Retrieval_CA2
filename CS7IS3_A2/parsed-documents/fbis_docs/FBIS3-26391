Chairman Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, braved the severe cold and crossed mountain after mountain to travel through Shanxi. He brought with him the concern and warmth of the party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission to grass-roots units as well as to the hearts of the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals. He pointed out: Showing concern for the masses in all respects, relying on the masses in every matter, and gearing all our work toward the interests of the masses is the party's fundamental aim and working line as well as the party's vivid characteristic and political edge. Leading cadres and the vast number of party members should firmly remember the historical truth that people are the real heroes and origin of victory especially when times are more advanced and our undertakings more developed, and work more sincerely for the interests of the people. Our undertakings in building socialism with Chinese characteristics will then develop more vigorously. Accompanied by Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics Department; Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party committee; Acting Shanxi Governor Sun Wensheng; and Li Laizhu, commander of the Beijing Military Region, General Secretary Jiang Zemin successively inspected Xinzhou, Luliang, Yuncheng, Linfen, Taiyuan, and Jinzhong prefectures from 29 January to 3 February. He visited peasant families; schools; plants; mines; and barracks; as well as peasants; workers; officers and men of the People's Liberation Army; public security cadres and policemen; officers and men of the armed police force; school teachers and students; masses in old revolutionary and poverty-stricken areas; and cadres working at the grass-roots level. Wherever he went, he held intimate conversions with the masses, asked about their welfare, listened to their opinions and demands, and extended New Year greetings to them. On 29 January, Luliang prefecture was covered with a layer of snow and the temperature was 20 degrees Celsius below zero. Ignoring the severe cold and fatigue, Jiang Zemin went straight to Xingxian county's Caijiaya in the old revolutionary area. He visited the Jinsui Revolution Memorial Hall and called on veteran heroes, veteran revolutionaries, and martyrs' family members to convey his cordial greetings and take photographs with them. He earnestly told the cadres and people: The state power of the people's republic was established by revolutionaries of the older generation, and the party and government always remembers them. We must continue the martyrs' unfulfilled will, carry forward the contributory spirit of the people in old revolutionary areas, and work arduously to develop Luliang prefecture. General Secretary Jiang was worried about the people's lives in poverty-stricken mountain regions. Throughout his trip, he saw people busily buying goods for the Spring Festival, and was particularly pleased to see the joyous atmosphere. At about 1600 on the afternoon of 29 January, Jiang Zemin traveled through a 3-km long valley and came to Mingwanta village in Linxian county, Shanxi's largest poor county. Jiang Zemin walked briskly up the slope and entered the house of peasant Li Sier. He held the Li couple's hands and asked about their family, the size of their farm, grain production, and annual income. The young couple was moved by the party's concern, and they vowed to shake off their poverty to become well-off as soon as possible. Later, Jiang Zemin entered a low earthen cave dwelling, the home of poverty-stricken Liu Zhengyang. He held the hands of Liu Zhengyang's 71-year-old mother and asked about her welfare. He lifted the cooking pot cover and asked whether they had enough food, and checked the fireplace. He repeatedly reminded village cadres to look after poor households. Meanwhile, the masses who heard about the visit rushed to the scene. Standing on the undulating slope on top of the cave dwellings, they clapped their hands to welcome General Secretary Jiang. Jiang Zemin smilingly extended new year greetings to them all. The people said simultaneously: "General Secretary Jiang, you have worked hard. We hope you will come again." The heart of the party's general secretary was linked to those of the people, and the entire mountain village was submerged in a joyous and encouraging mood. Shanxi still has some poor areas. However, the arduous, pioneering, and hardworking spirit of the people and cadres in the poverty-stricken areas, as well as their firm belief in the party and socialist undertakings, deeply impressed the general secretary. Jiang Zemin said: If cadres of all levels always showed their concern for poverty-stricken areas, shared the joys and sorrows of the people, and upheld the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we would certainly achieve advanced results and change the outlook of poverty-stricken areas by adopting practical measures; promoting aid work for the poor; and maintaining our arduous struggle. We must be determined, adopt more good policies, and strive to accomplish the great task of eliminating absolute poverty in the entire country by the end of this century, to thoroughly solve the issue of the survival rights of Chinese people, who make up one-quarters of the world's population. This will not only be a great event in the history of Chinese people but also a magnificent feat in human history. He also stressed: The development and stability of the rural areas is always crucial to nationwide social development and stability. The tasks to strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy should not waver at anytime. We must not slacken, in the slightest degree, in the production of principal agricultural products such as grains, cotton, and edible oil. In Linfen city's Qiaoli village, Jiang Zemin carefully listened with great interest to what veteran party branch secretary Wang Yunkang said. Wang Yunkang, who has been a village cadre for 40 years, animatedly briefed Jiang Zemin on how his party branch had led local masses to adhere to the socialist course to achieve common prosperity, and on how he had made efforts to build up his village party branch. He said: A good party branch must be politically sensitive, ideologically correct, democratic in work style, and economically clean. In short, the party branch and the masses must stand together through thick and thin, and they should share joys and sorrows. After Wang Yunkang finished, the general secretary nodded and said applaudingly: You have done a great job and what you just said makes a lot of sense. Your experience shows the core of grass-roots work in rural areas is to build a good party branch. The primary reason why your village party branch has a unifying force, rallying power, and combat capability is that you have truly integrated the party's policy with your local reality, and have truly transformed the party central committee's guidelines into the masses' self-conscious act, thereby bringing economic prosperity to the village and making progress in your work in all areas. If village party branches across the country were like your party branch, our rural work would be much easier. Your experience also shows that once the rural areas' dual management system that combines household with collective operations, which is based on the establishment of the contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, is refined; once rural areas' agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery industries are developed; and once rural areas' collective economies have become stronger, the prospects for building new and modern socialist rural areas will be better and better. Jiang Zemin also told leading cadres accompanying him: Not only should rural areas work to consolidate their leading bodies, build up work forces, and improve work style, but party committees and governments at all levels should also insist on doing so. If we have strong leading bodies, competent work forces, and a good work style on all fronts, we will be able to stand the test of all kinds of difficulties and crises, and we will win victory after victory in our work. Jiang Zemin also visited Linxian county's project employing comprehensive measures to fight soil erosion; Yuncheng's project to develop shoals in the Huang He and its project of diverting the Huang He water for irrigation use; and the project to widen the Hongdong section of the 309 State Highway, which is an important road for the transportation of Shanxi's coal. He fully approved Shanxi's efforts since the beginning of this winter to mobilize office cadres, workers, school teachers and students, and troops to do voluntary work -- repairing roads and taking part in the construction of capital farming projects and other key projects. He told Hu Fuguo, Sun Wensheng, and other comrades that they had done a good job and hoped they would keep up their good work. He pointed out insightfully: In the construction of some public projects, it is necessary to call on office cadres and people of all trades to do some voluntary work. This has many benefits. It is one of our party's fine traditions as well as a practical expression of our socialist politics; it not only helps develop our material civilization but also helps develop our spiritual civilization, to cement solidarity among the masses, bring party-masses relations closer, and improve our leading style. Wherever he went, Jiang Zemin went deep down to inspect local factories and mining enterprises, and to extend his regards to workers. He visited the Yuncheng Plate Making Plant, Yongji Railway Electric Machinery and Devices Factory, Xishan Mining Bureau's Guandi Mine, and Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, and called on workers on the production forefront and their families. Jiang Zemin pointed out to cadres and workers of state-owned enterprises: Currently, state-owned enterprises are facing numerous difficulties. The party and government understand this very well and are always concerned about it. In developing the socialist market economy, state-owned enterprises -- especially large and medium enterprises that are closely related to the country's economic development and the people's livelihood -- must enhance not weaken their capabilities and must effectively prevent the loss of state assets, because these are a basic criterion for measuring the results of the reform of our economic system. All party members must have a very clear understanding of this. To improve the performance of state-owned enterprises, we must further transform the operating mechanisms, adjust the organizational structure, and adopt a modern enterprise management system. At the same time, these enterprises need necessary support from the state. In particular, workers of state- owned enterprises should work hand in hand, and fully bring their enthusiasm and creativity into play. On 3 February, Jiang Zemin held a discussion meeting at the Taiyuan Railway Subbureau, where he was briefed on rules regarding all-around implementation of ideological and political work. Workers and staff members throughout the subbureau have followed the work rules for eight years, achieved good results, and amassed considerable experience. During the discussion meeting, the general secretary pointed out: You have carried out meticulous and lively ideological and political work, during various periods, in all areas for which the subbureau is responsible, and in all fields of work carried out by the subbureau; this is commendable. The more we deepen reform and develop the economy, the more we should strengthen all aspects of ideological and political work in all lines of work. Jiang Zemin also held a discussion meeting with renowned model workers in Shanxi Province at the Xishan Mining Bureau, which was attended by model workers Li Shuangliang, Shen Jilan, Guo Fenglian, Li Cheng, Hao Xiaoming, Fu Changwang, and Wang Cuicui. They told the general secretary about their practical experiences, made work proposals, and reflected the people's wishes. Jiang Zemin said: You are honorable representatives who have come to the fore from among workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Your advanced deeds fully demonstrate the necessity of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, the worker-peasant alliance, and the masses at all times, whether during revolution, construction, or reform. These are the sources of our strength and the foundations of our success. Respect for model workers and advanced characters means respect for people's practical work and pioneering spirit. Not only did we undergo rigorous tests during the revolutionary war but we have also encountered many new trials during reform, opening up, and modernization, some of which are very severe. If our comrades do not maintain vigilance and strengthen study and self-cultivation, they run the risk of being dismissed as useless. I hope that model workers will be able to withstand all kinds of tests at all times, including the test of their honor, and will continue to perform meritorious services for the party and people. I especially hope that our cadres will guard against conceit and impetuosity, show honesty and self-discipline, and fight a winning, not losing, battle against all kinds of ordeals. During the inspection, Jiang Zemin also paid personal visits to military troops and barracks to find out about the learning, training, and living conditions of commanders and fighters. Upon seeing fighters on duty outside a certain grass-roots unit at the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission, the general secretary immediately got out of his car, clasped their hands, felt their clothes, and asked them whether they felt cold. At a certain tank regiment, Jiang Zemin entered the dormitory for new recruits to the 4th Squad of the 1st Company and asked them whether they were homesick. He smiled in relief when the fighters unanimously said they were serving the military without any worries. He told the regiment's commanders and fighters on a hopeful note: Cadres should cherish fighters, veteran soldiers should help new recruits, and new recruits should respect veteran soldiers. They should unite as one, strengthen political studies, conduct military training properly, and build troops into all-around militant collectives. At a certain infantry regiment, Jiang Zemin inspected its amenities service center, and visited cadres and fighters who were undergoing training. He urged military cadres to strive to acquire knowledge in new and high science and technology to meet the demands of the new situation and tasks. Jiang Zemin expressed great concern for schooling and education for children in rural areas, especially those in mountainous regions. Whenever he arrived in a village, he would insist on inspecting kindergartens, and primary and middle schools. He praised Shanxi for implementing Project Hope and building schools to solve education problems for children in poor areas. He repeatedly pointed out: In the final analysis, economic development and social progress are determined by the improvement of the people's quality, and of scientific and cultural levels in all sectors of society. It takes 100 years to cultivate people, and education is the foundation. Neglecting education is a short-sighted and dangerous act. In carrying out education in rural areas, we must consider local realities, readjust the school structure, and train more personnel of the junior middle school level that are badly needed for local development. Also accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his inspection and visits to the people were responsible persons from relevant central departments, such as Zeng Qinghong, Ye Qing, Liu Jiang, Han Zhubin, Zhang Youcai, Teng Wensheng, and Yang Yongzhe.
