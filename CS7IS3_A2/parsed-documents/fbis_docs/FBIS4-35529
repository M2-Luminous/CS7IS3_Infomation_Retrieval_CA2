Yusuf, speaking to reporters in Gaza, says the Palestinian police will arrest and charge the killers of two Arabs suspected of cooperating with Israel in Gaza over the weekend. The police sent representatives to their funerals and have launched an investigation into the killings. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] claimed responsibility for the deaths despite its agreement last month to suspend attacks on so called collaborators. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 29 May reports that "General Yusuf said that the Palestinian police would issue gun permits to residents of the autonomy, but ascertain that the gun would only use their weapons to protect their homes and not carry them in the street."]
