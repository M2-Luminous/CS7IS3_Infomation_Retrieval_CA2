Istvan Csurka, the cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], who uncovered his recruitment as an informer prior to his expulsion from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], also complained that the parliament failed to extend the memorial day of Nazi victims to the victims of Bolshevism. [Szombathy] What position did you and the MIEP group take at the vote on the agents law? [Csurka] We voted yes, so we accepted the proposal. Our parliamentary group coordinated its stand prior to the vote and all of us tried to participate in the vote in order to emphasize our position. However, Janos Denes was so shocked at the previous vote (on the memorial day of the Nazi victims) that he was no longer able to wait for this vote too. I understand his indignation, because the entire legislative process is becoming ridiculous. [Szombathy] Why did you decide to support the agents law? [Csurka] Actually, this has never been questionable for us. We would have liked to adopt a serious law, but our strength is still to limited for that. The law is not an agent law, but an irresponsible "cosmetic law." The law on former informers will have no positive consequences on the Hungarian public whatsoever, because the law continues to leave the real agents unnamed and unpunished. [Szombathy] If this is your opinion about the law, why did you support it? [Csurka] It is better than nothing. We could not allow ourselves to be accused that precisely the MIEP was not voting in favor of the law, when we exclude every communist element from our activity. [Szombathy] In your opinion, why is this law incapable of fulfilling its real function? [Csurka] It does not have power, and it does not contain restrictions, punishments, and sanctions, like other laws. It makes the procedure extremely lax, and it does not cover the entire public life, and it is extremely lenient toward the old regime and party machinery. [Szombathy] Why did you not try to make the bill stricter with various modification proposals? [Csurka] We submitted modification proposals, but the miserable results of the vote preceding the agents law proves the extent to which such MIEP efforts were swept away. For example, we earlier demanded the replacement of the chief prosecutor. We are alone when we want to modify a law in order to condemn communism and the old regime. It is interesting that, yesterday too, there were 57 of us who wanted the memorial day of Nazi victims to be extended to the victims of Bolshevism. In our view, Nazism and Bolshevism are totally identical concepts. However, our parliament absolves Bolshevism and condemns Nazism. One victim should not be more sympathetic than the other one. In addition, I think the law on creating a memorial day is slightly dangerous because talks are now being held between certain Jewish organizations and the government on compensating the Jews and settling the damages incurred to them, and now the representatives of full compensation have received a big moral push with this law. Unfortunately, the parliament failed to sense that circumstance. This parliament is definitely ripe to step down. [Szombathy] To what extent does your own case influence you when you voice your criticism? Certain things became known about this before your departure from the MDF.... [Csurka] Those were difficult days, but I can only say that I am glad that I vetted myself and accepted the things that can be used against me. It is both an honest and Christian thing to remain alone on the pedestal, although I do not feel guilty at all. They cannot bring anything against me by which I caused any damage to anyone; I never submitted any report. [Szombathy] Starting from your own case, what advice can you give to those affected by the law? [Csurka] I do not deal with it, and I will not answer that question. I have nothing to do with them.
