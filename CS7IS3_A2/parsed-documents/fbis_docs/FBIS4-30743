[Begin Goncz recording] [passage omitted] If I myself had to define what the electorate voted for or against I would say that the country had two desires. One of these is that the country itself should not break into two societies -- with a society of the poor people on the one hand and a society of those amassing immeasurable riches for themselves on the other. Parallel with this -- obviously not consciously -- is that we should not break into two parts, east and west Hungary. As a result of the election the parties have several moral obligations. First, they should focus their energies to achieve an economic revival as much as possible and in accordance with a thorough plan. Neither the government nor parliament can fulfill this task on its own. In the interest of a common objective, a national consensus must be established -- as wide as possible -- for the fulfillment of this goal. In other words, in my judgment efforts should be made for establishing a coalition government, but naturally I cannot interfere in this, nor do I want to. [passage omitted] I must add that I am convinced that the electorate of the country has helped bring to victory a future modern and European social democratic party.
