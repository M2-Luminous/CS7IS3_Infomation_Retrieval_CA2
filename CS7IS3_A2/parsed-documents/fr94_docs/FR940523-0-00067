The provisions of this Part establish regulatory requirements governing reimbursement for certain costs of remedial action at active uranium or thorium processing sites as specified by Subtitle A of Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. These regulations are authorized by section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;1), which requires the Secretary to issue regulations governing the reimbursements. 765.2 Scope and applicability. (a) This Part establishes policies, criteria, and procedures governing reimbursement of certain costs of remedial action incurred by licensees at active uranium or thorium processing sites as a result of byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. (b) Costs of remedial action at active uranium or thorium processing sites are borne by persons licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2092, 2111), either by NRC or an Agreement State pursuant to a counterpart to section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, under State law, subject to the exceptions and limitations specified in this Part. (c) The Department shall, subject to the provisions specified in this part, reimburse a licensee, of an active uranium or thorium processing site for the portion of the costs of remedial action as are determined by the Department to be attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and either incurred by the licensee not later than December 31, 2002, or incurred by the licensee in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department. (d) Costs of remedial action are reimbursable under Title X for decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action, provided that claims for reimbursement are supported by reasonable documentation as specified in Subpart C of this Part. (e) Except as authorized by §765.32, the total amount of reimbursement paid to any licensee of an active uranium processing site shall not exceed $5.50 multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. This total amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to section 765.12. (f) The total amount of reimbursement paid to all active uranium processing site licensees shall not exceed $270 million. This total amount shall be adjusted for inflation by applying the CPI&hyph;U, as provided by §765.12. (g) The total amount of reimbursement paid to the licensee of the active thorium processing site shall not exceed $40 million, as adjusted for inflation by applying the CPI&hyph;U as provided by §765.12. (h) Reimbursement of licensees for costs of remedial action will only be made for costs that are supported by reasonable documentation as required by §765.20 and claimed for reimbursement by a licensee in accordance with the procedures established by Subpart C of this Part. (i) The $310 million aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated under section 1003(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-2(a)) shall be adjusted for inflation by applying the CPI&hyph;U as provided by §765.12, and shall be provided from the Fund. §765.3 Definitions. For the purposes of this Part, the following terms are defined as follows: Active uranium or thorium processing site or active processing site means: (1) any uranium or thorium processing site, including the mill, containing byproduct material for which a license, issued either by NRC or by an Agreement State, for the production at a site of any uranium or thorium derived from ore_ (i) was in effect on January 1, 1978; (ii) was issued or renewed after January 1, 1978; or (iii) for which an application for renewal or issuance was pending on, or after January 1, 1978; and (2) any other real property or improvement on such real property that is determined by the Secretary or by an Agreement State to be: (i) in the vicinity of such site; and (ii) contaminated with residual byproduct material. Agreement State means a State that is or has been a party to a discontinuance agreement with NRC under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021) and thereafter issues licenses and establishes remedial action requirements pursuant to a counterpart to section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act under state law. Atomic Energy Act means the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq. ).
