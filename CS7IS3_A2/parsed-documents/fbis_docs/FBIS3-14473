[Rabin] Good day and a happy holiday to all the Israeli people. [Talmor] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is undoubtedly no al-Sadat or Mubarak. Are you convinced that he really seeks a full peace agreement with Israel or is he just pretending to want peace in order to secure U.S. economic aid? [Rabin] First of all, it is my pleasant duty to recall the past 15 years, which have proven that it is possible to achieve a lasting peace with a large, leading Arab country like Egypt even in a region as turbulent as the Middle East. I telephoned Egyptian President Mubarak yesterday. I expressed my appreciation and gratitude to Egypt for signing the peace agreement and for proving its ability to adhere to it. The Egyptian president said he was happy that I called and said that Egypt and Israel had set an example on how to overcome past hatreds and build a viable peace. Mubarak expressed the hope at this stage that Israel and the other countries engaged in the peace process would attain the same accomplishment. I hope and believe, in light of the fact that the talks in Cairo ended yesterday on a positive note and will resume in Cairo next Tuesday [29 March], that we will first of all overcome the issue of security arrangements for the Palestinians in Hebron and then of course continue the negotiations to reach agreement on the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First, in order to show the world that it is possible to reach agreements and to implement them. I hope that the agreement's implementation will help change facts on the ground, at least in those areas where it will take effect in the initial stage. I therefore have faith in the future. Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have already agreed to resume the Washington talks at the end of April. I also believe that the talks will take a somewhat different form. There will no longer be algebraic-like formulas defining what constitutes peace and what constitutes withdrawal, but rather a far more comprehensive view of peace and withdrawal as packages, withdrawal in stages without committing oneself to a final line, and of course security arrangements and the subsequent U.S. aid. [Talmor] You may have your faith, Sir, but in south Lebanon only this week there were serious terrorist attacks in which Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel. The same al-Asad you pin so many hopes on was supposed to stop this. [Rabin] There is no doubt that just as you mentioned earlier, al-Asad is no al-Sadat. Al-Asad has a different approach which makes progress in the peace process more difficult. The State of Israel and its people are democratic. The Israeli public has to be convinced that the Arab leader it is negotiating with really means peace and is willing to hold public meetings at the most senior levels.... [Talmor, interrupting] And this is not happening. [Rabin] At this stage of the negotiations with Syria, only relatively low-level contacts have been held. If this does not change at some stage -- if higher-level contacts are not held, if the Syrian media does not show greater openness, if Syrian leaders do not issue clearer public statements on their intention to reach peace -- it will be very difficult to make progress in the negotiations. Clearly, and as a further projection of this, Syria also has the capability to keep things quiet along Israel's northern border. [Talmor] Why did Israel not come out with a more vigorous and aggressive reaction to this week's Katyusha attacks against the Israeli border and even against areas inside Israel? [Rabin] First of all, we did react. Last week's Katyusha firing was an exception because there are understandings which are basically kept. According to these understandings, no Katyushas are to be fired at Israel's northern border settlements. [Talmor] But the Katyushas could have fallen on Israeli settlements? [Rabin] Nothing can be hermetically sealed. In general, the residents of the northern settlements along the Lebanese border live in greater security and tranquility today than they did before July 1993. I am sure that this Passover, tens of thousands of Israelis will safely spend their holiday in the Galilee. [Talmor] Mr. Rabin, you mentioned the telephone conversation you held with President Mubarak to mark 15 years of peace. Does Mubarak's regime appear stable from Jerusalem's perspective. Is there no danger of an Islamic revolution similar to the one which swept Iran? [Rabin] I think that the Egyptian reality is completely different than that of Iran although a terroristic, radical, Islamic movement exists there as well. I believe that the majority of the Egyptian people support President Mubarak's regime, would like to see continued economic development, and do not exhibit any leaning toward the Iranian brand of nationalistic or religious-nationalistic extremism. Terrorist attacks are carried out here and there. That, regrettably, is a part of Arab society and the Islamic world. Terrorism is a fact of life in most of the neighboring countries as well as in more distant ones. I have confidence in the strength of President Mubarak's government and have no doubt that he adheres to his comprehensive policy of both encouraging peace and extending Egypt's assistance to Israel and to its Arab interlocutors in reaching peace. We see this for a fact: most of the recent contacts have taken place in Cairo or at other Egyptian locations. [Talmor] This interview is taking place immediately following the return of the Israeli delegation from Cairo. Now that you have been briefed and held consultations, can you tell us what the Palestinians will ultimately receive in return for their agreement to continue the talks in Cairo next Tuesday? Will Hebron be awarded an almost equal status to that of Jericho and Gaza? [Rabin] No, Hebron will not be given a similar status to neither Gaza nor Jericho. Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the horrendous massacre which took place at the Cave of the Patriarchs. I cannot ignore the fact that we have been keeping Hebron under curfew for almost one month in order to prevent friction between the approximately 120,000 Arab residents of Hebron and the 415 Israeli Jews who live there, whether as permanent residents or as students at the Shavey Hebron Yeshiva. This state of affairs is unacceptable and I am talking as a Jew and an Israeli. It is totally unacceptable that the Palestinians be the ones to suffer on account of this despicable massacre, which was committed by a Jewish criminal. At the same time, I want to make sure that the war against the enemies of peace, such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, will continue full blast. Even while our delegation was sitting down with the PLO representatives in Cairo, we did not hesitate to carry out an operation which led to the elimination of at least three Hamas terrorists who had participated in the murder of Jews and were continuing to plan additional murders. We will guarantee the security of the Israelis living in Hebron but it is difficult to explain to the world and to ourselves why the burden for this despicable massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs should fall, and has fallen for the past month, on the 100,000 Arab residents of Hebron. Therefore, we must offer reasonable security arrangements for the Palestinian residents of Hebron. We agreed to a temporary international presence in Hebron, which will help the town return to normal life and report to the Palestinian-Israeli liaison committee, the mayor, and to the military governor. [Talmor] Do you not fear that Hebron may set a precedent for subsequent Palestinian demands in Nabulus and other cities? [Rabin] I believe that what happened in the Cave of the Patriarchs was really a despicable, murderous, aberration, which will not be repeated. Therefore, there will be no need for such a precedent. [Talmor] Is Israel still considering moving all the Jewish settlers in Hebron to one location or perhaps even evacuating the Jews from the town? [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage we, or at least I, have any intention of evacuating the Jews living in Hebron. All the rest is not an issue for public statements. This is an Israeli decision which should not fall within the framework of returning life to normal in Hebron or resuming the negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. [Talmor] Any discussion of the Hebron massacre inevitably leads us to the state commission of inquiry investigating it. In your opinion, Mr. Rabin, how has the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the defense establishment portrayed themselves so far in the state commission's hearings? [Rabin] At this stage, I do not intend to discuss issues being discussed in detail by the commission. A state commission, made up of distinguished and experienced people, has been established, and I am sure that it will do the kind of job expected from such a commission and present its recommendations to the government. Then I will be able to comment. Right now, I would like to merely state in general that the IDF is the sovereign body in the territories on behalf of the Israeli Government. Ever since the inception of the intifadah, the IDF has been facing challenges it never had to face before. Seven years have passed and it has learned to handle these challenges. It has had to enforce law and order under the special circumstances of a civil uprising by the Palestinians in the territories against the Army. This is not an easy task. Elsewhere in the world, armies are not usually employed for this kind of job, which is mainly police work in addition to confronting terrorist squads. I do not believe that any other army in the world would have met this challenge while retaining its moral caliber, the values of the IDF, and the authentic values of the Jewish people -- not those of the murderer from Qiryat Arba'. I admit that mistakes have been made and mishaps have occurred. I am talking about widespread activities, day and night, 365 days a year for over seven years. Hundreds of thousands of IDF soldiers have served dutifully despite all the difficulties. I have nothing but praise for the IDF. [Talmor] Sir, you are probably aware that the public believes that the commission could ultimately find you, as defense minister, responsible for what happened in Hebron and perhaps even topple the government. [Rabin] As prime minister and defense minister I bear ministerial responsibility for whatever happens in the framework of my duties. I am talking about responsibility in the correct sense of the word. I am not responsible for every slip-up by a sentry, battalion commander, or even brigade commander -- if the appropriate orders had indeed been issued in a timely fashion. Not everything falls under the framework of collective responsibility and I believe that what you described earlier will not come to pass. (Talmor] Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, thank you very much and a happy holiday. [Rabin] Happy holidays. I would like to use this opportunity to express my thanks, appreciation, and holiday greetings to the IDF soldiers, the Border Police, the Israeli police, and to all those who guarantee the security of Israel's civilians.
