However, within the defense forces a report is already being prepared for presentation in the fall of what changes to the Swedish defense forces will be needed in order to facilitate increased international cooperation. The issue has been made more urgent by the new cooperation arrangement, Partnership for Peace [PFP]. Preparations are already taking place so that Sweden will perhaps be able to take part in the first PFP exercise. The supreme commander pointed out, however, that as yet no political decision has been reached on the matter. "The investigation being carried out at headquarters aims to look at how Swedish forces can better engage in international cooperation, not only with Finland's, Norway's, and Denmark's defense forces, but also with the combat forces of the rest of Europe," Bengt Gustafsson declared. He is expecting clearer instructions from the government as to how the defense forces are to plan possible future changes in preparation for the next defense bill that will be agreed in 1997. However, in general terms he predicted that the road to a common European security system and possible common European defenses will be a very long one and that the matter might only find its way onto the agenda "at some distant point in time." He also pointed to the alternative possibility that the issue might never arise because of a trend toward fragmentation in the Western world. At the same time he pointed to the clear efforts by France and also Germany to create a defense force independent of NATO. Bengt Gustafsson, who is now leaving his post after eight years, had drawn a full house, as might have been expected. A little while ago he irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt by raising the old question of a Nordic defense league. This time he protected his back by not "saying a word" on the subject. However, he did point to the joint Nordic military operation in Macedonia and Bosnia as an extension of cooperation that goes back a long way and as a political demonstration of solidarity with Europe. Bengt Gustafsson stressed that bearing in mind the increased international involvement the future structure of the defense forces must not lead to a situation in which Sweden has two defense forces, one for Sweden itself and one to be lent out. He wants to see a single defense force, but with a clear delineation of roles. No one with a reason not to go abroad should be forced to go, and anyone who wants to go abroad must be given all the necessary support, said Bengt Gustafsson, who also wants to see the personnel question clearly addressed in the next defense bill.
