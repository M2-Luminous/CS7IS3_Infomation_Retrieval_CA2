As to the unmarried rate of this older population, the single rate in the 30-44 age group is 6.09 percent for men, but only 0.4 percent for women. Of the older single population, 77 percent (over 6 million) are aged 30-39, while only 23 percent are 40-44 years old. The urban-rural distribution of China's older single population contrasts sharply by sex: the men are located mainly in rural areas, numbering 6.04 million, or about 81.62 percent of the older single male population; the women are located mostly in cities, numbering 300,000, or approximately 67 percent of the older single female population. As to the numbers of older single people living in urban and rural areas, rural males (6.04 million) outnumber urban males (1.36 million) by [nearly] 4.5 to 1, while urban females (300,000) outnumber rural females by 2 to 1, leaving the sex ratio for the rural single population even more glaringly lopsided, with men outnumbering women by 40 to 1. Among the older male population, the single rates are highest for illiterates and semiliterates, reaching 22.02 percent and 21.65 percent for urban and rural areas respectively, meaning that 1 of 5 older illiterate and semiliterate [men] are unmarried; the unmarried rates for men with grade school educations are obviously lower, respectively at 5.05 percent and 7.73 percent; the single rates for men with high school and technical educations are lowest, respectively at 1.45 percent and 0.07 percent; the unmarried rate for college-educated men is about 3 percent. The impact of educational level on the single rate for older women is: the unmarried rates are highest for college educated women, at 2.07 percent in the rural areas and 4.98 percent in the cities, meaning that 1 of 20 older urban women with college degrees are unmarried; the single rates for older illiterate and semiliterate women are lower (0.29 percent for the rural areas and 0.73 percent for cities); the unmarried rates are lowest for women with grade school educations (0.09 percent for the rural areas and 0.31 percent for the cities). So China's current 2.02 million older, single, illiterate and semiliterate men (of whom 1.81 million live in rural areas), and 48,000 college-educated, older, single women (of whom 45,000 live in cities), have become the priority and difficulty of our older single population. While our older single population are generally manual workers, this is not so by sex. Census data show the unmarried rate to be high for older male manual workers, as well as for older female mental workers. The unmarried rates for older working men by occupation are: as high as 7.95 percent for workers in farming, forestry, livestock raising, and fishery, and 2 to 7 percent for other manual workers, but at only 0.33 to 1.37 percent for mental workers, such as all types of specialized technicians, obviously lower than for manual workers. But the single rate for older working women by occupation is just the opposite, averaging the highest at 1.35 percent for all types of specialized technicians, office workers, and related personnel, but lowest at only 0.31 percent for workers in farming, forestry, livestock raising, and fishery. Editor's postscript: This information tells us that the crux of the difficulty in solving the spouse problem of the older single population are the gaps in features, such as numbers of men and women, distribution, and social, economic, and educational level. If marriage perceptions continue to follow the tradition of "men not marrying up and women not marrying down," the problem will be even harder. Meanwhile, under China's current socio-economic situation of still incomplete social security and service systems, as time passes, millions of older single people will gradually reach middle and old age, with their health, feeding, and housing bringing varying degrees of particular difficulties. So how to care for and help them will be a crucial matter requiring the attention of our whole society now and for a long time to come.
