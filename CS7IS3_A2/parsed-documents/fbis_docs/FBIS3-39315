Bulgaria is the eighth country to join it. "I would like once again to hail NATO's readiness to open itself to the security problems of East Europe and to admit new members in the future. I hope that the process of evolution starting with Partnership for Peace will be based on equal treatment and respect for the lawful interests of the partners in the area of security, and that the provision of security guarantees in the future will be considered," President Zhelev said at the ceremony in Brussels. In his speech Mr. Zhelev described Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace plan as a stage of its sovereign policy of integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Mr. Zhelev said that "the Republic of Bulgaria already a NATO partner, will pursue its sovereign course to full membership in NATO." President Zhelev specially stressed that "Bulgaria's arguments for its participation in NATO do not contain elements that could be interpreted as being directed against Russia." "On the contrary, we support Russia's democratic and reformist forces and wish them success. We are convinced that NATO is in a condition to find adequate ways and means for Russia to become committed to European security, without encouraging the imperial ambitions of certain would-be dictators," Mr. Zhelev said. Speaking of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, President Zhelev said they were a challenge to Bulgaria's security and caused -- through the international sanctions -- formidable difficulties for this country's economic reform. "Bulgaria's policy to the Yugoslav crisis was and remains principled, consistent, peaceful and inspired by good intentions. I am sure it will be given credit by our Western partners, by all civilized and democratic countries," Mr. Zhelev said. "I am convinced that the North Atlantic alliance has made a good choice by seeking a new type of security in integrated Europe through the joining of the new democracies. This is a momentous process which helps democracy strike strong roots in East Europe and bear fruit that will not have a bitter after taste for the people who overthrew communism full of hope, self-confidence and a firm belief in a worthy future that the West would support," the Bulgarian president said about Partnership for Peace. He pointed out that for Bulgaria, the concept of security has military, as well as economic, social, political and humanitarian dimensions. Mr. Zhelev recalled that the idea of cooperation with NATO meets with broad public support in Bulgaria, and that Bulgarian Parliament was the first in East Europe to adopt a special declaration on the Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Zhelev stated that Bulgaria is ready to adjust its defense policy to that of the European democracies, the United States and Canada. President Zhelev said Bulgaria is the only East European country invited to join Partnership for Peace, which borders on two NATO members in the Balkans -- Greece and Turkey. He added that Bulgaria had reached a good level of cooperation in the political, economic, military and military-technical sectors with them. "Its most valuable asset is a remarkable `transparency' in relations, which transcended the measures envisaged in the Armed Forces in Europe Treaty so that we ourselves expanded them on a bilateral basis," Mr. Zhelev said. He also pointed out that "Bulgaria cannot remain indifferent to the fact that the military balance in the Balkans does not match the new political realities in so far as some Balkan countries have not acceded to the European agreements and therefore their arms are not under control." President Zhelev is expected back in Bulgaria tonight.
