The reclamation corps regarded human life as worthless. The parading of a corpse touched off an earthshaking storm, awakening educated Chinese youth to rise in resistance. In the over four decades since the founding of the PRC, the CPC has practiced a brutal dictatorship, believing that it could rely on its powerful state apparatus to force its people into submission. While conscientious Chinese writers and artists would have reported this social reality in their works on behalf of the people, the PRC's literary and arts policy that permits eulogies but no exposures has long kept many writers afraid to touch such sensitive topics. A Work Recording, Exposing the Brutal Treatment of Educated Chinese Youth The recent appearance of the long literary record by the young Sichuan writer Deng Xian [6772 6343]--Dreams of Educated Chinese Youth (carried in the No 5, 1992 issue of the literary bimonthly TANG TAI, and published in a separate edition by the People's Literature Publishing House in April 1993)--has broken this taboo. Dreams of Educated Chinese Youth recounts the story of Mao Zedong's sending of educated Chinese youth down to the countryside and border areas for "reeducation," and their subsequent tide of demanding to return to the cities. In the words of this book's "synopsis," the author "uses full and accurate data and powerful artistic expression to reveal for the first time the inside story and whole course of the great [struggle to] return to the cities by educated Chinese youth, as well as the Frontier Corps' bloody archives." This book is also significant in that: 1) It expresses in a work for the first time, through a record of the facts, the surging spectacle of the Chinese people's demonstration and stand for their lives against CPC tyranny. Even more rare is that the resistance ended in victory, demonstrating the theme that "tyranny must lose and the people will win." 2) Since the failure of the 1989 student movement, ultra-leftists have resurged, doing their utmost to defend past CPC crimes. So this book is also a forceful attack on such attempts to rewrite history. The Construction Corps Was More Like a Reform-Through-Labor Camp The policy of forcing large numbers of educated Chinese youth to the countryside, to submit to so-called "reeducation," was set forth by Mao Zedong in an editorial note in RENMIN RIBAO [PEOPLE'S DAILY] on 21 December 1968: "Educated Chinese youth going to the countryside, to be reeducated by poor and lower-middle peasants, is very necessary." Once Mao's "imperial edict" was issued, it immediately touched off the campaign of going to work in the countryside and mountain areas, which affected almost all urban families. The data show that by the end of 1978, 20 million educated Chinese youths had been sent down to the countryside or off to border areas. While Mao's slogan sounded very pleasant, the so-called "reeducation" was in fact consistent with his hostile actions against learning and intellectuals. His expelling of educated Chinese youth to the countryside was in fact consigning them to purgatory. Dreams of Educated Youth authentically recounts the many hair-raising crimes committed by Mao Zedong's cadres in tormenting the educated youth. At the end of May 1973, XINHUA SHE [NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY] reporter Li Ming [7812 2494] inadvertently saw in Jinping County, the encampment of the 18th Regiment of the Yunnan Production and Construction Corps, many prisoners laboring under escort by the People's Armed Police [PAP]. These convicts were very young and unkempt, sweating away at hard labor. When one of them asked a guard for a drink of water, not to speak of the excoriation, several militiamen also rushed over and beat this prisoner to the ground with their rifle butts. Then, his pitiful cry rang out in the boiling hot air: "PLA uncles, spare my life! Please spare my life...." Even more shocking were the female prisoner ranks that this reporter saw, with 17 and 18 year-old educated girls escorted by fiendish militiamen to hard labor in rock quarries. What he could not understand was: Why was the air there laden with such a bloody smell? Why was this construction corps more like a huge reform-through-labor camp? A Uranium Mine With No Safety Measures Here are the true facts. In the 18th Regiment, these soldiers had long since treated educated youth as prisoners to be wantonly hung up and beaten, humiliated, and even raped. One camp boss openly asserted: What have you come to the frontier for? To be remolded as "disloyal reform-through-labor convicts!" According to a report (No 241) issued by the New China News Agency on 4 July 1973, 23 of the 18th Regiment's 31 units saw the occurrence of varying degrees of tying up, hanging up, and beating of educated youth. There were over 30 types of punishments, such as being roasted in the sun in the summer, and being doused with cold water in the winter. Some were beaten into cripples, some went mad, and others committed suicide. Many of the cadres in the Yunnan construction corps were sex fiends who ravaged educated young girls. Even worse, Corps cadres acted with utter disregard for the lives of educated youth. In the late 1960s, a uranium mine was discovered in a desolate mountain pass of high mountain ridges in Western Yunnan, which was taken over by the Construction Corps in 1970. Educated youth from the Corps' Fifth Division, 21st Regiment (Menggang farm) were sent there. While the mine had over 400 educated youths, whose main jobs were mining, picking, storing, and shipping, it had absolutely no safety or protective equipment, leaving many educated youths subject to long-term radiation that took their lives. Educated Youth Parade a Corpse "If the people do not fear death, how can they be cowed by it." As educated youths had limited patience, their discovery that their lives were being treated with utter disregard (with statistics showing that in the first 10 months of 1978 alone, the Yunnan Reclamation Area experienced as many as 153 unnatural deaths of educated youths, and other reclamation areas experienced many suicides as well) finally set off a wave of strikes and demonstrations. The book relates in detail three later-publicized disturbances by educated youths in 1978 and early 1979. The first was the parading of a corpse on 13 November 1978. This demonstration occurred in the Yunnan border region on the Ganlan Plains. The corps authorities' lack of concern for human life, plus bad doctoring by barefoot doctors, who acted irresponsibly by actually getting drunk and leaving during a difficult labor by an educated young woman, resulted in the pregnant female losing so much blood that both mother and child died. The unexpected death of this educated young woman left the other educated youth so in grief that their resentment quickly grew into resistance over the fate of educated youth in general. This time, the CPC's consistently-utilized formula of pressure tactics did not work. As the camp's public security body and PAP were going into emergency action in preparation for forced disposition of the corpse, hundreds of educated youth who had heard the news rushed up, confronting the armed personnel with hoes, long knives, and iron clubs. Finally, they lifted up the corpse on their shoulders and set out for Jinghongzhen (the capital of the Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture). They neither chanted radical slogans, presented vehement views, nor committed any violence. Rather, they simply bowed their heads, carrying the corpse of their companion who had died such an unfortunate death, in an attempt to win some basic human rights for both the living and the dead. Like an endless river, they flowed along slowly beneath the dark and gloomy November sky, finally sitting down for several days in front of the Prefectural Party Committee gates. Only 24 hours after the occurrence of this incident, the news of it appeared through telegraphic dispatch in writing on the Xidan Democracy Wall in Beijing. Meanwhile, it affected all reclamation areas in the southwest. In a few short days, all of the eight large farms in the Banna Reclamation Area were faced with a serious situation of educated youth being out of control emotionally. Educated youths from all of the farms went into action, contacting each other, establishing secret ties, and responding by the hundreds to a single call. Victory of the Resistance Changes Their Fate Who would have thought that the chance incident of an educated young woman's tragic death would become the fuse to set off an earthshaking wave of return to the cities by educated youth, to become the first roll of thunder that would result in hundreds of thousands of educated youths on Yunnan farms and even throughout China awakening in bold resistance. The educated youth won a great and complete victory, in which the prefectural party committee met all of their demands: 1) It dealt severely with the doctors involved in the incident, investigating and affixing responsibility; 2) It treated the educated young woman as if she had died in public service, agreeing to hold a memorial meeting; 3) It better implemented the educated-youth policy, instructing farms to improve health care as quickly as possible, and to make overall plans for solving the existing problems in educated-youth lives. The victory from this parading of a corpse sharply boosted the morale of educated youth to demonstrate against tyranny, paving the way for victory in the two subsequent strikes and demonstrations that called on the CPC to abolish its reactionary policy of sending educated urban youth to work in the countryside and mountain areas. The courage (a hundred laying down on the train tracks and a thousand going on a hunger strike) and tactics (absolutely peaceful and rational, to provide the authorities with no handles) displayed by the educated youth in these two magnificent actions, showed through and through the extent to which these young people had matured by steeling themselves to their miserable lives. Firm Memories of the Ultra-Left Disaster On his Spring 1992 southern tour, Deng Xiaoping set forth the key issue as guarding against the left. Dreams of Educated Youth was written in the midst of this anti-left tide, being in the same category as works such as Anti-Left Memorandum and China's "Left" Disaster. Mao Zedong's policy of sending educated urban youth to work in the countryside and mountain areas has been negated by Deng Xiaoping. Deng's remarks on this policy were: "We spent 30 billion yuan to buy three discontents -- educated youth, parents, and peasants." Still, the CPC has ultra-leftists who just cannot give up on this policy that has wasted our national wealth, ruined a whole generation of youths, and was such a disaster; they are still trying by all means to beautify it. In 1990, Beijing held the "Spirits Tied to the Black Earth--A Retrospective on Wild Beijing University Youth," at which time ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO also said that the policy of sending educated urban youth to work in the countryside and mountain areas had "radiated a spirit of development and excellence." In the early spring of 1991, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of going to Yunnan in support of the border area, Chengdu held a large retrospective exhibition, with the general title "Youth Has No Regrets." Beneath this general title was an explanatory note borrowed from Selected Poems by Pushkin: "A Russian once said that all suffering will pass, and what is past will turn into a happy memory." However, the author of Dreams of Educated Youth questions this view. He says in the "Introduction" that: "I cannot help but have certain instinctual doubts about the words of this Russian poet: If all past suffering does not turn into bitterness, then can the attitude of the Jews toward World War II, the Chinese toward the Nanjing Massacre, and the Japanese toward the atom bomb be one of turning those nightmares into happy memories?" He holds that as history is an organic unity, "While we may forget honors, money, and the many shining laurels that may someday adorn our heads, we have no rationale for forgetting suffering, or its indelible historical brand that was forcibly stamped on us as individuals and as a whole." He asks: "If those 10 young girls who have already been forgotten and are forever sleeping in darkness (referring to the 10 educated young girls from Chengdu averaging only 17 and one-half years of age who died in a fire in Yunnan in 1971 while there in support of the border area) could speak out from the grave, what would they say? If they had the right to choose their lives again, would they opt to be educated youths? Would they have no regrets?"
