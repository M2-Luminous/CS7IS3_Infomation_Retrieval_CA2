The controversy surrounding the cod has been settled, but the dispute over the blocking minority in the Council of Ministers which has been enlarged to 16 members continues within the European Union. The majority believes that it should be 27 votes (of a total of 90 votes distributed among the countries of different sizes). The British and the Spanish want to stick to the current regulation of 23 votes. The causes of the quarrel are questions of power stemming from different motives. Spain is interested in a veto coalition with Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Ireland. The five countries belong to the less prosperous receiver countries. For them "Europe" is a pecuniary source that is supposed to bubble. Europe's enlargement might curtail their influence. Since these countries, which hold a total of 31 votes, are likely not to agree on every issue, the proud Spain would like to be in a position together with Italy and Portugal, or with Italy and Greece to prevent decisions with 23 votes (per combination). The proud Britons aspire to the same position of power -- together with as few states as possible. They are not so much interested in "taking" but in preventing. As defenders of classical self-determination, they would like to prevent being overruled by other states. Theoretically, a decision can also be blocked with 27 votes. It is possible to scrape the required votes together, if need be. It might be a little more difficult for the southern countries than for Britain. Their attitude is ambiguous: If they insist on the smaller blocking minority, they might prevent an expansion of the European Union, to which they attach great significance. Together with sensible Germans, they welcome a shift of the axis of the European Union to the north and east and a loose form of cooperation. In view of these advantages, an increase of the blocking minority from 23 to 27 is the lesser evil.
