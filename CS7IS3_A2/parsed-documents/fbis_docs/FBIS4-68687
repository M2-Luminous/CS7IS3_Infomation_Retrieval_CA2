Gorbatov, researcher at the Center for Socioeconomic Research of the Youth Institute: "Refugees--Moscow Is a Big Railway Station"] [Text] Logic suggests: Before talking about a problem, and especially before intending to solve it, it is necessary to picture the scale of it. As for refugees, objective statistics are lacking, both for all of Russia and for the Moscow region. At first glance the reasons are simple: There is no control over movement across the border from former Union republics (except for the Baltics), and there are no clear-cut legal norms. According to the law of the Russian Federation on the status of refugees, adopted in the summer of last year, only citizens of other states can be considered as such. This means that persons who arrive in Central Russia from zones of ethnic conflict, which are within the boundaries of the territory of the Russian Federation (Chechnya, Ossetia, Ingushetia, and others), cannot obtain the status of refugee. They are called either resettlers or displaced persons, but the essence does not change because of this. It turns out that there are many more refugees than recorded. Although, strictly speaking, the figures are still terrifying. According to data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of the Russian Federation, more than 9,000 refugees were counted at the end of 1993 in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, of which 3,600 are concentrated right in our city, and 5,500 in the oblast. This figure does not include those who are living here in an "illegal" status. Expert estimates in this regard are rather contradictory, and vary from several to hundreds of thousands. They cannot be used as objective information for an analysis of the economic status of refugees. Therefore, the data cited further apply only to persons who officially have the status of refugees. The Moscow region, fortunately for its residents, was never "open" to migrants, rather strict restrictions existed associated with residence permits. Nevertheless, the population of the capital has grown steadily from year to year precisely owing to migrants. Now, despite the decree of the Government of Moscow concerning toughening passport control and the introduction of duties on the right to stay in the city, the number of refugees and displaced persons on its territory is increasing. In 1992, 2,500 refugees were counted here, and now the number is significantly higher. We are talking only about people who use official channels to acquire the right to live in Moscow. Why is the capital so attractive? For a majority of those who arrive in the Moscow region (61.7 percent), the presence here of institutions and organizations that can solve their problems is important. Thirty-seven percent of this group declare that they would like to get authorization to go abroad. So, for a large part of the arriving refugees Moscow represents a kind of transshipment point. In addition, it should be noted that there is quite a large number of commercially inclined persons for whom the presence of conflict on interethnic grounds is only a reason for legal resettlement from regions with an unstable political and economic situation in a city, which for them is a "gold mine" (15 percent on average). But on the whole the economic situation of the refugees in the Moscow region, really, like everywhere, is unenviable. Many (24.6 percent) live in crowded material conditions. The main official sources of their existence are state allowances and assistance from relatives (26.8 percent, on the average). Only 22.7 percent have stable earnings. Fewer have permanent work--only 3 percent of them, and 32 percent of the able-bodied do not work at all. However paradoxical, their misfortune is that they do have...a higher and secondary special education (up to 33 percent). In Moscow they encounter an already developed infrastructure that is characterized by a great oversaturation of this kind of specialist (four-fifths of all employees). This problem has especially worsened now under conditions of increased unemployment. At best, those who arrive can count on work that is "not prestigious" to the local residents. Despite the significant share of those who would like to change specialties so that they could find work in the Moscow region (up to 38 percent), there are also those who under no circumstances (18.5 percent) want to engage in work that is "not according to their specialization," and, as a rule, this is the intelligentsia (80 percent from this group). But, in addition to work and obtaining the means for existence, the problem of housing is becoming even more critical. At the present time 28 percent of them are forced to rent housing, and 650 [as published] percent take shelter with relatives. The housing situation for 40.5 percent of the refugees is simply intolerable. Of course, it is necessary to feel sorry for them. But in our region hundreds of thousands "of our own" families are standing in line to receive housing. But not many people (2 percent) can allow themselves to buy an apartment, given today's high prices. So, the question stands this way: Either leave the region, or buy housing. Therefore, many of them (43 percent) plan to sell their apartment in their previous place of residence and acquire one within the boundaries of the Moscow region. However, not everyone by far has something to sell (20 percent, on average). It is even more difficult with residence permits. But it is what makes it possible to use the social benefits (acquiring a free education, material allowances, etc.). It is practically impossible to get a residence permit without acquiring housing in Moscow. The percentage of those without residence permits in Moscow, and this means in many ways "people without social rights," is the highest in Russia (48.3 percent of the refugees living on its territory). The most vulnerable people in this situation are children and pensioners. A majority of families, of course, need material assistance for the children on the part of the local authorities and the state. There is not enough money for clothes and normal nourishment. Pensioners cannot get pensions and other benefits due them because of difficulties in transferring documents from their previous place of residence. The loss of documents complicates the situation in many ways, and a search for them is hampered or impossible because of the tense political situation between Russia and a number of republics. Without residence permits it is also difficult to use medical services, which very tangibly hits an already meager budget. A lot has been written about the difficult economic situation of the refugees, but the issue of ways to resolve the problem remains open to the present time. This in many ways depends on the presence in the state of a good national program of resettling refugees on the territory of the country. Such an attempt was undertaken at the end of 1991 by the Government of Russia--the "Migration" program was adopted. But...it remained mainly on paper. It appears that it is aimed more at the resolution of questions of providing cheap manpower and developing the regions of the non-Chernozem, Siberia, and the Far East. Alas, the interests of the state, and not the refugees, emerged as the priority. A serious review is needed of the principal provisions of the program. After all, besides everything else, its implementation in its previous form requires large material resources, whose allocation, based on the difficult economic conditions, does not seem possible. But despite all this, uncontrolled migration pressure on the European region of Russia, including on the Moscow region, continues to increase. The attempts of the Government of Moscow to protect its region from such pressure, using old methods (toughening the rules of passport control), have an unhealthy effect on Russian refugees most of all. After all, persons of other nationalities who come to Moscow can count on the assistance of various friendly associations of their own people that exist here (Azerbaijani Chechen, Armenian, etc.), which help their fellow-countrymen overcome the "barrier" of residence registration legally as well as illegally. Therefore, only the Russians are thrown to the whims of fate. It is no accident that Russian refugees are experiencing the greatest economic difficulties in their own "historic motherland." It is apparent that previous experience in the regulation of migratory streams cannot be used to resolve refugee problems. While their appearance in Russia is in many ways a new phenomenon (we have not had refugees since 1924), it is not new as such to many countries of West Europe and America. They have accumulated a wealth of multifaceted experience in this regard, and it would not be out of place to utilize it. The more so in that under conditions of a threat of mass migration from the former USSR to the countries of West Europe (30 percent owing to refugees), they are eagerly ready to help. There is a special decree of a parliamentary meeting of the European Community adopted in February 1993 "Concerning the Migratory Movement of the Population between the States of the Former USSR," and recommendations attached to it, according to which Russia can count on the rendering of assistance to refugees and displaced persons on its territory. Of course, now the problem lies not so much in money as in necessary meaningful aspects of the national program for rendering assistance to refugees and forced migrants. The creation of a network of nonstate social services, aimed at refugees, can be viewed as a promising direction in the resolution of this problem. These organizations, which are not dependent on state structures and not subordinate to them, whose source of existence will become not budgetary resources but subsidies from various charitable funds, including international, should work on those questions that state services refuse to work on (offering juridical services, searching for housing, retraining, searching for employment, etc.). They will be able organically to supplement the work of state services. There are already quite a few of them in the countries of Western Europe. For example, there are about 60 in Great Britain alone (of these, four work on a nationwide scale and 56 are small local organizations). Seventy percent of the total number of these organizations are concentrated in London, which is very similar to Moscow in the nature of the problem in this respect. Now the employees of our center, together with colleagues from Great Britain, are conducting work on a joint project whose purpose is to accumulate British experience in work with refugees and use it in a plan to develop nonstate social services in Russia (including in Moscow). In our opinion, another no less promising direction in the resolution of the refugee problem could be the establishment of a network of centers for refugee professional retraining, taking into account the requirements of regional labor markets. The specific nature of the work with refugees and forced migrants lies in the fact that the status of "refugee" is itself temporary. Many of those who were questioned would like to go back and continue to work in their former specialty, given a stabilization of the situation in the region of their former residence. Therefore, the content of the programs for the retraining of refugees should reflect universality and differentiation. In acquiring a new specialty, the previous one should not be lost. Ignoring the previous work experience of refugees is an unnecessary loss of time and resources. At the same time, the experience of Germany, France, and Great Britain is being used widely.
