In the new year, the two sides of the strait should further strengthen contacts and exchanges to push forward the process of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Reviewing the changes that have taken place in cross-strait relations in the past 15 years since the publication of the message, Cheng Siyuan said: Because of the development of cross-strait relations, as of today, more than 1 million visits by people of both sides have been recorded; indirect trade has topped $10 billion; exchanges in various fields are increasing; and there has been a tremendous change in the painful situation of 15 years ago in which communications and contacts were totally cut off due to military confrontation between the two sides of the strait. He expressed the hope that both sides would treasure the new hard-won situation and push forward the relations between the two sides of the strait on the existing basis. He said: Although exchanges and personnel contacts between the two sides have increased, they are also faced with many difficulties. On the one hand, the exchanges and contacts are still indirect, because the personnel visiting each side have to go by way of Hong Kong or a third country. Even the development of economic and trade relations has to be conducted through a third region. This not only wastes time and causes delays in business, but it also wastes money and manpower. On the other hand, the Taiwan authorities have set up many restrictions to obstruct exchanges and personnel contacts. He expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities will take into account the vital interests of the people on both sides of the strait, adopt effective measures to remove the manmade obstacles, and establish, as soon as possible, postal links, trade relations, and air and shipping services between Taiwan and the mainland. Cheng Siyuan said: Besides speeding up exchanges and contacts, an important task is to firmly stop the movement toward "independence for Taiwan" and to oppose all acts aimed at dividing the sovereignty of the state in the forms of "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." The failure to carry out this task well will cast a shadow over cross-strait relations and will affect the further development of relations between the two sides of the strait. He said: Of course, the complete solution of problems is most important. Both sides should sit down to discuss the reunification of the country. If we can realize the peaceful reunification of the country, we will have something good to tell our forefathers and posterity and open a new page in the annals of the Chinese nation. On the occasion of commemorating the 15th anniversary of the publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," the joyous New Year's Day of 1994 happens to be drawing near. Cheng Siyuan very happily extended festive greetings to compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to other compatriots living overseas. He expressed the hope that they will continue to show concern for and support the motherland's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive on the mainland, and contribute, through various forms, to the early realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
