Tonight the spotlight falls on the future of the new government -- how it intends solving some of the long outstanding problems and how it hopes to bring everlasting peace and prosperity in this country. The long-awaited dream of a democratically elected government in South Africa has finally been realized. This week's festivities, among others, saw the inauguration of the president and his two deputy presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki and Mr. F.W. de Klerk. Now that this time is over, a rough and tough road is awaiting this new government. Among the problems which need to be addressed is the aspirations of blacks and the fears that still exist in some of our white compatriots. With me in the studio to discuss the road ahead is the deputy president of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Good evening to you, sir, and welcome. [Mbeki] Good evening, Leslie. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, are you settling in? [Mbeki] Yes, we are in the process of settling in Leslie. We ... [pauses] Everybody is moving into new offices and finding staff and discovering where the dining rooms are and where the toilets are and things like this. Yes, yes, I think everybody is in the process of doing that. [Mashokwe] Let us into the last cabinet meeting you had. We are talking about a government of national unity, a potpourri of people from different backgrounds. Is it working? Will it work? Are there problems? [Mbeki] It will work. It will work. I think the ... we are all of us proceeding, I think from the same basis, that there are certain things that need to be done in the country. People need jobs and I don't think any of the parties represented in the cabinet would disagree with that. We need to ensure that the standard of living of the people throughout the country is raised and I think everybody would agree with that. All of us agree that we need to attend to the matter of violence, whether political or criminal. That has to be attended to. We need to ensure that we have proper relations with the rest of the world. I think all of these matters are agreed, so we are starting, maybe broadly speaking, from the same base, and I think that that's what will assist in making this cabinet -- never mind that it's got three parties in it -- a cohesive unit. I'm sure about that. [Mashokwe] Are there problems? [Mbeki] Well, the ... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Insurmountable -- insurmountable problems. [Mbeki] You mean within the cabinet? Sure, I would imagine that there would be tensions. We are all coming from different points. We've got different histories. We've just come out of an election campaign that was vigorously fought and people need to get to know one another better. Yes, I would imagine that there would be tensions, but as I say that there's a broad vision which we all of us share and that fact ought to help in terms of overcoming whatever problems there might be in terms of people getting used to one another. [Mashokwe] The big expectation out there is that of nation building and reconciliation. What would you regard as priorities as you step into this? The party's over and government has got to start operating now. [Mbeki] Well, the ... Parliament resumes Leslie on the 24th of this month, and the president will give a state of the nation address, and we expect that that nation, or that state of the nation address will reflect the opinion of the cabinet as a whole. I think that will be an important moment when this new government says: We are speaking with one voice with regard to various matters, and that ought to translate in terms of the constituencies of the various parties in the cabinet, that at that level -- that process of national reconciliation, of building one country, of determining priorities and programs -- that it is possible to do all of that despite the fact that you are dealing with different parties, so I think that's going to be an important moment, because at that point, as I say, the cabinet will speak with one voice, I hope, and that ought to send the message to the country that we can and must, as different political entities, act together. We want, also, to ensure that in the preparation of that presentation by the president, that the president would have consulted further, further than the parties represented in the cabinet -- the unions, the business community, the civic organizations, the traditional leaders and so on, so that you ... what you should then get coming across on the 24th of May, is a national vision. [Mashokwe] But that doesn't answer my question on what you as deputy president will regard as priorities. [Mbeki] Sure, the priorities. I thought you were asking a question about what needs to be done to convey an image, a message of reconciliation and of acting together. With regard to priorities, surely the priority, the basic priority, must be to -- as quickly as is possible -- to change the conditions of life of the people. That has to be basic, whether it relates to jobs or housing or health or education or land or any of these questions. That has to be fundamental priority. The people have won their democratic rights. They voted -- exercised that right, elected government of their choice. The next step in the emancipation of the people must be to address the issues of freedom from hunger, freedom from poverty, from want -- all of those sorts of questions. That must be priority. Of course there must be detailed programs -- when ... what do you do with housing? What do you do with job creation, provision of water in the countryside and all these questions? But I think that that's a priority that must underpin this. I was saying earlier that one of the questions again that is critically important is the matter of violence. Just now, on Friday, 12 people got killed at Thokoza. We ought not to have anything of that kind. More than 400 people have been killed in Natal since the state of emergency was declared. That must be priority. It's both political and criminal violence -- but that must be priority in terms of the programs that this new government must engage in. [Mashokwe] Let's go back to the issue of reconciliation if we may. Sir, the point is people were murdered, maimed, killed in the past and you talk ... [pauses] The ANC talks of a commission of truth. At one point we have amnesty for security generals -- people, and the question is: Are you going to come up with a blanket amnesty for political killings at the expense of people who probably still have that pain in their heart, who were killed, maimed, during those days? [Mbeki] Leslie, this new government of national unity has not yet discussed this question, so I couldn't speak for that government on this issue. It is clearly a matter that must be addressed. Our own view with regard to this is that if we took the route of amnesty, indemnity, whatever, it would be important that anybody affected -- it doesn't matter from where they come -- whether they come from the ANC or from anywhere else, that they must say what it is they want to be indemnified for. If I ask for indemnity, I need to say: These are the things that I did for which I require indemnity, but as I say, the matter has not been discussed. It clearly is one of the issues that will be discussed by this new government, but I am reflecting on a discussion which I think goes beyond the ANC. Even the legal community in the country is raising the point, that if there is to be amnesty for anybody it needs to be known what it is that they are applying for. [Mashokwe] But will that not open up wounds? [Mbeki] No, the intention is not to open up wounds. The intention is to solve an existing problem, and as you are saying, there are many problems that have not been solved. I've got a first cousin of mine who disappeared. We don't know -- as a family we have looked. We have asked questions. We don't know where he is. He has disappeared. It's possible that somebody out there knows, and it will be good for the family that they know -- not for purposes of retribution -- so that at least we know that this person is gone forever. No, it's not for purposes of retribution. We are not after Nuremberg trials. We are ... [pauses] It's necessary to clean the slate, to solve these outstanding questions -- answer them, and so that we can at least know what it is that we should never repeat again, in future. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, I need to ask you this one. It's very important. You are deputy president and reports reaching us here indicate that in the next two years or so Mr. Mandela might be handing over the reins of power to you. Is that the plan? [Mbeki] No Leslie, the ... [pauses] I heard today that a London newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, carried some report that Nelson Mandela is going to retire after two years or something -- absolutely no truth to this. In fact we ... I found it rather reprehensible that you could get a newspaper like that and whoever writes for it, writing a thing like that. They ... [pauses] I'm quite certain. They didn't even have the courtesy to ask Nelson Mandela is this true. I know they certainly didn't come to me. No substance of any truth at all to this, and dealing with this particular newspaper it's not the first time that they floated all sorts of funny ideas which, you know, seem to us clearly intended to destabilize the ANC, in this instance to destabilize the new government, the presidency. There's no substance. Nelson Mandela has been elected to lead this country for five years when we'll have the next election, and it will be up to the ANC and Mandela to decide whether he stands for a second term of office. There's no truth whatsoever to the story and as I say I think it's rather reprehensible. I think it's ... [pauses] You are a journalist. You are part of the media. I think it is bad ethics for the media to handle matters in the way that this particular newspaper has handled this matter. [Mashokwe] But you are the national chairman. You are the deputy president. It is not ludicrous, anyway, for people to speculate in that direction. Is it? [Mbeki] Well, you see, sure -- I suppose there's no law against speculation. That's perfectly alright, but to assert this matter in the way as I understand that this particular newspaper asserted it, that highly-placed sources in the ANC, whatever phrase was used. I think that's bad, particularly that, I mean, if this was serious I would have expected that your fellow journalists would try and seek Nelson Mandela's opinion to say: Mr. President, I understand the following -- what's your view? But they don't, and the intention can't be honorable. The intention can't be to inform. I think the intention is something else. [Mashokwe] Okay, let's look at other issues -- death penalty. Some right-wingers were given the death sentence very recently. There are question marks around the ANC's policy on death penalty, some say the official one ... [pauses] line is -- now, you don't like -- the ANC does not like the death penalty. Are you going to institute death penalties? Is the ANC government going to move away from death penalties? What is the thinking? [Mbeki] We are against the death penalty, and I'm quite certain that when the matter gets discussed that's the position that the ANC will present. We don't think its correct for ordinary persons like ourselves to take into our hands the power to take away other people's lives. The matter will be discussed surely, but as I say, our own view remains that it would not be correct for the government to give itself such power. The right to life -- the right to life as South Africans -- I think we need to be very sensitive to that because too many people have died in this country, in criminal violence, in political violence. People continue to die, and I think you want to create a society which has a sense of revulsion at the fact of murder, of taking away of people's lives, whether it's done by elected organs of state or by individuals. [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, let's think a bit about the Hani murder, for instance. It occurred during the days of the old government and the sentence passed, in people's eyes, befitted the action. Are you going to be standing in the way of the carrying out of that action? [Mbeki] Well, as I say Leslie, as I say, talking about the ANC -- we want to say no. Sure, the commission of crime, of any crime, must receive the necessary response from the judicial organs of the country, but we do not believe that this particular retribution, this particular punishment, death, solves anything. It perpetuates a notion which is unhealthy, that people can take other people's lives. [Mashokwe] Let's move over to matters financial. A lot has been written in the papers about the pay raises that the new government has earned itself, or what the Melamet Commission has recommended. A lot of people say in the days of electioneering, the ANC, particularly, was vocal on the need to cut on government expenditure, salaries for that matter. The question is: What action are you going to be taking now that you are in government? [Mbeki] Well, we would like to have the recommendations of the Melamet Commission discussed by parliament, in the first instance. There may be some technical problems about payments. You've got members of parliament sitting there, you've got ministers sitting there, and there may not be any particular framework to deal with the matter of their salaries at the end of this month. That's got to be addressed somehow. But no, we would want to -- parliament, and society in general -- to participate in the debate as to ... about this particular matters, so there hasn't been a decision, certainly not on the part of the ANC and certainly not on the part of Parliament, to say that we accept the recommendations of the Melamet Commission. We would want all those matters discussed openly and criteria, rules, principles and all of that, discussed and agreed, but I think we also need to say this Leslie, that it's important not to set up a salary structure for elected officials such that you expose those elected officials to bribery, and that's important. If you take an elected official and you pay them at rates which are clearly inadequate you expose them to temptation. You also clearly don't need to pay those elected officials at rates that are far above what people in equivalent positions are earning, because you are creating a different problem. So I'm saying that we need to find a balanced solution to this question, but certainly, if you said you want to have your elected officials living as though in monasteries or nunneries, what's going to happen? You are going to call them back here to say: Why did you accept this money from here or there, because in the end, in terms of maintaining families and leading ordinary lives, if you expose them to poverty, they will ... they will be susceptible to bribes. [Mashokwe] Today's newspapers indicate that a national debt of 60 billion rand has been accumulated and you are receiving this in your hands as you move into office. Is that a priority? Is that a problem? [Mbeki] The size of the national debt is a problem. It's been a very ... [pauses] It's become a very high-ranking element in terms of public expenditure. The servicing of that public debt -- it has been -- last year it was, I understood, second after education -- I hear ... I see in the press now that it's likely to become the first element. Yes it is a worrying factor because it means that you tax the public, raise public revenues in order to service, to pay the banks. It's something that must be addressed very seriously and it's part of the constraint. It's part of the constraint in terms of the handling of public finances, that you couldn't act in a way which once more raises that public debt, because I say in the end you have national resources being consumed by servicing that. It's a real situation. It's unfortunate that it happened, but we inherited it and we've got to deal with it as best as we can. [Mashokwe] You referred earlier on to violence that has been rearing its head here and there in the country. The question is: Are we going to see you being able to cut on defense and security in the coming years, as it was envisaged by the ANC -- we will cut money on defense, use it for other things. What is the situation now as you move into real government. [Mbeki] Yes, we do believe it's a -- if you are talking about defense -- it should be possible to keep those defense figures low, because, in the first instance, you know we've got to read the situation. What is the threat to this democratic South Africa? We are talking about the defense forces. Does Swaziland threaten us, or Lesotho, or Botswana, whatever, meriting whatever expenditure -- or do we have a naval threat from India so that we must buy many naval ships and all that? I would imagine that that kind of threat is not really there. That should help to address the issue of what source of expenditure we should have on defense. With regard to the maintenance of law and order, hopefully the situation is going to change, the situation with regard to the relationship between the police and the public. I know for a fact that the new minister of safety and security is very concerned about this matter, senior police officers are concerned about this matter, because I do believe that once you change that relationship between the police and the people, the capacity of the police to prevent crime and to catch wrongdoers will be much increased. It may not need more policemen, it will certainly need better cooperation between the people and the police. [Mashokwe] Millions of rands have been pledged to the country by foreign governments over the past few days. America spoke of 600 million dollars and we say, where is this money going to? [Mbeki] That money ought to go into reconstruction and development. It ought to go directly into projects that are targeted at improving the conditions of life of the people, whether it's housing or health, clean water in the rural areas, roads so that people have got access -- that's where it ought to go. [Mashokwe] But if past experiences are anything to go by, many of these monies have ended up in bureaucracies, and this brings me to the question of civil service. A smaller, efficient civil service is what the ANC was taking about. Does this mean people are going to lose their jobs? [Mbeki] Well, we don't have past experience Leslie in this country [laughter] because there has never been a democratic government. [Mashokwe] Eh, but there was a government [words indistinct]. [Mbeki] Yeah, not a democratic one anyway. No, with regard to the public service. We have said, indeed, that we are not after sacking anybody. We -- job security is guaranteed, questions of pensions are not going to be affected, but clearly we have got to keep public expenditure down with regards to that kind of expenditure. I am not talking about capital expenditure, public works programs, and so on. We have got to keep recurrent expenditure down, so the ANC certainly does not have any intention of a radical increase in numbers of people within the public service, who are -- without offending anybody -- who are pen-pushers, and I think it will be possible. There are many structures of government that are being established in terms of the new constitution, which structures of government we will probably need the civil servants that are already employed. We might have to increase, somewhat, but I am saying that we are not looking forward to a radical rise in recurrent expenditure because clearly it would have a negative impact. [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, how then are you going to be implementing affirmative actions? People who voted for the ANC believed that their lot would be changed come an ANC government? [Mbeki] Well, yes, sure, change must happen. Change must happen. Change does not happen necessarily because you increase the number of people in an office from five to 20. Change can happen in many ways. You see, for instance the South African economy, the South African economy needs very many skilled people, whether they are technicians or engineers or whatever. So I mean, it ought not to be that we proceed from the position that to create employment take them into the public service. Why don't we say, in the context of a growing economy you are going to need all the skills? [Mashokwe] Is it out of question, Mr. Mbeki -- I have to butt in here -- to say there are people who were advantaged by the apartheid government then, who ascended to positions like that of a general, and somebody who voted for you would want to say, I have been in civil service and I hope to be able to move up there because the government has changed, and I have the qualifications. I was denied this in the past? [Mbeki] Sure, very legitimate, and I would believe that the public service commission for instance would look very favorably at that. We want to remove racism, we want to remove discrimination, whether gender or race. We need to remove that discrimination from the system, and indeed you are quite right, you might find that there are people who have the competence, the experience, the qualifications, but who were kept down because there was apartheid, and that those matters certainly need to be addressed. [Mashokwe] Is South Africa rejoining the world -- the OAU, SADC [Southern African Development Community], PTA [Preferential Trade Area], AFD [expansion unknown]? [Mbeki] The new South Africa will be admitted by the OAU when it meets at summit level during the month of June. We certainly will be looking for an early meeting with the SADC to look at -- there has been prior discussion with them about this -- but to look at what happens, how South Africa joins this grouping, and many groups like this, the African Development Bank... [Mashokwe, interrupting] Commonwealth? [Mbeki] Commonwealth, yes. In our own view South Africa should go back into the Commonwealth, but again this is a decision that the new government will have to take. [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki thanks for your time, and thanks for talking to us. [Mbeki] Thanks.
