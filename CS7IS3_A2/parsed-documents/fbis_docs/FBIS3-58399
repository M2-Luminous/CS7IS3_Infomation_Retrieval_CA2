Indeed, at their Brussels meeting, the Sixteen found a series of balances which are promising for the Atlantic alliance's future. They also largely cleared up two major misunderstandings that could have clouded their future relations: The action to be taken in Bosnia and opening up the alliance to new members. First, there is a Euro-American balance. Bill Clinton fully recognized the political dimension of the European Union acquired by the Maastricht Treaty and the role which the Twelve intend to give themselves in the security and defense sphere. Speaking of a "new spirit" in transatlantic relations, Francois Mitterrand said: "The consent wrested from the Americans in Rome (in 1991) with regard to recognizing the European defense identity seemed perfectly natural in Brussels.... Distrust has been replaced by great mutual confidence." The U.S. President, for his part, did not seem to use this affirmation of European identity to dissociate himself from the "Old Continent." He promised to leave 100,000 men there -- a sign of the strategic importance which Europe continues to have in the Americans' view. Moreover, he seems to be really involving himself in the fight for the continent's integration, including Russia, and is even taking the lead in it. The determination with which he defended his Partnership for Peace plan clearly demonstrates this. In this respect, too, NATO found a degree of balance between the expectations of the Central European countries and Russia's fears. Although the link between the Partnership and NATO membership remains unofficial, it was reaffirmed that the neighboring countries of Central Europe can have a fairly clear prospect of future club membership. British Prime Minister John Major moreover explicitly mentioned Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. That was no accident. German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, the most ardent advocate of NATO's expansion within the German Government and the most skeptical about the Partnership for Peace plan, yesterday described the summit as a "great success" and said that it offered Germany's eastern neighbors "a clear prospect of membership." This did not prevent Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev from seeing it as "a step in the right direction." Finally, with regard to Bosnia, NATO unanimously adopted a very measured stance. The threat of air strikes against Tuzla and Srebrenica is a "tactical" use of the stick, mid-way between a purely verbal threat and the risk of escalation which the announcement of an intervention in Sarajevo could, for instance, prompt. It is a calculated risk but one which, at least for the time being, safeguards NATO's credibility. Even more significantly, France and Britain, which last year were strongly opposed to the American idea of air strikes, rallied round to it while the United States, hitherto critical of the Europeans' conciliatory approach, finally gave approval to the Twelve's plan to try and secure a peace agreement.
