The restituted land is 5 percent down from the intended over 50 percent set by the ministry for 1993. A total of 1,027 land division plans were drawn up by December 31, 1993. The list of most efficient areas in this country is headed by northeastern Bulgaria, while southern Bulgaria ranks last, the deputy agriculture minister said. He also said that the recent months have witness a speeding up of this process. As main stumbling blocks for land restitution the speaker pinpointed the shortage of jurists and land-use planners in the land commissions, as well as the belated passage of an act to regulate the compensation to be granted to the owners who cannot have back the whole of their land. The land reform cannot be accomplished unless parliament passes this act, Mr. Stoyanov stressed. In case the necessary funds are available, the land reform can roughly be completed by year's end, Mr. Stoyanov believes. According to the ministry's estimates, the land reform needs some 800 million leva, which have been envisaged in the 1994 draft budget. The parliamentary committees are expected to open the debates on the draft budget as early as this week.
