Issues related to the development of Ukrainian-French relations were discussed during the conversation. Much attention was paid to ways of encouraging French investment in Ukraine's economy. Whoever is the first to do this will gain a higher profit, Moroz stressed. Among the major topics discussed was the issue of eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Chernobyl is a misfortune not only for the Ukrainian people. The world community should understand that this is a matter of concern for all. It is necessary to resolutely move from declarations to concrete assistance, Moroz declared. Peissik said that a representative of France's prime minister is expected to arrive in Ukraine in early July. This visit will be entirely dedicated to the Chernobyl issue. During the talks they also discussed ways of expanding Ukrainian-French interparliamentary relations.
