Ignatyev] [Text] In the early 1980's, the Pentagon began implementing a program of more extensive use of outer space for military purposes. The motives for these activities are reflected in the words of J. Abrahamson, director of the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) Program: "Space is the first line of defense." The question of gaining superiority in space became particularly critical in connection with the launching of a program for creating an antiballistic missile [ABM] defense system with space-based elements. It was during this period in the United States that a jump in appropriations for military space was observed (from $6.7 billion in 1982 to $10.6 billion in 1984), AFM 1-6 Military Space Doctrine (15 October 1982) and AFM 1-1 Basic Aerospace Doctrine (16 March 1984) were issued, and the first steps were taken to organize the American space forces. Creation of space commands -- first in the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and then a unified command -- entirely corresponds to the principles of organizational development of the American Army and Navy. Maintenance of military equipment and upkeep of personnel are entrusted to the so-called main (administrative) commands, and their operational use and combat employment are entrusted to the unified (operational) commands. The main commands are subordinate to the departments of the branches of the armed forces, and the unified commands are directly subordinate to the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]. Before creation of the space commands, functions for the operation and control of satellites in orbit were performed primarily by the U.S. Air Force Systems Command (no longer in existence), which was called upon to oversee the development, production, and testing of space equipment. On the whole, the Air Force's activities in this area, according to American experts, were functionally isolated, organizationally not thought through, and technologically limited. A similar picture was observed in the departments of the U.S. Navy and Army, where the space systems being used also were not included in the force composition of the armed forces; that is, they were not part of operational formations and large units subordinate to the JCS through headquarters, command posts, and control centers. In addition, bodies of operational management did not exist in the branches of the armed forces for such systems, and functions of development, operation, and control were entrusted to the same commands. As space activities intensified and the role of space systems increased, these factors increasingly made their presence felt. According to one Pentagon representative, "any event in space immediately required the intervention of the JCS and Department of Defense." It should be noted that the U.S. Department of Defense encountered serious difficulties from the very start in forming the space commands. First, a considerable part of the space systems is used in the interests of several branches of the armed forces and agencies of central subordination. Second, the functioning of ground-based deep-space surveillance and nuclear missile attack warning systems is closely linked to military space activities. Third, attempts to share space systems caused rivalry between branches of the armed forces. Finally, the proposed activities of space commands inevitably would affect the sphere of responsibility of the unified American-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command [NORAD], which financed the deep-space surveillance and warning systems. As a result of repeated reorganizations and resubordinations accomplished since 1979, today a definite structure of space commands has taken shape in the U.S. Armed Forces. The central role was allotted to the Air Force, which participated most in the creation and practical use of space systems. (The Air Force accounts for 90 percent of the specialists in the field of space and 80 percent of the U.S. military space budget). Surveillance and warning systems were removed from control of the NORAD Command (for all intents and purposes, Canada did not participate in accomplishing the corresponding tasks and operating the facilities) and transferred to the space commands of the branches of the armed forces. The affiliation of the space systems was preserved and determined by what branch operated the ground-based control and data collection and processing centers and was the primary consumer of the information received. The U.S. Space Command [USSPACECOM] was created on 23 September 1985 (headquarters at Peterson AFB, Colorado) as a necessary link of operational management between the JCS and the space commands of the branches of the armed forces. Initially, the space commands of the Air Force and Navy, and later of the Army, were operationally subordinate to the Headquarters of the USSPACECOM. Today, this is one of nine unified commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. The following were defined as its basic missions: Development and constant adjustment of the space doctrine and methods of conducting combat operations with the use of space assets; estimating troop needs for equipment and compiling purchase orders for it; developing the tactical and technical requirements for advanced systems; operational control of forces and assets of subordinate space commands when conducting space operations. According to U.S. Air Force regulations, space operations mean possible operations calling for the use of outer space for military purposes. They are divided into four groups: Active operations, control of outer space, support of ground forces, and support of space systems. Antiballistic missile defense and also strikes from space against ground targets are considered active operations in the United States. Control of outer space includes, on the one hand, operations to protect the orbital grouping of spacecraft and, on the other, countermeasures against enemy spacecraft and ground services (ranges). Various types of satellites are to provide support to ground forces: Communications, navigation, reconnaissance, meteorological, and other satellites. Today, the United States has at its disposal only such assets which are not strictly weapons and are not capable of hitting targets in space or from space. As far as support of space systems is concerned, this includes surveillance of outer space, launching satellites and controlling them in orbit, identifying and cataloging space objects, and also actions associated with maintaining space systems in working order. The USSPACECOM commander is simultaneously the commander of NORAD and the Air Force Space Command, and a Navy admiral is appointed as his deputy. Attempts to divide these positions proved unsuccessful, which indicates the difficulties of creating balanced structures in the space forces. Actually, the USSPACECOM is a relative concept, since it does not possess its own forces and assets. Its only real component is the headquarters as a body directly subordinate to the JCS. In connection with the impossibility of a clear-cut division of the functions of NORAD and the USSPACECOM, the headquarters is the same for these commands (there are a number of common directorates). The recently formed operations center, which has 24-hour shifts, and a joint intelligence center, whose tasks include continuous global assessment of the current space situation, operate under the USSPACECOM. Today, the personnel strength of the command headquarters exceeds 650 people; 50 percent Air Force, 30 percent Navy, and 20 percent Army. When creating and accepting into service new elements of the ABM defense system and anti-satellite weapons, it is planned to make them operationally subordinate to the USSPACECOM. The U.S. Air Force Space Command, created on 1 September 1982 (headquarters at Peterson AFB), became the first formation of this sort in the armed forces. In the period that has passed, it has repeatedly undergone substantial organizational and structural changes which, apparently, are not final. Today, the following belong to the command: All American nuclear missile attack warning and deep-space surveillance systems; the U.S. Air Force space command, control, and telemetry complex; the Western (headquarters at Vandenberg AFB, California) and Eastern (Patrick AFB, Florida) missile ranges; command, control, and data reception centers of a number of space systems; a unified NORAD/USSPACECOM command post at Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. On 1 July 1993, the 20th Air Force, consisting of six Minuteman and MX ICBM wings, was transferred to the command. As experts believe, this will make it possible to more effectively use common logistic and technical support facilities to service missile equipment (ICBM's and missile platforms) and range services, and to simplify training of personnel for common military occupational specialties. The sphere of activities of the Air Force Space Command includes operating and servicing corresponding equipment, personnel acquisition and training, technical equipping of units and subunits, and organizing their daily activities and combat training. The space commands of the other branches of the armed forces performs similar missions. In addition to the 20th Air Force, the main components of this command are four space wings and one space group (Figure 1). The 21st Space Wing includes all American nuclear missile attack warning systems and also the NORAD/USSPACECOM command post; the 30th and 45th space wings include the Western and Eastern missile ranges, respectively; the 50th Space Wing includes the unified military space systems command and control center and the Air Force space command, control, and telemetry complex; and the 73rd Space Group includes the Spacetrack deep-space surveillance system. Figure 1. Structure of U.S. Air Force Space Command The IMEWS[.sup]1[/] space-based ballistic missile launch detection system provides U.S. military-political leadership warning about a nuclear missile attack. It includes four-five satellites constantly operating in a stationary orbit, ground information reception centers at Buckley AFB, (Colorado), Narranger (Australia), Kapaun (FRG), six mobile reception complexes at Holloman AFB (New Mexico), and also BMEWS, Pave Paws (Figure 2 [not reproduced]), and Parks ground-based systems (a total of eight radar sites in the continental United States, Alaska, Greenland, and Great Britain). With the exception of Alaska (the site at Clear), all nuclear missile attack warning system sites are equipped with modern powerful radars with phased-array antennas capable of detecting ballistic targets at ranges up to 5000 km. The deep-space surveillance system (organic assets -- Spacetrack system sites, committed assets -- sites of scientific research centers and agencies and also U.S. test ranges) includes a total of 15 ground-based radar and optical (optico-electronic, Figure 3 [not reproduced]) surveillance sites. The bulk of them are located in middle latitudes on the territory of the United States, Turkey, Italy, South Korea, and islands of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. Deep-space surveillance systems (Air Force and Navy), if necessary, are able to support conduct of active operations to protect American satellites and to counter space activities of other countries. They conduct surveillance of space objects (perform 60,000 coordinate measurements daily). The NORAD and USSPACECOM command posts have a catalog of approximately 7,000 space objects, where data of these observations are registered. During the latest reorganizations, ground centers of U.S. reconnaissance space systems and satellite communications intercept sites of other countries located at Misawa Air Base (Japan), Griffiss AFB (New York), and Lackland AFB (Texas), and also in the areas of Edzell and Feltwell (Great Britain) were included as part of the 73rd Space Group. The 50th Space Wing is a large subunit of the Air Force Space Command. As the command structure developed, the Air Force space command, control, and telemetry complex (SCCTC), ground-based infrastructures of the main communications (DSCS, NATO-3), navigation (NAVSTAR), weather reconnaissance (DMSP), and other systems were consolidated into it. It is planned to transfer the LANDSAT natural resource reconnaissance satellites and corresponding ground equipment to the wing. Through the SCCTC, the Air Force control the majority of U.S. reconnaissance satellites, experimental spacecraft, and also equipment used for working out space components of antiballistic missile defense under the SDI Program. Every day 9 sites (on the territory of the United States, Great Britain, and Greenland) conduct about 600 communications sessions with satellites and accomplish continuous control of more than 70 spacecraft in orbit. In compressed time periods, literally in several years, Falcon AFB was turned into the largest facility, which comprised a single whole with the adjacent NORAD and USSPACECOM command post, the Air Force Space Command Headquarters, and the Air Force Academy in the "space" state of Colorado. This air base houses the main center for control of U.S. military space systems (total area of 27,000 square km), which is combined with the control center of the experimental test complex where the SDI Program is accomplished. Here the major satellite communications center, the central Air Force SCCTC post, the main control station, and leading control station of the NAVSTAR navigation system are deployed. Presently, personnel of the 30th and 45th space wings, respectively, accomplish operation of all structures of the Western and Eastern missile test ranges, servicing of launch complexes, and preparation of spacecraft for launch. Operational services of the Eastern Range are additionally charged with providing security for Space Shuttle launches, and launches of ballistic missiles from U.S. and British submarines from adjacent water areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Minuteman and MX ICBM's as well as target missiles (under the SDI Program) are launched from the Western Missile Range to the vicinity of the Kwajalein ABM Range (Marshall Islands). The United States mainly uses various models of Atlas, Delta, Scout, and Titan booster rockets at this stage. According to American estimates, up to 40 percent of the military space budget is spent on their procurement, launch preparation, and launch. However, in connection with the high degree of automation at launch complexes of both ranges, no more than 16,000 military and civilian specialist are permanently employed. The total personnel strength of the Air Force Space Command is presently (not counting the 20th Air Force) more than 30,000, with up to 14,000 of them civilian specialists. Organization of the U.S. Navy Space Command began on 1 September 1983 based on the Navy's existing deep-space surveillance system, several space systems, and their ground components. Presently, the command, which includes the Navy's SPASUR space surveillance system, operates the satellite navigation (Transit), communications (FLTSATCOM, LISAT), and SSU maritime and ocean theater reconnaissance systems. Its main structural components are an aerospace group, a space operations support center, and a space reconnaissance and surveillance directorate (Figure 4). Figure 4. Organizational Structure of U.S. Navy Space Command The SPASUR system consists of nine radar sites (three transmitting and six receiving) located in the southern U.S. states which create along the 33-degree north latitude parallel a solid barrier beam for detecting spacecraft using scattered reception of reflected signals (interferometric method). Together with Air Force Spacetrack sites, they form the integrated SPADATS deep-space surveillance system, which accomplishes missions in the interests of the Defense Department. The SPASUR system supplies up to 75 percent of the information for the already mentioned general catalog at the NORAD/USSPACECOM command post. The leadership of the American Navy most actively opposed creation of a unified space command, fearing infringement of its interests on the part of the Air Force, which repeatedly has raised the issue of transferring all space activities under its control. As a compromise, a procedure was adopted under which a U.S. Navy admiral was appointed NORAD/USSPACECOM deputy commander. Today, the personnel strength of the Navy Space Command varies between 2,000 and 3,000 people, and its headquarters (100 people) is at Dahlgren, Virginia. The Army Strategic Defense and Space Command (ASDSC) was created in 1992 as a result of a merger of the Space Command (formed 7 April 1988) and the Strategic Defense Command (1 July 1985), responsible for implementing Army projects within the framework of the SDI Program. There were two main causes for the difficulties of its formation: The U.S. Army's lack of its own space systems and the need to tie various tasks into a single complex justifying the creation of such a command. Today, the ASDSC performs two basic functions -- participation in space activities of the Department of Defense and supervising research projects in the field of antiballistic missile defense. A number of ground-based control centers and sites of the DSCS strategic satellite communications system and NAVSTAR satellite radio-navigation communications system, as well as the Kwajalein ABM test range (Pacific Ocean) and agencies directing scientific research and development in the field of ABM defense (Figure 5) belonging to the Army have been transferred to the command. Figure 5. Organizational Structure of U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space Command The Army has traditionally participated most actively in creating the American ABM defense system. All the major ABM program were developed under its leadership: Nike-Zeus, Sentinel, Safeguard, and others. Today, within the framework of the SDI Program, the Army command authorities organize and oversee development of such ground components as radar, anti-missile missiles, powerful ground-based lasers, and also research and development for creating tactical systems such as THAAD, Corps SAM, ERINT anti-missile missiles, and command, control, and communications equipment. Prior to the formation of the ASDSC, the personnel strength of the Army Space Command was about 450 and that of the Strategic Defense Command over 1200. The ASDSC Headquarters (about 100 people) was located at Peterson AFB, and the main research and development administration bodies in the ABM field are located in Arlington, Virginia, and Huntsville, Alabama. On the whole, the U.S. Army Strategic Defense and Space Command serves as an example of a sufficiently artificial, compromise organizational structure, the appearance of which was the result of rivalry between the branches of the armed forces and a reluctance to lag behind others. Such are the basic functions, structure, and composition of the space commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. The diversity of missions associated with space activities, the difficulties of classifying equipment and distributing functions, and the different degree of participation of the branches of the armed forces in space programs in the end prevented the American military leadership from creating balanced and equal tables of organization and establishment. A statement made in May 1993 by the chairman of a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee for armed forces appropriations, D. Murtha, is typical: "It is a strange thing that we annually spend $15 billion (U.S. military space budget--I.I.) and no one is responsible for this." Another example is observance of a schedule of rocket booster launches from U.S. ranges. As American experts calculated, from 1990 through 1992, when the missile test ranges were already under the jurisdiction of the Air Force Space Command, only four percent of the booster rocket launches were accomplished on schedule, and some waited several months to be launched. To demonstrate the point, we will point out that a 24-delay in the launch of a heavy Titan-4 booster rocket costs the Defense Department $6.8 million. National security is considered the primary goal of American space policy; therefore, the space commands will continue to keep their status. "Despite the end of the Cold War," stated former Chairman of the JCS C. Powell, "our national security will, as before, depend on the effectiveness of space systems." For several years, the United States voted against adoption of any resolutions in the UN on demilitarization of outer space, striving to convince other countries that space was already militarized long ago, and in the interests of mankind itself. At one time, creation of space commands meant transferring space systems from the sphere of scientific research activities to the area of combat employment and including them directly in the combat structure of the armed forces. By the year 2000 the Clinton Administration plans to reduce the Pentagon's military space budget 15 percent. Time will tell how much these good intentions are fulfilled. Footnote 1.
