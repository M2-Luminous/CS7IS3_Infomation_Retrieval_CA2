Wieker, Deputy Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;2390. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below. The Decision and Order adopts the procedures set forth in the Proposed Decision and Order ( see 58 FR 68,903 (December 29, 1993)) that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $610,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into with J.R. Cone on May 14, 1993. The funds were paid by Cone towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period from November 1973 through February 1977. The DOE is currently holding the funds in an interest bearing account pending distribution. The OHA has determined to distribute the Cone Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states will be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be based on the volume of petroleum products they purchased. Applications for Refund must be postmarked no later than June 30, 1994. As we state in the Decision, any party who has previously filed an Application for Refund in the crude oil refund proceedings should not file another Application for Refund. The previously filed crude oil application will be deemed filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures are finalized. Dated: April 5, 1994. Thomas O. Mann, Acting Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
