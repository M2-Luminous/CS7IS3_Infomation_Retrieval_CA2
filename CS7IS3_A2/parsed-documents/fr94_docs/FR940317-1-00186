FR940317-1-00186 FR940317-1-00015 All comments received by FAA and NPS at the addresses and by the dates listed above will be reviewed and utilized in any development of proposed regulations. Comments received pursuant to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will be analyzed and discussed in the preamble to the Proposed Rule. Any proposed rulemaking will also be made available for public review and comment. Regulatory Process Matters Economic Impact The FAA and NPS are unable to determine at this point the likely costs of imposing regulations affecting overflights of national parks or the annual effect on the economy. Following a review of the comments submitted to this ANPRM, the FAA and NPS will determine what regulatory requirements will be proposed, if any, and will review the potential costs and benefits, as required by Executive Order 12866. Significance This anticipated rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866. The FAA has determined that the ANPRM is not significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034, February 2, 1979). Other Regulatory Matters At this preliminary stage it is not yet possible to determine whether there will be a significant economic impact on a number of small entities or what the paperwork burden might be. These regulatory matters will be addressed at the time of publication of any NPRM on this subject.
