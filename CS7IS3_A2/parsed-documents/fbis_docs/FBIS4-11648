This is agreed upon by leaders attending the fourth G-15 summit in New Delhi, India. Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the leaders agreed that ministers representing the group at Marrakesh should meet before the meeting to coordinate their positions. He said the subject on the need to impose a global minimum wage raised by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir will be viewed with concern. Efforts should be made to ensure such a move is not approved or endorsed. If a global minimum wage is imposed, it will have serious negative consequences in the industries and economies of the South countries.
