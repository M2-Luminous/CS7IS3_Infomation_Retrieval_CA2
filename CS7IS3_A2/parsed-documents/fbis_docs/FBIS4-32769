The PSDR leader said that the PDAR Leader Victor Surdu was attempting "to draw the electorate of his party onto a certain zone in order to justify the PDAR shift to opposition." Anyway, the ruling PSDR will treat the PDAR "as an opposition party with all the consequences resulting thereof," said Adrian Nastase.
