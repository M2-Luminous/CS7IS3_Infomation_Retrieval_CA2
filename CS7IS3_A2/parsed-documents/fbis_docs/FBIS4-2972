Mr. Qian was also interviewed on this occasion on a number of issues covering Hong Kong, Taiwan, the international community, and China's foreign affairs. On the Hong Kong issue, Mr. Qian pointed out that a breakdown of negotiations between the Chinese and the British sides mainly affected the transition of the legislative body but not the administrative structure because it is subject to a major change, including the replacement of the administrative head but not the general civil servants. The legislative body should have remained intact through to 1997 but now it will have to be reelected. Other matters will be handled in accordance with the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This meant that it was just a partial breakdown while the "one country two systems" will be adopted. Mr. Qian said further that there would be no direct transition of the three-tier assembly to be seen in the 1994 and 1995 elections to be held unilaterally by the British Hong Kong Government. It was, he said, up to the future special administrative region to set up another administrative structure by holding another election which would be based on the Basic Law and on the actual situation at that time. Mr. Qian said that hopefully a steady transition was possible with concerted efforts by the Hong Kong people.
