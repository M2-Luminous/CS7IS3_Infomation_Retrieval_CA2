FR940819-1-00063 FR940819-1-00011 ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.57)'' Instructions for Proposed Item 33 Only if Types 1&hyph;6, Item 32, are indicated, mark here the status of warning devices at the crossing at the time of the accident: 1. Provided minimum 20-second warning. 2. Alleged warning time greater than 60 seconds. 3. Alleged warning time less than 20 seconds. 4. Alleged no warning. 5. Confirmed warning time greater than 60 seconds. 6. Confirmed warning time less than 20 seconds. 7. Confirmed no warning. If status code 5, 6, or 7 was entered, also enter a letter code explanation from the list below: A. Insulated rail vehicle. B. Storm/lightning damage. C. Vandalism. D. No power/batteries dead. E. Devices down for repair. F. Devices out of service. G. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to accident-involved train stopping short of the crossing, but within track circuit limits, while warning devices remain continuously active with no other in-motion train present. H. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to track circuit failure (e.g., insulated rail joint or rail bonding failure, track or ballast fouled, etc.).4 J. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to other train/equipment within track circuit limits. K. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signals timing out before train's arrival at the crossing/island circuit. L. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to train operating counter to track circuit design direction. M. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to train speed in excess of track circuit's design speed. N. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signal system's failure to detect train approach. P. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to violation of special train operating instructions. R. No warning attributed to signal system's failure to detect the train. S. Other cause(s).
