S. assistant secretary for South Asian affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to start negotiations with Pakistani government officials and political leaders. On her arrival in Pakistan on Sunday, she met with the acting President Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. Ms. Raphael's meeting with Benazir Bhutto is considered very important, and U. S. Ambassador John Minjo and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Sheharyar Khan were also present at the meeting. It was learned that these talks began with discussion of India-Pakistan relations and the Kashmir problem. The United States had assured that it would support efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in the United Nations. Ms. Raphael said that the Kashmir issue would be resolved according to the UN resolutions. The United States had advised that the nuclear programs in South Asian countries be frozen, rolled back, and then destroyed. It was assured that no pressure would be put on any country unilaterally to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If what Ms. Raphael has said represents the Clinton administration's policy, then we should understand that U. S. policy on Pakistan is changing. Pakistan and America have very old relations, and Pakistan still desires good relations. However, we cannot deny that it was the United States that brought about the coolness in the bilateral relations. It has always tried to take advantage of Pakistan's friendships through some agreements, and has never considered Pakistan's needs and interests. It is especially true when we had problems with India, and during trying times, the United States not only left Pakistan alone, but also took steps to benefit India. In the context of the nuclear program, the U. S. policy seems to want to make India a powerful country in this region. Under the Pressler Amendment, military and economic aid to Pakistan has remained suspended. A few months ago, the United States threatened that it would declare Pakistan a terrorist nation just to please India. Therefore, believing that the United States has changed its policy over Kashmir's nuclear program and other issues could be premature. Since the United States itself is responsible for the tension and cool relations between the two countries, it should take the initiative in improving this relationship, and must provide facts to support its intentions.
