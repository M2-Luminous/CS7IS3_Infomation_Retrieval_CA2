"I have no future because I am going to die very soon," a distressed King Sihanouk told reporters at the Royal Palace. French doctors who took the blood samples sent the tests to the king's doctors at Beijing Hospital. "The results are not good," the king said. "The doctors in China told me, 'You have a problem. The cancer is still threatening your life.'" King Sihanouk, 71, has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy in Beijing since October following the discovery and removal of a malignant tumor near his prostate gland. The cancer has since spread to his bone marrow. The king, a mild diabetic, also said the tests showed he has an accumulation of fat around his liver and continuing problems with arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. King Sihanouk was originally scheduled to return to China on June 2, but he said that he was moving up his departure two weeks to May 18, in frustration at the bickering of politicians here and his inability to solve the Cambodian conflict after UN-sponsored elections last year. "It is true that I have very, very serious health problems, so .... I prefer to go now to Beijing because I am not happy with politicians here," he said.
