This was proved by the signing of several agreements here today, which was witnessed by Malaysian Minister of Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz. The agreements worth a total of 60 million U.S. dollars are principally for the establishment of integrated entertainment centers, comprising multiplexes and dynamic motion simulators in Shanghai and other cities of China, Ramli Kushairi, chairman of South Malaysia Industries (SMIB) told newsmen here today. SMIB is a big shareholder in the proposed projects. The venture partners are United Cinemas International owned by Paramount Pictures and Universal MCA, and China Venturetechno International and Shanghai Paradise, a leading Chinese entertainment company listed on Shanghai's stock market. The international standard multiplexes to show the latest films "will meet the needs of the more affluent and discerning Chinese consumers", Ramli said. The first multiplex would be opened in Shanghai in January 1995, he said.
