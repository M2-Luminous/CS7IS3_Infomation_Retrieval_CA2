It has emerged that an unidentified criminal or group of criminals set off two large explosions. We think that what you can see on your screens requires no comment. The explosion seriously damaged not only the building of one of the Security Ministry's services, but also the neighboring buildings of the Meteorological Center of the Academy of Sciences and the Defense Ministry's Military Academy. Fortunately, neither the students at the Military Academy, nor the security service officials on a night shift in the building were injured. The material damage is probably worth hundreds of millions [no denomination as received] [passage omitted]
