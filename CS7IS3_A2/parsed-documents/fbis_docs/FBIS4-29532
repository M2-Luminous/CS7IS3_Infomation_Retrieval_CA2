The North Korean nuclear issue has entered a totally new phase as North Korea and the United States are moving toward an agreement on dialogue with "special envoy Jimmy Carter" as a mediator. [passage omitted] The United States expressed its willingness to suspend efforts for UN sanctions on North Korea and to hold the third round of talks if North Korea returns to its previous status; if it returns to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and does not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Therefore, it seems that if North Korea accepts the U.S. proposal, the North Korean nuclear issue will "run the course of dialogue" as opposed to the "accelerating sanctions" situation that prevailed two days ago. [passage omitted] Accordingly, how North Korea will prove its nuclear transparency and to what extent the United States will improve its relations with North Korea are expected to be focused in the discussions at the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, if they are held. With regard to the verification of North Korea's nuclear transparency, the United States will demand special inspections [tukpyol sachal kkaji] by the IAEA, and North Korea will insist that the nuclear development will naturally be frozen as a result of the abolition of its existing nuclear facilities and by the U.S. assistance in the light-water reactor system. This difference in opinion between North Korea and the United States will probably cause another tug-of-war. It is expected, however, that a clue to solving the problem will be found in the agreement between Jimmy Carter and President Kim Il-song on "building mutual trust". The extent to which the United States will proceed with discussions on improving its relations with North Korea will totally depend on North Korea's attitude. The United States has said that it will improve relations with North Korea to a considerable extent if North Korea proves its "100 percent innocence" in regard to the development and possession of nuclear weapons. The United States and our government have completed coordination on this position. [passage omitted] The ROK and the United States have agreed that "when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks is held, South-North dialogue for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula should be held, and this means South-North bilateral inspections." This reflects our position that North Korea's nuclear transparency must be verified, not only by the IAEA, but also by our government. It is the line drawn by the policy of our government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned with the North Korean nuclear issue, but has kept away from negotiations on the issue, and it is its due demand. [passage omitted] We should also pay attention to the possibility that, as the supply of light-water reactors require a long time, several years, and a budget of several trillion won, North Korea will demand the fourth and fifth rounds of North Korea-U.S. talks while insisting on "freezing its nuclear development after the supply of light-water reactors." In preparation for this possible situation, the ROK and the United States are likely to put on hold [yuye] the draft resolution on UN sanctions on North Korea, rather than abolish it. The policy of "dialogue for sanctions and sanctions for dialogue" will inevitably be the basic principle that the ROK and the United States should adhere to until the North Korean nuclear issue is completely resolved.
