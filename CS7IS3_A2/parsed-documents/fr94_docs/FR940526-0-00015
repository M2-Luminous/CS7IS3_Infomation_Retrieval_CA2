FR940526-0-00015 FR940526-0-00006 An increase in the 1994&hyph;95 budget of $700 for compliance audits, $200 for salary expense, $100 for audit expense, and $500 for postage will be offset by a decrease of $1,000 in Committee expense and $500 in the miscellaneous category. Major expense items include $4,000 for Committee member compensation for meeting attendance, $2,000 for surveillance inspection, $1,800 for office supplies, $3,000 for postage, $1,500 for miscellaneous, $1,000 for audit, $2,400 for Washington Potato Commission contract fees, $11,200 for salaries, $1,800 for salary expense, and $5,200 for compliance audits. The Commission provides certain services to the Committee as specified in a memorandum of understanding. An interim final rule was published in the Federal Register on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15039). That interim final rule added ยง946.246 to authorize expenses and establish an assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through May 2, 1994. No comments were received. While this rule will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 946 Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 946 is amended as follows: PART 946_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN WASHINGTON 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 946 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. Accordingly, the interim final rule adding ยง946.246 which was published at 59 FR 15039, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: May 20, 1994. Eric M. Forman, Deputy Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12882 Filed 5&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
