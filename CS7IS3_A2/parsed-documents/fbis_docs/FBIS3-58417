Among other things, the two discussed establishment of peace in the Middle East, the situation in the Central Asian states and former Soviet republics. Underlining the importance of Iran-German parliamentary friendship group, Ms. Suessmuth formally demanded that German national, Helmut Szimkus, sentenced to death for espionage, be pardoned by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i. Referring to Iran's policy in Central Asian republics, Larijani who arrived here last Monday, said Tehran was to provide security to its borders with those countries. He noted that the U.S. prevented Iran from having cooperation with the Persian Gulf littoral states and from setting up regional cooperation to bring peace and stability into the region. Larijani also said Iran was for annihilation of arms of mass destruction, atomic, chemical and biological weapons in the region. On Tehran's opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord, the Iranian official said Iran only expressed its political opinion in this connection and it was not an obstacle to peace but was rather for realization of a just and real peace. The only way for real and lasting peace in the region was consideration of equal rights for Muslims, Christians and Jews, he noted. "The Islamic Republic of Iran is always ready to use its influence, if asked by Europe, in the region to establish real peace," Larijani said. In another development, Larijani had a separate meeting with Deputy Economic Minister of Germany Dieter von Wuerzen who stressed the importance of continuation and improvement of Iran-Germany political and economic relations. He also welcomed the proposal of cooperation among Iran, Europe and the Central Asian republics and expressed Bonn's readiness to play an active role in Iran's second five-year development plan (1994-98). Head of the German Parliamentary friendship group, Christoth Matschie [name as received], also present in the meeting lauded Iran's efforts for establishment of peace in the region, to mediate between warring Azerbaijan and Armenia in particular, and for hosting millions of Afghan, Azeri and Iraqi refugees. He referred to the Rushdie issue, allegations on Iran's involvement in assassination of kurdish leaders in Berlin and Iran's disagreement with the PLO-Israeli accord as differences existing between the two countries. Larijani, in response mentioned the granting of asylum to terrorist organizations by Germany, Bonn's failure to carry out its obligation towards Tehran including completion of Bushehr power- plant, negligence of German judiciary system regarding hundreds of Iranian prisoners in Germany, the West's support for Salman Rushdie and the biased stance and unrealistic attitude of the German press against Iran. He said Iran considered the West's support for Rushdie as open hostility with Islam and Islamic sanctities.
