A Chinese official with responsibility for aviation policy said that lack of British cooperation over air service agreements between Hong Kong and other governments would lead to the termination of any agreement not approved by the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). "The natural outcome will be that CAAC (the Civil Aviation Administration of China) will get into the market after 1997," the official said. "In principle, after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, the British companies should retreat from the territory and Chinese or Hong Kong companies should take over. "But in practice, taking account of reality, we accept the fact that some British companies have been operating quite well and have established a reputation among customers. "They deliberately withhold the texts of these agreements to try to maintain the status of domination of Cathay Pacific over Hong Kong's air services." The official argued that Cathay Pacific by itself could not cope with the increasing demands of the market. "It cannot even cope with two cities in Germany," he said. "There is no point to try to undertake the whole thing. Besides the CAAC will not throw it out. We can compete together (against foreign airlines)." Cathay Pacific has long been Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier, with monopoly rights on most routes. It has been given the rights to fly to countries which have air service agreements with Hong Kong, while its sister company, Dragonair, covers mainly mainland routes. The other registered airline, Air Hong Kong, carries only cargo. The Chinese official accused Britain of being reluctant to hand over documents and information concerning air services which have not yet been initialled by Hong Kong for discussions at the JLG. So far only eight out of about 30 air service agreements have been officially approved by the JLG. This leaves more than 20 at risk, should China fulfil its promise to revoke all agreements not approved by the JLG. Phil Burfurd, public relations manager of Cathay Pacific, yesterday played down the threat to Cathay. "We anticipate that we can keep our normal operation way beyond 1997," he said. "The air service agreements are done on a governmental basis. We are keen to see the agreement finalised." A British official maintained that the British were showing a full spirit of co-operation over this issue. "These are rather complicated issues involving not only governmental agreements but commercial confidences applied to airlines. We have to be very careful about how these things are handled," the official said. "If Hong Kong is, as provided for under the Joint Declaration, to have its own aviation regime and its own airlines it does not really matter who the owners of the airlines are Cathay has mainland shareholders anyway," he said. "We have attached great importance to preserving Hong Kong's aviation strength, one of the things which has made Hong Kong so successful. I believe Cathay, as a main Hong Kong airline, wants to preserve a satisfactory service regime along with all its aviation partners."
