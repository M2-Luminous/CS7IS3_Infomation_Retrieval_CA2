Children as Witnesses to Community Violence_$170,658 This project develops, implements, and evaluates after-school interventions to protect elementary-school-age children from the aftereffects of exposure to violence. The intervention program is expected to prevent or reduce the occurrence of certain negative psychological symptoms among children exposed to community violence. It should also help children develop coping skills that can reduce the likelihood of their future involvement in violence. The program is operated by Howard University and managed by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). OJJDP funds will be transferred to NIJ to complete this program in fiscal year 1995. Law-Related Education (LRE)*_$2,800,000 The Law-Related Education National Training and Dissemination Program includes five national LRE projects and programs operating in 48 States and four non-State jurisdictions.

Grantees will also be encouraged to develop violence prevention programs in primary, middle, and secondary schools and to foster LRE program expansion in urban minority communities. The major components of the program are coordination and management, training and technical assistance, preliminary assistance to future sites, public information, program development, and assessment. This program will be implemented by the current grantees, the American Bar Association, the Center for Civic Education, the Constitutional Rights Foundation, the National Institute for Citizen Education in the Law, and the Phi Alpha Delta Legal Fraternity.

Teens, Crime, and Community: Teens in Action in the 90s*_$1,000,000 This continuation program is conducted by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and the National Institute for Citizen Education in the Law (NICEL). Teens in Action in the 90s is a special application of the Teens, Crime, and Community program, which operates on two premises: (1) teens are disproportionately victims of crimes and (2) teens can contribute to improving their schools and communities through a broad array of activities. Under the fiscal year 1995 award, NCPC and NICEL will work through the National Teens, Crime, and Community Program Center to harness the energies of young people toward constructive activities designed to reduce crime and violence. The Program Center will be enlarged to serve as a formal clearinghouse for information and materials dissemination and to provide technical assistance and training. With the fiscal year 1995 funds, NCPC will significantly expand the number of communities participating in this program. This program will be implemented by the current grantee. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. ``Just Say No'' International*_$250,000 This grant will assist ``Just Say No'' International to expand its Youth Power program to public housing projects in Oakland, California, and Baltimore, Maryland.
