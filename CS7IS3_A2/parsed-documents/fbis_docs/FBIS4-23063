A. Lyakhov, Yu. P. Svirko, N. V. Suyazov, Institute of General Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 621.373.826] [Abstract]This article examines theoretical models that calculate the parameters of distributed (nonlocal) feedback optical lasers. The effective Q-factor approach used was asymptotically accurate, which made it possible to reduce the description of distributed feedback laser generation to a simple system of balance equations with concentrated parameters. The features of laser generation with light induced stochastic distributed feedback are examined. Optical bistability and generation of ultrashort pulses are possible, which reduces the threshold. Explicit equations are obtained which are suitable for practical evaluation of parameters in ultrashort pulse generation. An overview of experimental results is presented with analysis of the features and advantages of using distributed feedback lasers as sources of optical ultrashort pulses.
