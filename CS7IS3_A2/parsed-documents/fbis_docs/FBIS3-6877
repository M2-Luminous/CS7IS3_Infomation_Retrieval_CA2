He stressed: "I am strongly concerned about the possibility that such a figure may get beyond our control." The 1993 market share calculated by the U.S. method did not reach the "annual average of 20 percent" demanded by the U.S. Government when the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord was concluded. Therefore, Sekimoto's remark is meant to preempt the possibility that the figures in the U.S. report become the new "numerical target."
