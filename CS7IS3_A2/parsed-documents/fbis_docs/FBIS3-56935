Yeltsin forwarded to Ukraine President L. Kravchuk a message of a personal nature. It says that the assassination of Black Sea Fleet press center chief Lazebnikov has been received negatively by the Russian leadership. This has been reported by a confidential source from President Kravchuk's entourage, who stressed that the letter proposes in a rather harsh form to impose order in Sevastopol by joint efforts, and to decide finally the fate of the Black Sea Fleet in light of the Massandra understandings. The letter was sent bypassing the diplomatic channels of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
