How stable would such a government be and how much time would it be able to survive? [Boross] In principle, we must take every possibility into account, but I hope only in principle. There are also differences. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will not find such an easy ally as that one found by the Polish socialists. The MSZP will have a lot of problems if it wins, because the phase of unpopular measures has not yet come to an end. The Socialists will also have to take unpopular measures, just as we did; otherwise, they will cause big problems for themselves and the country as well. If they were more cautious with their promises and abstained from empty political cliches, their advance would perhaps not be so alarming. It is not the current situation, but the prospects for the future that concern me. At the same time, it is extremely important to preserve democratic values, and this requires elections. Free elections are the determining basis of democracy. We must accept the fact that some people might not understand the historic steps that have taken place now. [Fabian] In your opinion, what are the chances of cooperation between the Christian national forces? [Boross] If I think of historical analogies, I am pessimistic. The meeting in Szarszo was convened with similar slogans; nevertheless, it mostly turned into an excluding meeting. They excluded the major forces of the Christian national trend. I think that those who are now declaring a program have spoiled something. This is quite painful. It is unfortunate that there are people among those who represent one trend who come up with bad formulations and make dangerous formulations from both the international and domestic point of view. Their formulations are risky. Strong attacks have begun from within, and the situation is depressing. I must ask where Jozsef Torgyan belongs, whose activity leads to the fact that he cannot keep any one of his promises, because he made himself unable to join a coalition. Therefore, no matter what he says, the audience must know that nothing will come out of it because he does not have the power to carry this out; no one will form an alliance with him. I do not have rosy hopes regarding any collaboration; instead, I feel a division. This is the real risk. We know that the left will subordinate everything to its desire to return to power. [passage omitted] [Fabian] Political analysts say that two cycles represent the "wearing out time" of a government in a democracy. This can even be shorter under certain circumstances, as in the case of a change in the regime. Are there any resources left for a new government cycle? [Boross] Regarding its personnel, a government automatically undergoes changes in the first cycle. A government can become worn out by its own awkwardness or by a discrediting campaign like the one we have experienced in the past four years. Here we should take a look back to what this country was like in 1990 and how it is now, regarding property relations, administration, legal independence, constitutional order, and international relations. We can say that this government has not become worn out, because it has actually created the conditions for economic progress under normal and humane circumstances. Fortunately, there are similar governments in major Western European countries. Therefore, our foreign contacts are rather positive. As a propaganda ploy, one can say that the government has reached the point when it has to be replaced, but a sober observer looks at what would happen to this country if a change in direction took place immediately after four years. [passage omitted] [Fabian] How is Antall's heritage present in today's Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? [Boross] It is strongly present, and it is a very good feeling for me. His personality was suitable for remembering him in a theatrical way, but this is not what happened. Antall is present inside the party, at meetings when there is a need to quote him. This MDF will advance together with Jozsef Antall's ideas. [Fabian] If the MDF is again in the position to form a government after the elections, what partners can it count on? [Boross] First of all, the Christian Democratic People's Party is our natural ally. The United Smallholders' Party could also be another ally, a party that has governing successes and, with its seriousness, it might be able to win over the sympathy of village smallholders.
