Witnessing the great might of the People's Army which defies comparison with that 40 odd years ago, Yi expressed deep reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander, who has built an invincible army which no formidable enemy dare provoke. Recalling that the enemy in South Korea put him to all sorts of tortures to convert him, but could not bring him to his knees, Yi said: "I fought till victory with the conviction that I would win surely, as there was for me the great General Kim Il-song. "Touring different places of the socialist motherland, I was charmed by the great idea and guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the country and the people. "We will certainly win because the dear leader is with us. "Let all of us defend general Kim Chong-il with our lives." Yi In-mo wrote in the unit's combat register: "Let us be rifles and bombs defending general Kim Chong-il, the greatest general in the world, with death."
