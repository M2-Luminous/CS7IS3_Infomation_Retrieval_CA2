What expertise do you bring to the DGA [General Armaments Directorate]? [Conze] The DGA is an organization comprising 52,000 people spread over a good 60 different sites. Its activities are wide-ranging. Today, its staff is asking questions, sometimes anxiously. Why should we be surprised at this? The strategic environment has changed, European unification is making progress, economic constraints have increased, etc.. The DGA has an extremely positive balance sheet; the French arms industry has become number two in the world in terms of quality, and number three in terms of its turnover. It owes this success -- even if it is not consolidated -- largely to a particularly effective dialogue between the armed forces, the DGA, and the industrial players involved. The challenge we must meet, without (for pity's sake) breaking the instrument of success, is to make the organization develop so as to take better account of the new national, international, and European data. [Desaubliaux] Is the current period, mid-way between the 1993 general election and the presidential election in 1995, not more propitious to procrastination than making decisions? [Conze] For one or two years already, at least at the European level, the defense industries have been restructuring operations on a vast scale. Economic and budgetary constraints are forcing them to do so. Major reorganization is under way, involving alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Matra, Thomson, Giat-Industries, and others have shown the way. Today, the process is gathering speed. Negotiations have been launched in the missiles sector, between Matra and British Aerospace, and between Aerospatiale and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace]. More reorganization will follow and, in the relatively short term, other sectors will be involved: terrestrial armaments and, why not, the Air Force and Navy? This makes it all the more essential to define a strategy and fix objectives meeting the real operational needs of our armed forces. [Desaubliaux] In the context of European cooperation, is it sufficient to openly proclaim your willingness and determination" [Conze] If we do not succeed in securing effective economic cooperation, whole parts of the European arms industry will vanish. We can no longer do everything alone. This cooperation must leave the beaten track where, all too often, requirements were added up, management structures were superimposed, and national and international decisions were accumulated. What should we do? The answer must first be left up to the industrial parties involved. They must reorganize themselves, then determine "who does what where." The rationalization procedure must be implemented on an industrial basis and derive its support from various programs. The path we should follow is that of transnational industrial cooperation. Our priority must be to take account of operational requirements. At the risk of appearing slightly heretical, I would be tempted to ask not for a law on programs, but a law on requirements. [Desaubliaux] Let us take the future transport plane, the FLA [Future Large Aircraft], as an example. [Conze] This program is essential for both industry and the Armed Forces. I hope that it can be reorganized around the Airbus consortium because of the consortium's know-how, because of industrial rationality, and also because we must encourage the development of the European aeronautics industry. Nuclear Sector: Rock Bottom Budget [Desaubliaux] Will the programs already launched and new requirements not prove imperative? [Conze] If we continue committing the errors made in the past, there would be a need for a considerable budget increase. However, is it not be possible to reduce the increase required through better organization, better relations between the state and industry, and further developing the dialogue between the DGA, the Armed Forces, and industrial partners? This is what the white paper is suggesting. It is also the direction in which the DGA is reorganizing itself. Changing attitudes and modernized methods, e.g., by adapting the code for public procurement contracts or contract regulations, should enable us to fulfil the main requirements and achieve the key aspects of the programs, all while keeping within a reasonable budgetary framework. Increasing productivity by 2 percent each year does not seem to be an objective that is beyond the bounds of possibility. If we succeed in this, using a budget which is stretched to the limit, then we should end up having no need to resort to any major rethinking. [Desaubliaux] What about the reform of the Naval Constructions Directorate (DCN)? [Conze] Our objective here is to maintain, or even reinforce, the role and skills of the French military naval industry in Europe. We already have centers of excellence for this. I would add that we have embarked on a first large-scale European cooperation project, involving the Horizon frigate. This represents a major challenge. Our wish is to see this project through to the end, but nothing has been achieved yet at present. However, the structures of the DCN -- not to mention its status -- should further be changed. [Desaubliaux] Various studies have predicted the loss of 110,000 jobs in the defense industry over the next two years. And yet, you appear to brush aside all talk of dramatic reforms. Why? [Conze] We must endeavor to ensure that the necessary reorganization and restructuring--what has already decided and what is still to come--does not result in the disappearance of either large or small companies. Their technological competence is unique in various domains in Europe. For two years, 1992 and 1993, the arms industry paid a heavy price; representing 5 percent of industrial jobs, it accounted for 25 percent of job losses in industry. As I said several months ago, I am convinced that this industry will emerge from the difficulties it has recently encountered. So I remain optimistic. [Desaubliaux] In the nuclear sector, are there any urgent decisions to be made? [Conze] Modern systems are currently in service. In a few months' time, the nuclear submarine "Triomphant" will be armed with the M45 missile. The medium-range air-to-ground missile, the Hades, has been operational for fewer than 10 years and, even if it was mothballed, it is also a modern system. Successors will have to be ready by around 2010 or 2015. So there is no compelling urgency. The real challenge to be met is that of maintaining the level of competence, and scientific, technological, and industrial resources: the competence of the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], Aerospatiale, SEP [European Propulsion Company], SNPE [French National Gunpowder and Explosives Company], etc. From the national point of view and perhaps, in the long term, the European one as well. [Desaubliaux] Will nuclear tests remain essential? [Conze] Having spent 17 years in the nuclear sector, I can tell you that each test had a well-defined objective and fulfilled a well-evaluated need. When the moratorium was agreed in mid-1992, a series of tests had been prepared. The PALEN simulation program has been ongoing for several years now. We can expect a reduction, both in the number of tests carried out, and in the cost of the nuclear programs. However, its perfection, which ought to be accelerated, would require the resumption of tests sooner or later. [Desaubliaux] Can we economize in the nuclear sector? [Conze] Funds earmarked for the nuclear sector have dropped considerably in recent years, by something like 25 percent. We have now reached rock bottom, if -- in anticipation of a resurgence of threats, a scenario that we should not shut out of our minds -- we want to maintain our capacity and, if necessary, develop new arms. In one of the rare sectors of human creativity which covers a considerable number of fundamental disciplines, it is all the more important to set ambitious targets for the teams involved -- exploratory developments, demonstration projects -- even if there is no program to be developed in the immediate future. [Desaubliaux] Before returning to the DGA, you had said you were in favor of having a ground-to-ground missile. [Conze] Faced with certain kinds of threat, there may be systems more or less well suited to dealing with them. The ground-to-ground missile has its virtues, otherwise there would never have been any! In this respect, I am sticking to my convictions.
