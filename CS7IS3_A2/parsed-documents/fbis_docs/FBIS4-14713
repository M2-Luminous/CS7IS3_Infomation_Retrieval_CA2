General David Zaikidze was dismissed late Thursday after he and hundreds of his men occupied the Georgian Parliament for several hours in protest over the appointment of Shota Kviraya as interior minister. In an interview with AFP, General David Zaikidze denied rumors he had given Shevardnadze three days to sack Kviraya whom he contends is unfit for the job. He said he did not have designs on the post himself. "I don't want to be interior minister. We simply claim that Kviraya has made many mistakes since he began in the post," Zaikidze said. Kviraya was officially appointed Thursday but has been acting interior minister for the past three months. Prior to the interview, there were loud shouts in Zaikidze's office after which a representative of Shevardnadze stormed out. The rebel police chief was holed up in his office in the city police headquarters in the southern district of Sabordale under tight security. Zaikidze said he would not go against Shevardnadze and the parliament but said "that they (parliament) must listen to our requests and demands and the head of state must also listen to us and reach a decision". The atmosphere at police headquarters was tense, with Zaikidze bodyguards all carrying automatic weapons. The general commands around 7,000 officers in Tbilisi and his aides claim that the city police fully back the general.
