['Arafat] I am glad that I have had constructive and fruitful meetings and conversations with his excellency, President Yeltsin, and Mr. Kozyrev, with the interior minister, and the Duma speaker. After this, a fruitful and warm meeting took place with his Holiness, Patriarch Aleksiy II. In all of these meetings, particularly with President Yeltsin, we spoke frankly about the situation we are faced with and on how to give renewed impetus to the peace process. We also spoke about the obstacles that have sprung up and how to overcome them with Russia's help. For your country is one of the co-chairmen of the Madrid conference. You and the United States are its co-sponsors, and, as you know, Mr. Kozyrev, along with Mr. Christopher, appended his signature to the agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. The United States and Russia have a political and moral responsibility. For our part we are completely satisfied with the assurances that we have received from President Yeltsin. For he informed us that he is fully involved in the peace process in the region and is striving to achieve a real and universal peace there, particularly between the Palestinians and Israelis. [Correspondent] However, by 13 April peace had not been established. The agreements that have been signed are not being fulfilled. What do you think about the situation? What are the conditions for the renewal of the negotiating process? ['Arafat] Unfortunately, I am forced to say that the fulfillment of the fall Washington accords have been thwarted and postponed because of the Israelis' maneuvers. You must remember what the prime ministers stressed about dates and borders. Here are the results: 13 December passed by, 13 April passed by. No specific results have been achieved, on the spot. We do not have the results that could have moved the whole peace process forward. We are in a real impasse. We are trying now -- talks on this matter have taken place in Cairo and Paris, we have tried to find solutions in order to overcome such obstacles. For my part, I cannot give any assurances, no guarantees, because everything depends on the Israelis. Their authorities are wasting time for no purpose. They are trying to avoid fulfilling what was already agreed in Washington, agreed honestly, precisely, clearly, and in writing. Why, in my view, are there such delays? Everyone ought to know about this. Because the American administration gave to Israel -- it even sold peace earlier even than before the fulfillment of the Washington agreements. It supplied Israel with more armaments and the most up-to-date combat equipment; $10 billion of loans and credits; a huge powerful computer. It would seem that Israel obtained everything it wanted even before the implementation of the agreement. But we Palestinians paid for this, paid the price of peace, before the fulfillment of commitments by the other side. But we do not have this peace. Look, we still do not have our own state territory. One side has obtained everything, and the other -- the Palestinian -- has paid for this. As you can see, the delay in the deadline for the implementation of the agreement has given the chance to extremists from both sides. They have started to organize themselves and to act against peace. This is the result and this is how we have turned out. I have to say, unfortunately, that the peace process has lost its credibility. Faith in it has been lost since this breakdown over the time-scale of the implementation of the accord. [Correspondent] Mr. President, I recall your speech in Strasbourg at the Council of Europe to the parliamentarians of 32 countries. You spoke about a ruined economy and infrastructure. How do you hope to reconstruct and rebuild it, to renew it, and to give it a new boost? ['Arafat] But here I should disappoint the Russian people: Our infrastructure has been completely destroyed as a consequence of the Israeli occupation. As I have mentioned during my meetings with the EC ministers -- and I met them too, I said to them: Some of you occupied the Latin American, African, Asian countries and conquered their peoples at some time in the past. You were leaving behind states with ready infrastructure: Railway stations, radio, ports, airports, roads, clinics. But the Israelis have destroyed everything themselves and we, the Palestinians, have to begin from scratch. What sort of future do we face? It can either be something resembling the tragedy of Somalia -- the people in the Gaza strip are already threatened by hunger -- or we can grow into one of the economic tigers -- such as Singapore, for example. We have the necessary conditions and talents for this. As you know, the percentage of educated people among the Palestinians is the highest in the Middle East. Even higher than in Israel. But we need help from friends and brothers, as well as help and assistance from the international community. This is one of the issues I discussed here in Moscow. We have also discussed questions of economic relations. [Correspondent] You are the first Arab leader visiting the new Russia. Pointing to this, I should like to note that there is great potential and many unused possibilities that still exist in our bilateral Russian-Palestinian relations as well as in Russian-Arab relations as a whole. How do you see the prospects for economic, cultural, and scientific relations? ['Arafat] This is not the only thing that links us. In the first place we are neighbors. That is extremely important. I am sure that by ensuring the coordination at all levels, which we really need, we can achieve a lot. I hope that we can achieve coordination on all of these problems, not only in politics but also in economics, education, and the development of agriculture. I would particularly like to speak about an important sphere of Russian-Palestinian cooperation that I discussed with President Yeltsin and His Holiness Aleksiy II -- about Russia's links with Jerusalem, about spiritual and religious links. These are the centuries-old links between the Orthodox Church and the holy places. I think that they will acquire a second wind. In short, we are in favor of cooperation in all spheres and by all means. [Correspondent] Many thanks for your answers.
