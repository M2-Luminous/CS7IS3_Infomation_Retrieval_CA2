We have done our utmost to build a stable majority, but we have not succeeded, and the result is that this strong majority does not now exist.... But this must not frighten us: We have been underestimated in Parliament and are improving in all the opinion polls. We apparently already have over 25 percent.... And we are ready for any eventuality." It was shortly after 1100 yesterday, up on the fifth floor of the parliamentary group offices, which are connected to the lower house by a long elevated walkway. A meeting of Forza Italia's 100 deputies was under way. Silvio Berlusconi spoke in his twofold role as government leader and leader of the party-cum-movement founded five months ago. And he spoke off the cuff, taking advantage of the fact that no reporters were admitted to the room. He talked about the future, about alliances, and about strategies. He declared war on [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi -- "someone who is in danger of being understood and followed only by crazy people." He reaffirmed [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's loyalty but enlarged on his ideas about Benito Mussolini. He explained the nature of the party or nonparty that he wants to create and described future posts and responsibilities. He entrusted new deputy Fabrizio del Noce, former foreign correspondent for television channel 1 news, with responsibility for the very delicate media department. He provided answers on the question of internal dissent and the sudden departure of Domenico Mennitti (he may be replaced in the post of national coordinator by Paolo del Debbio). And he issued the following watchword to his colonels: We are ready for anything. He made it clear, with no circumlocutions, that "if it becomes impossible to govern, we will not be caught unprepared by an early election.... So much the worse for the others, for those who have failed to realize that they are playing with fire...." It was a case of Forza Italia versus the Northern League. Was this merely electioneering? Following the attacks from Bossi, who described the Berlusconi movement as "a UFO with no ideals," Berlusconi issued a sharp response, but warned his men "not to reply in the same tone, in the same language. We must ponder long and hard before attacking them, otherwise we risk losing votes, like them. Of course, the debate has now fallen below the danger level. Yesterday evening I saw Bossi on `Milano Italia' and I do not know whether it is possible to continue with an ally who insults you on television, and then tries to get smart by flirting with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and opening up to the progressive forces, without consulting with anyone...." Lastly, a piece of advice to his deputies: "Talk with the League deputies. Make them understand that they were elected with your votes, which are moderate votes. Make them listen to reason: If they follow Bossi they will quickly lose their seats, sooner than they imagine...." Though Bossi is a traitor, Fini "is loyal, a truly trustworthy ally. And we repay his loyalty. But that does not mean forever and unconditionally." The prime minister explained: "Today's alliances will not always be the same tomorrow...." This was a mysterious observation. Particularly when set alongside his brusque distancing from the fascism-antifascism issue. With regard to Mussolini and his American interview, Berlusconi explained that he "never said that Mussolini did some good things...partly because it is obvious that someone who wields total power will do both good things and bad things. But my thoughts lie elsewhere: Since we believe strongly in democracy, we want to do good things within democracy and certainly not under a dictatorship. Is that clear?" [passage omitted]
