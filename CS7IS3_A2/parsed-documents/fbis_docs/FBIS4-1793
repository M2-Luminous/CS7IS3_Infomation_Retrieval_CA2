The circular notes: Since China started implementing the policy of reform and opening up, exchanges with the outside world have increased and more and more people are going abroad to pursue their studies, either on government or their own expense. This has had a positive impact in promoting domestic economic development and advancing China's cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges with countries of the world. To broaden the appeal to skilled personnel and promote rational mobility, the circular urges public security departments to simplify procedures for people returning home from studies abroad to file for residence registration. The circular provides that when a person returning home from study abroad applies to have his residence restored in the location where he formerly kept residence registration, the police station should, upon examining his passport, restore his canceled residence registration. Where a person files for residence registration with another police station within the same city or county, the police station in the location where the person wants to move in should accept his application after examining his passport and a residence registration cancellation certificate issued by the police station in the locality where the person used to live. Where a person needs to settle down and work in another city or county, he should -- with documents issued by the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Personnel -- file for residence registration with the police station in the location where his employing unit resides. A person who has obtained a doctoral degree, or has been assigned to a key state project, to a state-owned large- or medium-sized enterprise, or to remote border region where conditions are tough, should have relevant documents issued by a personnel department at the provincial level or higher and a certificate on change of household registration; he may also apply for change of residence for his family members and under-age children. The circular also readjusts the time limit for canceling residence registration. Students who go abroad for studies for less than one year need only complete their exit registration, and do not need to cancel their residence registration.
