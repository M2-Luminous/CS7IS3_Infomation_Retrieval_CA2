FR940223-0-00028 FR940223-0-00015 These final rules, like the proposed rules, revise §§404.987 and 416.1487 to clarify that we may reopen and revise a final determination or decision either on our own initiative or upon the request of a person who was a party to the determination or decision. While the final rules clarify that the Appeals Council has the discretion to reopen a final decision of an ALJ on its own initiative, as well as at the request of a party to the decision, under the conditions specified in §§404.988 and 416.1488, they do not make the reopening authority under §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) inconsistent with the authority provided under §§404.969 and 416.1469 for Appeals Council own-motion review of an ALJ decision. Sections 404.988 and 416.1488 state the conditions under which a determination or decision that has become final may be reopened. Sections 404.969 and 416.1469, on the other hand, authorize the Appeals Council to initiate review of an ALJ decision that has not become final. A decision by an ALJ becomes final unless a person who was a party to the decision requests Appeals Council review of the decision within the stated time period, see §§404.968 and 416.1468, or the Council itself decides to review the decision within the time period provided in §§404.969 and 416.1469. The latter sections provide that any time within 60 days after the date of an ALJ decision or dismissal of a hearing request, the Appeals Council may decide on its own initiative to review the decision or dismissal. By contrast, §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) allow the Appeals Council to reopen a final decision of an ALJ for any reason only within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination made in the case. In almost all cases in which an ALJ decision becomes final, this 12-month period for reopening for any reason will have expired due to the normal processing time required for the disposition of the case through the reconsideration and ALJ hearing steps of the administrative review process. Therefore, a final decision of an ALJ seldom can be reopened under the conditions specified in §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a). Comment: Some commenters expressed the view that the proposed rules were unfair to claimants and beneficiaries because they permitted SSA to reopen on its own initiative a final determination or decision that was favorable to the individual and make a revised determination or decision that could be unfavorable to the individual. One commenter stated that fairness requires that only claimants and beneficiaries be permitted to initiate the reopening and revision of a final determination or decision. Response: Our authority to initiate reopening gives us the discretion to reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative under the conditions described in §§404.988 and 416.1488 whether such final determination or decision was favorable or unfavorable to the individual. The revised determination or decision which we make may be less favorable or more favorable to the individual than the prior determination or decision, or it may involve merely a technical revision that does not affect the ultimate conclusion regarding the individual's rights under the Social Security or SSI program. The policy that we may reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative is advantageous to many claimants and beneficiaries. While an individual may request that a final determination or decision that was unfavorable to the individual be reopened and revised, it is often SSA, and not the individual, that discovers that an error was made, or that new and material evidence exists, that provides a basis to reopen and revise a final determination or decision that was unfavorable to the individual. The authority to reopen on our own initiative allows us to reopen and revise the determination or decision in these cases even though the individual has not requested reopening. Indeed, in many, if not most, cases in which we reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative, we do so for the sole purpose of making a revised determination or decision that would be more favorable to the individual than the prior determination or decision. Our longstanding policy regarding the authority to reopen on our own initiative is intended to ensure that the final determinations and decisions which we make about the rights of individuals under the Social Security and SSI programs are fair and proper. It enables us to protect the integrity of these programs by allowing us to reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative, as well as at the request of a party to the determination or decision, in cases where, for example, the determination or decision was obtained by fraud, the evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made in the determination or decision, or new and material evidence shows that the determination or decision is incorrect. See §§404.988, 404.989, 416.1488 and 416.1489. In addition, if we reopen and revise a final determination or decision on our own initiative, any person who was a party to the revised determination or decision has the opportunity under §§404.994 and 416.1494 to request that the revision be reviewed. Under these sections, if an individual is dissatisfied with a revised determination or decision made in his or her case, he or she may request further administrative or judicial review, as appropriate, of our revised determination or decision. Comment: Two commenters believed that some of the conditions for reopening determinations and decisions provided in §§404.988 and 416.1488 are too broad. One of the commenters stated that the criteria in §§404.989 and 416.1489 for determining whether good cause exists to reopen under §§404.988(b) and 416.1488(b) should be clarified to provide more precise standards for determining good cause to reopen. The other commenter urged that the criteria for determining good cause be modified to limit further the conditions under which a determination or decision may be reopened. This commenter also recommended the elimination of the provisions of §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a) which permit the reopening of a determination or decision within 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination for any reason. Response: We do not believe that there is any need at this time to modify or clarify the specific criteria in §§404.989 and 416.1489 for determining whether good cause exists to reopen a determination or decision under §§404.988(b) and 416.1488(b). In addition, we believe that the conditions for reopening provided in §§404.988 and 416.1488, including the provisions of §§404.988(a) and 416.1488(a), are sufficiently restrictive. These sections of the regulations provide that a determination or decision may be reopened only within limited time periods and/or under limited circumstances. They limit the conditions under which we may reopen a final determination or decision either on our own initiative or on the request of a person who was a party to the determination or decision. The final rules, like the proposed rules, only revise §§404.987 and 416.1487. The sole purpose of the revisions is to clarify our longstanding policy that we may reopen and revise final determinations or decisions on our own initiative as well as at the request of a party to the determination or decision. These final rules, therefore, do not make any changes to §404.988, §404.989, §416.1488 or §416.1489. For the foregoing reasons, the proposed rules are being adopted as final regulations. Regulatory Procedures Paperwork Reduction Act These regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements necessitating clearance by the Office of Management and Budget. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect determinations or decisions about the rights of individuals under the Social Security and SSI programs. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.
