The poll will probably put an end to debates centered not only on the degree to which unification with Romania is sensible and historically justified, but also on what to actually call the people. Victory for the Agrarians in the parliamentary elections and the attendant insurance for the "Counsel with the People" policy being conducted by them have clarified this question: The state bears the name Moldova, Moldovans live in it, and they speak Moldovan. It seems that the epithet "Romanian," having dominated all spheres of republic life in recent years, is on the way out. The Agrarians also promise to review the national anthem, which is identical to that of Romania. What is Romania's reaction to this unexpected turn of events in Moldova? A group of eminent representatives from the Moldovan intelligentsia sent a protest to the United Nations assessing the negative backlash on the part of the Romanian press and certain political movements as interference in Moldova's domestic affairs. Using the results of the poll, the parliamentary majority will doubtless push a decision on the status of the southern and eastern regions through the legislative body even before a new constitution is adopted. But although a draft law on the Gagauz question has already been agreed, dialogue with the Dniester Region has yet to begin, and it will not be easy. The Tiraspol authorities are interpreting the majority of that region's inhabitants' non-participation in the elections to the Moldovan parliament, and subsequently in the national poll too, as a declaration of the region's own statehood. However, the hope was expressed in the Dniester Region that with the victory of the Agrarian Democratic Party relations between Chisinau and Tiraspol will alter radically, and Moldova will "embark on a constructive path." The first session of the new parliament is expected to ratify the agreements on the CIS. With the defeat of the idea of unification with Romania, a number of ministers are expected to leave, first and foremost the ministers of culture and education, and the head of the languages department. The most extreme activists of the People's Front are represented in the leadership of these departments.
