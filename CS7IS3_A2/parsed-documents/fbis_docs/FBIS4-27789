FBIS4-27789 "dreas108__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan EU Demands for Deregulation Outlined EU Demands for Deregulation Outlined OW0306062394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0306062394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Full details have emerged on the items that the European Union (EU) has demanded that the Japanese Government deregulate. There are 32 items in all, including: 1) revising the current Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, which restricts direct investment by foreign corporations in some areas of business to make corporate acquisition in Japan easier; 2) introducing a permit system for mutual acceptance of foreign inspection standards for electronic equipment and to promote imports; and 3) expanding the access of foreign capital to pension operations. Demands on deregulation in the area of finance are nearly the same as those from the United States. On 31 May the Japanese Government and the EU began a working-level exchange of views regarding the demands. The 32 items of the EU's demands were classified into five areas -- investment promotion, information and communications, import promotion, market liberalization, and distribution. The EU and the Japanese Government are supposed to exchange views on them item by item in order to probe for points of compromise, and on 31 May, five government agencies concerned -- the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Economic Planning Agency, and the Management and Coordination Agency -- conducted negotiations with officials of the EU individually. The Japanese Government wants to incorporate what are agreed in the discussions into the deregulation plans to be formulated by the end of June. Regarding corporate acquisitions, the EU is demanding the amendment of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, which is viewed as "granting a veto over the acquisition of Japanese corporations by foreign corporations." The law at present provides that foreign corporations making direct investments in Japan can do so in most areas of business by making ex-post-facto reports but must file advance reports for government review and approval in four particular industries: oil, agriculture, leather, and mining. The EU considers the exceptional measures on these four areas of industry as barriers to investments. For import promotion, the EU wants the standards and permits for electric equipment mutually recognized between Japan and the EU, thus saving time taken in import inspections and enabling the EU-approved product specifications to be accepted by Japan automatically. In addition, the EU requests simplification of import inspection procedures for television sets and video cassette recorders. With respect to customs service, the EU seeks reduced commission rates, simplification of quarantine procedures, and 24-hour customs office operations of major seaports and airports. Its demand in the financial field is the same as that of the United States--the easing of rules on pension operations. Whereas at present only the trust banks and life insurance companies are allowed to deal with public pensions (welfare pensions and national pensions), the EU requests that Japan open this business to investment consulting companies. The scale of public pensions in operation ran to about 20 trillion yen at the end of 1993, and European and U.S. investment consulting companies have been raising their voices to demand that Japan open this area to them. Regarding pensions, the EU wants Japan to ease the regulation on ceilings which are put on the amount of money used on operations of private businesses' pensions, and to raise the ceilings.
