EU [European Union] External Economic Relations Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan went to the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on April 18 armed with a "first thoughts" paper on Ukraine, containing three major proposals. The Commission will consider the full paper at its April 27 meeting, then pass it back to the Foreign Affairs Council in May. Options "The paper proposes alternatives. These must go to Council and one cannot be sure they will materialise," an EU source said. Sir Leon told ministers about U.S. studies calculating a shortfall in agricultural inputs in Ukraine worth about 120 million U.S. Dollars, and suggested this problem could be addressed by provision of seeds and fertilizers to Ukraine either directly or via a loan for purchase of materials. A second option would be a straight balance of payments loan to Ukraine, although this would have to be part of an International Monetary Fund package. The Commission has not put any figures to these suggestions yet, and officials said budgetary implications of the ideas would be considered as they became more concrete. Option three would be an aid scheme for building nuclear reactors with modern technology and improving their safety record. However, this type of assistance would only be granted on the condition that the Ukrainian authorities bite the bullet and close down the ill-fated Chernobyl plant, where the world's worst nuclear accident on April 26, 1986 polluted the surrounding countryside and large areas of Europe, causing many deaths and leading to a high incidence of cancer in the Ukraine. The advantage of this proposal would be that it would finally close Chernobyl and show EU citizens that their governments were doing something for their safety, an official said. He admitted this would cost "very big money," and would have to be coordinated with the other major donors as the Group of Seven.
