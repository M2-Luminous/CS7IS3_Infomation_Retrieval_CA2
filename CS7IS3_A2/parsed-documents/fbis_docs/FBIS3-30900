Accordingly, the News, The Week, and the Daybreak [Napkelte] programs will follow the events of the campaign in the first period of the election campaign, strictly adhering to the principles of proportionality and impartiality. In this period, the television will not broadcast paid election advertisements. In the campaign period in the stricter sense of the word, the television will broadcast campaign programs by introducing the parties and their candidates that have a national list. It will provide an opportunity for the parties to contrast their views and ideas twice a week in 60-minute discussion programs. The leaders on party lists will participate in the last, 90-minute discussion forum to be held two days before the elections. During the four-week campaign period, all parties that are on national lists can appear on television with a film edited by themselves and at their own costs, in the order drawn in front of a public notary. Every party will have two chances to appear, first with a five-minute film, then with a 10-minute one. To prepare these programs, the parties will be able to use Hungarian Television's film archives for a charge, but they can only use material made on them and not other parties. In the actual campaign period, all parties can have altogether one minute per day advertising time on the two channels together. The propaganda films will be made at the cost of the parties and the television will broadcast these for 10 percent of the usual charge. The broadcasting time of these advertising films will be decided by a draw. The same applies to the period between the two rounds of the elections. In accordance with the election code of ethics, parties that set up lists have to be shown in news programs on the election events under identical conditions, and the election reports have to be done in proportion to their nominations. The duty of the election programs is to explain the electoral law in an understandable way, and to assert that participation in the elections is a moral and political obligation for all citizens. To inform the public, constitutional lawyers and politicians will explain the electoral system, its advantages as opposed to other systems, and the procedure of the elections. According to the chairman's orders, to mobilize the public and to ensure the highest possible participation, these programs will have to show the election experiences of western countries, the electoral activities of Hungarians living in the West, and well-known Hungarian intellectuals will have to speak about this issue. The views of the committee that is defined in the elections code of ethics will have to be asked on disputed or unclear issues. These orders will come into force from the date of their publication, namely 4 February 1994.
