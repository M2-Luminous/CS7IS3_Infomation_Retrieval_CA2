FR940426-1-00073 FR940426-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 51 [FRL&hyph;4878&hyph;3] Proposed Rulemaking on Ozone Transport Commission; Emission Vehicle Program for the Northeast Ozone Transport Region AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: On February 10, 1994, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) submitted a recommendation to EPA under section 184 of the Clean Air Act (the Act), for additional control measures to be applied throughout the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR). Specifically, the OTC recommended that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC LEV or LEV) program for the entire OTR. The OTC's recommendation, developed after notice-and-comment pursuant to section 184(c)(1), is published here as an appendix to this document. Under section 184(c)(3), EPA is to review the OTC's recommendation to determine whether the additional control measures are necessary to bring any area in the OTR into attainment by the dates specified in the Act, and are otherwise consistent with the Act. Based on this review, EPA is obligated to determine whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's recommendation. If EPA disapproves or partially disapproves the OTC recommendation, it is to explain why the recommended measures are not necessary or are not otherwise consistent with the Act, and to specify additional control measures that would be equally effective. Upon EPA approval or partial approval of the OTC recommendation, EPA is to make a finding that the relevant States' State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are inadequate under section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act (relating to contribution to nonattainment in downwind States), and those States are to submit a SIP revision within one year of the finding adopting the approved control measures. This notice describes the framework for EPA's action on the OTC's recommendation and describes the issues EPA is considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendation. DATES: EPA will be holding a public hearing on the OTC recommendation on Monday, May 2, 1994 from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. (EDT) and on Tuesday, May 3, 1994 from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (EDT). The comment period will remain open until June 3, 1994. Please direct all correspondence to the addresses shown below. ADDRESSES: The hearings will be held at the Fifth Floor Auditorium, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Building, 79 Elm Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06106. Written comments should be submitted (in duplicate if possible) to the Air Docket (see address below). Copies of information relevant to this matter are available for inspection in public docket A&hyph;94&hyph;11 at the Air Docket (LE&hyph;131) of the EPA, room M&hyph;1500, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7548, between the hours of 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mike Shields, Office of Mobile Sources, U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, telephone: (202) 260&hyph;3450. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Overview of Title I Scheme The OTC's recommendation under section 184(c) of the Act that EPA mandate that States in the OTR adopt the LEV program arises in the context of the program designed to address ozone (or ``smog'') pollution in subpart II of part D of title I of the Act. This program is described in detail in EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and the Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble, 57 FR 55620 (Nov. 25, 1992).
