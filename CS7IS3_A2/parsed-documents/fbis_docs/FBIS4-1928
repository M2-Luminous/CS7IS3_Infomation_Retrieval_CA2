Through further exchanging opinions, they deepened their understanding of each other's viewpoints and put forward new opinions for settling the differences. This should be affirmed. However, the talks did not reach written agreement on the issue of "sending back people who enter the other side's area in violation of the regulations concerned" and two other technical issues according to the expectations of the leaders of the two organizations while in Beijing, and failed to exchange opinions and talk about the issues of "jointly cracking down on maritime smuggling and robbery and other criminal activities," "protecting intellectual property rights on the two sides of the straits," "building up ties and mutual assistance between law courts on both sides of the straits," and a number of economic and technological issues enumerated by the "Agreement of the Wang-Ku Meeting." This was indeed a regrettable point. The fourth working talks between ARATS and SEF were arranged during the Beijing talks in February, and the subjects of the talks were also written into the "joint press bulletin." After major consensus was achieved at the Beijing talks, the principle issues for the working talks were solved. In the general framework of the draft agreements on the three issues, the working talks should have made smooth progress. However, after the two sides held repeated discussions over six days, and although ARATS continued to adjust its opinion by accepting many of SEF's opinions, they still failed to reach agreement on the three issues. This made people think that, just before the fourth working talks, some institutions in Taiwan had overthrown part of the consensus reached by the Tang- Chiao talks and called for "maintaining the bottom line of the ARATS-SEF Taipei talks under the precondition of giving consideration to the dignity of legal jurisdiction." It seemed that one could not just blame technical factors for the failure of the recent talks to make major progress. The understandings reached by ARATS and SEF in their Beijing talks must be treated seriously. Only by maintaining the consensus can the two sides reach agreement on the relevant subjects in their working talks. From the Wang-Ku talks to the Tang-Chiao talks, ARATS and SEF were solemnly authorized to handle relevant affairs, and should conscientiously deal with such affairs. They responsibly signed relevant agreements and press bulletins. The important agreements and consensus formed the principle for the development of mainland-Taiwan relations in the future, and also formed the precondition and foundation for the working talks between the two organizations. The Taiwan side overthrew part of the "Tang-Chiao consensus," and this damaged the foundation and atmosphere for the working talks between the two organizations. This inevitably had a serious impact on the fourth working talks. Some people on the Taiwan side often said that the two sides of the straits should have "sincerity" and should "keep good faith" and "respect each other." Did the haphazard negation of the consensus reached by the responsible officials of the two organizations represent such "sincerity" and "good faith"? Zou Zhekai, deputy chairman and secretary general of ARATS, recently said that in the course of settling various technical issues between the two sides of the straits, it is necessary to follow the principle of "avoiding politics, considering things as they stand, handling easy things before difficult ones, and seeking common ground while reserving differences." Adopting a realistic attitude and avoiding political issues was the consensus reached by responsible officials of the two organizations. Settling problems by consensus is not only a sensible and understandable way of settling the differences between the two organizations, but also represents the principle for developing mainland-Taiwan relations in current circumstances that should be followed and safeguarded. Only thus can the linkage between ARATS and SEF be freed from the obstruction of various political issues and function as a smooth channel of communication, thus guaranteeing the development of relations between the two sides of the strait. There is no wonder that differences exist in the working talks between the two organizations, and this is very normal. They should jointly seek solutions through increasing mutual trust and understanding in the course of discussion. As long as both sides are sincere in making efforts to make progress, they may succeed in reaching agreement next time if they fail this time. Continuous exchanges and discussions will bring the two sides' opinions closer and closer, and they will eventually solve their problems. However, it is the common wish of the people on both sides of the straits that there be a consensus and less differences in the development of relations between the two sides of the strait and that a written agreement will be reached on the three technical issues [shi wu xing yi ti 0057 0523 1840 6231 7344].
