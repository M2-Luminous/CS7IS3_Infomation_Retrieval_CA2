FR940804-1-00032 FR940804-1-00012 A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The habitats and the ranges of the two species considered herein have been substantially reduced by urban and agricultural development and recreational activities and are further threatened with destruction, modification, and curtailment. The Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot currently occur within very restricted ranges and are extremely localized in their present distributions. The habitat requirements for these two butterflies are primarily defined by their larval host plants. The removal or degradation of these plants, as well as that of nectar sources for adults, leads to the elimination of the affected population. In the case of the Laguna Mountains skipper, habitat destruction and degradation from overgrazing and trampling of its larval host plant by domestic cattle is considered to be the primary factor responsible for its decline (Murphy 1990; D. Hogan, in litt. , 1991; J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). The larval host plant (Cleveland's horkelia) is itself a rare species and only found in the Laguna, Cuyamaca, and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California, and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The only known extant skipper population in the Laguna Mountains is found in the El Prado campground area of the Cleveland National Forest (Murphy 1990; D. Hogan, pers. comm., 1993). This area is protected from grazing cattle by a fence. Although the larval host plant is found throughout the campground, it is subject to trampling by people (D. Hogan, pers. comm., 1993). Sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage scrub occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly have been degraded by grazing and (to a small degree) destroyed by urban development. Fifty to seventy-five percent of the known range of the quino checkerspot has been lost since 1900 due to habitat degradation or destruction (Brown 1991). The primary larval food plant, Plantago erecta, can be displaced by exotic plants, which invade once the ground is disturbed by discing, grading, and/or grazing (J. Johnson, in litt. , 1989; G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1990). The food plant then recolonizes in sites where grass does not grow well, like cattle trails and road edges, where quino checkerspot larvae are subject to trampling (D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). The encroachment of urban development in rural Riverside County potentially threatens one of the quino checkerspot populations near Vail Lake. This area is growing rapidly and is projected to be fully developed within the decade (Monroe et al. 1992). The Vail Lake area is included in a Community Plan that provides for subdivision of parcels into 20-acre (9 hectare (ha)) lots (M. Freitas, in litt. , 1993). Additional development in this area is expected to further reduce and degrade habitat of the quino checkerspot through construction of homes and roads, and increases in cattle and horse grazing, fire frequencies, and the distribution and abundance of exotic plants. An existing recreational vehicle park and marina at Vail Lake attracts unauthorized use of all terrain vehicles (ATV's) within natural habitat areas. ATV's increase the fire hazard and destroy habitat through creation of trails. Evidence of ATV use is apparent at one of the quino checkerspot localities near Vail Lake, where a recently created dirt road bisects the center of the habitat (G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1991). Quino checkerspot habitat at this locality has been disced in part; these disturbed areas no longer support this species, while the surrounding undisturbed areas do (G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1991). Bureau of Land Management-administered lands and Forest Service Wilderness Areas are currently contiguous with privately-owned quino checkerspot habitat near Vail Lake. As Riverside County becomes more densely populated, fragmentation and degradation of this contiguous habitat is expected. Any residual individuals remaining near the last known population of the quino checkerspot in San Diego County would be threatened by a proposed urban development project on Otay Mesa. The preferred alternative for the Otay Ranch New Town Plan (the largest planned community in the southwestern United States) would result in the loss of 5,600 ha (14,000 acres) of upland shrub communities, or about 52 percent of their extent within the project area. The effects of this project on the quino checkerspot are not known at this time but may be significant. Habitat loss due to grazing and clay mining are the primary threats to the quino checkerspot butterfly in Mexico. B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Overcollection is a potential threat to both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot because they are rare butterflies. Johnson ( in litt. , 1989) has noted that the number of quino checkerspot colonies has been reduced since lepidopterists, eager to include rare species in their collections and to obtain surplus specimens for exchange or sale to other lepidopterists, have visited the few remaining colonies steadily throughout the flight season. ``Where the populations may already be small, this depredation by collectors may so weaken the colonies as to end their existence. I have witnessed examples of this with other species of Lepidoptera whose loss of habitat has restricted the species to isolated colonies. These have then been wiped out by intensive collection by lepidopterists.'' (J. Johnson, in litt. , 1989). The remaining populations of the quino checkerspot butterfly near Vail Lake are threatened by overcollection. In the spring of 1993, these populations were the subject of scientific collections for voucher specimens and captive-rearing (D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). In addition, at least two collections of about six specimens each have been made by private collectors for non-scientific purposes (unpubl. Service data).
