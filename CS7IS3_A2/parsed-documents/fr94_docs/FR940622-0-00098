FR940622-0-00098 FR940622-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of the Secretary 49 CFR Part 1 [OST Docket No. 1; Amdt. 1-262] Organization and Delegation of Powers and Duties Delegations to General Counsel AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Transportation has delegated to the General Counsel the authority to deny petitions for rulemaking or petitions for exemptions and to notify petitioners of denials. This rule is necessary to reflect the delegation in the Code of Federal Regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule becomes effective June 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven B. Farbman, Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement (202) 366&hyph;9306, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 49 CFR 5.11, any person may petition the Secretary of Transportation to issue, amend, or repeal a rule, or for a permanent or temporary exemption from any rule. Under 49 CFR 5.13, if the Secretary determines that the petition contains adequate justification, he is authorized to initiate rulemaking action or grant the exemption. If the Secretary determines that the petition does not contain adequate justification, he is authorized to deny the petition. The Secretary is also authorized to notify the petitioner of the decision. This rule delegates to the General Counsel the Secretary of Transportation's authority to deny a petition for rulemaking or a petition for exemption and to notify the petitioner of the denial. Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment are unnecessary. For the same reason, good cause exists for not publishing this rule at least 30 days before its effective date, as is ordinarily required by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this rule is effective on the date of its publication. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 1 Authority delegations (Government agencies), Organizations and functions (Government agencies).
