Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the WCDBANR and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] attended the meeting and delivered an opening address. In his opening speech, he said today's meeting is the work committee's first meeting in 1994. He added responsible personnel of the work committee have held coordination meetings whenever it is necessary even though the work committee does not want to hold meetings very often. He continued and said he coordinated development activities for Kachin Special Region-2, which are to be implemented by joining hands with the Kachin Independence Army [KIA] -- an armed organization, with the chairman of the WCDBANR subcommittees. He said it has been nearly five years since the implementation of the development of border areas and national races began in May 1989. He noted that the implementation of development activities in the regions now have to be expanded for jungle-based organizations who are going to return to the legal fold. He continued that border areas and national races development activities are not the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Development of Border Areas and National Races and said all the ministries have to carry out these activities as if they are their main tasks. He said the implementation of border areas and national races development activities is actually the fulfillment of the three cardinal causes. [nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty]. [passage omitted] He then added that preparations must be made now to introduce for substitution crops for opium in the respective regions. When this is accomplished, the substitution crops can be cultivated effectively during opium growing season. That is why preparations are necessary to ensure the needed supply of seeds, saplings, machinery, fertilizer, and other equipment. [passage omitted] Continuing, he said the state government has been carrying out border area development activities effectively and with genuine goodwill. One can see the gradual growth in urban and rural development when compared to the previous situation. The jungle- based armed organizations have realized their activities are not benefiting the country and local native people, and they also believe that the state government is really working for the benefit of national races in border areas. That is why, they are offering to hold peace talks. If the armed insurgencies subside in various border regions, these regions will become calm and the state government will be able to carry out more development activities than what is currently being done. [passage omitted] He then added that we should look at the work being carried out to eradicate narcotic drugs in border areas. The destruction on 27 October of an old opium refinery and equipment by local natives near (Aunglankhet), (Khinpunlon) Village Tract, Kokang region should be hailed and documented. He noted that the state considers the eradication of narcotic drugs a national duty. This is the reason the creation of business enterprises, which will aim to completely eradicate the cultivation of narcotic drugs, was mentioned in the objectives of the Law on the Development of Border Areas and National Races. The law was proclaimed on 13 August 1993. He spoke next about the eradication of narcotic drugs in border areas. He said the state has reached an agreement on short- and long-term plans, a six-year plan in Kokang region and a 10-year plan in Wa region, with local leaders. That is why, regional work committees must keep a close eye on the annual reduction in narcotic drugs and their destruction drugs in their respective regions. [passage omitted] He concluded his opening speech by saying that one can see the state leaders' goodwill for national brethren by looking at the amount spent for the development of national brethren. [passage omitted]. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said in his closing speech that even though SLORC intends to carry out development activities in every state, priority has been given only to the poor states. The SLORC has realized that national development activities can only be carried out effectively and ultimately when there is national solidarity. The SLORC discussed and coordinated the return of jungle-based armed organizations to the legal fold to ensure national unity. Due to this invitation, some jungle-based armed organizations have made contact regarding their return to the legal fold. Some are holding discussions and coordinating at the lower level.
