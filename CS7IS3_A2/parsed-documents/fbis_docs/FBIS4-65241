The Russian side appreciated Germany's efforts to include Russia in the West's security and economic cooperation, Vogel said in Bonn today. Russia's inclusion in NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative is already "well under way," and the extension of the leading G-7 industrial countries to include Russia will continue, initially politically and later economically. The issue of bidding farewell to the [Russian] troops, on which there has been heated public debate in both countries, was one problem that was "speedily resolved in the spirit of mutual understanding." Before a cultural function in Weimar there will now be an official farewell ceremony for the troops in Berlin.
