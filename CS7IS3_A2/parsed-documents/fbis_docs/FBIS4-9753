The speaker asserted that with the establishment of these committees "Congress will start to work at full capacity and must greatly improve its legislative efforts." The formation of the working committees had been paralyzed by the political controversy that arose when their chairmen were to be appointed. This controversy prompted the first political crisis of the new Congress and created great confusion among the public. The following is a list of the committee chairmen and the party to which they belong: Domestic Policy: Enrique Ochoa Antich, Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) Foreign Policy: German Monzon, Convergence Defense: Ibrahim Sanchez, COPEI [Social Christian Party] Economy: Gonzalo Perez Hernandez, National Integrity Movement-Convergence Comptrollership: Paulina Gamus, Democratic Action (AD) Finance: Gustavo Tarre Briceno, COPEI Agriculture: Amilcar Aponte, AD Mass Media: Manuel Isidro Molina, MAS Tourism: Ixora Rojas, AD Environment and Land Use: Cesar Perez Vivas, COPEI Youth, Recreation, and Sports: Vladimir Petit, COPEI Administration and Services: Aristides Hospedales, AD Against the Improper Use of Drugs: Luis Emilio Rondon, AD Energy and Mines: Ali Rodriguez, Cause R. Education: Pablo Gonzalez, AD Culture: Jose Albornoz, Cause R. Science and Technology: Lelis Paez, Cause R. Social Affairs: Victor Moreno, Cause R. Health: Luis Parodi, COPEI Neighborhood Affairs: Alberto Salcedo, Cause R. Regional Development: Emilio Lopez, COPEI Planning: Julio Castillo, MAS Lauria emphasized that this time the committees are more pluralistic as their chairmen and deputy chairmen belong to different political forces. Traditionally, both were from the same party, which in practice meant that the deputy chairman was merely the chairman's alternate.
