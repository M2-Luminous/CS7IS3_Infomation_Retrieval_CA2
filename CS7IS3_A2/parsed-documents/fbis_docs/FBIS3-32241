During their meeting they analyzed the evolution of the peace negotiations between the PLO and Israel and Argentine support for this process of understanding. During a telephone conversation with CLARIN, Foreign Minister Di Tella gave details of his meeting with 'Arafat: [J.C.] What was the purpose of your meeting with the Palestinian leader? [Di Tella] We want to adapt our position to the constant changes in the world, and this process in the Middle East is an example of these changes. Argentina acknowledges the peace efforts of both the PLO and Israel, and now we have met with a man who is currently handling the weapons of peace. 'Arafat took our message of support for the peace process very positively. This is our small contribution to a process that is so important for the whole world. [J.C.] Has 'Arafat been invited to visit Argentina? [Di Tella] Yes; President Menem invited 'Arafat to come to our country as a gesture of support for the peace process, and 'Arafat was pleased to accept the invitation. In the same way, 'Arafat invited Menem to visit Jericho in the future when the Palestinian chief installs himself there. [J.C.] Will Argentina support the Palestinian process of autonomy diplomatically and materially? [Di Tella] One of the things we offered them is the construction of a school, a subject we are discussing with the Israeli and Arab communities in our country, which might make economic contributions. [J.C.] What are the possibilities for the PLO to maintain diplomatic representation in Buenos Aires? [Di Tella] There already is a Palestinian delegation in our country, and in order to make progress on this subject we must observe the functioning of all these peace agreements and hold talks with the Palestinians. It is still premature to speak about this. [J.C.] Why was the meeting with 'Arafat kept secret? [Di Tella] Because of 'Arafat's constant movements and the alternatives in the PLO-Israeli negotiations. The meeting could not be confirmed until the last moment. Those were the reasons why we did not want to release information about these talks. [J.C.] Has there been any Israeli influence to prevent this meeting with 'Arafat from being made public? [Di Tella] Not in the least. The Israelis knew about this meeting and did not object to it at all.
