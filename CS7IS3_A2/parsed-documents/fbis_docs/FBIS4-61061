Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev Hopes for Moscow's Mediation in Resolving Karabakh Problem"] [Text] [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Guliyev, during the official visit to Moscow by your parliamentary delegation an "Agreement on Interparliamentary Cooperation Between the Russian Federation [RF] Federal Assembly and the Azerbaijani National Assembly" was signed. How do you assess the prospects for cooperation between the parliaments of Azerbaijan and the RF? [Guliyev] We attach very great importance to relations with the RF since we think that the RF, as the rightful heir of the former USSR, plays a tremendous role in both the region and the world as a whole. We regard the document we have signed as a very important step toward developing partnership relations. We agreed to regularly exchange information regarding the two countries' current legislative activity and also to help synchronize ratification processes in respect of agreements concluded between the two countries. [Mekhtiyev] It is known that during your delegation's talks with the RF leadership discussion of the Karabakh problem was one of the main topics. Did you succeed in reaching agreement in your approaches to resolving this problem? [Guliyev] Both sides were unanimous that it is pointless continuing the war. As a first step it is necessary to ensure a cease-fire in the region, then start pulling back the troops a certain distance, and lastly completely withdraw Armenian troops from the occupied territories. We think that these phases should be completed within 30-40 days. Once all of the above terms have been met discussion of the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh can begin. [Mekhtiyev] RF Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said 28 April at the final press conference that it is necessary to acknowledge the existence of three warring parties while the conflict is being resolved, namely Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, official Baku is previously known to have repeatedly stated that the conflict is directly between Armenia and Azerbaijan.... [Guliyev] We are not opposed to Armenian representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh taking part in the coming talks, but the Karabakh Armenians cannot speak on behalf of the whole population of Nagorno-Karabakh. The point is that until the conflict began in 1988 almost 25 percent of the population of this former autonomous oblast were Azerbaijanis. As you know, they were all expelled. There can hardly be talk about defining the status of this territory without taking their opinion into consideration even though they are in exile. Azerbaijan is not about to become a federal state. When the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh is discussed it is necessary to proceed on the basis of the CSCE Council of Ministers decision of 1992, which stresses that this territory is an inalienable part of Azerbaijan. [Mekhtiyev] Do you not think that the CIS should defend the sovereign rights of Azerbaijan more vigorously? [Guliyev] At the moment, the Commonwealth is not making full use of its potential for defending this organization's member countries against possible aggression, and during the meeting of the heads of state in Moscow 15 April the abnormality of the situation where two members of the CIS are fighting among themselves was pointed out. The Commonwealth could make vigorous efforts to establish peace in the region. That is why, after signing the Treaty on Collective Security, Azerbaijan proposed an amendment whereby members of the CIS should be protected not only from outside aggression, but also from aggression from neighboring CIS countries and from occupied territories. [Mekhtiyev] During their summit in Moscow the CIS leaders advocated the continuation of Russia's peace efforts to resolve the conflict and urged the world community to back the Russian plan for a peace settlement. However, reports appeared in the press saying that the Azerbaijani leadership refuses to accept the Russian plan for a settlement of the problem... [Guliyev] It is inaccurate to use the word "refuse." The Azerbaijani leadership made several remarks about the peace plan that was proposed for discussion early this year. An updated version of the peace plan for the settlement of the Karabakh problem has now been taken as a base with consideration for our remarks and suggestions. At our insistence the plan under consideration includes a point, which makes provision for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the Azerbaijani cities of Lachin and Shusha. We are indeed insisting that specific timeframes be given for the withdrawal of the Armenian forces of occupation from these and other occupied areas. Another way in which this plan differs from its predecessor is the principle of both sides' troops being pulled back. The previous plan made provision for the symmetrical withdrawal of both warring parties' troops, that is it was not only the Armenian side, occupying 20 percent of our territory, that was to pull back 20 km but also the Azerbaijani side; however, fulfillment of these terms would have jeopardized the safety of the civilian population in the abandoned areas. We expressed doubts as to the advisability of a symmetrical troop withdrawal and our arguments were viewed with understanding by the Russian leadership. The previous draft did not give a precise indication of where the troops would be stationed following the withdrawal, thus enabling the Armenians to come up with their own interpretation of the accords reached. [Mekhtiyev] Mr. Chairman, is the Russian plan not at variance with the CSCE Minsk Group's mediatory mission? Is one not conscious of a kind of rivalry between Russia and the CSCE in the peace efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem? [Guliyev] I would venture to disagree with that assessment. The Minsk Group does not deny the role of Russia and the CIS in resolving the problem. There is plenty of scope here to coordinate the peace efforts made by Russia and the CSCE. I think that the presence of international observers in the conflict zone could play a positive role. They should monitor any breach of the accords by the sides.
