The open session of the Majles was held yesterday with Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri presiding. In this session, the bill of the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget were presented to the Majles. It is interesting that before the bills were presented, the deputies of Tehran, Semnan, and Baft made speeches. Seyyed Reza Akrami, Deputy From Semnan For the Late Debts of the Country, We Must Have a Comprehensive Solution in Order To Pay Them at the Appropriate Time The first pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr. Akrami, the deputy from Semnan, who said: Today, the Second Five-Year Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 1373 budget bills will also have problematic consequences. The deputy of the people of Semnan, referring to the importance of oil and oil revenues in the national economy, said: Oil is the national capital of the country and it must be used for capital investment. In other words, we must sell the oil, train an educated, skilled work force, create work, workshops, electricity and factories, and create suitable jobs. Otherwise, in the long run, there will be problems. He then suggested in this connection that in the Second Five-Year Plan, the oil revenues be only used for national investment. For the late debts of the country, we must have a comprehensive solution in order to at least pay the debts at an appropriate time, and in the future suitable ways other than the oil revenues can be used for borrowing. Our Islamic country has the potential for nonoil exports at a level several times the present one. In this connection, does the Ministry of Agriculture not import the equivalent of $1.5 billion in food stuff. Is it not able to export an equivalent amount of fruit, dried fruits, etc.? With proper planning, can we not become self-sufficient in wheat, rice, fodder, meat, and cheese? Why is the milk that is produced in the districts and villages wasted, and then we read in the press that the Ministry of Construction Jihad, with the help of the Ministry of Commerce, intends to import 20,000 tons of cheese by the end of the year? Why are 1.4 million barrels of petroleum products used in this country? Can we not seriously revise this tremendous consumption? Why should more than 50 percent of our cars carry only one passenger and use 50 rials per liter of gasoline? He suggested that a traffic plan be implemented in all the cities in order to counteract the present trend of the consumption of imported fuel. He added: The speaker of the Majles and the president can request that the ministries have an annual foreign currency income of $10 billion [as published] from the export of minerals, manufactured goods, fruits and dry goods, training of students from other countries, offering medical services, and the sale of software and hardware. Referring to the recycling of goods by advanced industrial countries such as Germany that, for example, obtains 52 percent of its consumer paper through recycling paper, the speaker said: In our country, only a seminar was held by the City Hall and the issue was filed away. The recycling of paper in our country is very small. The Planning and Budget Committee has included a note in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget according to which every province will be able with proper planning through exports, the sale of land, and business taxes, to make a deposit in the national treasury and allocate it to fundamental projects or incomplete projects of its cities. In conclusion, he said: Can only the province of Kerman have the first rank in nonoil products by exporting pistachios, carpets, and handicrafts and for other provinces to be ranked lower or does this potential exist in other provinces of the country as well? It only requires thought, initiative, planning, management, and cooperation. Marziyyeh Vahid-Dastjerdi, Deputy From Tehran Another pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Ms. Vahid-Dastjerdi, the deputy from Tehran, who expressed her condolences on the death of the revered source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and mentioned a present problem of the country as the lack of a unified and correct management system. Emphasizing the sensitivity and difficulty of the present conditions, she said: Because of the lack of such a system, the best instruction, decrees, and plans do not result in the slightest action. She said that the Five-Year Plan and the budget will be successful, provided the preparations and means for the implementation of these programs and also a strong management for its organization are available. The speaker then emphasized the necessity of the existence of a balance of powers in decision making and planning and said: Our economic stability depends on the political and cultural stability of the country. Ms. Dastjerdi added: Our sworn enemies also do not deny the fact that Iran has recently been the reviver of the religion of Islam in the world, and all that we state in the various parts of the world as the increasing property of Islam and even spirituality is the result of the sacred divine revolution of Iran. She continued: The world today is ready to follow and requires a model, a model of economy, politics, culture, etc. If we are not able to offer the best practical models in these areas, other Islamic nations and even non-Islamic nations will win the match. The speaker considered one of the most important issues in Islamic economy as conservation and avoiding waste and added: Unfortunately, despite all the emphasis by the Commander of the Faithful to his officials in regards to conservation, what is prevalent today is waste and what is not seen is conservation. Just a few days ago, we witnessed that the Ministry of Construction Jihad sent an invitation card on relatively large, high-quality paper with gold print and English on the back to 270 Majles deputies for the first authentic Iranian Holstein Cow Festival, inviting all the deputies to this so-called festival. She pointed out: The annual import of 500,000 tons of paper into the country is significant, and the result is that this kind of useless paper distribution and printing of cards, invitations, and small and large magazines takes place. How can we say we obey Imam 'Ali, who at one time examined the treasury of the Muslims with the light of one candle? Go to the offices and government centers in the morning. You will see most of the lights on in the bright daylight. Why is the energy and the treasury of the Muslims wasted without any consideration? The speaker emphasized: The Majles must in its budgeting, aside from all interests, reduce the budget of every ministry in which there is more waste. In conclusion, the deputy from Tehran said: It is clear that when we control the flow of oil but others the price, it cannot be relied on as an important and reliable lever in economic planning, because it will create chaos and an imbalance in all planning. She emphasized proper supervision by the Majles over the executive organizations. In conclusion, with reference to the Ministry of Education, even though it is an educational matter, and especially since 65 percent of its personnel are women, she said: Is it not religiously and logically more proper to have a woman as the minister of education? Even though we do not have a shortage of administrative and creative women, they speak of lack of experience of women at the upper management level. My question, is were the gentlemen born as ministers, or have they come to occupy these position gradually? What is wrong with some of the deputy ministers of education being women? Ahmad Pishbin, Deputy From Baft The third pre-agenda speaker was Ahmad Pishbin, the deputy from Baft, who offered his condolences on the death of the revered source of emulation of the Shi'ites and, speaking of foreign currency situation, said: The daily life of the various strata of people has been disrupted. Who is to be accountable for such chaos? On what basis have the economic planners deregulated the dollar and placed the existing foreign currency of the country at the disposal of capitalists, thereby causing problems and high prices? Would it not have been better, instead of using Western-style planning, for them to plan according to capabilities? Is it not better to put our efforts into a variety of exports and production? We must avoid unnecessary imports and make use of the resources of the country. Among the most important resources of this country are faith and belief of the people in the revolution, Islam, and religious guardianship. Through strong planning, the future must be drawn through reliance on God and without attention to the ideas and disruptions of global oppressors. Referring to making agriculture active and creating jobs in the existing areas of every city, he said: Today, we are confused in the area of industrialization and the use of appropriate tactics in the progress of industry in the country. Every powerful person and group has engaged in importing expensive machinery from various countries and displays the mirage of machine-manufacturing factories to the people. We have created a large consumer market for foreign countries. Hence, every day, the number of the unemployed increases and the price of the dollar increases. With the implementation of the modification plan, the weakest strata of the society will be sitting at home. Referring to the discovery of embezzling gangs on various levels, he said: The people are waiting to see how the judicial organizations deal with these people. Would it not be better, before false and apparently legal ways are found for these individuals to be released by their partners, for the judicial organizations to put these individuals on trial openly and punish them, in order to both soothe the pain of the revolutionary people and serve as a warning to these who would continue the path of these individuals? Referring to the problems of his constituency, Pishbin spoke about the problem of the shortage of chemical fertilizers and seeds, the high price of fodder, and the lack of government support for animal husbandry products. He made reminders regarding the failure to pay for damages to the houses of the flood victims, the failure to build flood dams, the failure to distribute fuel in the region, and the severe shortage of doctors. In conclusion, he asked for more attention by the officials to his constituency. Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, Deputy From Tehran The fourth and last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, the deputy from Tehran, who spoke about the question of Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, to the minister of interior concerning the "reason for not granting a march permit to the students of the Office of Strengthening Unity." The details were published in a RESALAT editorial this Monday. Speech of the Speaker of the Majles After the speech of the president, the speaker of the Majles thanked him and said: Mr. Hashemi kindly presented to the Majles the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] national budget for two continuous hours, with his usual patience and perseverance. I also thank the honorable Cabinet, who were inspired by the president and with perseverance and 24-hour efforts tolerated the burden more than in any other year. Every year, we want to prepare the next year's budget, and the gentlemen worked hard on the chapters this year. In addition, the Second Five-Year Plan is added to it. First, it appeared that examination of the Second Plan would negate the need for us and the honorable government to have a 1373 budget. But, as the honorable president pointed out, the projection was that due to the fluctuation of the price of oil and other issues the Second Plan might not be presented to the Majles on time, and naturally in a short period of time it would be impossible to attend to the people's plan. Fortunately, with contacts and coordination with the president and his awareness, he reached the conclusion, and we did too, that we need to have the 1373 budget. This doubled the work of the honorable Cabinet, in addition to adding to the examination of the Second Plan. Hence, the generosity and kindness of Mr. Hashemi, the government, and the honorable ministers and experts is worthy of praise and gives us the opportunity to examine the budget bill and the Second Plan on the basis of the amended bylaws of the Majles (two rounds of discussion). This task will give the opportunity for more expert examination in both rounds of discussion in the Majles. We hope, as you pointed out and with the same patience and care that your honor and the government have used, God willing, our colleagues, with the same care and coordination and with the active presence of the honorable government experts, that we will be able to examine the budget law in the Majles within the period allowed by the new law and present it to the honorable government for implementation. Then we will complete the Second Plan more carefully in a period of one year. In conclusion, the speaker of the Majles added: It seems that 1373 is a completion for the First Five-Year Plan, or the fifth year of the First Five-Year Plan, which in practice makes no difference to us. Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. `Final Section' The meetings of the speaker of the Majles with the nobel people of the cities of Shadegan, Behbahan, and Ramhormoz were among the trips of Mr. Nateq-Nuri to this province. In each of these cities, the welcome was most enthusiastic. Despite the deprivation that exists in Shadegan, this city has good and pleasant people. In this region, prior to the imposed war, the so-called Khalqi Arabs, whose purpose was to inflict disunity and conspiracy against beloved Khuzestan, faced the self-sacrifice of these same Arab people and were eliminated. With the empty support of these mercenaries, the Ba'thists wanted to separate Khuzestan from Iran, but they failed. In the city of Behbahan, the friendly people closed down the city altogether and came to welcome the head of the Legislative Branch, an action that was nearly unprecedented in the history of that city. Among the interesting points in the city is the implementation of the reservoir dam of Marun, which is located 19 km from Behbahan and was visited by the delegation. Ramhormoz, also like other cities, made a great deal of effort to host the friend and supporter of the Imam and the leader. In this city, a large Khuzestan cement factory has been built, which can expedite its economy. In this city, a letter by a woman from Ramhormoz to the delegation attracted everyone's attention. The letter stated: "Despite the fact that all my possessions consisted of two pieces of gold, I gave one piece in response to the call of the leader for the people of Lebanon and I gave this one to the treasury, even though I am embarrassed for it is very insignificant." This woman could have stated her problems in this letter, but with generosity showed that such actions are higher than anything else. On Wednesday morning, 17/09/1372 [8 December 1993], we left Ramhormoz to visit the Petrochemical Complex of Bandar-e Imam Khomeyni. This complex, which is one of the largest petrochemical complexes in the world and if the agents of global oppression would not cause disruption, our country would be rescued from dependence now, finally after Japan refused to complete this complex, our committed domestic experts along with the participation of some countries took steps to develop and operate it and were able to bring up to 70 percent of the capacity of this complex to operation. Now, various kinds of raw material for plastic industries, water pipes, plastic equipment for cars, and PVC production in this complex have reached operation. On Thursday, that is, the last day of the trip, visits to Khorramshahr and Abadan became possible for the delegation. The heroism and resistance of the brave people of Khorramshahr and Abadan will never be forgotten. All the visits to the cities of the province are on one side, and the visit to these cities on the other. The people of the province must allow us to praise these two cities more, because Khorramshahr was the center of the war action. The trend of reconstruction, especially in Khorramshahr, despite the fact that much work has been done, progresses slowly. One of the reasons for the problems that Khorramshahr faces is lack of wealthy immigrants to this city. The governor of Khorramshahr told me: In this city, we have 10,000 people who receive regular pay from the Emergency Committee. They do not have the financial ability to complete the reconstruction of the residential housing and commercial buildings. Unfortunately, the immigrants who enjoy relative financial resources have not entered the city yet. Of course, their coming may be due to lack of treatment and health resources, water, sewage, recreational, cultural, and other resources, which is true to some extent. Haj Aqa Nateq-Nuri said: To eliminate the problem of water and sewage of the cities of Khorramshahr and Abadan, 80 billion tomans is needed, and if this problem is not eliminated, it will be as if no reconstruction has taken place. In connection with the recreational and cultural resources, it is necessary to say that the speaker of the Majles inaugurated the construction of the "Khorramshahr Martyrs" Athletic Complex with 1.2 billion tomans in funds. Engineer Kamravi, deputy director of the Reconstruction Crusade of the province, said: This athletic center will be even larger than the large Azadi Stadium of Tehran. With the news that the speaker of the Majles announced on behalf of the Cabinet, stating that the "government has increased the reconstruction funds in the 1373 budget bill by 15 percent compared to last year," and also that the process of reconstruction will continue to the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, a wave of happiness overcame the people of Khorramshahr. At 1900 on Thursday, 18/09/1372 [9 December 1993], in the residence of the delegation, the news of the death of the revered source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, overtook everyone with mourning, and no one felt like speaking. In conclusion, it is necessary to express appreciation to the honorable speaker of the Majles, who was able to visit the cities and centers without any rest on the five-day trip, from 0700 to 2030, to be with the people and officials. Also, during this visit, with his behavior towards the reporters, photographers, and cameramen, he showed that he especially values journalism and journalists. Also, we thank his office, the Security Affairs and News Affairs, who made their best efforts, and it is hoped that this visit will bring prosperity to the rich province of Khuzestan.
