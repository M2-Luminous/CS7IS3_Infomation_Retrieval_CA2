He was responsible for organizing the first loyalty oath to the Ukrainian people. He is the codesigner of the first Ukrainian battle flag, and the military unit in which he serves is the only unit in Ukraine that uses this national (rather than the old Soviet) flag. He is the author of the songs: "Return Me To My Homeland" and "The March of the National Guard of Ukraine." Oleksandr Lobashchuk is a registered candidate in the election for the office of people's deputy in the Hvardiyskyy Electoral District No. 260. His candidacy is supported by the Union of Officers of Ukraine. [Besyada] Lieutenant Colonel Lobaschuk, in your opinion, how is the building up of the Ukrainian Army progressing? [Lobashchuk] The building up of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is the most important and most difficult problem that our state faces. Ukraine inherited her present military force from the former Soviet Union, and, unfortunately, even today, its sympathies are in large part pro-Russian, especially in the highest command ranks. This is demonstrated in various ways. It is revealed most strikingly in the military's attitude towards the Ukrainian language, in the stubborn disregard of this language, as, for example, by the generals. Even in Lviv, the military procurator's office and military courts conduct all their proceedings in Russian. As a result, the principal task in building up an army that would be fully in line with the people's interests requires providing it with genuinely national cadres. [Besyada] I fully agree with you. After all, is it imaginable for a true Ukrainian to declare that the rapid introduction of the Ukrainian language in the army may provoke opposition among the military, as Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has stated? And can we trust a man who has sworn loyalty to the Ukrainian people, yet refuses to speak the language of this people? [Lobashchuk] I believe that Mr. Radetskyy's statement reflects his maneuvers aimed at simultaneously accomodating Russia and benefiting Ukraine. This cannot be. The claim that it is not possible to introduce the Ukrainian language in the army quickly on the grounds that this supposedly requires special programs and funds is completely unfounded. In any army (that is the nature of an army) everything is determined by orders. I am convinced that if a clear-cut order is issued, our army will be able to switch completely to Ukrainian in the span of half a year. [Besyada] It seems that the situation in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, just as in Ukraine as a whole, is not identical throughout the country. We would therefore like to hear your opinion regarding our Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military District, in particular. [Lobashchuk] The population of Western Ukraine takes a more responsible approach to the building up of a national Armed Forces than do those living in the east or in the south. Here, the idea of statehood is clearly defined in people's minds, and this has a positive effect on the military. Consequently, the Carpathian [Prykarpatskyy] Military District is in an advantageous political and moral situation. [Besyada] The Union of Officers of Ukraine played an important positive role at the initial stages of the formation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What are this organization's objectives today? [Lobashchuk] Yes. The Union did a great deal when the building of the Ukrainian military began. It is also doing a lot at present. But with the coming of Mr. Radetskyy to office, incomprehensible pressure began to be put on the Officers' Union. At its fifth congress, held in December of last year, the Union was forced to raise the issue point-blank: The UOU has to send its members to parliament so that they can defend the interests of what is indeed a national army within that institution. [Besyada] This brings us to a very important question -- elections to the Supreme Council. What is your election platform based on? [Lobashchuk] The substance of this platform is reflected in its very name, for which I chose the famous lines from our Bard [Taras Shevchenko]: "Our own law in our own house, our own strength and will." I support a parliamentary-presidential republic, a strong executive branch, and the elimination of the local councils of people's deputies, which should be replaced by a more traditional Ukrainian administrative organ, headed by a supervisor [uporyadnyk] and a popular assembly [viche] elected by the people at all levels -- ranging from the village to the oblast. I am in favor of uniting all national-democratic parties and movements as well as trade unions into a single political force, which would implement the idea of a strong Ukrainian state. The official language for everyone without exception in government and military service is to be Ukrainian. I support recognizing the Ukrainian Insurgent Army [UPA] as the fighting arm in the struggle for Ukraine's independence. I reject Leonid Kravchuk's statement: "We have what we have." I believe that we should have what we want, what the Ukrainian people want. This requires a firm and resolute state policy that would guarantee the people adequate food, housing, work, and relaxation. [Besyada] Naturally, your program devotes an important role to the building up of the Armed Forces. [Lobashchuk] This is an especially painful subject for me. Because much that is being done in this sphere is not what the people want. Even the date of Ukrainian Armed Forces Day was set against the will of the people--not on the feast of St. Mary the Protectress [Pokrova], but in traditional Soviet style, on the date of the signing of the decree. Ukrainian officers and ensigns [praporshchyky] and their families need to be shown greater solicitude by the state. I believe that in the very near future we must have a professional army. This can only be done by applying the territorial principle of military conscription. In other words, if a youth lives in Galicia, he serves in Galicia. Incidentally, this is the principle in effect in Germany. In this, too, our Mr. Kravchuk has applied the old Soviet exterritorial principle, which had only one goal -- to intermingle various nations. The current justification given for this system is couched in seemingly noble terms: Young men from Western Ukraine will serve in Eastern Ukraine and thus spread the use of Ukrainian in this region. This is pure bluff. Orders are the only instrument by which the situation in the army is determined. I believe that our soldiers should serve only one year and two months and be drafted only once a year in September and be released from service in November. This would mean significant savings for the state, and there are great social and economic advantages to this. This would completely eliminate the shameful phenomenon of "didivshchyna" [hazing of conscripts]. You should have seen the faces of the soldiers when the Supreme Council extended military service from one and a half years to two years on 19 November of last year. The soldiers and their parents were astonished by this swing in our state policy. More attention needs to be devoted to the training of youth for state service. Programs in schools and higher educational institutions should include boot-camp type military training [tabirnu viyskovu pidhotovku]. Young men should be given the opportunity to become physically fit and become familiar with military equipment and a military regimen. Then the army will be receiving nearly fully trained professionals. A great deal of pressure is being put on the National Guard of Ukraine today, and there is an effort under way to eliminate it. I, on the other hand, am for strengthening the National Guard, because it is currently the best psychologically prepared institution to defend Ukraine. Events in the Trans-Dniester region and on the border with Belarus attest this.
