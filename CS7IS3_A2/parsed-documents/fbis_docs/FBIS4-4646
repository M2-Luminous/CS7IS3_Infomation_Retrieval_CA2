FBIS4-4646 "dreas064_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 South Korea Minister Meets Media on Team Spirit Decision Minister Meets Media on Team Spirit Decision SK0204004394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0035 GMT 2 Apr 94 SK0204004394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United States will wait before deciding whether to hold this year's joint military exercise in view of recent developments in the North Korean nuclear row, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said. Speaking at a press conference for Korean correspondents on Friday, Han said Washington and Seoul had left open the possibility of holding Team Spirit when North Korea violated its agreement with the United States on Feb. 25. South Korea and the United States, however, have yet to discuss such matters as when to hold the exercise, Han said. Han then noted that the U.N. Security Council has just adopted a presidential statement urging North Korea to permit International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. He said he believed the U.N. action opened "another possibility" to resolve the nuclear dispute through dialogue. But right now, more weight is being given to the Security Council step than dialogue, Han said. Given these circumstances, Seoul has no intention of taking the diplomatic initiative vis-a-vis Pyongyang in order to achieve a breakthrough in the nuclear impasse. Neither has the South Korean position changed with regard to its previous demand that Pyongyang must accept IAEA inspection of all seven reported nuclear facilities, Han said. Asked whether Seoul is prepared to give in and let Pyongyang and Washington hold a third round of talks before an inter-Korean envoy exchange, Han said "no." There have been no discussions between Seoul and Washington on this point, he added. Han reiterated that progress would come only when North Korea accepted complete IAEA inspections. "There could be flexibility as to whether North Korea accepts inspections or the IAEA makes a proposal on negotiations (for inspections)," he said. Commenting on U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remark that in order to resolve the nuclear dispute risk of another Korean war can be taken, Han said Perry clarified that he had been partly misinterpreted. Prior to Friday's press conference, Han appeared on NBC-TV's "Today" program and said another chance is at hand to resolve the nuclear dispute. Han said he had reaffirmed in his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that they would keep the door open for North Korea to solve the issue through dialogue.
