Manufacturers must still be persuaded to equip their cars with this miracle device. Quite sensitive, it shrinks in the slightest cold air draft. Then, it expands languorously under the effect of heat. Developed by the Mecaplast company, this car-engine thermal air-intake regulator is the first to use the surprising properties of shape-memory alloys. "The system spares motorists who drive in very cold areas the unpleasantness resulting from the icing of intake valves," Didier Theron, the marketing manager of this Monaco company specialized in plastics engineering, explained. When the air temperature falls below a given value, the spring becomes less stiff, which causes a trap door to close, thus protecting carburetion components against the rigor of cold weather. Conversely, when the weather becomes milder, the spring recovers its initial characteristics and opens again the trap door. The trick? The reversible behavior of these shape-memory alloys which reflects the passage from one crystalline structure to another. This transformation takes place in a number of alloys, such as copper-aluminum-nickel or titanium-nickel, following suitable heat treatments. Mecaplast uses products made by the Memometal company. Located in the Alberville area in Savoie, this company has all the equipment required to make the precious material (vacuum furnaces, annealing furnaces, drawing machines, etc.). It can prepare the formula that will exactly meet its clients' requirements. Fast and Reliable Regulators What are the advantages of shape-memory alloys to regulate the carburetion air intake? First, an extremely short response time: about two seconds compared with about 50 for traditional systems using wax caps. "These performance characteristics make it possible to achieve a much more precise regulation, which is therefore more suitable for the current electronic injection systems," according to Didier Theron. Another advantage is its reliability, as there is a minimum of moving parts. This simplification also reduced manufacturing costs by about 30 percent. In spite of all these benefits, the regulator is not yet on the market. In fact, we shall have to wait patiently for a few years, until car manufacturers venture to add this "quasi magic" component under the hoods of their cars. This wait-and-see attitude, however, does not shake the Mecaplast engineers's faith in the future of shape-memory alloys in the automobile world. They just filed a new patent in order to use these alloys to regulate the ventilation of engine hoods according to the outside temperature.
