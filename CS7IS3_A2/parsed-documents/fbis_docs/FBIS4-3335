Zou Jiahua said: Some results have been obtained in the task of turning losses into profits nationwide last year. However, the huge losses of state-owned enterprises is currently still a prominent economic problem. The situation has not only brought losses to enterprises but also created great financial difficulties for the state and localities. In addition, it has direct and adverse effects on a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, as well as affected the smooth process of enterprise reform. Enterprise losses will lead to lower living standards and increased difficulties for workers as well as directly affect social stability. We must understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of the task of addressing enterprise losses from a strategic high plain. Thus, Zou Jiahua asked departments at all levels to effectively tackle the following tasks: 1) Strengthen leadership, formulate plans, and establish the responsibility system. Localities and departments should, in accordance with actual conditions, outline goals and programs for turning losses into profits as well as implement the programs with plans. It is necessary to determine persons responsible for the task as well as mobilize and rely on the masses for resolving the loss problem. Leading cadres at all levels must become personally involved in resolving prominent problems of their localities. 2) Earnestly analyze causes of enterprise losses and offer systematic guidance aimed at addressing the causes. 3) Stress the tasks of turning losses into profits in some key industries and enterprises. We must undertake the tasks in coal, oil, textile, and light industries, particularly in localities and state-owned enterprises whose losses are over 40 percent or 1 billion yuan. 4) Departments at all levels must assist enterprises to resolve their difficulties and enterprises must strive to turn around their losses. While actively promoting reform, enterprises at all levels should, in accordance with the demand of domestic and foreign markets, actively readjust product mix, strive to manufacture marketable products, continue to develop new products, realistically and strictly strengthen operations control, explore internal potential, and demand efficiency from management. In addition, enterprises must implement technological modifications, utilize new technologies, and seek to upgrade efficiency with technological applications. Enterprises should also arouse the people's enthusiasm in increasing production and conserving spending. Banks should extend circulating fund loans to enterprises that are capable of turning losses into profits. Finance departments should release funds due for loss subsidies as soon as possible. At the conference, Wang Zhongyu, minister of state economics and trade commission, outlined specific plans for this year's tasks of turning losses into profits. He said: Enterprises at all levels must effectively identify their principal products. They should modify, limit, or eliminate the production of low-grade products of small market sales, while increasing the production of marketable products to conquer the market. Enterprises at all levels must strive to improve internal efficiency, formulate operations policies and strategies, reduce stockpiles, quicken fund turnover, and upgrade efficiency in fund application. We must do a good job in screening and evaluating the assets of deficit-ridden enterprises to properly account for their assets. When there is no hope to rescue an enterprise whose funds cannot meet its debts, experiments in bankruptcy should be carried out in accordance with the "Bankruptcy Law." Wang Zhongyu pointed out: It is necessary to carry out the task of turning losses into profits by closely centering on the guidelines for invigorating large and medium state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to target localities, industries, and enterprises, identify situations, and offer systematic guidance to score results in our tasks.
