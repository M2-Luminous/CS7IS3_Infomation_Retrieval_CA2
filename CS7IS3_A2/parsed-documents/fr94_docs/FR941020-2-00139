FR941020-2-00139 FR941020-2-00081 15. Applicants state that the Companies also assume an expense risk under the Contracts. According to Applicants, this is the risk that the charges for administrative services under the Contracts will be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to the Contracts funded by the Accounts are consistent with the standards enumerated in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants state that without the requested relief, they would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each Other Account funding Contracts. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Additionally, Applicants note that the requested relief is consistent with the authority of the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, to issue exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons or transactions. Finally, Applicants note that, in connection with future contracts and future separate accounts, the Commission previously has granted exemptive relief, similar to that requested by Applicants, from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act. 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself. 3. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable compensation for the risks assumed. 4. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.15% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by the Companies is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon the Companies' analysis of publicly available information regarding similar variable annuity contracts, taking into consideration such factors as: the rating of the company; the size of the company; and, the type of retirement program for which the annuity is intended. Applicants represent that each of the Companies will maintain at its principal office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the variable annuity products analyzed and the methodology and results of the Companies' comparative review. 5. Applicants acknowledge that the Sales Charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. To the extent distribution costs are not covered by the Sales Charge, each of the Companies will recover its distribution costs from the assets of its respective general account. These assets may include gains from either operations with respect to the Contracts or from charges imposed under the Contracts. Applicants represent that the Companies have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Accounts and the owners of the Contracts. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by each Company at its principal office and will be made available to the Commission. 6. The Companies also represent that the Accounts will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by either the company's board of directors or the board of trustees, as applicable, a majority of whom are not interested persons of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. Conclusion Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
