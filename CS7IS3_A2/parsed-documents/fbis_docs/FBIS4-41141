ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says in its comment on the event that it took place, symbolically, on June 22, the anniversary of the beginning of the Great Patriotic War which resulted in the split of the world into two opposing camps. By becoming the West's partner in European and global security, Russia cleared yet another barrier on its way to the civilised world community". "Moscow has secured a special relationship with the West," according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In its analysis of the documents signed by the Russian minister of foreign affairs, the newspaper says: "It appears that the key phrase of the (Russia-NATO) protocol is "Russia and NATO agree to prepare an extensive individual programme of partnership which is in line with Russia's size, significance and potential". This means that Moscow has finally got what it wanted and NATO has recognised Russia's "special status". TRUD stresses that "the move enables this country to take a more active part in European affairs, including defence. By joining the Partnership for Peace programme, Russia avoided the danger of finding itself in a sort of isolation from the further development of military and political cooperation on the European continent". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes: "The most important thing is that the realisation of the Partnership for Peace programme will bridge for Russia and NATO the gap which separated Europe a few years ago. Another bridge will be provided by the agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union, which President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation is due to sign on the Greek island of Corfu, where a summit of the European Union member countries will take place on June 24. When the agreement takes effect, it will open up a new, much more extensive potential for cooperation between Russia and the European Union in the economic and political fields.
