Froitzheim: "Revolution of the Dwarves"] [Text] Seen with the naked eye, the crumbs look like fly specks. But Wolfgang Ehrfeld is holding real treasures in his hands: Ultrasmall microturbines, which do not reveal their true shape until placed under a high-resolution microscope. Such microsystems, assures the managing director of the Institute for Microtechnology Mainz (IMM), are once again radically changing the industrial world: "Even today we still have no concept of most applications." What until recently still smacked of science fiction--tiny robots which independently repair machines, carry off calcification in blood vessels or self-navigating vehicles equipped with microsensors--are slowly but surely becoming reality in the laboratories from Mainz to Madison, Wisconsin, from Tuebingen to Tokyo. Microcomponents are already being used in fiberoptics networks and medical equipment, as well as in everyday articles such as ink jet printers and air bags. German companies and researchers are involved at the forefront of this promising future technology and are even leading in some subareas. Professor Anton Heuberger at the Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin and Daimler researcher Walter Kroy in Munich are two of the most famous pioneers in silicon microtechnology. The newer and more flexible Liga [lithography, electroforming, casting] process, with which tiny parts can also be made from metal, ceramics or synthetics, was developed by IMM head Wolfgang Ehrfeld in the 1980s at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK). And Dortmund Microparts GmbH--a joint venture of the Steag, Krupp/Hoesch, Huels, Rheinmetall and VEW groups--is considered worldwide to be the only company which has mastered large-series manufacture of micromechanical systems. The team around managing director Reiner Wechsung can produce 120,000 microscopic little gearwheels in one operation. "In basic research and first products we are probably ahead of the United States and Japan." Rainer Guenzler of the Institute for Micro-and Information Technology (Imit) of the Hahn-Schickard Society in Villingen confirms the European lead but with the reservation: "In patents the Japanese are unequivocally ahead." Guenzler should know: His institute, supported by the land of Baden-Wuerttemberg, helps medium-sized mechanical engineering manufacturers introduce microtechnology and therefore painstakingly keeps track of pertinent activities at home and abroad. But Imit cannot supply a reliable analysis of the future world market in microtechnology. Even professional market watchers are stumbling about in the fog. The Market Intelligence Research Corp. (Mirc) in Mountain View in Silicon Valley predicted last fall that worldwide turnover in microsystems and microstructures would surpass the three-billion-dollar mark as early as 1995; last spring Mirc corrected the sum to 2.9 billion--and the year to 1998. Battelle Memorial Institute also reports contradictory data: While its Frankfurt branch, now closed, at the end of last year predicted a market volume of 20 billion German marks [DM] for the year 2000, Battelle Europe now anticipates only sales of eight billion dollars in this market by the turn of the century. On the other hand, should the daring assumptions be correct on which the Federal Ministry [for Research and Technology, BMFT] supports the draft of its second subsidy program for microsystem technology (period: 1994-1999), the anticipated world market could be much greater: Microcomponents are to represent a full four percent of the sales price for cars in the construction year of 2000. Even in the worst economy that would be more than DM 20 billion. In Europe alone microsystems worth DM 3.6 billion would then be built into telecommunications facilities. In this context the BMFT does not even mention the application field of medical and pharmacological technology, regarded as particularly promising. The prophets only agree on one point: that an additional technological race between Europe, Japan and the United States is coming--its outcome still open. All three sides are ready to invest. In the United States the research authority ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) has taken up the subject. ARPA manager Kaigham J. Gabriel, himself a former microengineer, is allowed to spend 24 million dollars in seed capital over three years. In Japan, micromachine development is focused on the Micromachine Center (MCC) in Tokyo, in which such illustrious companies as Fanuc, Hitachi, Kawasaki, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Seiko or Toshiba are participating. In 1991 the Ministry for Industry and Trade, MITI, granted 25 billion yen (DM 387 million) to a 10-year program aimed at the concrete task of joint construction of a millimeter-large, automatic blood vessel scrubber. Such a joint leitmotif is missing in the German program for microsystems technology, whose first part runs out at the end of the year. Over the past three years the bureaucrats in Bonn dissipated their energies on no fewer than 31 (Japan: five) joint projects with 224 partial projects, whose DM 148 million budget was split equally between industrial companies and research establishments. Even the whole dozen of the Fraunhofer institutes involved conduct largely uncoordinated research. For example, only four belong to the pan-European microtechnology elite group Nexus, which is run by Heuberger's Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (Isit) in Berlin. While the BMFT is now preparing to kick off the second round of subsidies with the prospective sum of DM 400 million, Liga inventor Wolfgang Ehrfeld prefers to fight his own fight. As founder of the IMM subsidized by the Rhineland-Palatinate, the ex-KfK employee wants to show how efficient German research can be. "I wish for more competition in research and development," Ehrfeld taunts the solicitous ministerial technocrats, "because that is the only way to mobilize the reserves which lead to innovation." The ambitious professor, helped by the economics minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Rainer Bruederle, has thus within two years built a fully equipped think tank from the ground up--mainly filled with second-hand, like-new equipment. Since then the IMM has grown to 100 employees, already finances 25 percent of itself through industrial contracts and, in addition to MicroParts, is regarded as the most important address in Liga technology. The Mainz team is not satisfied with applications in the branches of telecommunications, medicine, pharmacology and automobiles, but in addition devotes itself to improving production technology and the associated equipment development. Together with the Lothar Spaeth company Jenoptik in Jena, the IMM developed a precision scanner for deep lithographic production of tiny molds needed for mass production of Liga microparts. Since there is no comparable equipment on the world market, inquiries and orders have already come in from Europe, the United States and the Far East. Old and established entrepreneurs often shy away from that much high-tech, even if the innovations would soon have immediate impact on their business. In mechanical engineering, the BMFT estimates, 60 percent of the companies will be forced to use microsystems components. But only five percent of the companies would develop such products themselves. So the employees at Imit in Villingen, which as a supplier of R&D is to pave the way to the future for the traditional Black Forest precision mechanics companies, will also have to do a great deal of persuading. Sighs Rainer Guenzler: "It is not easy to convince the head of a small company that he should invest in new things precisely during the recession." Flexible Alternatives Various methods are available in order to produce microscopically small components. The conventional methods, for instance etching of fine structures, are derived from silicon processing. The advantage: benefiting from years of experience in semiconductor manufacture. But that does not compensate for the serious disadvantage, namely fixation on the material silicon. The Liga technique--Liga stands for the three principal process steps of lithography, galvanizing, casting--developed by Wolfgang Ehrfeld at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center (KfK) in the 1980s is now revealing itself as a highly promising and flexible alternative. Ehrfeld: "We can produce components from gold, copper, synthetics or ceramics." The principle is simple. Through a mask a radiation-sensitive synthetic is irradiated with X-rays. A solvent etches out the affected surfaces, and the hollows are filled in a galvanic process with nickel. After removing the residual synthetic, the metal structure serves as a mold for the production of the actual parts. In this manner Ehrfeld produces new kinds of fiberglass plugs from the synthetic PMMA, a mass product which costs only pfennigs although it has a dimensional tolerance of less than one-thousands of a millimeter. These are not the only such applications to make the Liga process famous beyond the science. While the method has so far been kept under lock and key up by the KfK, Ehrfeld with his institute is deliberately taking a different tack: "If we want to have any chance at all versus the established silicon methods, we must open up the Liga process to all who are interested." That is precisely what the busy research entrepreneur is doing. He organized an international network of Liga users, which he is busily continuing to expand. By now, more than 30 groups are likely to be working with this method worldwide. To be sure, this leads to the German share of the Liga cake becoming smaller. That is the intention for Ehrfeld: "That is the only way the method can become established and plant builders and other suppliers can become interested in it." The market resulting form it, according to Ehrfeld, "more than compensates for the lost monopoly."
