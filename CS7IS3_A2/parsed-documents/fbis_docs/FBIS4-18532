This is an totally false assessment and misrepresents the realities in Turkey. Firstly the Welfare Party, which could once have been termed as Muslim fundamentalist, has been transformed into a pro-Islamic party under the influence of young Islamic progressives like Melih Gokcek, who was elected mayor of Ankara, and Tayyip Erdogan, who won in Istanbul. So the progressive wing seems to be making advances in the party and they are distancing themselves from the fundamentalists... Secondly the elections have shown that the nationwide popularity of the Welfare is only 18.75 percent, which means 81.25 percent of Turks oppose it. Thus it is not a popular movement that can dominate our society. Thirdly the new mayors of Istanbul and Ankara know well that they do not represent the majority of the people in their respective cities. (Both in Ankara and Istanbul the Welfare won the mayoral seats by winning about 25 to 27 percent of the votes). In Ankara 73 percent voted against the Welfare, and in Istanbul 75 percent rejected the pro-Islamic party. But because of the split in the votes the Welfare managed to win...Now the Welfare mayors have to realize they cannot run their cities in an arbitrary manner. Or else they will face both the citizens and the law. According to Turkish law, mayors who violate the law can be sacked by the Interior Minister... Fourthly the mayors can only run their cities and provide services to the people. They cannot act like a police force or force people to do anything that is not included in the law. They cannot order women to cover up or interfere in the way we live. The RP is not, and will never be, a majority party in Parliament. We feel most of the present concern is misplaced. People are acting as if the RP was the winner of a parliamentary election and will be running the country in the years to come. That is not true. However, if people continue to display anger and frustration with the election victories of the Welfare, and try to resort to illegal means, we feel this will only serve to further polarize the public. We also feel great concern over the emotional displays of Welfare supporters in Istanbul and Ankara after they heard about the victories of their candidates. They have to remember they do not represent the majority in either Istanbul or Ankara and their actions could well antagonize the general public. Let us first give the Welfare the benefit of the doubt. If they step out of line we have the laws and the government to put them firmly in their place.
