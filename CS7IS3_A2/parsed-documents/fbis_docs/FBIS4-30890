Apart from holding talks with his Slovak counterpart, Michal Kovac, he will also meet Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, representatives from nongovernment organizations, and a group of intellectuals. He will visit the Society for Foreign Policy and, in the evening, he will attend a theater performance of Cyrano de Bergerac. Prior to his visit, Vaclav Havel granted an interview to our daily. [Svora] Mr. President, the Czech Republic is of late becoming ever more distinct from the other postcommunist countries. What do you think of this? Not so long ago, you said that the term postcommunist country should no longer be used.... [Havel] First of all, I would like to emphasize that, in the statement you quoted, I was not insisting that the Czech Republic be described differently from the other countries convulsed by communism. This term should not be applied to any of these countries. Of course, it depends on what we mean by the term postcommunist country. I had in mind the period in which communism had been overthrown, but in which not all of the state's democratic and political structures had yet been established. I meant that the aforementioned term should be applied to this transitional period. If we perceive this word in this way, then the time has come for us to stop using it. Free elections have been held in all of these countries, political parties have been formed, and democratic mechanisms have begun to function normally. If, however, by the term postcommunist country we mean countries in which there has been communism at some time, then we may be described as postcommunist countries for the next 100 years. [Svora] All the same, the Czech Republic has -- in a certain way -- become singled out from the transforming countries by its economic results in particular.... [Havel] It is perhaps true that the macroeconomic indicators are better in the Czech Republic than in other states. There are various reasons for this. First and foremost, the Czech lands have always been industrially more developed. This, however, is not the only reason. It has also asserted rapid economic transformation. The fact that the Czech Republic is better off from an economic point of view should not have any political consequences. I think that the principle of solidarity should apply in the Central European region. [Svora] Like Presidents Kovac and Walesa, you have indicated more than once that you do not want to be merely an inactive observer of political development. However, your activities often meet with a lack of understanding on the part of the other elements of power. How do you perceive the role of a president in our geopolitical region? [Havel] It ensues incontrovertibly from the constitutional division of power in the state that each [element] enjoys a differently enshrined form of jurisdiction and a different type of legitimacy. This has its advantages. For example, when there is a change in the government, the president comes to the forefront and represents the continuity of power and so on. There is a certain tension between prime ministers and presidents in all countries, not just in ours. However, it is perceived much more sensitively in view of the long absence of a democratic system. The same thing holds true for all presidents, however; they should not fulfill merely a ceremonial function. In this case, the question would arise whether the function of president could not be carried out concurrently, for example, by the prime minister. [Svora] The aforementioned triumvirate of presidents is also linked by something else: They are in office more or less without those with whom they had cooperated closely in the past. Which of your former friends do you still have left? [Havel] I am a conservative person. If someone is my friend, then he remains a friend for life. It just so happens with my friends from dissent that sometimes they are involved more in political life, sometimes less. I meet with some often and with others seldom; sometimes our views are similar, other times they are not so similar. However, this should not -- and does not -- alter the fact that we are still friends. Despite the fact that I have little time, I meet with all sorts of people, including my old friends. Every two weeks, I organize a meeting with various personalities in the presidential Amalia residence. Around 300 different people have already taken part in them. [Svora] You once said in an interview for the former SMENA that you do not want to be a president-grave digger. Despite this, you were the last Czechoslovak president. With the passage of time, what is your assessment of the breakup of Czechoslovakia? [Havel] For many citizens in the Czech Republic, and also in Slovakia, the breakup of the Federation came as a real blow. They were used to a homeland that had a different dimension, not only geographically, but also culturally and historically. And, all of a sudden, this homeland diminished in size. However, thanks to the decent way in which the breakup took place, people have come to terms with it relatively well. I resigned from my post as federal president for various reasons. One of them was that I did not want to stand in the way of a development that I saw as irreversible. And I had to. Undoubtedly, I would have been faced with the task of signing the official law on breaking up the state. How could a president who had sworn his oath of office on the Czechoslovak Constitution sign this law? It seemed to me that I would make the situation easier for everyone if I resigned. [Svora] The number of voices calling for standardized Czech-Slovak relations is increasing in the Czech Republic. In principle, apparently, there cannot be any difference between Australia, Portugal, and Slovakia.... [Havel] I believe that order makes friends. We are two states and we must have the basic attributes of statehood. We have our ambassador in your country and you have your ambassador in our country, we have a demarcated border, we have customs officers, and so on. It is necessary to have these basic attributes of statehood. This does not mean, however, that if we have standard requirements, we also have to have standard relations. We will always be linked to such an extent by our common history and similar language that our mutual relations will never be standard ones. [Svora] What do you expect from today's visit to Slovakia? [Havel] I am looking forward to my talks with President Kovac. I am curious about his interpretation of the current political situation in Slovakia prior to the early parliamentary elections. I expect not only a further exchange of views on various topics, but perhaps also an agreement on certain standpoints and initiatives.
