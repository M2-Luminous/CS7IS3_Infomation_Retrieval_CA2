'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, warned: "Very soon Israel will be in mourning and put up black flags because 'Izz-al-Din will strike harder than even the Zionist terrorists can imagine." Islamic Jihad said: "The blood of the people will not be shed for nothing. "The bullets of the Islamic fighters will be our immediate answer to the Zionists." In their statements, the fundamentalists joined the Palestine Liberation Organization's call for three days of mourning and a general strike throughout the occupied territories. The mosque massacre sparked widespread clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops who shot dead nine protestors and wounded scores more.
