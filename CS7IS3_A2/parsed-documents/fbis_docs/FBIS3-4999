Seoul proposed to Washington the formation of a Korea-U.S. committee on industrial cooperation when Trade-Industry-Energy Minister Kim Chol-su visited the United States last April. Kim's proposal was aimed at introducing advanced technology to wipe out trade disputes by linking Korean and U.S. manufacturers through technological tie-ups. But Minister Kim seemed unaware of the differences in the economic structure of the two countries, an observer said. In Korea, the government is able to easily guide enterprises in whatever direction it wants, but in the United States, government intervention in private business is impossible because of its free market mechanisms, the observer explained. Minister Kim proposed to form an alliance between Korea and the United States in technology, investment and overseas market development in high-tech industries during Washington talks with Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Seattle last November, Kim and Brown agreed, in principle, that the committee will be launched when trade ministers talks are held again this year. Seoul also proposed to form nine subcommittees on semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, medical equipment, computers, machine tools and power generation facilities, environment-related facilities, automobiles and aircraft, a Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said. But Washington has cited various difficulties in proceeding with ahead with the bilateral industrial cooperation program under the government initiatives. The official is pessimistic about the proposal, citing a bilateral science and technology cooperation committee whose inauguration has still yet to be seen due to passive attitude of the U.S. government although Seoul proposed nearly 10 years ago. Korea has also suggested establishing a fund on industrial and technological cooperation each with money provided by each government and businesses to carry out projects. Korea has set up a fund this year with 3.2 billion won donated by the business circle and 800 million won of state subsidy. The government plans to increase the fund to $20 million (some 16 billion won) by 1997. The government has also drawn up a concrete program on the operation of the fund when the subcommittees are established. The official said that the fund will be used to support joint venture projects, introduction of advanced U.S. technology, feasibility studies to sort out areas for possible cooperation and exchanges of science and technology researchers. But the U.S. government has turned down the suggestion, reportedly saying that it is unable to set aside money from its budget and to force businesses to donate to that purpose, the ministry official said. Korea also proposed that both government officials and businessmen participate in the nine subcommittees. But the U.S. government objected to the inclusion of public servants in the subcommittees, the official said. During the conference of the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC) in Washington last month, the two sides agreed to change the subcommittees to private advisory forums composed of businessmen from both countries. But the U.S. reiterated that public officials should be excluded. As expected, the U.S. government has also faced difficulties in arranging for American companies to take part in the formation of the advisory forum in each field, although Korea is ready to do so, according to the Trade-Industry-energy Ministry. U.S. officials reportedly insist that technology transfers can be possible on commercial basis among companies and as a result their government can hardly intervene in private businesses. Although Minister Kim's idea is good, he does not understand the different industrial structure of the two nations, an official of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), a private interest group of large business concerns. "In fact, there are many sectors for manufacturers of both nations to cooperate," the FKI official said, adding that Korean and U.S. companies will be able to join hands to advance to China with the enormous market potential with U.S. high technology and Korea's experience of massive production and still cheap skilled manpower. He said, "The urgent problem to be tackled for high-tech imports is to create an atmosphere for foreign investment here and trust on Korean firms." "Restrictions in the financial sector, acquisition of real estate, construction of plants are a great hindrance to foreign investment," the FKI official stressed. The WALL STREET JOURNAL recently reported that 220 foreign firms withdrew $369 million in investments here in 1992 and 52 of them completely closed their plants here due to the unfavorable business environment.
