At 0111 GMT, Tawara begins the interview by discussing censure motions submitted by the LDP in the House of Councillors against the foreign minister and the farm minister over the decision to partially open the rice market. He says that some people believe the LDP's plan is to delay deliberations on political reform. Denying the allegation, Kono says: "We submitted censure motions in the upper house because the ministers' agreement on the decision apparently runs counter to upper house resolutions calling for maintaining self-sufficiency in rice." He stresses that the LDP has no intention of delaying deliberations on political reform. Tawara says that the LDP acts like an unmanageable child when negotiating with the ruling coalition. Refuting Tawara, Kono says: "The ruling coalition acts high-handedly and does not listen to what the LDP has to say. Opposing such an attitude, we have called for dialogue." Kono then explains the efforts made by the LDP following the adoption of political reform bills in the lower house in mid- November to promote discussions on political reform and a supplementary budget for economic recovery, stressing: "People must clearly understand these efforts." Moreover, he criticizes the ruling coalition for rejecting LDP demands for promoting deliberations both on political reform and economic recovery. Returning to the rice issue, Tawara asks Kono whether he opposes the partial opening of the rice market. Kono, without answering the question directly, notes that rice farmers in such countries as Australia and the United States are growing rice for export to Japan, while Japanese farmers produce rice for domestic consumption. He expresses apprehension over the impact on Japanese farmers of the decision to partially open the rice market. After citing news reports saying that the LDP has changed its attitude and has become flexible in debate on political reform, Tawara asks for Kono's comments on the reports. Kono says: "I have asserted from the beginning that the political reform issue should be concluded in the current Diet session" and notes that because of a lack of concessions on the part of the ruling coalition in the lower house, the issue is now being discussed in the upper house. He adds: "The debate in the upper house is aimed at narrowing differences between government-proposed political reform bills and the reform plan put forward by the LDP." Tawara and Kono then discuss three key issues in political reform on which the LDP and the ruling coalition have not yet reached an agreement: electoral district units for proportional representation; the reapportionment of seats for the lower house; and the handling of political donations by corporations and other organizations. Kono notes that the ruling coalition is split over the issue of whether to compromise with the LDP on these issues. When asked if he rejected compromise measures proposed by Prime Minister Morhiro Hosokawa during the Hosokawa-Kono summit talks last year, Kono says: "No. We both refused to accept each other's compromise plans. I presented my opinions and Mr. Hosokawa rejected them." Tawara next asks Kono whether the LDP will accept the proposal, which has surfaced within the ruling coalition as a compromise measure, to divide the nation into electoral blocs for voting on the basis of proportional representation. Kono says: "Since we want votes for seats involving proportional representation to be cast on a prefectural basis, discussions will be necessary." Concerning Tawara's question about whether there is one issue among the three key issues on which the LDP can compromise, Kono stresses the need for further discussion. Tawara then says that the LDP needs to make compromises in talks with the ruling coalition. Kono responds: "It is necessary to make concessions to enact the political reform bills. That is why I am asking Mr. Hosokawa to compromise." Asked whether he would accept an offer to hold summit talks with Hosokawa again to narrow differences, Kono gives a negative view, noting the importance of respecting political reform debate in the upper house. Finally, Tawara asks whether the LDP is determined not to boycott deliberations on political reform in the upper house. Kono answers: "Our party will never do such a thing." The interview ends at 0146 GMT.
