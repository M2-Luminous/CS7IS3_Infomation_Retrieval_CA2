All personal luggages are strictly examined and inspected, and the quantity of luggage a traveller may take is strictly limited. No unqualified product is allowed to be taken out of the country. Last year the three entry and exit ports of Manzhouli, Labudalin and Erlian alone seized fake brand-name products worth 10 million yuan. The Manzhouli Tourism Bureau provides foreign tourists with a shopping guide in the Russian language, which reminds tourists to demand receipts from Chinese shops. If a commodity can not pass customs inspection the buyer can claim compensation from the shop. If any travel agent does not provide a tourist with the shopping guide and the tourist buys a fake, the travel agent is responsible for paying any compensation. These measures are aimed at safeguarding the reputation of Chinese-made products and ensuring that cross-border trade develops in a healthy way, according to a local official.
