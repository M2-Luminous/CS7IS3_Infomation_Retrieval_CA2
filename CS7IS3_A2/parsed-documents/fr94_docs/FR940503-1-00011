FR940503-1-00011 FR940503-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This notice proposes the supersedure o f an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50/ &hyph;80A series turbofan engines, that currently requires a one-time ultrasonic and eddy current inspection of the high pressure compressor rotor (HPCR) stage 3&hyph;9 spool for cracks. This action would retain the inspection requirements of the current AD, but would accelerate the inspection schedule, and introduce a repetitive inspection requirement. This proposal is prompted by a review of the inspection results to date, which indicate that the crack occurrence rate is higher than initially projected. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent an uncontained HPCR stage 3&hyph;9 spool failure, which could result in damage to the aircraft. DATES: Comments must be received by June 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;11, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.
