(c) The total of disaster, deficiency, and Options Program bushels shall not exceed the result of multiplying the permitted acreage for the crop times the yield. Options Program bushels that remain eligible for premium and incentive payments shall be calculated as the smaller of: (1) The result of multiplying the permitted acreage of the commodity, times the program payment yield established for such commodity, minus the disaster bushels; or (2) The bushels of the commodity that are enrolled in the options program. §1415.26 Successors in interest.
