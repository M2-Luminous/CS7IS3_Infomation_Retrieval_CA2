The Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government clamorously announced in Phnom Penh, Battambang, and Treng that they have seized Pailin. Meanwhile, some foreign news agencies and newspapers have echoed this announcement of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government in an evil intention to deceive the national and international public opinion just as they did concerning the Anlung Veng battlefield. II. Many observers and journalists stressed, however, that they had been waiting several days for permission to go to Pailin, but the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government did not allow them to go. They waited in Battambang and Treng for several days, but they did not reach Pailin. Therefore, they assumed that the Vietnamese puppets had not yet seized Pailin as they claimed. The Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government lied. They also reported that on the Route 10-Pailin battlefield, many attacking troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were killed and wounded. The routed troops who retreated from the battlefield said that hundreds of their colleagues were killed and wounded. Several hundred other wounded troops were hospitalized. The attacking troops died in battle and also due to a shortage of water and food, while hundreds deserted their ranks. Those deserters also said that the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government lied to them that their troops were fighting on the front line; but, in fact, they were very far from Pailin. III. The spokesman of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] would like to stress to the national and international audience that: A. Not a single soldier of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government was able to enter Pailin city. Presently, Pailin remains under the control of Democratic Kampuchea in an orderly manner. B. We would like to inform the national and international audience that the Vietnamese communist puppets, two-headed government, and their masters who have continued to kindle war and oppose national reconciliation, peace, constitution, and the king have made an all-out effort to smash the national forces and people in order to enable Vietnam to swallow Cambodia and enable their allies to seize and incorporate Cambodia into their arena. This is why they have given money to the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government for continuing to fuel the war. They ordered the attack on Anlung Veng and claimed to have won victory and to have seized this area. In fact, they suffered heavy and shameful defeats. The journalists and national and international public opinion have been informed about this big defeat at Anlung Veng -- they met a crushing defeat and swore not to fight again for the rest of their lives. While launching this new offensive, they shamelessly claimed to have seized Pailin in such a way in an attempt, on the one hand, to whitewash their big defeat at Anlung Veng and, on the other, to beg for more money and to put pressure on FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. They also went so far as to flex their muscles for the king when puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim visited Beijing. IV. We would like to stress that on 17 and 18 March, the attacking forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were severely smashed by the NADK forces, inflicting heavy losses on them in terms of manpower, tanks, and artillery. Many of their forces were forced to retreat and flee in disarray. On 19 March, puppet Hun Sen and the Political Bureau of the Cambodian People's Party of the Vietnamese communists ordered their forces to make an adventurous assault. On 19 March, the attacking forces then began their onslaught, using tanks and artillery as the principle means. They moved up to Sala Krau, but were intercepted and attacked from the rear and the front by the NADK forces. They were cut to pieces and four of their 20 tanks were destroyed. The remaining 16 tanks moved up to Sala Krau on the night of 19 March. The people and NADK surrounded them from all directions, cutting the attacking forces into many parts in the area from Kon Damrei to (Phum Don Ta). On the afternoon of 21 March, we destroyed two tanks and damaged three others. In addition to the nine tanks we destroyed between 8 and 18 March, we destroyed 14 other tanks. The remaining tanks are short of fuel and the enemy soldiers are suffering shortages of food, ammunition, and spare parts to repair the damaged tanks. They are encircled in a four to five kilometer area at Sala Krau where the people's forces and the NADK are continuing to attack and capture as many of them as possible. The attacking forces' supply is inoperable. This is, on the one hand, caused by heavy rains as their vehicles get bogged down and cannot move forward. On the other hand, they often hit land mines and are targets of attack from the people and NADK. Many of them are thus destroyed, damaged, and stalled in the fields. The doomsday of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two- headed government is drawing near. They will soon suffer a similar big defeat, just as they did at Anlung Veng because their forces -- including tanks, infantrymen, and so forth -- that have hazardously moved forward are already being intercepted by the people and NADK.
