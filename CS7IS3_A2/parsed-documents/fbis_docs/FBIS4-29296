Due to the inability of domestic investors to operate the foreign investments, some 95 percent of the shares were permitted to be owned by foreign investors. As such, foreign investors are permitted to purchase a large portion of shares of the infrastructure in the public interest in sectors such as ports, the production and supply of electricity to the public, railway services, nuclear-powered electricity generating plants and the mass media. The deregulation package which was issued is named Government Regulation No:20/1994. It was endorsed by President Suharto on 19 May 1994. It was laid down in the regulation that foreign investments can be made through two methods -- through direct investments and through joint ventures. Foreign investors are permitted to own a 95-percent stake if investments are carried out through joint ventures. As for direct investments, foreign investors are permitted to own a 100-percent stake and their investments should be exclusively situated within industrialized zones. In short, we fully understand the statement made by Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, Minister of State for Investment and Chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board, who said: "This is a courageous and big breakthrough [preceding two words in English]." According to Sanyoto, the foreign investors had been waiting for such a deregulation package to commence their operations in Indonesia. The government regulation was in accordance with Regulation No: 1/1967. But what went wrong? A group of industrialists, parliamentarians and people doubted that the new deregulation package would be successful. For example, Benny Sutrisno observed that the government could be fully liberal because it could totally absorb the market economy by making attractive investment offers to foreign investors, including the public sector. Benny Sutrisno said he would agree only if such an action was undertaken for the sake of strengthening the country's economy. Apart from this, questions were also raised on whether approximations were taken into consideration on the negative aspect of the deregulation package. But it was different with Kwik Kian Gie, a philanthrophist and economist. He was surprised at the government's decision to make an almost full offer of the public sectoral activities to foreign investors. He was confused over the definition of "the people's aspiration for a livelihood." In fact, segments of the community are still in the dark over the government's strategy of offering the industrial sector to foreign investors. Therefore, it was probable that numerous persons have a similar opinion to that of Benny Sutrisno. The opinion was that it was clear that the government was independent in making the decision, which could prove to be critical. Those from the elite [preceding word in English] economic strata would definitely fall victim to this deregulation package. The public will definitely have to support the losses. This is considered to be an unfair practise. Besides, there are those who considered that the deregulation package could spark off public anxiety because certain groups have varying convictions regarding the provisions of the 1945 Constitution -- particularly the conflict which prevails between the ministers who favored the Government Regulation No: 20/1994 and certain parliamentarians who were ill-informed of the deregulation package. In fact, the government should have held consultations with the members of the House of Representatives prior to the announcement of the new deregulation package, which could provoke a multitude of queries. We had pledged to further strengthen our climate of openness and democracy. On 11 March 1966, we conscientiously pledged to implement and uphold Pancasila [State ideology] and the 1945 Constitution. Then, why issue the new deregulation package, which is not in compliance with the provision of Chapter 14 of Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution which states: All branches of production which are of significant national importance and which are in the public interest are state property. If we are still unconvinced by this, then let us again look again at the contents of Guide Book 1 on Pancasila. Let us look again at Chapter II [Roman two] on the Basic National Development, the Development Objectives under item A and the Bases for National Development under item B. Regarding the first four out of seven bases laid down for our national development, there is clearly a stress laid on the bases being for benefit, joint ventures, democracy and equal justice. These are wanting in the new deregulation package.
