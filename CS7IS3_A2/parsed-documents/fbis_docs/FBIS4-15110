If they return, Abkhazia will effectively stay within Georgia, he said. Even though the document was not ideal, Tbilisi had to compromise because there was no other way to win the lost war. Shevardnadze said that unless the refugees returned, "a confederation with Abkhazia will remain a dream. Any opportunity to have the refugees return to Abkhazia should be seized. Without this there is no point in talking about Abkhazia's status or a political solution of this issue...They will not have another chance to return." Following Shevardnadze's speech the opposition withdrew its proposal that the agreement should be denounced and that a vote of confidence in Shevardnadze be taken. Shevardnadze himself demanded that such a vote be taken once the government is approved. The Georgian parliament will resume the debate on the government composition on April 7.
