A member of the "New White Hand" ["Nueva Mano Blanca"], a name used in the past decade by a so-called "death squad," has told NOTIMEX the victims were "executed" in San Salvador and in areas of the outskirts for their involvement in holdups. A spokesman for this group, which emerged last January, explained his organization consists of approximately 80 civilians, including women, who have been victimized by criminal gangs. He has said that his group is not responsible for the attacks on or murders of politicians and that its mission is to fight crime "due to the authorities' inadequate actions to eradicate it." He added the group uses 9-mm pistols to "execute" gang members. The police have reported more than 50 criminal gangs are operating in San Salvador. [passage omitted]
