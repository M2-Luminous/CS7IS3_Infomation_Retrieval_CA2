Iraqi opposition sources told AL-HAYAH in London yesterday 'Awn "worked for an operation run by Saddam's sons 'Udayy and Qusayy, which traded in hard currency in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, including the Kurdish-controlled north." The Associated Press reported that Arab sources yesterday cited Iraqi officials as saying that 'Abbas 'Awn was convicted of dealing with "hostile external powers" bent on undermining the Iraqi dinar. Travelers confirm the news of the execution. 'Awn had been apprehended on 3 January, 1994, but was then released. According to the same sources, 'Abbas 'Awn was executed by firing squad, along with his brother-in-law, Qasim Qaqiyah, and others. Sources of the "United National Iraqi Opposition" told AL-HAYAH the day before yesterday that 'Awn was bankrolling Iraq's military industries. Also executed with him were Majid Hulw, Qasim 'Abd-al-Karim Hasan, and his chaufeur.
