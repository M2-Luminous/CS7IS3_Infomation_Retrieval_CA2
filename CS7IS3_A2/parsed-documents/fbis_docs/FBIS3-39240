At a CDU symposium in Wiesbaden, Kanther reported on Friday [11 February] that a direct comparison between the two halves of 1993 shows that the number of asylum-seekers illegally smuggled into Germany went down from 30,000 by about 20,000. Thus, many who pay large sums of money to human traffickers only to be deported immediately upon their arrival in Germany have been spared great disappointment. According to the interior minister, there is a close connection between the crime of trafficking in people, illegal border-crossings, and the above-average crime rate among illegal immigrants. He also sees a great problem in the illegal employment of illegal immigrants, Kanther said. "Illegal employment is not a minor offense, it is a very serious crime," he stressed. The CDU politician also opposed the view that Germany has become an immigration country. The demand for an immigration law is absurd; anyone who claims that this could regulate the problem of immigration is just spreading "impractical chimeras" that cannot be used to solve practical problems. Political achievements must be measured by their results, Kanther said.
