According to their budget-drafting schedule, the ruling coalition will work out guidelines on February 3 for compilation of the budget and tax reforms for fiscal 1994, starting in April. Based on this, on February 5 the Finance Ministry will announce its budgetary plan, which is likely to be adopted as a government proposal with few changes on February 10, just in time for the summit meeting in Washington between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Government sources said the biggest point for debate will be how to finance a planned reduction in the income tax. The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], an important force in the coalition, has been opposed to raising the current 3 percent consumption tax rate to offset the income tax cut, an idea pushed by the Finance Ministry.
