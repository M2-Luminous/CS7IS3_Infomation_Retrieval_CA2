The servicer's functions typically involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service'' the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted, a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. Receivables of the type suitable for inclusion in a trust invariably are serviced with the assistance of a computer. After the sale, the servicer keeps the sold receivables on the computer system in order to continue monitoring the accounts. Although the records relating to sold receivables are kept in the same master file as receivables retrained by the originator, the sold receivables are flagged as having been sold. To protect the investors' interest, the servicer ordinarily covenants that this ``sold flag'' will be included in all records relating to the sold receivables, including the master file, archives, tape extracts, and printouts. The sold flags are invisible to the obligor, and do not affect the manner in which the servicer performs the billing, posting and collection procedures relating to the sold receivables. However, the servicer uses the sold flag to identify the receivables for the purpose of reporting all activity on those receivables after their sale to the investors. Depending on the type of receivable and the details of the servicer's computer system, in some cases the servicer's internal reports can be adapted for investor reporting with little or no modification. In other cases, the servicer may have to perform special calculations to fulfill the investor reporting responsibilities. These calculations can be performed on the servicer's main computer, or on a small computer with data supplied by the main system. In all cases, the numbers produced for the investors are reconciled to the servicer's books and reviewed by public accountants. The underwriter will be registered broker-dealer that acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. Public offerings of certificates are generally made on a firm commitment or agency basis. Private placements of certificates may be made on a firm commitment or agency basis. It is anticipated that the lead or co-managing underwriter will make a market in certificates offered to the public. In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to NatWest. In other cases, however, NatWest (directly or through one or more of its U.S. banking affiliates) may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust. Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 11. In some cases, the sponsor will obtain the receivables from various originators pursuant to existing contracts with such originators under which the sponsor will purchase the receivables at fair market value from originator or a finance company pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement related to the specific offering of certificates. In other cases, the sponsor will originate the receivables itself. As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives cash, or certificates representing the entire beneficial interest in the trust. The sponsor sells some or all of these certificates for cash to investors or securities underwriters. 12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified servicing fee. 10 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon rate, together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased at a premium yields less than the stated coupon. 10 The pass-through rate on certificates representing interests in trusts holding leases is determined by breaking down lease payments, into ``principal'' and ``interest'' components based on an implicit interest rate. 13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor or an affiliate thereof, and receive fees for acting as sponsor) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support. The servicer may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables between the time they are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement). The servicer, typically will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing the trust, including in some cases the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation.
