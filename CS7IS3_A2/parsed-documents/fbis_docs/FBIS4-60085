"The world's situation is such that we can prepare all our needed goods from various countries, even from those which are enemies of the Islamic revolution," the president said during his 3-hour visit to the plant which is affiliated to the Ministry of Post, Telephone and Telegraph. Addressing the staff of the plant, the president said that all doors were open for reconstruction of the country and that "our vigilant people are ready to bear hardships to insure the prosperity of their children in the future." He pointed to the significance of solar energy and energies generated by wind and sea, saying that all these types of energy could be generated inside the country. "Such energies may not be economical at present but we should lay the foundation of this," he added. Referring to the government's investments in martyr Raja'i and martyr 'Abbaspur hydroelectric power stations, he said "the energy generated by the two power plants is cheap, sustainable and safe... fortunately we ourselves build such dams, using domestic resources." He said that the optic fiber and solar cells plant, the first of its kind in Iran, was of great importance in area of using solar energy. He said that it was very important that small solar power plants be installed in mountainous and rugged rural regions where setting up of power transmission lines would be uneconomical. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani said though solar energy might be more expensive than other types of energies, its advantages over other sorts of energies necessiated its use.
