This bill entails not giving authority to the Latvian delegation to sign agreements which allow the operation of the Skrunda Radar station after 31 August this year. As Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs said in the debate, because of the secrecy and importance of the information, he could not refute the opposition's arguments in an open plenary session of the Saeima. Andrejevs emphasized that the government does not doubt that the further operation of Skrunda radar does not correspond to Latvia's interests, but the real political situation does not allow the government not to sign the agreement on the radar's operations for another five and a half years.
