ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to August 3, 1994, the comment period for the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that appeared in the Federal Register of February 4, 1994, (59 FR 5363). The document announced the agency's intent to take several related actions to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and ingredients whose uses are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). FDA is taking this action in response to a request to allow additional time for public comment. DATES: Written comments and information by August 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments and information to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Helen R. Thorsheim, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9511. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5363), FDA published an ANPRM announcing the agency's intent to take several related actions to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. The ANPRM requested information on whether the specifications it is considering are feasible, and if they are not, why higher levels will not endanger the public health, and what levels are feasible. Interested persons were given until May 5, 1994, to provide comments and information in response to the ANPRM. FDA has received a request to extend the comment period to permit at least an additional 90 days for public comment. The request stated that additional time is needed to undertake testing, analysis, and data collection relating to the ANPRM. The request also asked that the extension be granted as quickly as possible, so that the requester can determine whether there will be adequate time to perform testing. After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for interested persons to submit comments and information relating to the ANPRM. Accordingly, FDA is extending the comment period to August 3, 1994. Interested persons may, on or before August 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this ANPRM. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: April 28, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
