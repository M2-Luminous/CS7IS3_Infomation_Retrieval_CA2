While Director General Eda stresses the continuation of government policies on nuclear power, he has also opened the lines of communications in an effort to clarify the differences with the policies of the Liberal Democartic administration. Director General Eda gives some a sense of impending reform, but given that he is simply one who tries to please everybody, the trust of neither the pro-nuclear nor anti-nuclear sides will be gained. The crucial time is from now on. Soon after Director General Eda assumed his cabinet position he opened the door for direct dialog with anti-nuclear-power groups. Nisaburo Takagi of the Nuclear Power Data and Information Office said, "Up until now, even if they met the Director General, all they ever did was hand over a list of demands. Any exchange of ideas was impossible." On 20 September Miyako Oshita, a single representative of a nation-wide anti-nuclear group called the Plutonium Action Network, met with Director General Eda. Her face looked hopeful when she said, "It was the first time to speak with the STA Director General, and he made a definite promise to continue dialog in the future." That the pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions joined hands for the first time and co-sponsored a symposium entitled "Why Plutonium Now?" on 25 September, was also on the line extending out of the route "from confrontation to dialog." After experiencing the pursuit of nuclear energy policies during the LDP administration, there appears to be a strong perception that "those of the anti-nuclear faction are also important associates" (Director General Eda's words). On the other hand, in contrast to that situation, it is also a fact that within the STA there is the following criticism: "Government policies are decided through democratic procedures. Formally lending an ear to the anti-nuclear faction will make administration sluggish." Then the head of a division involved with nuclear power divulged the following: "After about November, when the nuclear power administration's study will end one pass, people in the STA will probably be more nervous. From now on we wonder what sort of orders will come from the Director General." Nevertheless, even if the dialog route is remarkable, the government's policy of atomic energy promotion and the establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle aimed at the effective use of plutonium is no change from that of the LDP administration. That is because the basis for the existence of the Hosokawa cabinet lies in the "succession of the previous administration's policies" based on an agreement among the eight coalition parties. Director General Eda himself hinted about the change of direction in an interview last August: "The Social Democratic Federation's predecessor, the Social Citizen's Federation, had been seeking a five-year moratorium on nuclear power. But, when the basic doctrine of supporting the administration was proposed three years ago, those words disappeared." In the 5 October meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee Director General Eda made a fairly positive observation: "The effective use of plutonium is a choice that resource-poor Japan should take." As the head of the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan, Director General Eda inherits the promotion of atomic energy for electrical power generation, but he also listens to the voice of the opposing forces. How will he deal with the assertions of the two sides? Director General Eda will continue walking a tightrope.
