In this letter, the commission has requested from the Greek Government to ready the money, radio stations and arms for liberation of Vorio Epirus (northern Epirus). Referring to the letter, REPUBLIKA writes that "It is a witness of the Athens' attempts and representatives of the Greek minority in Albania for organizing the Greek forces in Albania in a radical form. Those who have signed the letter request from Athens a more careful policy and a greater attention toward the Hellenization of the south of Albania. They have generous suggestions, and requests for technical means, arms, money, self-organization, headquarters in Athens, radio station in Vorio Epirus etc. They propose Athens that in the centre of its propaganda with Albanians should be stressed that Italy and other Western states are not friend countries of Albania. Intending to create an isolation climate toward Albania, the objective is that Albania be dependent on Greece and in order that it might be easier for Greece to exercise its policy of dictation.
