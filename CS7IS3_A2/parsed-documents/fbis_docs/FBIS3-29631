In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Murayama said "a political force to replace the 38-year-long corruption-ridden politics of the Liberal Democratic Party could not be formed without the participation of the SDPJ." "That political parties with different stances and policies are supporting the coalition government is, in a sense, a demand of the times, and will heighten the transparency of politics...(the SDPJ's participation) is significant in that sense," Murayama said. The SDPJ is the leading bloc in the seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which was launched last August after the ouster of the LDP from power and the placing of priority on legislating political reforms aimed at cleaning up the country's politics. Asked why the SDPJ would stick with the coalition after last month's enactment of political reform bills, Murayama said "(the next) general elections (under the new system mixing single-seat districts and proportional representation) will be a turning point deciding the framework of the coalition." As for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle his cabinet as early as late this month, the SDPJ chief reiterated his opposition, saying "if the reshuffle is conducted to replace a specific minister, it is wrong." "The most important thing (for the government) right now is pump- priming measures for the economy. Ministers responsible for (enacting) the fiscal 1994 budget should be exerting their efforts for the people and (thus) a cabinet reshuffle at present is inappropriate," Murayama said. Hosokawa has expressed hopes of reorganizing his cabinet later this month, with the media speculating that this could mean the removal of Masayoshi Takemura from the key post of chief cabinet secretary, perhaps to another position. Murayama said he would not accept a ministerial post even if urged by Hosokawa to join his new cabinet. "I assumed the SDPJ chairmanship in response to party members' requests to maintain party unity. Circumstances within the party will not allow me to join (the cabinet)," he said. On financial sources to offset the 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, Murayama said, "the tax cuts apply only to fiscal 1994. I think (the government) will implement tax reductions even after the year...But before that (the SDPJ) will call for a thorough rectification of the inequitable tax system." Following that, he said, the government should propose and seek the support of the people for a new tax to cover the costs of the ongoing aging of society. If the government takes other steps to get the support of the people on a new tax to finance welfare and pensions, there will be no need to hold general elections on the issue, he said.
