It was said then, with full clarity, that the Economic and Social Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between Syria and Lebanon will make the citizens of both countries feel the importance of what took place. They will sense, through the cancellation of the import permit, which will enable Syrian merchants to import Lebanese goods without a permit, that something important has indeed been achieved this time on the level of bilateral relations, and that all this will reflect positively on the living conditions in both countries. Since that date, many meetings have taken place at the highest levels, as well as at other levels, and documents, signatures, and ratifications have been exchanged. Recently, on 9 February 1994, the Lebanese paper AL-SHA'B reported that the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies ratified 14 draft laws; foremost, the agreements with Syria. The draft law under Decree No. 4373, which permits the Government to conclude cooperation agreements between Lebanon and Syria, was submitted to the Chamber for discussion and ratified. Implementation With this measure, everything has become ready for implementation, especially once the signed, ratified, and legally approved documents have been exchanged. This is a major step forward, because the agreement provides for measures that will lead to economic integration between Syria and Lebanon and the establishment of a Syrian-Lebanese common market, including joint industrial and tourist projects. Under this agreement, eight committees were formed to carry out production and services projects in all fields. What Has Been Achieved So Far Many efforts have been exerted, several meetings have been held, and numerous delegations have come to Syria while others have gone to Lebanon, all pending the moment the implementation will begin. The time is approaching, and in the course of all these activities the two sides have defined the bases for applying the Certificate of Origin, as follows: - The Arab Certificate of Origin used for facilitating and developing trade between the Arab countries will also be used to certify the national identity of goods exchanged between the two countries. - In light of the discussions that took place between the two countries concerning the provisions of the Certificate of Origin and the methods of certifying their veracity; and in accordance with the decisions made by the Follow-Up and Coordination Committee during its meeting on 15-16 September 1993 on these subjects, the two sides decided to make the following recommendations: 1. Certificate of Origin: A. Applying the Certificate of Origin (as per attached) approved under the Agreement on Facilitating and Developing Trade Between the Arab Countries, provided this certificate is endorsed by the customs departments in both countries in accordance with the current procedure between them. B. Instructing the customs departments in both countries to fix a date in order to put this certificate into effect after these minutes have been ratified by the quarters concerned in both countries and after an agreement has been reached in principle concerning its format and dimensions. The two departments shall conclude their work within a period of two months from this date. C. The customs departments in both countries shall, when necessary, exchange information about checking the veracity of the Lebanese or Syrian Certificates of Origin. They may take the necessary measures in this regard through coordination -- including the exchange of visits -- with the competent departments in both countries. 2. Cancellation of Import Permit: - Canceling the current import permit with regard to the exchange of goods and commodities between the two countries and replacing it in Syria by the Import Approval (as per attached model) under the provisions of Paragraph B of Article 5 of the Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement signed between the two countries on 16 September 1993. - The Syrian side has explained that all products of Lebanese origin can be traded with Syria within the limits of the foreign trade ordinances and the currencies used in Syria, whether or not these products are included in the lists attached to the 1953 agreement. Exemptions from and reductions of customs duties are incorporated in these lists. - The Lebanese side explained that all commodities of Syrian origin can be traded with Lebanon and also imported in accordance with the existing laws in Lebanon, and that exemptions from and reductions of customs duties are also incorporated in the lists attached to the 1953 agreement. The Joint Economic Committee On 10 January 94, a Lebanese economic delegation led by Lebanese Economy Minister Hagop Demerdjian visited Damascus. A meeting was held at the Economy Ministry in Damascus under the chairmanship of the ministers of economy and foreign trade of both countries. The meeting was attended by Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council, and members of the Syrian and Lebanese delegations. As a result of this meeting, it was decided: 1. To form the Joint Economic Committee provided for in Clause (i) Paragraph (B) of Article (4) of the Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement under the chairmanship of the two ministers of economy in both countries and the representatives of the competent departments. The committee shall undertake the following tasks: 2. To discuss the scientific means and formulas needed to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement signed between the two countries on 16 Sepember 1993, especially Paragraph (B) of Article (2) which deals with: A. Coordinating the internal costs of national goods exchanged between the two countries in order to achieve parity in these costs, and therefore free the goods from any restrictions.. B. Proceeding gradually toward the free exchange of national goods and commodities between the two countries and freeing these goods and commodities fropm any restrictions in accordance with the lists of commodities and products whose internal costs have been equated and endorsed by the Economic Committee established under this agreement. C. Coordinating all other fields of economic cooperation, especially the transfer of capital between the two countries in order to free trade between them and to enable them to establish joint ventures. D. Enabling nationals of both countries to carry out all types of economic and professional activities to ensure equal opportunities for them in accordance with existing laws and regulations. E. Encouraging the establishment of joint economic ventures, taking into consideration the coordination and standardization of privileges, securities, facilities, and exemptions, and applying in this regard the provisions of existing laws, including those concluded within the framework of the Arab League and its affiliate organizations. F. Coordinating economic and trade cooperation with the other states and regional and international organizations. G. Revising the lists attached to the economic agreement signed between the two countries in 1953 with the view to expanding and developing these lists. It was also decided that the two sides will submit their ideas on how to achieve these tasks gradually, provided attention is given to the following priorities: A. Specifying the topics and questions dealing with trade and the proposed solutions for them. B. Revising the commodity lists attached to the economic agreement of 1953 with the view to developing and expanding them in line with the economic developments in both countries. C. Studying the minutes of the technical committee with the view to defining the bases for applying the certificate of origin. Each side will inform the other of its own ideas through the general secretariat of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council within a period of one month from this date prior to discussing these ideas in the meeting which is scheduled to take place in Beirut at a date to be fixed by the secretary general.
