Petition NIH/ORDA for determination of containment for experiments requiring case&hyph;by&hyph;case review; and Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;b&hyph;(5). Petition NIH/ORDA for determination of containment for experiments not covered by the NIH Guidelines. Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c. Submissions by the Principal Investigator to the Institutional Biosafety Committee The Principal Investigator shall: Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c&hyph;(1). Make an initial determination of the required levels of physical and biological containment in accordance with the NIH Guidelines; Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c&hyph;(2). Select appropriate microbiological practices and laboratory techniques to be used for the research; Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c&hyph;(3). Submit the initial research protocol and any subsequent changes (e.g., changes in the source of DNA or host&hyph;vector system), if covered under Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, III&hyph;C, or III&hyph;D, to the Institutional Biosafety Committee for review and approval or disapproval; and Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;c&hyph;(4). Remain in communication with the Institutional Biosafety Committee throughout the conduct of the project. Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d. Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator Prior to Initiating Research The Principal Investigator shall: Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d&hyph;(1). Make available to all laboratory staff the protocols that describe the potential biohazards and the precautions to be taken; Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d&hyph;(2). Instruct and train laboratory staff in: (i) the practices and techniques required to ensure safety, and (ii) the procedures for dealing with accidents; and Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;d&hyph;(3). Inform the laboratory staff of the reasons and provisions for any precautionary medical practices advised or requested (e.g., vaccinations or serum collection). Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;e. Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator During the Conduct of the Research The Principal Investigator shall: Section IV&hyph;B&hyph;4&hyph;e&hyph;(1).
