This matter was the main subject of analysis during the first workday of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. In meeting with some of the members of the congressional committee that will give an opinion on MP 457, Minister Ricupero verified that obstacles still exist, and with a further aggravating factor: After the exit of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, political interests are still hindering the approval of the economic plan. Congress does not consider itself defeated by the executive branch triumph in having MP 434 reedited. The electioneering congressmen insist on introducing three modifications to the MP: a recovery of salary losses, a minimum salary increase, and the inclusion of a certain kind of price freeze. The only objective of these changes is to make the economic plan not feasible. [passage omitted] The problem is that the new finance minister does not have Cardoso's ability to convince the congressmen to approve the economic plan. The fact that Cardoso is a candidate for president of the Republic has increased the number of congressmen interested in the failure of the economic plan.
