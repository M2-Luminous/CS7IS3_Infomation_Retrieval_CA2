FBIS4-20084 "drweu080_q_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 TURKEY Reaction to Clinton's Statement on Cyprus Noted Reaction to Clinton's Statement on Cyprus Noted NC2504193394 Istanbul HURRIYET in Turkish 24 Apr 94 p 16 NC2504193394 Istanbul HURRIYET Turkish BFN [Unattributed report: "Turmoil on Cyprus"] [Text] The statement President Clinton made before he met Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, to the effect that "an important development will take place on the Cyprus problem in a few days and the ball is in Denktas' court" has created a turmoil in Ankara. The opposition parties moved into action and blamed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller after they read the report in HURRIYET's headlines. Ciller responded by saying: "I did not discuss the Cyprus problem with Clinton. Nor did he make such a statement." However, Ciller's decision to suddenly send Ambassador Volkan Vural, who is her adviser, to Nicosia drew attention to the Cyprus problem in Ankara. Meanwhile, the Greek newspapers reported that one of Prime Minister Papandreou's advisers informed the Greek prime minister that "Ciller has made a promise. Denktas will approve the new package of confidence-building measures." That report created a reaction in the opposition party leaders. President Suleyman Demirel was the first to react. Replying to a question on Clinton's statement during a reception in the Cankaya Mansion, he said: "Something that is wrong, something that is undesirable, and something that violates and harms the rights of Turkey, its kinsmen in north Cyprus, and the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] cannot be accepted." Regarding the reports that Rauf Denktas has agreed to the package of confidence-building measures, Demirel said: "I conferred with the speaker of the TRNC Republican Assembly yesterday. As far as I know, the matter is being discussed. Meanwhile, I have been informed that the United States wants progress to be made in the talks. However, that is all. The question is not related to pressure but to the need for something to be done. That is the official information I have. Naturally, the problem is not a matter between Turkey and the United States. Nor is it between Turkey and Greece. It is related to the agreement the two communities will reach to coexist in Cyprus. That is a matter that does not closely concern Ankara. Naturally, Ankara maintains a very sensitive and careful approach on the Cyprus problem. That applies to public opinion, the parliament, and the government. I am also very careful." Demirel's attention was drawn to Clinton's statement that the problem will be solved in a few days. He replied: "He has mentioned two or three days. We shall wait to see developments in the next few days." Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "I have the text of the records on the meeting Prime Minister Ciller had with President Clinton. Ciller has not made a promise." Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz's reaction was as follows: I cautioned the prime minister before her visit to the United States. I was worried that a concession might be made on Cyprus. The prime minister must disclose the views she exchanged with Clinton, particularly the promise that was made to him. We proposed that the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] hold a general session on the Cyprus problem. We have conferred with the speaker of the TGNA. The convocation will be held on Tuesday. I shall address the session and explain our anxiety on the Cyprus problem. Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan reacted as follows: No one can make a concession. An administration that has lost its grass roots cannot make a concession on the matter. A secret policy cannot be maintained within the state. The records on the prime minister's meeting with President Clinton in the United States must be placed in the archives. Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin said: I do not believe that the reports are true. The prime minister will issue a statement on the matter.
