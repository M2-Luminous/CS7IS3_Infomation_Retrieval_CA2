During the annual plenary session of the National People's Congress in March city and provincial representatives demanded a guaranteed increase in grain production. The representatives have also demanded balanced supply and demand in the grain market, in a highly publicised campaign. The rise in the grain price is a complicated issue. Although consumers are paying more when buying grain, peasants' incomes have not increased as a result. Even though the price of grain has increased, the extent of the increase has been unable to match that of agricultural raw materials and equipment such as fertiliser, diesel, farm machinery and components. While there is a surplus of agricultural workers, there is a serious shortage of people who actually work the land. Most of those who work the land are elderly people and women. As such, grain production can by no means be neglected. The primary reason for the soaring price of grain in recent years is that little emphasis has been placed on farming. This is because farming offers very low profit margins. It has been suggested that the annual consumption of grain per capita is falling, against an increase in overall grain production in China. Moreover, the pricing of grain in China is mainly affected by the distribution system. An inefficient distribution system will result in a lack of grain supply in some areas and this means that both consumers and peasants will suffer. To a certain extent, the suggestion that grain consumption is falling against an increase in production is correct. But it does not pinpoint the central issue. In fact, the problem lies more on the production side than in the distribution system. Annual grain consumption per capita among the rural population has not dropped significantly. It is because grain consumption by urban residents has fallen, against soaring consumption of pork, poultry and eggs. But how will the production of pork and poultry increase if there is no feed for the animals? If grain production is not increased, no balance can be fixed between supply and demand in the grain market. Eventually, it will be difficult to stabilise the grain price even if the efficiency of distribution is improved. Boosting the efficiency of the distribution process is imperative, to ensure that both peasants and consumers are protected. Devoting more emphasis to agricultural production to ensure growth in grain production will be an immediate move towards stabilising the pricing of grain. This could be done in three ways. --The government should take on the role of building facilities to conserve water, to increase the area under irrigation and bolster precautionary measures against natural disasters. --The government should offer incentives for farmers to devote more time to farming through its agricultural policy. --The government should rely on town and village enterprises in a move to increase agricultural production. Finally, I would like to elaborate on stabilising grain prices. There are two ways this can be done: either the government fixes prices under a planned economy or the prices are left to market forces. Previous experience has shown that pricing under a market economy has not worked in China. Accordingly, stabilising grain prices through government mechanisms would not necessarily mean the country was returning to a planned economy.
