Angolans, as a whole, long for peace. Meanwhile, diplomatic sources following the talks say the proceedings continue today with the discussion of the final aspects on the formation of the new national police force. Yesterday, the sides agreed on specific issues. The sources stressed that the two sides regard as possible the approval of the general document on the second round of talks. It has been suggested that the delegations are committed to establishing a just peace for Angola, despite the military operations carried out by the Luanda regime with the backing of one of the observers to he peace process. This has created a great deal of confusion about Russian's role in the ongoing talks.
