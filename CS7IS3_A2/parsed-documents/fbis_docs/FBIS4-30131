FBIS4-30131 "dreas122__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-122-A Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Hata Cabinet Support Falls Below 50 Percent Hata Cabinet Support Falls Below 50 Percent OW2306121894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2306121894 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on 18-19 June to investigate such data as trends in the rate of public support for the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The results of the poll showed that the support rate for the cabinet fell to 48.2 percent, a drop of 3 percentage points over the previous month. This is the first time the cabinet support rate has fallen below the 50-percent mark since the formation of the coalition government last summer. The percentage of poll respondents who said they did not support the cabinet rose to 36.9 percent, a rise of 3 percentage points over the previous month. Apparently, the fragility of the current administration, which lacks stability in carrying out its policies, has accounted for the drop in its support rate. For example, 46 percent of non-supporters said they did not support the administration because "it lacks stability." Although its support rate is still high in comparison with those marked by past administrations during the days of Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] rule, the Hata administration, which runs a minority government, is expected to face a severe test in managing government affairs as the current Diet session approaches its final rounds. On the other hand, however, the support rate for the LDP -- which has made firm its plan to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration and is stepping up its moves toward overthrowing the administration -- dropped to 23.2 percent, the lowest support rate recorded ever since the party was established. Thus, the party has so far failed to gain public support for its strategies. The support rate for the Hata administration was 51.6 percent in a poll conducted last month immediately following the inauguration of the administration. This is the fourth highest in Japanese history among support rates marked by an administration immediately after inauguration. Although the latest support rate for the Hata administration dropped slightly from last month, it is still higher than the highest support rates marked by past LDP administrations under former Prime Ministers Takeo Miki, Masayoshi Ohira, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku Sato. Among supporters of the Hata administration, 37 percent said they supported the administration because "it is better than past LDP administrations"; 32 percent said they supported it because "it is likely to do something new"; and 28 percent said they supported it because "it is eager to achieve political and economic reform." As reasons for their not supporting the Hata administration, 36 percent of the non-supporters cited a "lack of stability." Another 36 percent said they did not support the administration because "the prime minister does not have real power." Still another 36 percent said they did not support the administration because "it seems to be unable to get anything done at all." Among male respondents to the poll, 49 percent, or nearly the same percentage as last month, expressed support for the Hata administration. However, the support rate among female respondents fell to 47 percent, a drop in 6 percentage points over last month. Among respondents in their 30's, 46 percent expressed support for the Hata administration, while 43 percent of those in their 40's expressed support. In either case, the support rate dropped by a noticeable 7-8 percentage points over the previous month. Regarding support rates for political parties, 23 percent of the respondents expressed support for the LDP, 11 percent for Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 9 percent for the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and 4 percent for the Japan New Party [JNP]. For the last three months, the LDP's support rate has increased slightly, but in the latest poll it dropped by 3 percentage points over last month, falling below the previous record low of 23.7 percent marked in a poll conducted last February. The support rates for the SDPJ and the JNP increased slightly, while that of Shinseito remained at the same level as last month.
