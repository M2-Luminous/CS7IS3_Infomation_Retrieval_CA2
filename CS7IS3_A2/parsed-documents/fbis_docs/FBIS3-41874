Pakistan is the only country in the Islamic world that has acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. According to American experts, Iran is making serious efforts to manufacture nuclear weapons, but it may take eight to 10 years to succeed in this task. Besides, the Islamic countries are so rich with oil wealth that any one of them may become inclined to acquire nuclear weapons. The apprehensions in the minds of the United States and its allies reflect their thinking and logic. Pakistan has assured the Clinton administration in clear-cut terms that its nuclear program is meant only for peaceful energy purposes, that it does not have any intention of manufacturing nuclear weapons, and that it will adhere very strictly to its policy of not transferring nuclear technology to any other country. Despite this, the United States is not ready to trust these assurances. Beyond just Pakistan, it is also planning to take to task those Muslim countries that may attain nuclear capability within eight to 10 years, as well as those with the financial capacity to buy such weapons. This clearly shows that to establish world supremacy under the new world order, the United States is targeting Islamic countries by raising the specter of nuclear proliferation. Under one pretext or another, Iraq and Libya have already been U.S. targets. Other Islamic countries -- especially Pakistan and Iran -- should work out a common strategy to foil these American designs.
