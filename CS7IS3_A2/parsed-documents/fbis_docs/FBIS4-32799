It is believed that hundreds of thousands of people throughout the island will participate in this exercise, which is based on the UN plan to prevent catastrophes. [passage omitted] The goal of this exercise is to prepare the people and civil defense organizations for floods, earthquakes, heavy rains, and hurricanes. During the Meteor 94 exercise, the islanders will pretend to be bracing for and confronting a very big hurricane. The Cuban specialists have justified this exercise with numbers. In the past 200 years, the island has been hit by 90 hurricanes that have resulted in many dead and wounded and heavy material damage. [passage omitted] During the exercise the people will pretend to be bracing for a hurricane that has been baptized "Claudy." This hurricane will follow the same trajectory followed by "Gilbert," a hurricane that hit Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in 1988. [passage omitted] Meteor 94 is designed to alert people to this type of catastrophe and update civil defense mechanisms, as well as to establish the role of the media in such a situation. The goal is to create a safer world as the year 2000 approaches.
