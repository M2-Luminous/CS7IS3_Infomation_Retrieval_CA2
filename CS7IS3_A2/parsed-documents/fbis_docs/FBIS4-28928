The radio said that the dove camp, especially former U.S. high-ranking officials and former U.S. generals who were involved in the policy toward North Korea for a rather long period and who, staying in South Korea, frequently contacted North Korea repeatedly advised Washington to ponder over the matter, saying it is a mistake if it thought "sanctions" or "military response" against North Korea would be effective. The radio quoted them as saying the United States does not know North Korea yet and, particularly, how bold and decisive supreme commander Kim Chong-il is. Suffice it to recall the situation on the Korean peninsula which abruptly took a critical turn in March last year, they said. The radio quoted them as stressing that the U.S. must know well the preparedness of the North Korean Army equipped with modern weapons and well trained for action. Not a few figures in the United States hold that, no matter how important the "nuclear issue" may be, the United States must open the door for dialogue to North Korea once again before taking "sanctions" and "military countermeasure", the radio said.
