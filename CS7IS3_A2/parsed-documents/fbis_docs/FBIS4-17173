A law to this effect has been adopted by the republican parliament. While upgrading Adygey to the level of a state language and giving it state support, the legislative assembly at the same time did not downgrade Russian or discredit it. It did not discriminate against the Russian-speaking residents of the republic in any way. "Knowledge or lack of knowledge of a language does not provide sufficient grounds for any restriction of the rights of the citizens of the Republic of Adygeya", stipulates one of the opening articles of the law.
