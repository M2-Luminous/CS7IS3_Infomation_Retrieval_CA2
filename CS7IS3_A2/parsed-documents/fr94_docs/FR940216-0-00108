FR940216-0-00108 FR940216-0-00010 Several commenters stated that independent sampling and testing will not be a successful deterrent to willful cheating, because a cheater can buy off its ``independent'' laboratory. While this type of fraud is always possible, EPA believes it is considerably more difficult for a refiner or importer intent on cheating to falsify reports when a second company has to be brought into the conspiracy. Given the consequences if caught, independent laboratories are unlikely to collaborate with a refiner or importer to falsify reports to EPA. False reporting by a refiner, importer, or independent laboratory would constitute a criminal violation under 18 U.S.C. section 1001, subject to monetary penalties and imprisonment, and EPA would expect to seek vigorous prosecution of such a case. In addition, the final rule provides that any laboratory that fails to comply with the requirements of the rule is subject to debarment or suspension, i.e., the company that operates the laboratory would be made ineligible for any government contracts, and would be precluded from participating in the reformulated gasoline program. Another criticism made of the independent sampling and testing provision is the inconsistency with the requirements for conventional gasoline, where independent sampling and testing is not required. EPA considered requiring independent sampling and testing for conventional gasoline, but decided to treat conventional and reformulated gasoline differently in this regard. EPA believes the profit incentive for cheating is less for a producer of conventional gasoline than for a producer of reformulated gasoline. Conventional gasoline does not require the new and costly refining procedures necessary for reformulated gasoline, and will not be sold at reformulated gasoline's price. In contrast to reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline is subject to neither time and place of use restrictions nor to per-gallon maximums and minimums. Moreover, an enforcement program for reformulated gasoline that is more strict than for conventional gasoline is appropriate given the greater air quality concerns in the areas slated to receive reformulated gasoline. EPA considered enforcement approaches to verifying refiner and importer test results for conventional gasoline that are less burdensome than independent sampling and testing, such as the approaches that were suggested by the reformulated gasoline commenters and are discussed below. These middle-ground approaches were rejected for the same reasons they were rejected for the reformulated gasoline program_they simply would not be effective as test verification mechanisms.
