Haris Silajdzic said the following about their activities and the results achieved in Vienna where the Bosnian delegation held talks with a Croat delegation; and in Geneva, where a ministerial conference of the international Contact Group for Bosnia-Herzegovina was held: [Begin Silajdzic recording] Regarding the implementation of the [Bosnian-Croat] agreement, I believe collective efforts have to be made; this cannot be done only through work of the government and a certain number of people. We all must participate to neutralize the consequences of the conflict. Most difficult will be returning people to their homes. I repeat, a collective effort is needed to execute that part of the job. Regarding the [Geneva] communique I believe President Izetbegovic has analyzed its positive and negative sides in great detail. One could underline the problem of the continuation of the talks and the problem of guarantees. I think the international community has not committed itself regarding the continuation of the talks and the guarantees. It did set up some coordinates and a basic concept, but the obligations stemming from all this for the international community are not clear. The communique contains general clauses saying UN Security Council resolution should be respected. This is clear without the communique, but they are not being respected. The main question is: How will this round of negotiations, which we are entering with best intentions and a desire to resolve the question peacefully, differ from the previous one? What are we talking about here? Agreements have been reached before, but there were no instruments to implement them [words indistinct] We ask the question: If the aggressor does not join the talks -- they are now making it conditional on the lifting of the sanctions -- what will the international community do if they stick to this position? We cannot allow the status quo to continue -- which is what the aggressor wants to achieve -- on the territories conquered by force. The international community still does not have answers to this, nor adequate measures. And another question is: What happens if we reach an agreement, but the aggressor does not want to observe it? What happens then? There is no answer to this either. The third question is the question of guarantees we had raised before, in particular at assembly sessions. What guarantees do we have that Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again become the victim of aggression, an invasion from Serbia and Montenegro? That Bosnia-Herzegovina will not again be a scene of new confrontations? We want international guarantees regarding this issue. There is no answer to any of this. We have their assurances, but no guarantees. The problem is in the credibility of the international community, the credibility whose roots have been to a large extent damaged. The question now arises: If the international community cannot resolve the question of respecting the Gorazde 3 km exclusion zone, how can it then resolve the global question of Bosnia-Herzegovina? We have not got an answer to this. We have been told the international community is working on it. Talks about this are under way, but no decision on this has yet been made. [end recording]
