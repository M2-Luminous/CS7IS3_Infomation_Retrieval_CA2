Both sides expressed the view that the present government has finally changed over to an antisocial stance. After the meeting, Krustyu Petkov stated that since the Berov cabinet is illegitimate and it is impossible to conduct a serious dialogue with it, he will resort to an unusual approach for our country, namely, for the trade unions and employers to hold bilateral talks on topical problems. He said that tomorrow it is likely that the two sides -- the KNSB and BSK -- will sign a document in which they will call upon other social partners to join them. This afternoon the KNSB Executive Committee held a session to discuss the draft project that the Council of Ministers has submitted for compensating incomes during the second quarter that, in his words, was like throwing dust in the eyes of the trade unions and the discontented population. During the next few days, the KNSB will also discuss specific forms for applying trade union pressure, including boycotting the payment of bills for thermal and electric power, with the aim of unblocking the accord reached on income policy from the beginning of the year.
