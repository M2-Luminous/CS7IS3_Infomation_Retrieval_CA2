Party Officials' Attitudes In anticipation of the congress, the 19 April Athens daily TA NEA published a commentary by Yiannis Politis characterizing the attitudes of various ND officials. ND Vice President Yiannis Varvitsiotis, Politis wrote, will be ND leader Miltiadhis Evert's "most faithful Supporter" and will advocate party unity. Another ND official, Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, is accusing Evert of engineering the Varvitsiotis vice presidency without previous consultation and of ignoring the party's statutes. For his part, Stefanos Manos states that "he will never undermine Evert or participate in plots against him," despite the fact that relations between the two have never been good, according to Politis. Manos, Politis commented, makes no secret of his ambition to become party leader but has confided to friends that "he can wait as long as necessary, given that leaders are no longer permanent." Evert's ideological opponent in the party is Andreas Andrianopoulos, Politis continued. While Andrianopoulos knows that his "neoliberal" positions have little resonance within the party, he nevertheless wishes to "preserve them for the future" after it becomes clear that "Statism has been overtaken." Poll on ND The 21 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the results of a 15-16 April poll conducted by the MARTEL organization in the Greater Athens area among 800 individuals. Poll results showed that when queried on what the ND should be as a party after the congress, 27.2 percent stated that it should be "from somewhat to completely similar" to the 1990-93 period, while a majority of 66.2 percent said that it should be "totally different." Some 6.6 percent did not know or did not answer. Profile of Party "Elite" Yiannis Mavris comments on the results of a January-April 1993 poll on the ND's profile commissioned by the "Flash" radio station and conducted among high government and party officials of the 1981-1993 period. Of the 125 respondents, 54 (43.2 percent) were members of the ND. Their answers were published in the 23 April I KATHIMERINI. Poll data revealed that the average age of the ND leadership "elite" is 48. Some 59 percent of these officials have a public school education, and the rest come from private institutions. According to Mavris, this differentiates Greece from other West Europe countries, where political "elites" are shaped by "compartmented and very specific school mechanisms." Some 84 percent either lived or studied abroad. A total of 32 percent have a doctoral degree and 30 percent hold a graduate degree. Some 38 percent studied in Great Britain, 17 percent in the United States, and 14 percent in France. In general, Mavris continues, the ND "elites" have not entered politics due to family tradition, since 72 percent stated they have no relatives in politics. Many officials entered politics through youth party organizations (31 percent), with 26 percent reporting they entered politics before the age of 25. However, 33 percent said they entered politics after they were 40. It should be noted that 39 percent--compared to 16 percent for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)--held a position in the private sector before entering politics. The poll asked officials to positions themselves on the ideological-- political spectrum. The great majority (63.6 percent) declared themselves "liberals," 18.2 percent said they are "neoliberals," 2.3 percent described themselves as "conservatives," 11.4 percent said they believe in "other ideologies," and 4.5 percent said they are "social democrats." Respondents were given three choices when asked to state their preference for other parties worldwide. Some 60 percent said they feel closest to the U.S. Democratic Party, 52.5 percent to the British Conservative Party, 50 percent to the German Christian Democrats, 35 percent to the U.S. Republican Party, 20 percent to the German Social Democrats, and 12.5 percent to France's Gaullists. Andrianopoulos Dissents According to Yiannis Politis writing in the 26 April TA NEA, Andreas Andrianopoulos strongly dissented from the congress' decisions to reject neoliberalism as a party tendency. While Evert is cited as saying that party officials are henceforth duty bound to respect the decisions of the congress and that ideological dissenters essentially put themselves "outside the party," Andriansopoulos stated on 25 April that he "never made a secret of his opinions" and charged that developments in the congress "risk opening the way for dangerous new party formations." Politis noted, however, that according to his information Andrianopoulos will make no move before the European Parliament elections, which will test the popularity of the ND's ideology. An interview with Andriansopoulos by Takis Mikhas appeared in the 21 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Andrianopoulos said he did not agree with the ND's insistence on "consensus," noting that the "consensus" the ND accepts means that "we are all traveling in the same train, whose route, however, is determined by the government." "Consensus" on the economy, Ansdrianopoulos continued, means agreeing with the government that funds must be collected to plug the deficit while ignoring ballooning governmenst expenditures. In foreign policy, Andrianopoulos said that he disagrees with the ND's approval of the government's policy on "national Issues," despite Evert's statement that dissent is almost equal to "treason." Never before in recent Greek history, Andrianopoulos charged, has Greece been so isolated in the Balkans, Europe, and the world, first because of Athens' pro-Serbian stance and secondly because of what is interpreted as an inimical Greek attitude on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Speaking on the government--imposed, ND--approved embargo on the FYROM, Andrianopoulos termed the measure "catastrophic" and predicted it will lead to an "impasse." Evert Statement Stirs Party Tensions In the 28 April TA NEA, Politis reports that new tensions arose within the ND following Evert's 27 April statement on SKY radio that the ND is not yet ready to assume the reins of government by demanding new elections, even if the party makes a strong showing in the Euroelections. Evert's rationale, Politis notes, is that the ND must first prepare itself to deal efficiently with the problems the country faces. In a harsh reaction to the statement, ND officials who support former Prime Minister Mitsotakis charged that it "fails to provide a vision and a goal" for Euroelection voters. Congress Assessed Katerina Koletsi drew conclusions from the ND congress in a 28 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA commentary. Evert's goal for the congress, she wrote, was to change "Mitsotakis' ND" into his own party, which harkens back to its "Karamanlist" past. While Evert achieved his goal at the congress, Koletsi continued, he had not foreseen that Mitsotakis and his large bloc of supporters, encouraged by ND official Dora Bakoyanniis strong showing, would criticize him, that Andrianopoulos would react so negatively to the rule forbidding neoliberalism as party ideology, that while stating he is not a neoliberal, Manos would disagree with Evert's decisions, and that Yiorgos Souflias would express his concern about the party's course in the coming months. While at the three-day congress "forces were registered, fronts determined, foes revealed, alliances concluded, and the ND assumed the Evert identity," the "absence of political contact between party officials" also became evident, Koletsi said. The party, she concluded, is "walking on a tightrope, united only in appearance, a unity that will endure only until the final confrontation."
