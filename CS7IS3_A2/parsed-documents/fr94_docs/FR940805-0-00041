ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is amending its regulations concerning the carriage and handling of explosives. These amendments are necessary because the United States has adopted a new system for classifying and labeling explosives. These amendments will align terminology in existing Coast Guard regulations with that used in the new system and update references to address the new system. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR Mark O'Malley, Project Manager, Port Safety and Security Division, and Mr. Stephen H. Barber, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Regulatory History On April 8, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Classifying and Handling Class 1 (Explosive) Materials in the Federal Register (59 FR 16783). The Coast Guard received no letters commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and none was held. Background and Purpose On December 21, 1990, the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) published a final rule revising the Hazardous Material Regulations contained in 49 CFR parts 171 through 180 (December 21, 1990; 55 FR 55402). This final rule also revised the requirements previously found in 46 CFR part 146 concerning the transportation of military explosives by vessel and relocated them in 49 CFR part 176. Under this final rule, there is only one regulatory system common to all explosives. Therefore, the shipment of military explosives by vessel now must comply with the requirements of 49 CFR part 176. Furthermore, the old classification system for explosives was replaced by the United Nations system. These comprehensive rules for commercial and other explosives treat military explosives as belonging to Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 of Class 1 (explosive) materials, as defined in 49 CFR 173.50. Under the old system, military explosives were categorized as Class A, B, or C. [For a comparison of old versus new classification schemes, see 49 CFR 173.53.] Sections 78.80&hyph;10 and 97.70&hyph;10 of 46 CFR are being revised to align with the more recently revised 49 CFR 176.78. Section 176.78 of 49 CFR was revised to provide for the use of a power operated truck designated EE or EX to handle Class 1 (explosive) materials or other cargo in an area near Class 1 (explosive) materials on board a vessel. Additionally, paragraph (d) of 46 CFR 176.78 states that a power operated truck designated LPS, GS, D, or DS may be used under conditions acceptable to the Captain of the Port (COTP) rather than requiring Commandant approval. These sections are being revised to consolidate current regulations for the use of power operated vehicles on board vessels transporting hazardous materials. Furthermore, on January 29, 1991, after consultation with the Coast Guard, RSPA published a final rulemaking revoking 46 CFR part 146 (January 29, 1991; 56 FR 3334). The purpose of this rulemaking is to update terminology and cross-references throughout Coast Guard regulations to reflect this new classification system. Discussion of Comments and Changes
