This is one of the few development programs the military can undertake in view of the tight budget (27 billion korunas [Kc]). It will cost Kc800 million to establish the rapid deployment force of 3,000 men (they will begin to fulfill their tasks on 1 July). Colonel Karel Hejzek, of the General Staff, who has been entrusted with establishing the brigade, rejects the view that this ambitious project, like the grandiose but unprepared plans to professionalize the Federal Army, will also fail. He maintains, among other things, that by yesterday, when the recruitment centers closed, 600 reserve soldiers had signed up for the rapid deployment force. Nevertheless, he envisages that, after the medical examinations and psychological and physical tests, one-third of the men will be rejected. "We are not an institute for fallen aristocrats," says the colonel. "We do not intend to moderate the strict selection criteria, even if we have to begin training with less than the full complement of personnel in the units." Until now, two-thirds of the planned number of men have been serving in the brigade. However, if Col. Hejzek's group were to apply the standards governing the selection and training of the elite U.S. Army units, the public would probably accuse it of tyrannizing people. "I am disappointed by the physical prowess of the recruits that have joined up," admits the colonel. The Army would like to pay the professionals in the rapid deployment force well and also offer them language and specialist training. The one thing that worries the experts is the reaction of the soldiers recruited for further service to the standard of accommodation, which does not even reach the normal standard. There are also problems with apartments for the families of career soldiers. Because of this situation, very capable professionals are refusing to move to the elite brigade's garrisons.
