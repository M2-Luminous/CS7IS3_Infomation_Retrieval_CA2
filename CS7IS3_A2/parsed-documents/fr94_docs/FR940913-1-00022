FR940913-1-00022 FR940913-1-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [IL63&hyph;1&hyph;5716b; FRL&hyph;5071&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Illinois AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to approve Illinois' 1990 base year ozone precursor emissions inventory for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). The emissions inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions. The Illinois ozone nonattainment areas covered by the ozone emissions inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Chicago, Metro-East St. Louis, and Jersey County. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision request without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and the public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. A second comment period on this action will not be held. Parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before October 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR18-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the State submittal and USEPA's analysis of it are available for inspection at: Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR18-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edward Doty, Environmental Scientist, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR18-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6057.
