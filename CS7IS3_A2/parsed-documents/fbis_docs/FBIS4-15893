For that purpose, not only are negotiations conducted with the CIS countries on the fair division of the former Union's fleet, but possibilities are also sought to purchase, build, and charter vessels. A shipping company -- "Moldova Shipping Company" -- was recently created there. It already has seven vessels at its disposal: three passenger ships, three freight vessels, and a barge. All of them have been chartered from Romanian ship owners and are, for the time being, kept in the Romanian port of Constanta. However, in the near future, our neighbors will start building a port on the Danube, where the Moldovan territory is adjacent to the river. It looks like the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company will have yet another competitor. At any rate, it will take care of the cargo from Moldova itself.
