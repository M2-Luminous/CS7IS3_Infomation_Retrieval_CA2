The third achievement involves our diplomatic activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries have expanded and its prestige and position in the international arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable international situation to build and defend the fatherland. The seventh national party congress asserted Vietnam's foreign policy of firmly maintaining peace, expanding the relations of friendship and cooperation, creating favorable international conditions for the cause of national construction and defense, and positively contributing to the world people's common struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for peace, independence, and progress. The party Central Committee's third plenum concretized and seriously implemented this policy against the background of new changes in the region and the world and following the seventh national party congress. We positively expanded our diplomatic activities and scored very significant achievements. We restored normal relations with the People's Republic of China and developed the relations of friendship and cooperation with the country a further step. We strengthened and enhanced the special solidarity with the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord on Cambodia. We struggled for its serious implementation, established friendly and neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and promoted and opened up a new stage of cooperation and friendship with ASEAN and its organizations. We also expanded relations with other countries in the Asia-Pacific Region, maintained and developed the existing relations of cooperation with the Russian Federation and states of the former Soviet Union, and East European countries. We preserved and developed our traditional relations with Cuba, India, and the DPRK; continued to support the legitimate causes of the Palestinian, Asian, and South African peoples; and expanded relations with developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. We positively contributed to the consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a number of new industrial countries. We restored normal relations with international financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the struggle for the lifting of the U.S. embargo and for normalizing relations with the United States. II. Shortcomings and Newly Arising Problems 1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly developed, material-technical bases are very few, the accumulations attained from the internal economy are minimal, and investment and development are not great enough. Productivity and economic results are low, although our economic growth is acceptable. Our production capability, which is in the stage of developing for mobilization in the days ahead, is not up to par. This will affect adversely economic growth in the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation is not consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due, are too immense to be settled because our annual export values are still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units, and leading and managerial cadres are not maintaining firmly their awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby causing great losses to public property while lavish spending is prevalent. It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in production and circulation. The state-run business sector missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas, and this allowed a group of private traders to exploit these opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the private economy. We have difficulties in production development and experience a lack of good management and guidance. Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent. We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many negative sides. Our legal system is not complete while its implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance with labor is not been strictly observed. 2. Cultural and Social Domains Many great and urgent issues are still not resolved, although we scored some achievements in these domains. Unemployment, especially for youth of working age, is still the pressing issue and is one of the fundamental factors causing negative practices in our society. Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through illegal business activities. At the same time, many families who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute. Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and teachers provide poor training and education service, which is causing great public concern. Education management cadres at all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual education expenses are too high, which affects the education of children from poor families. Funding for scientific and technological research is higher than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest in this field. Different scientific groups have not been formed. The organic [huwux cow] relationship among scientific research establishments, training institutions, and production units has not been established. The import of foreign technologies has been poorly managed and led to the import of outdated technologies and equipment at high prices. This causes long-term negative effects for the nation. The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great concern. The lifestyle of running after money, unhealthy interests, bad customary habits, and superstitions is on the increase. Poisonous and dangerous cultural products are readily available in the market. Incorrect tendencies -- such as the rejection of our revolution's achievements and our revolutionary culture and arts, the detachment of arts from the party's political line, the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the spread of bad foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles -- are appearing in creative, logical, and critical works. These mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the fourth plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they slowly are improving. Guidance by party organs and the state management over the cultural and arts work is weak. Our public health service is not meeting the minimum requirements of society. Grassroots health care is weak. Hospitals are ill- equipped and provide low standards of service and care. The increase in population is still higher than 2.2 percent. This high rate obstructs socioeconomic development, improvements to life, and affects the development of our race. Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices tend to increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling, prostitution, and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are prevalent, raising public indignation, and greatly affecting the people's confidence in the party and state. 3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and bulky and its management method and work attitudes slowly are being renovated. The leadership quality and result of many party committees are still low. They even sidestep the party line in some places. Cadre-related work is a weak chain. The cadre contingent, generally speaking, is not up to its duties or requirements. In many places, difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when able cadres are needed for appointment to key leading positions. There are not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to take care of party work, state management, production and business, external economic relations, religion, ethnic communities, and women-related work. The planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres are not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper attention to checking the observation of party regulations, lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow and lacks efficiency. The evil practices of authoritarianism, oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are prevalent in many places. The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still facing difficulties in the contents of work and methods. The number of cadres working in mass organizations is not stable. They lack enthusiasm about their work and they are not given appropriate care, training, and benefits. Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among our party cadres and people. They still have a low level of awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile forces, who always wish to scrap the party and socialism from our country. Some party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints or activities that are aimed at stirring up social disorder. Others have deviated seriously from the socialist path, or are even inclined to choose another path. Our ideological and theoretical work is still slow, is not sharp enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond convincingly to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres, including core leaders, are still sluggish when it comes to self-education. They lack efforts to improve one's own character and understanding. Disunity among cadres at some party organizations is also very serious. III. Generalizations Despite the shortcomings we need to overcome, our past important achievements are creating favorable conditions for the country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the stage of industrialization and modernization for our country. These conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend, both material and spiritual, economic, politic, social, and cultural, and both domestic and overseas. The reality of past years allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of our party on renovation were correct; the steps taken appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses are being absorbed in the life of our people. Reviewing reality of renovation brings up many useful lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first experiences learned through the renovation process and pointed out by the seventh party congress need to be developed and applied to our current reality. Those were the lessons of maintaining firmly the socialist path during the renovation process, combining the determination of the revolutionary principles and strategies with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the changes. There were also the lessons of the necessity to renovate comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply appropriate steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons learned were to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and the state management role during the process of developing a multisector merchandise economy and socialist democracy as well as the need for timely exposure and handling problems, which arise during the renovation process. We also need to pay appropriate attention to the task of reviewing reality and continuously completing and perfecting the theories to build the socialist path of our country. Renovation is a difficult process which is unprecedented, but we have been bravely searching, learning, and achieving important progress. The most basic, decisive factor was the determination of our party to retain its leadership position; to reject pluralism and a multiparty political system; to honor the spirit of independence, self-determination, and innovation; and to follow correct lines and policies, which are in good accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam. Our party has also been able to develop the total strength of the great all-people solidarity block and expand international cooperation. The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for the socialist society our people are building. The congress also pointed out seven basic directions to make these characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized into practical directives. The building of the socialism, however, is still new to us. It requires from us massive energy to research, to study, and to discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to figure out the concrete model for each domain of economy, politics, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh Thought, especially Leninist thoughts on a new economic policy and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps which suit our concrete historical circumstances and which will help our country advance firmly on the socialist path.
