The Bulgarian delegation and the creditors reached an agreement consistent with the nation's short and medium- term interests, he said. The agreement provides for rescheduling the Bulgarian debt over 11 years, with a seven-year grace period. It is a little better than earlier ones and has a key role in the implementation of international financial institutions' financial support programme and for the settlement of the Bulgarian debt to private creditor banks, the official said. The finalization of the deal with Bulgaria's private creditors (the London Club) began in Frankfurt this week, Kostov recalled. The meeting in Frankfurt was attended by 63, or actually all German banks, he said. At this time debt-for-equity swaps cannot be discussed, Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev told the same show. The government is expected to consider an ordinance Karabashev is sponsoring regulating the use of foreign-debt bonds in privatization. The details will most likely be discussed at a meeting next Thursday, he said. The agreement with the International Monetary Fund on April 11 to support Bulgaria's economic reform programme includes a Systemic Transformation Facility that would help the government effect mass privatization, close down money-losers and streamline state-run companies, said Karabashev.
