FR940516-2-00108 FR940516-2-00072 The NASD responds that it has identified situations in which a member's ownership of the issuer's debt or non-voting equity results in the absence of an arm's-length bargaining relationship, potentially compromising due diligence, disclosure, and pricing. Furthermore, the NASD disagrees that the concept of control in Schedule E is sufficiently broad to cover a situation where an underwriter might obtain practical control through holding a substantial amount of debt securities with ``equity-type control powers.'' The NASD is not aware of any situations in which the NASD staff has based a determination of ``control'' on debt ownership, nor does it believe it can distinguish debt securities with ``equity-type control powers.'' The SIA argues further that disclosure in the offering document of a significant relationship between the issuer and the underwriter should be sufficient to address such potential conflicts of interest. The NASD responds that it relies on a number of standards of fair practice, including disclosure, to ensure the independence of members participating in offerings. The NASD does not believe that disclosure of a conflict, by itself, is sufficient to address the effects to the conflict. The SIA also notes that concerns about conflicts arising from an underwriter's ownership of issuers' debt and non-voting equity arose as a result of the prevalence of leveraged buy-outs and bridge loans in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The SIA points out that these transactions are no longer prevalent, and argues that the rule change should be postponed until these transactions again become prevalent. The NASD, however, believes that a member's debt or non-voting equity interest in an issuer can present a conflict regardless of the structure of the transaction. The NASD notes that recently, companies once subject to leveraged buy-outs are now de-leveraging by issuing equity. In these situations, the member, who served as financial advisor and acquired subordinated debt in the buy-out, may now serve as lead manager of the equity offering. The NASD believes that these situations raise potential conflicts that warrant the protections of Schedule E. Finally, the SIA argues that the 10% member ownership threshold for determining whether there is a potential conflict should not apply to the member's holdings in an individual class of securities but rather, to the member's combined securities holdings in the issuer. 11 For example, under the SIA's approach, a member with a 10% interest in the issuer's subordinated debt would not have a conflict of interest if its interest in all other classes of the issuer's securities including voting and non-voting equity, does not rise to the 10% threshold. The NASD responds that it considered this approach but determined that the potential conflict of interest occurs in connection with significant ownership of securities within an individual class. 11 The SIA also argues that the aggregation standard for measuring ownership for a conflict of interest is more strict than that for measuring control under the definition of affiliation. The NASD responds that the standards are in fact the same: the NASD will aggregate the firm's trading and proprietary accounts, the proprietary accounts of any associated persons or employees, and any accounts over which members or associated persons or employees exercise beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13(d)(3) under the Act. V. Discussion The Commission has considered the above comments and has determined to approve the NASD's proposed rule change. The Commission recognizes the NASD's obligation to ensure the objectivity and independence of members participating in a securities offering. Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that a member's holdings of subordinated debt or non-voting equity could influence the independence of the member's pricing and due diligence functions in a subsequent offering of the issuer's securities. The Commission believes that the absence of an arms-length bargaining relationship in these transactions potentially compromises due diligence, disclosure, and pricing. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to extend the requirements of Schedule E to situations in which a member participating in a public offering owns debt or non-voting equity of the issuer. 12 The Commission does not believe that disclosure of the member's interest in the issuer, by itself, is sufficient to address the potential conflict of interest that arises when a member holds a substantial interest in the debt or non-voting equity of an issuer. Rather, the Commission believes that the additional protections provided under Schedule E_including a pricing opinion and due diligence by a qualified independent underwriter_are necessary to address these potential conflicts. 12 The Commission also recognizes that the potential conflict of interest that arises occurs in connection with the member's interest in an individual class of securities. The Commission thus believes that it is appropriate to apply the 10% member ownership threshold for determining whether there is a potential conflict to the member's holdings in an individual class of securities, rather than to the member's combined securities holdings in the issuer. Finally, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to provide an exception from the QIU pricing requirements of Schedule E in recapitalizations or restructurings for members who are otherwise subject to Schedule E but are acting solely as financial advisors. The Commission understands that in these transactions, the member acting as financial advisor would not be participating in the pricing opinion. Consequently, it appears that in recapitalizations or retructurings in which the conflicted financial advisor does not participate in the pricing of the offering, an exception from the Schedule E qualified independent underwriter pricing opinion would not reduce investor protections. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. 13 Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the NASD's rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with person engaged in regulating, clearing and settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change will prevent manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and otherwise protect the public interest in connection with offerings in which a member and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates may have a conflict of interest with the issuer. 13 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3(b)(6). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;46 be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegated authority. 14 14 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
