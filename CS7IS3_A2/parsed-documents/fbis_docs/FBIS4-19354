[Catroga] The 1995 budget's basic guideline is the continuation of the aim of budgetary consolidation. In 1995 we wish to do better than in 1994, within the context of concern to achieve a sound course for public finances. [EXPRESSO] But do the Revised Convergence Program (PCR) figures still stand? [Catroga] That is the goal for now and for 1995. In the Portuguese convergence program, the target for the deficit is around 5 percent. [EXPRESSO] In the state budget, the average for 1995-96 is around 4.75 to 5 percent.... [Catroga] We succeeded in moving from a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 1985 to 3.3 percent in 1992. Hence we will certainly be able to achieve the budgetary consolidation aims in the medium term, with the contribution of economic recovery, success in the struggle against tax evasion, and success in the constant improvement of the tax authorities' efficiency. For next year, we hope that the economic recovery will accelerate, in line with the European economies' prospects for 1995. [EXPRESSO] "Will accelerate...." Do you mean that you now believe in an economic recovery in 1994? [Catroga] I have said that the main aim of economic policy for 1994 and 1995 is the creation of conditions for a sustained and noninflationary economic recovery. Three or four months ago, I said that there were hopes and some signs. I now emphasize: There are very positive signs. [EXPRESSO] What are they? [Catroga] In the first place, the indicators of confidence. I have just received a Confederation of Portuguese Industry survey of manufacturing industry that shows a significant improvement in the indicators of confidence, enterprises' order books, and employers' expectations of new investments. If we compare the levels of operating capacity in October 1993 with the figures available in January 1994, we will see that there was an increase of around 4 percent in the rate of use of production capacity. If we analyze the industrial production indexes, we find that since July there has been some change for the better. There are also positive signs in the tourism sector: Tourist demand for this year has increased substantially. There are also some positive signs in the sphere of agriculture: This year, for the first time in many years, we have favorable weather conditions that have made it possible to restore the water level in dams and for spring crops to grow normally. [EXPRESSO] But there are also unfavorable signs.... [Catroga] There are, such as, for instance, the consumption of cement and steel in the first two months of 1994. This is linked to the normal lag in the construction sector's reaction to the economic cycle -- especially in the civil construction sector. In any event, there are positive signs from the external demand side, and signs in the European economies that are also a mixture of encouragement and apprehension: Encouragement, because the indicators at the European level show a strengthening of confidence over the past four months; apprehension in view of the weakness of the recovery of some locomotive economies (such as the German economy) and the French and Spanish economies' uncertain trends. These are contradictory signs, as is characteristic, moreover, of a period of a change of trend. Because of all this, I believe that there will be a recovery. It will be slow and difficult, but it will happen. [EXPRESSO] Right now in 1994? [Catroga] In 1994, there should be some recovery, albeit insignificant. The level of economic activity is expected to rise gradually in the second half of this year, and more strongly in the course of 1995, in line with the European economies. [EXPRESSO] What will Portuguese economic growth be this year? [Catroga] The favorable and unfavorable external and internal factors do not yet enable us to draw conclusions for a revision of the macroeconomic scenario underlying the budget for 1994. So, right now, the government's goals are still the same.... [EXPRESSO] With respect to all the indicators? [Catroga] With respect to all the indicators. There are no figures as yet for undertaking a revision, so those indicators still seem possible. An economic recovery is taking shape that will be modest in 1994 and stronger in 1995. I have always said, and I repeat, that the recovery will be slow and difficult. [EXPRESSO] Do you still believe in the goal of a 5.5 percent inflation rate set in the state budget for this year? [Catroga] I believe that right now there are no grounds in this, as in the other macroeconomic variables, for changing the macroeconomic scenario projected in drafting the budget. The inflation target is difficult but not impossible. Moreover, the inflation rate has now fallen; it resumed its downward trend in December.... [EXPRESSO] In annual terms, yes, but not in monthly terms. [Catroga] In annual terms it is now 6.2 percent.... [EXPRESSO] But in monthly terms that trend is not confirmed. [Catroga] No, there are always month-to-month fluctuations, but there is a much more important factor (to which analysts do not always pay due attention) -- the trend in inflation in terms of comparable fluctuations in the nonnegotiable goods sector [sector dos bens nao transaccionaveis]. The nonnegotiable goods sector, which showed considerable resistance to the fall in inflation until November, clearly fell from December. From 8.8 percent in November, it then fell to 7.8 percent and 7.6 percent. Now this is a favorable factor. [EXPRESSO] There are economists who say that if the current monthly rate of growth of inflation -- around 0.7 percent -- persists, we will reach the end of the year with a rate close to 8 percent, and that we will succeed in reaching last year's inflation rate only by reducing it to 0.5 percent per month. [Catroga] It is always possible to devise several scenarios. The scenarios depend on the assumptions. Many of those analysts also did not believe that the government would achieve the goal of 6.5 percent in 1993, just as they did not believe that the 8.9 percent target in 1992 was attainable. I say that it is a difficult and challenging, but not impossible, target, and that it remains a goal of economic policy to continue the process of deflating the Portuguese economy within the framework of the targets set. [EXPRESSO] Let us turn to monetary policy and interest rates.... [Catroga] The other central banks' benchmark rates [taxas directoras] have gradually moved downward, and so the Bank of Portugal, using its powers to implement monetary policy, which it exercises independently, took the view that there are conditions for a fall in benchmark rates. I will be more specific: The Bank of Portugal's liquidity transfer rate [taxa de cedencia de liquidez] in real terms (that is, nominal rates minus inflation) was around 8.1 percent 31 March 1993, as against 8.6 percent in Spain. Today, the Bank of Portugal's benchmark rate in real terms is around 3.6 percent, and in Spain it is 2.8 percent.... [EXPRESSO] According to the prime minister, interest rates will fall another 2 percent. [Catroga] No. What the prime minister said was that in a scenario in which inflation falls to around 5 percent, and in which there is success in the policy of budgetary consolidation, in the wage restraint policy, and in the fight against inflation...with all these assumptions it is natural for benchmark rates to fall! That is what he said. [EXPRESSO] But some economists have said that the repetition of the "promise" of a fall in interest rates in official speeches has now brought the situation to such a pass that there is no longer room for maneuver.... [Catroga] Confusion between benchmark rates and credit market rates has become widespread. In the case of benchmark rates, the room for maneuver depends on the trend in inflation and the trend in the other banks' central benchmark rates. So it will be concluded on the basis of the trend in these two variables whether or not there is room for maneuver. We believe that the trend in the other European central banks' central benchmark rates is downward, and we believe that the tendency will be for the downward trend for the inflation rate to continue. Accordingly, and without prejudice to exchange rate targets, if these conditions are fulfilled, conditions for a sustained and gradual fall in interest rates will continue to exist. [EXPRESSO] Are you not worried that we have witnessed an upsurge in short-term interest rates? [Catroga] They are not benchmark rates, and we must not confuse erratic movements, which are sometimes the result of certain specific daily developments, with structural trends.... [EXPRESSO] And are you also not worried by the market's nervous reactions? There was, in fact, a nervous reaction to the prime minister's statements. Rates reached around 30 percent, and the Bank of Portugal spent almost 200 million contos [1 conto:1,000 escudos] in order to calm nerves. [Catroga] The Bank of Portugal has considerable reserves -- it has reserves totaling $20 billion -- and Portugal is one of the countries in the world with the best external liquidity positions (it is one of the countries with the highest cover ratios for import months [coeficiente de cobertura dos meses de importacao]), and so this does not worry the central bank or the government. If it is rational -- and in the medium term markets are rational and pay attention to "fundamentals" -- the market will have to pay attention to a sign of which I have just learned from REUTERS -- the good results of the implementation of the budget in the first quarter. This was a good sign! Another good sign is the effective wage restraint, which is occurring in this country as it has not occurred for many years, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. [EXPRESSO] In any event, the agitation on the market has a great deal to do with exchange rate policy and with some people's gambling on a possible devaluation of the escudo. [Catroga] The central bank can reduce its real benchmark rates and without prejudice to the aims of exchange rate stability. The macroeconomists are in the habit of saying that an exchange rate of balance is one that maintains an appropriate exchange rate that maintains equilibrium in the balance of payments in the long term. And my conclusion is that in fact the current exchange rate, following the adjustment which occurred last year, is a correct exchange rate, because -- employers assure me when I speak with them -- it has ceased to be cited by the real economy as a factor that affects Portuguese enterprises' competitiveness. [EXPRESSO] "Has ceased to be" because the escudo used to be too strong? [Catroga] What I say is that the exchange rate is no longer a factor affecting the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy and Portuguese enterprises. It is clear, as the prime minister has already stated, that exchange rate stability, contrary to what many fundamentalists also believe, does not mean exchange rate immutability. [EXPRESSO] Does rejecting "exchange rate immutability" mean having a flexible escudo instead of a strong escudo or a weak escudo? [Catroga] No. We must have an appropriate exchange rate, and today's exchange rate is appropriate to the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy and enterprises. [EXPRESSO] Which means that it used not to be.... [Catroga] Hmmmm.... I have not conducted a historical analysis. Europe [EXPRESSO] Portugal came closer to the Community average between 1986 and 1990 than between 1986 and 1992. That is, the fall in the period of recession was clearly noted, and it converged less than Spain between 1986 and 1992, but convergence now has a goal called Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). [Catroga] Portugal is committed to building EMU. We ratified the treaty on European union and believe that this project, which is a gradualist project, is important for galvanizing competitiveness in the European economy, but we also believe that EMU is not in itself a factor promoting European economic recovery on a sustained basis. As regards real convergence, Portugal has achieved significant progress. As compared with Spain, with respect to convergence, we were better in 1993 than in 1991, and we are much better than as compared with Greece; Greece has widened the gap. Between 1986 and 1992, our GDP rose from 52 percent of the European average to 60.7 percent. Moreover, the Community aid plan [Quadro Comunitario de Apoio] must be viewed in its true significance, within the framework of a Union's regional development policy, and it must also be explained that there are other, richer countries than Portugal, such as the Netherlands or Denmark, which receive higher per capita Community aid. In any event, the second Community aid plan will make possible, like the first, the reduction of regional inequalities. The Portuguese Government's medium term aim is to grow again at an average rate exceeding the Community average by 1 percent. [EXPRESSO] Starting from when? [Catroga] Starting from now, from the new Community aid plan, which starts in 1994 and will have greater impact from the second half of 1994. According to a European Commission estimate, the effect of this factor alone points to a growth of the Portuguese economy exceeding the Community average by 0.5 percent. [EXPRESSO] According to the Commission, the Twelve's growth forecast is 1.3 percent in 1994 and 2.1 percent in 1995. Will Portugal exceed this growth rate by that 0.5 percent margin? [Catroga] I believe so, in the medium term.... [EXPRESSO] In 1994 or 1995? [Catroga] I believe that we will exceed the Community average in 1995. [EXPRESSO] But not in 1994? [Catroga] In 1994, much depends on the European economy's performance. [EXPRESSO] Let us talk about the convergence criteria for EMU. [Catroga] As [European Commission Vice President] Leon Brittan stated in an interview published last weekend, I believe that these conclusions on the criteria are not yet properly founded in terms of a reassessment or otherwise. The criteria exist, we must be pragmatic, and they are the benchmarks for the economic policy targets. I must say that, as benchmarks, I do not believe that the main guidelines of economic policy would be substantially different with or without these convergence criteria. In my opinion, what is essential is the consolidation of a favorable trend with respect to all of them. [EXPRESSO] But in the case of the public debt, Portugal's trend has been clearly unfavorable. For a set target of 71 percent for this year, we already reached 70.2 percent in January, and February brought the 750 million [currency unspecified] foreign loan "bill...." [Catroga] Let us examine each of the convergence criteria. With respect to the trend in the inflation rate, I believe that we are on the right path. With respect to the public deficit criterion, the Portuguese economy has already shown through the trend from 1986 to 1992 (the public deficit, in terms of GDP, was just 3.3 percent of GDP in 1992, whereas in 1985-86 it was around 10 percent) that it is possible to have success in the process of budgetary consolidation. So 1993 must be viewed only as a point of discontinuity, and as I have already said, the strategy of budgetary consolidation is a settled policy of the government and the Finance Ministry, and we will resume the path of that sound course for public finances in 1994. In 1993, according to the latest figures at my disposal, Portugal stood at 7.1 percent. The provisional figure for Spain is 7.3 percent, but the latest figures at my disposal suggest a higher figure, after the inclusion of the so-called regional deficits. Italy is close to 10 percent, the United Kingdom stands at 8.7 percent, Greece at 17.5 percent, and Belgium at 7.2 percent. France stands at 5.5 percent. The figure I have for Germany is 4.2 percent, except that, according to what Helmut Schlesinger stated in Lisbon, it will rise to 7 percent if we take into account the deficit of the Treuhand -- the state agency overseeing the privatization measures in the former GDR. [EXPRESSO] There remains the public debt.... [Catroga] At the end of 1993, we had a ratio of 66.4 percent with respect to GDP. [EXPRESSO] At the end of January, it had risen by nearly 4 percent. Is the trend not the main thing? [Catroga] Certainly, but we are also going to reduce it, and we are close to the target, which is 60 percent. [EXPRESSO] Except that we have already been in the area of 64 percent.... [Catroga] Yes, but the indicator worsened in all the countries. Look, in Italy it went from 108 percent to 118 percent; in Germany it went from 44 percent to 49 percent, in France from 39 percent to 44 percent, in the Netherlands from 79 percent to 81 percent, in Belgium from 121 percent to 128 percent, and in Denmark from 68 percent to 80 percent. With respect to the fourth criterion -- long-term interest rates -- we are virtually there. Right now, the criterion is 7.6 percent, and we are already below 9 percent. [EXPRESSO] With all this, will the third stage of EMU really be in 1997? [Catroga] The view now shared within the Union is that the third stage will perhaps be not in 1997 but somewhere between 1997 and 1999. [passage omitted]
