FR940314-0-00029 FR940314-0-00005 The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Temporary Revision (TR) No. 61&hyph;6, dated March 15, 1993, and TR No. 61&hyph;7, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard Maintenance Manual (MM) P5186, applicable to Model 14RF&hyph;9 propellers; TR No. 61&hyph;6, dated April 8, 1993, and TR No. 61&hyph;7, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard MM P5199, applicable to Model 14RF&hyph;19 propellers; and TR No. 61&hyph;4, dated March 15, 1993, and TR No. 61&hyph;5, dated July 27, 1993, to Hamilton Standard MM P5189, applicable to Model 14RF&hyph;21 propellers. These TR's describe the new torquing procedures for torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts, and procedures for inspecting propeller hubs for cracks. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Hamilton Standard 14RF series propellers of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub. This AD requires an initial torque check of the propeller hub retaining nuts within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, the implementation of a new, more stringent hub retaining nut tightening procedure, and repetitive torque checks of the hub retaining nuts. If the torque checks of the hub retaining nuts do not meet the acceptance critieria of the applicable TR's during the initial or subsequent repetitive checks, then the propeller hub must be removed from service and inspected for cracks prior to return to service. Propeller hubs with crack indications must be removed from service and replaced with a serviceable propeller hub prior to further flight. The FAA's analysis indicates that 30 days will be sufficient to schedule the torque checks without adversely affecting flight safety. Subsequent to an acceptable initial torque check and the implementation of the new hub retaining nut tightening procedure, this AD requires a one-time entry in the propeller maintenance records that the new tightening procedure was incorporated. In addition, all future propeller installations should follow the new installation and hub retaining nut tightening procedure. The AD will thereafter require repetitive torque checks at intervals not to exceed 500 hours time in service since the last inspection. In addition, this AD requires repetitive visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation, and removal from service of propellers hubs found cracked or with undetermined leakage. These inspections must be performed at intervals not to exceed 70 hours time in service (TIS) since the last inspection, or at line checks, whichever occurs first. If the leakage is found to be caused by other than a leak in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly, the leakage may be due to a propeller hub crack and the propeller must be removed from service and replaced with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the applicable TR's to the MM's described previously. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;09.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
