Yushenkov told Interfax the meeting, which took place in the Pentagon on Tuesday and lasted an hour, had focused on the possibility of Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, seen as a preparatory stage for membership of the North Atlantic alliance. Perry "did not deny that the program provides for the future standardization of weapons according to NATO technology," Yushenkov said. He believes that, in view of this and since "the framework agreements were drawn up without our participation and do not conform to the status of Russia," the State Duma must protest against Russia's joining the program, despite the fact that most East European countries have either joined it or stated their intent to do so. But there was complete mutual understanding on the other two issues, the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the future ratification of the START-II treaty, Yushenkov said. It was also agreed that Perry would meet State Duma members during his end-of-March visit to Moscow.
