Speaking to this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam Peter Williams remarked that the aid pledge shows his government's regard for the economic performance of the government and people of Vietnam together with the policies of economic renovation over the past few years. He stressed the excellent development of bilateral relations following the highly successful UK visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet last July. "The substantial international assistance the Vietnam has enlisted in the recent donor conference for Vietnam can help the country move forward to further successes in the future," said the ambassador. It is known that UK is the second biggest donor after only Japan at the said Paris conference. Peter Williams further said that the international community's strong support to Vietnam stems from their belief in the country's potential for economic development and their positive evaluation of the results of the Vietnamese Government's current economic reforms.
