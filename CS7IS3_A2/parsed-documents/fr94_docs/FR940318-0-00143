FR940318-0-00143 FR940318-0-00023 In some cases, the specific components of blends, as well as their proportions, are confidential business information; in others, only the proportions are confidential. With respect to both types of blends, however, listings in this final rule and in future updates will refer to only those blends which have been submitted for review. Although several companies may submit blends with the same components, only those compositions specifically reviewed under SNAP will be listed as acceptable. ASHRAE has issued numerical designations for many blends. All blends will be assigned a generic name for use in public notices. Substitutes that were included in the proposed rule will retain the same generic names, but the listing will include any available ASHRAE designations. Blends submitted since the proposed rule will be listed using the ASHRAE designation when available. If ASHRAE has not issued its designation, they will be assigned new names. In most cases, the discussion in the listings will include the blends' components. Blends that contain HCFCs will be labeled ``HCFC Blend Alpha'', ``HCFC Blend Beta'', etc. This designation is intended to ease identification of blends which must be handled in accordance with other regulations described below. Blends that have zero ODP will be given similar names that describe their major components. An information sheet listing the trade names and manufacturers of the blends, along with a vendor list, may be obtained by contacting the SNAP refrigerants sector expert. e. Ammonia. Ammonia has been used as a medium to low temperature refrigerant in vapor compression cycles for more than 100 years. Ammonia has excellent refrigerant properties, a characteristic pungent odor, no long-term atmospheric risks, and low cost. It is, however, moderately flammable and toxic, although it is not a cumulative poison. OSHA standards specify a 15 minute short-term exposure limit of 35 ppm for ammonia. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in meat packing, chicken processing, dairy, frozen juice, brewery, cold storage, and other food processing and industrial applications. It is also widely used to refrigerate holds in fishing vessels. Some absorption refrigeration and air conditioning systems use ammonia as well. f. Perfluorocarbons. Unlike CFCs, HCFCs or HFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds. The principal environmental characteristic of concern for these compounds is that they have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes, often orders of magnitude longer than those of the CFCs. These long lifetimes cause the PFCs to have very high global warming potentials. Technology for containment and recycling of PFCs is commercially available and is recommended by manufacturers to offset any possible adverse environmental effects. One advantage of the PFCs is that, like HFCs, they do not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, these chemicals are nonflammable and exhibit low toxicity, and they are not subject to federal regulations concerning volatile organic compounds (VOCs), since they do not contribute to ground-level ozone formation. The Agency anticipates that in widespread use, these compounds pose higher overall risk compared to other available alternatives because of their relatively long lifetimes and associated high GWPs. Because of these concerns, the Agency has found acceptable only certain narrowly defined uses of perfluorinated compounds, prohibiting their use where other alternatives with lower overall risk are available. EPA has described these limited acceptable uses as specifically as possible. Further, users should be aware that, because of the environmental concerns detailed above, any proposed uses of PFCs outside those described in this final rule should be submitted for future review under SNAP. g. Chlorine. Chlorine was listed in the proposed regulation as an alternative refrigerant in chlorine liquefaction, a processing step in the manufacture of the chemical. When chilled below its boiling point, chlorine can be stored as a liquid at atmospheric pressure, a method that for safety reasons is preferable to storing the chemical as a pressured gas at ambient temperatures. Although the refrigeration system will generally be physically separate from the actual chlorine process stream, compatibility of the refrigerant with liquid chlorine is critical because of chlorine's high reactivity. CFC&hyph;12 has been widely used because it does not react with chlorine. Systems using chlorine as a refrigerant require specialized compressors designed to resist chemical attack by liquid and gaseous chlorine. EPA has determined that chlorine can be safely used in refrigeration systems associated with chlorine-containing industrial process streams. Such systems must be designed and operated with the same safety considerations that apply to the process stream. In particular, OSHA regulates this use under its standard for Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).
