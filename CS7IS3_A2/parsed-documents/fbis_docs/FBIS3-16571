The talks between the Tajikistan official authorities and the armed opposition have been deferred. Nor did the recent meeting of foreign ministers of Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] during which a desperate attempt was made to set up the dialogue broken off after the murder of Tajik Vice Premier Moyensho Nazarshoyev produce the expected results. Incidentally, Nazarshoyev should have headed the government delegation. Naturally these unreassuring results in no way mean an end to attempts to set up the negotiations process with the opposition. But, as Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed in Dushanbe after meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian states, "...it is still too early to say when these efforts will produce results and it will be possible to hold talks." Seeking the culprits in this situation is a complex matter. But some mass media seem to have been very successful here. And, in accusing both the official authorities and the opposition, they cite new culprits -- the military. Those Russian servicemen who for two years now have been risking their lives to "hold" the Tajik-Afghan border and fulfilling their peacekeeping mission within the collective peacekeeping forces. Frankly, it is hard to think of anything more absurd. Moreover, stories have appeared that the "military lobby" is allegedly using every effort to try to acquire the status of peacekeeping forces under UN auspices in order to acquire certain benefits.... Please, good gentlemen! The Russian 201st motorized rifle division deployed in Tajikistan (nearly 6,000 men) has in fact for two years been performing peacekeeping functions without this status. We shall not list these functions -- KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has been writing of them constantly since the very start of the civil war in Tajikistan. Other central newspapers also regularly report the complex situation of the Russian servicemen who have found themselves at the epicenter of bloody events. That is the first point. The second is that of the 16,000 Russian servicemen now serving in what are called trouble spots only 1,200 (in the former Yugoslavia) have the official status of peacekeeping forces. The others are as they say "simply serving under fire." Expenditure on their maintenance and backup has recently increased by a factor of 10-15 as was reported 16 March at a press conference by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. And the money for this is found from the already meager military budget. As a result many military programs, primarily social programs, are being disrupted. Less housing is being construction, the defense complex is in a fevered state, and there is a lack of money for the most essential things for the troops' normal functioning.... As for the further development of events in Tajikistan itself, it may boldly be asserted that there is still a long way to go until peace and calm there. Politicians, the Foreign Ministry assured us, will do everything possible to ensure that talks with the opposition take place. The military, come what may, will ensure the conditions without which these talks are not possible at all.
