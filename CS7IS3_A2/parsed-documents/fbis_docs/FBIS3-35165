Alliance sources told AL-RA'Y the formation of a "unified national Islamic leadership of the intifadah" will top the agenda of this important session. The sources also expect raising the question of claiming the same armed fedayeen operations by more than one faction of the alliance to put an end to this phenomenon. Hamas and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] have both claimed several military operations against Israeli occupation, the latest of which was a military operation against settlers near Hebron on 6 February. This strained relations between Hamas and the DFLP at the time. Some Palestinian quarters think the alliance factions have so far failed to coordinate their electoral efforts in the occupied territories. This was the reason for Fatah's success in the elections of the doctors' union in Gaza Strip two days ago. All of Fatah's candidates won the 11 seats of the union. [passage omitted]
