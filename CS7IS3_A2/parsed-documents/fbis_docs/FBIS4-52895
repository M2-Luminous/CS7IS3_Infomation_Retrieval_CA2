FBIS4-52895 "dreas094_l_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Philippines Military Human Rights Crimes Excluded From Amnesty Military Human Rights Crimes Excluded From Amnesty BK1605050294 Manila BUSINESS WORLD in English 12 May 94 p 8 BK1605050294 Manila BUSINESS WORLD English BFN [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Proclamation No. 377 disqualifying from the presidential amnesty military and police personnel who committed "serious human rights violations, including extralegal executions during counterinsurgency operations." Earlier, the president issued Proclamation 347 and 348 ushering in the second round of amnesty to be granted under his regime. These proclamations are currently pending Congressional seal of approval even as government negotiations with rebels are on-going. Under the new proclamation, the grant of amnesty to personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) is preconditioned on the fact that their acts do not constitute "serious human rights violations" such as acts of rape, torture, extralegal execution, arson, massacre, other crimes against chastity or robbery of any form. The proclamation amends Section 1 of Proclamation 348 which grants amnesty to certain AFP of PNP personnel "who have committed certain acts or omissions punishable under the Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War, or other Special Laws in furtherance of, incident to or in connection with counter-insurgency operations." Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon backed yesterday the Philippine National Police's continued detention of Wilma Tiamzon, secretary general of the Communist Party of the Philippines, despite the Bulacan provincial fiscal's dismissal of the illegal possession of firearms charge against her. Mr. Drilon said Ms. Tiamzon is still facing a kidnapping and serious illegal detention case pending before a Quezon province court, noting that the kidnapping charge is a non-bailable offense. He also said the PNP has appealed to the justice department on the Bulacan fiscal's dismissal of the illegal gun possession charge against the communist leader. "We are going to follow judicial processes," Mr. Drilon said, as he suggested Ms. Tiamzon apply for bail if she wants to be released from detention. He also said the communist leader can apply for provisional liberty before the Presidential Committee (PC) on the grant of bail, pardon and clemency. The PC serves as the forerunner of the National Amnesty Commission pending the latter's formation. The PC handles the applications for bail or pardon of those who are either charged or convicted of non-bailable offenses like kidnapping. The Justice Secretary also said if Ms. Tiamzon wants to be released for humanitarian reasons, a recommendation for such should come from the PNP. As to government's pronouncement that it will continue to make arrests while there is still no substantial progress in the peace negotiations with leftist rebels, Mr. Drilon said the law has not been "suspended" and that police agencies must "continue to enforce the law." Mr. Ramos downplayed news that the National Democratic Front (NDF) would back out of the peace talks because of Ms. Tiamzon's continued detention, stating "so what's new?" during his weekly press conference. "We have bent over backwards to make sure that every opportunity to dialogue with government is given to them," he said. The President added that despite threats to withdraw from the talks, "the door is still open." In another development, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) yesterday reported that 21,106 rebel returnees availed of P [Philippine pesos] 670 million worth of financial assistance from the National Reconciliation and Development Program (NRDP) from 1989 to 1992. This came amidst reports that the funds released by the NRDP, now known as the National Program for Unification and Development Council (NPUDC), were meant as amnesty fund alone. NPUDC executive director Alberto Bernardo pointed out "the reported P670 million is not an amnesty fund alone but an umbrella fund which covers the various activities of the NRDP." The activities include, among others, the immediate assistance project, livelihood loan assistance, balik-baril [return gun] project, livelihood skills training and bayanihan [mutual aid] resettlement community project. Mr. Bernardo further said the NRDP did not incur expenses for amnesty applications "as these were shouldered by the local government units, DILG, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine Information Agency." The NPUDC chief added that the NRDP, in coordination with the Department of National Defense, documented 36 cases of forgery in 1992 and 1993 resulting in savings of P68.8 million. In this connection, six fake rebel groups were arrested by the PNP Criminal Investigation Service Command and four forged checks amounting to almost P130,000.00 were recovered by the NRDP.
