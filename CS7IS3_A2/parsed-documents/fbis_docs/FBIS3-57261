Rakhman Mustafazade, in an interview with Interfax, accused Armenia of causing delays in the peace process within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. He said Azerbaijan's position fully conformed to the idea of the presidents of Russia and the United States as stated in their Moscow declaration, namely that the conflict must be resolved within the CIS framework and on the basis of international law principles, such as respect for the independence and existing borders of the new states on the territory of the former Soviet Union, including Azerbaijan and Armenia. As Azerbaijan's principal conditions for the settlement of the conflict, Mustafazade named the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the territories they were occupying and security guarantees for the Armenian and Azeri population of Nagorno-Karabakh; abrogation by Armenia of all its legislative acts declaring Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia; and an end to Armenia's "policy of destroying Azeri historical and cultural monuments" in Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Elchin Guseinbeili described peace plans recently proposed by some foreign political scientists as "not serious." He said the plan for "security zones" and "humanitarian corridors" for Nagorno-Karabakh would lead to the annexation of the "occupied territories" both within Nagorno-Karabakh and outside it. At the same time, he said humanitarian corridors could be used to enable Azeri refugees from Armenia's southeastern regions to return home.
