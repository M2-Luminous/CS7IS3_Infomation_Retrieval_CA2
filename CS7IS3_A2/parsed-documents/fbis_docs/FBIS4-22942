Lomonosov; UDC 541.183] [Abstract] The effectiveness of three porous polymer adsorbents, i.e., Polysorb-1, Tepasorb-15, and Tenax-GC, as absorbers of n-alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, ketones, and n-alcohols was assessed by gas chromatography on a Tsvet-106 chromatograph with a flame-ionization detector. For each adsorbate in that temperature interval in which the adsorbent peaks were symmetrical and in which the retention time was virtually independent of the sample size (i.e., in the Henry interval), researchers calculated the specific volumes retained (V[.sub]m,1[/]) by each of the three adsorbents. From the dependence lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T, the researchers then calculated the adsorbents' differential heat of adsorption during the adsorption of zero samples, standard molar changes in the entropy of the adsorbate, and the extrapolated values of V[.sub]m,1[/] at 20�C. From the dependence of the differential adsorption heat during the adsorption of zero samples they determined the contributions of the magnitudes of the energy of the specific interaction to the total heat of adsorption. The dependence of lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T turned out to be linear for all three polymer adsorbents studied. The values of the heats of adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons for the three adsorbents were lower than those for n-hydrocarbons with the same number of carbon atoms in the molecule, whereas the retained volumes were higher for aromatic hydrocarbons than for n-alkanes throughout all the temperatures studied. This was taken as an indication of the fact that in the case of aromatic hydrocarbons, dissolution processes may also be at work in addition to adsorption processes. The dependences of the differential heat of adsorption during the adsorption of zero samples on the number of hydrocarbon atoms in the molecule for different homologous series on all three polymers were linear. The adsorption heats found for ketones, ethers, and n-alcohols were different for the different adsorbents. This fact was attributed to the adsorbents' ability to manifest specific reactions with the said adsorbates in addition to dispersion interactions. Polysorb-1 and Tepasorb-15 were found to be virtually inert with respect to ethers; however, they engaged in additional specific reactions with alcohols and ketones on account of the �-electrons of the benzene rings on their surfaces. The highest values of V[.sub]m,1[/] extrapolated for 20�C were obtained for Polysorb-1, and the lowest were obtained for Tepasorb-15. Both in the present study and elsewhere, the properties of Tenax-GC have been found to remain quite stable from batch to batch. The properties of Polysorb-1, on the other hand, were found to be quite unstable and to vary from batch to batch. Figures 2, tables 7; references 18: 6 Russian, 12 Western.
