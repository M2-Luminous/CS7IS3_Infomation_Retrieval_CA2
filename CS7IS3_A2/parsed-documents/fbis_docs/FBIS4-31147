Some other honorable deputies also had their names in the pot along with Greguric's, but, from what we have learned, the list has now been shortened to one man -- Nedeljko Mihanovic, member of the Academy. Although Stipe Mesic has let it be known that he will not leave the post of president of his own volition, since he feels that as a member of another party he can defend the interests of the state, some parliamentary analysts nevertheless forecast that there will be a gentlemen's agreement. The fact is that the majority party has the right to choose the president of the parliament everywhere in the world. As matters now stand, Mesic will withdraw, but he will not drop out of the race. It is assumed, that is, that his new party will nominate none other than himself as its candidate to oppose the probable candidate of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] -- Mihanovic. There are also those who think that the strongest opposition party, the HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party], will offer its candidate as well, so that there would be three in the race. The winner would be whoever got 70 votes, or, if two are left, the one who gets one vote more than his rival. Balloting -- Open or Secret? The fight for votes would be interesting. But the collection of signatures to qualify to run in the race would be equally interesting. The candidates must collect at least 30 signatures. In addition to his own 17, the Liberal candidate might perhaps also get two IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] signatures, perhaps even a dissident or two from the HSS [Croatian Peasant Party], and an independent like Vladimir Bebic. In addition to his own 11, Mesic would also get six signatures of the SDP [Social Democratic Party], perhaps even a few votes from the HSP [Croatian Rights Party], and a few HND [Croatian Independent Democrats] members "if needed." If there are several candidates in the running, the balloting may be secret. Nevertheless, if nine deputies seek an open ballot, the decision could be made to that effect. In that case, the opposition might demonstratively withdraw from the chamber, blackmailing the incumbent party and forcing it to accept a secret ballot. They are not after all electing the president of a soccer club, for God's sake, but the president of the parliament! And in that case everything becomes uncertain for the simple reason that now the likely HDZ candidate does not enjoy enough confidence and prestige among the oppositionists for the outcome to be certain. If Mesic had been opposed by Dr. Greguric, there would not have been that uncertainty. Dr. Nedeljko Mihanovic is not a politician; as he himself acknowledges, he simply wandered into politics because of his strong desire to help in bringing down the Yugoslav state, which he had always been against, and to help build Croatia, which had always been his dream. He entered the elections out of enthusiasm, simply in order to help the HDZ, in which he enrolled at the very beginning, in whose program he placed absolute trust, and whose leader he has followed. So, since he never had political aspirations, nor was he ambitious, and since he was pushed into political waters, Dr. Mihanovic, as they say, is not comfortable there. Which is no wonder when you realize that he has spent his entire working life in the tranquil, shaded and apolitical chambers of the Institute for Literature and Theater of the HAZU [Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts], as a consulting scholar. If he is nevertheless elected president of the parliament, he will not have an easy time of it. Academician Mihanovic is not young, and even by temperament he has always been known as a tranquil man attached to books, not a potential agile politician. Life Among Books He was born on 16 February 1930 in Sitno Donje, near Split, to father Marin Mihanovic, a farmer, and mother Marija. His wife is a lawyer, they have a daughter. He has a Ph.D. in philology. In 1958 he went to the Institute for Literature, where he became director of the section for literature. "If I searched the world over for a better position than this one, I never would have found it. From this warm pillow of aesthetics and art, I put my head on the very volatile political pillow," he was to sadly acknowledge. He has been a reader of Croatian language at Hamburg University. He has published a number of essays, criticism, and lexigraphical contributions, he has edited critical editions of the works of Croatian writers, for example, the poetry of Stanko Vraz, the poetic works of Vladimir Nazor, Govor Umjetnosti (The Language of Art), Oblikotvornost i smisao (Form and Meaning), Mjera i vrednost (Measure and Value). He won on the slate of the HDZ in Medvescak Opcina in Zagreb and became a deputy in what then was the Chamber of Opstinas. He is today a deputy in the House of Representatives. "I tried to withdraw from politics right at the outset, but they said that the interests of the Croatian state and the Croatian people were at stake, and I am simply disarmed by that argument. I have an aversion to politics, to officialdom, but I would never stand in the way," says this literary historian, who is only afterwards a deputy. Will this man of the pen get his bearings behind the president's desk? When you talk to Academician Mihanovic, you are aware of having a poetic soul opposite you. If he becomes president of the House of Representatives, how will he deal with the political wolves and foxes? Will he be able to react quickly, using every possible means? Or perhaps, that moderateness will have a good effect on the hot passions in the parliament?
