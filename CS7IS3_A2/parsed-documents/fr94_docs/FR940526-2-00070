The form is used to register the separate accounts as unit investment trusts under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and to register the securities issued by the separate accounts under the Securities Act of 1933. There are approximately 288 registrants currently filing Form N&hyph;4. It is estimated that it would take 139.3 hours per respondent with a total annual burden of 40,118 hours. Form N&hyph;17f&hyph;1 is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 17f&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act by management investment companies maintaining securities or other investments with companies that are members of a national securities exchange. There are approximately 23 registrants currently filing accountant examination certificates. The time necessary for investment companies to comply with the form's requirements is less than three minutes. Form N&hyph;17f&hyph;2 is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 17f&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act by management investment companies maintaining custody of securities or other investments. There are approximately 130 registrants currently filing accountant examination certificates. The time necessary for investment companies to comply with the form's requirements is less than three minutes. Form ADV&hyph;E is the cover sheet for accountant examination certificates filed pursuant to rule 206(4)&hyph;2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) by investment advisers retaining custody of client securities or funds. There are approximately 752 registrants currently filed accountant examination certificates. The time necessary for investment advisers to comply with the form's requirements is less than three minutes. Rule 6a&hyph;1 and Form 1 prescribes the form for registration as a national securities exchange. New filings on Form 1 are very rare, with an estimated burden of 45 hours per response. Rule 22d&hyph;1 requires that any scheduled variation be applied uniformly to all offerees. Absent adequate public notice, shareholders would not necessarily learn about new scheduled variations in sales load. The rule imposes a burden of 15 minutes annually, per respondent. Rule 12b&hyph;1 requires registered open-end investment companies that intend to distribute their own securities and pay the expenses of distribution to adopt a distribution plan, provide directors with quarterly reports of expenditures pursuant to that plan and keep certain records. The rule imposes an annual burden of 40 hours per registrant to maintain a distribution plan. Form S&hyph;1 is used by issuers that are not eligible to use any of the specialized forms to register securities pursuant to the federal securities laws. It is estimated that approximately 1,239 respondents would file Form S&hyph;1 annually at 1,275 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 1,579,725 hours. Form S&hyph;4 is used by issuers to register securities issued in business combination transactions pursuant to the federal securities laws. It is estimated that approximately 505 respondents would file Form S&hyph;4 annually at 1,235 burden hours per response with a total annual burden of 623,675 hours.
