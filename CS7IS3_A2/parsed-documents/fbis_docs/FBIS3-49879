He added, in an exclusive telephone interview with AL-HAYAH from his office in Sarajevo: "We have warned the European Union that the signatures of the Serb and Croat parties cannot be relied upon unless they are accompanied by international resoluteness to force them into compliance and implementation. The Europeans, however, have not paid attention, which has led to the failure of the last truce and the continuation of obstacles to humanitarian aid convoys." The Bosnian foreign minister discussed the question of Sarajevo, saying that the presidential commission still lacks a final position in this regard, pending the decision of the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It is certain, however, that its decision will reject any partition of the capital." He mentioned the city of Mostar in the south of the country, whose population is 40 percent Muslim, 38 percent Croatian, and 22 percent Serbian, explaining that the Croats had expressed their readiness to study its partition, under pressure from the European Union, "but so far they have not shown any goodwill." He asserted that the Bosnian government still stood by its decision not to negotiate over an outlet to the sea at the Prevlaka peninsula, "because it is absolutely unacceptable to us." He pointed out that in the ongoing contacts with the Croats over the outlet, it had been decided that Bosnian Prime Minister Dr. Haris Silajdzic would meet with Croat Foreign Minister Mate Granic in Vienna on January 3 to discuss the question of Niyum, and reaching this port through Croatian territory. He said that when this problem is solved, the fate of the agreement will be deadlocked in the coming talks set for the 18th [of January] in Geneva. [passage omitted]
