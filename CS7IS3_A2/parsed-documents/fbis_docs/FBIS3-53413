This danger, they maintain, is fundamentalism, a.k.a. religious extremism or political Islam. The Zionist movement gave the go-ahead for this international campaign against Islam. The campaign got going with the collapse of the Soviet Union and cruised through the catastrophic Gulf War and the launch of the Madrid conference for a settlement. The campaign found a welcoming ear in Arab regimes faced with a worsening political and economic crisis, mounting social and political demands, and the challenge of Islamic opposition. The campaign also reinforced the Western traditional view of Islam as a threat to Western interests and agents in the Islamic world. All this led, with an accelerating pace, to the emergence of a new lining of forces and interests on the Arab and Islamic scene. The handshake between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin was a symbolic milestone on a path that led several Arab regimes, both in the Arab Maghreb and the Gulf, to flirt openly with the Zionist entity. Those Arab regimes began exploring the possibilities of normalizing ties and exchanging interests with the Zionist entity, even ahead of a formal recognition. The Arab Maghreb regimes began looking into the prospects for security, tourism, and cultural exchange with the Zionist entity. The Gulf countries began looking into the economic aspect and to contemplate lifting the boycott. All this is a measure of the noose tightening around Egypt, the largest Arab country, which Israel still fears. These developments are occurring behind a smokescreen of rhetoric about the fundamentalist danger. A wider and more dangerous deception of the masses is under way, the purpose of which is to divert their attention from the real danger to their civilization, and historical and economic integrity. It is, namely, the Zionist entity. The Zionist entity, having usurped Palestine, holy Jerusalem, and Arab land, is ready for a more dangerous round of expansion in which it will seek to dominate the region economically and culturally. The Zionist entity will seek to change the region's identity and turn it from an Arab and Islamic world aspiring to unity and liberation, and restoring its prestige and cultural vibrancy to a Middle East region in which there is no room for Islam and Arabism. The choicest place, economically, politically, and militarily, will be reserved for Israel. The Zionist entity threatens to bury the hopes and dreams of our nation under the ruins of this region. So where does the real threat to Palestine and its honorable Jerusalem, and the Arab and Islamic entity and its aspiration to unity lie? Does it really lie in fundamentalism and independent, comprehensive development, as the Zionist entity and the regimes advocating a peaceful solution--primarily Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria--like to propagate? Or does the impending danger threatening the nation lie in Zionism and its allies and associates, and in dictatorship and corruption? Against this blatant defiance of the nation, its identity, and aspiration to freedom and unity--the defiance that got the nation and its resistance elements warmed up--ideologies and policies have been restructured and reincarnated. The early signs of this can be seen in the Palestinian national movement, where there is a center of challenge, a crater, and the theater of the conflict between the proponents of a settlement within the framework of "the sole legitimate representative" [reference to the PLO] and its opponents as represented in the 10 Palestinian factions that constitute the strategic alliance between the Islamists and the leftist, nationalist current. Judging by the historic status that the Palestinian cause assumed among the circles of the pan-Arab, Islamic, and nationalist struggle, and by the challenges the Zionist entity poses the nation's existence, we expect a new strategic Palestinian structure to extend up to and beyond the struggling arenas in the Arab and Islamic worlds. If this is the case, then two camps will emerge in the coming years. The first will be made up of the nationalists, the pan-Arab, and Islamic regimes and movements that insist on pursuing the goals of the Islamic, pan-Arab, and national struggle for independence, freedom, unity, and justice on the land of Islam, and democracy. This camp will be up against a second camp embracing the regimes, movements, and currents that wager on normalization with the Zionist entity, sacrificing the pan-Arab objectives, and on diminishing the Islamic role and message. Their only road to this will be violence and dictatorship. The dimensions and scope of such a battle go beyond the Palestinian and even the Arab, Islamic entity to the human struggle, because of the Zionist entity's influence worldwide and its expansionist ambitions on every level. It perpetuates the eternal struggle between right and wrong, progress and backwardness, between the powers of liberation and arrogance, and between prophets and idols. What a great battle, a splendid gift sent by heavenly providence in the hand of Zionism and its allies to reorganize the ranks of the nation and mobilize them for a clear cause. (The unbelievers plot and plan, and God too plans, and the best of planners is God.) [Koranic verse]
