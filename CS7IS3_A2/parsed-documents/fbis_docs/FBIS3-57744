Kazakhstan's head of state is in Davos to take part in the world economic forum that is being held here. "In December last year Kazakhstan acceded to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it," he said. "My official visit to the United States will take place in mid-February and there we will exchange ratification instruments. The Supreme Council of Kazakhstan has also ratified the START I Treaty. True, we did carry out a great deal of work before that." This was completed during the meeting in Moscow of the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine; and Belarus made a contribution to this, too. There were several points at issue. "The first was the guarantee by the nuclear states that there will be no nuclear attack on Kazakhstan," Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "We now have this guarantee, including from China. The second point was that the cost of the enriched uranium in the nuclear warheads should be returned. An agreement on this has been reached with the United States. The third point was economic matters, investment in Kazakhstan, and economic integration with the Western states, including the United States. When agreement was reached on these three issues, we went ahead with the ratification of the treaties on nuclear problems. The president stressed that "Kazakhstan has never wanted to be a nuclear power, if only because 500 nuclear charges were exploded on the territory of Semipalatinsk Oblast, including 87 in the air and 107 on the surface. Hundreds of thousands of people are still suffering and Kazakhstan was left to face their problem alone. I closed down that test site by decree. From this everyone will understand Kazakhstan's striving to rid itself of these weapons and not have them on its territory."
