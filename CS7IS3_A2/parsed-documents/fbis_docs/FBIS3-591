He said the country was headed for a head-on collision, and that a "volkstemming" [plebiscite] before April 27, to prove support for a volkstaat [homeland], was non-negotiable. At the same time, the April 27 election should be postponed for at least two months to allow the Freedom Alliance enough time to prepare for participation. But, interviewed on the television programme Agenda, Gen Viljoen did not state whether the Freedom Front he registered would be submitting a candidate list. Gen Viljoen said he met Mr de Klerk on Tuesday, but Mr de Klerk again refused to allow a poll among whites. The Afrikaner should be given a chance to enter the new South Africa peacefully and not violently, Gen Viljoen said. It was very unwise of Mr de Klerk to have rejected the request for a white plebiscite, and the country was being put at risk. "Now we have the situation that in April we won't have a volkstaat and there will be great dissatisfaction. "The Afrikaner will be angry and if there is war people should not blame me," Gen Viljoen said. He maintained that securing a volkstaat peacefully was better than fighting, in which many people would be killed. In South Africa, however, pieces of paper did not mean much, and in such an unsafe situation the Afrikaner should maintain his military capabilities. Gen Viljoen said the Freedom Front waited for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] delegation at the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission] offices on Wednesday in the interests of maintaining solidarity within the Freedom Alliance. He had not gone to the IEC's offices because he had been engaged in other meetings. He told Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg on Wednesday they should meet to manage the conflict. Gen Viljoen said they got along famously on the principle of Boer consensus. The ANC [African National Congress] should realize that while he was trying to accommodate the Afrikaner constitutionally and peacefully, he was experiencing strong opposition from rightwing quarters who wanted a volkstaat. He had tried to get his AVF colleagues to go along with his initiatives but failed. If the Freedom Alliance's constitutional demands were met, however, they would participate in the election, which would have to be postponed to allow the alliance time for prepapations. Gen Viljoen said the fact that the police had warned him about far rightwing plots against himself showed how serious the situation was. There were 85 far right organisations while the AVF was an umbrella body for only 17. But Gen Viljoen said he had to accept this situation. He was a soldier who had been in many battles.
