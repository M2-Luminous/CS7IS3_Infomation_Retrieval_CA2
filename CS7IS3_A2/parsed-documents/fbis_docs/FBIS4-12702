Afterward they issued a statement saying a battle has been imposed on the press, which they must fight to the end. They added that everything they had been told--assurances given to people working in the media and citizens everywhere that freedoms were secure--has been proven false. The two media officials said that every Lebanese journalist and all those who want to maintain simple freedom of expression should mass on a broad front that includes Lebanese, Arab, and international organizations and individuals in a confrontation that might last for some time but that will inevitably end with victory for freedom of expression and the protection of democracy and public freedoms. Chairmen al-Ba'labakki and Karam invited members of the boards of the two syndicates to a joint meeting to be held at 1200 on 11 April at the Press Syndicate offices.
