FR940407-2-00102 FR940407-2-00055 [Docket No. 40&hyph;3453] Atlas Corp.; Receipt of Application To Amend Source Material License No. SUA&hyph;917 by Atlas Corp. Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has received, is reviewing and is offering an opportunity for a hearing on an application from Atlas Corporation to amend Source Material License No. SUA&hyph;917. In general, the submittals referenced below propose to modify License Condition 41 by providing a revision of the 1982 approved reclamation plan for the mill tailings. As in the original reclamation plan, the proposed plan calls for reclamation of the tailings impoundment in place, covering the tailings with a soil cover to reduce radon emanation, and flattening the embankment side slopes to 10 horizontal to 3 vertical (10H:3V) or less. In addition, the license amendment application proposes the following modifications of the previous plan: 1. As means of promoting surface water drainage, the original domed top configuration would be changed to a system of channels. Three collection ditches would merge to form a larger drainage channel which would convey flood runoff from the reclaimed tailings surface into Moab Wash. 2. The soil cover thickness for radon attenuation purposes would be reduced based on an increase in the allowable radon emanation rate. 3. The erosion protection cover design would be modified. The top of the tailings impoundment would be covered with a layer of compacted rock and soil, and the embankment side slopes would be covered with rock native to the region. 4. Moab Wash would be reconfigured and designed to contain the Probable Maximum Flood, and convey flood flows into the Colorado River east of the tailings pile. On the southwest side of the tailings embankment, another drainage channel would divert runoff from the natural sandstone bluffs southwest of the channel. The licensee's proposal, currently under review, was first proposed to the NRC by a letter dated August 2, 1988, and has been modified by submittals dated January 17, 1989, June 4, 1992, April 14, 1993, and April 23, 1993. Additional information has been requested from the licensee by NRC letters dated October 8, 1993, November 29, 1993, and January 3, 1994. Responses to these letters may result in futher modifications to the reclamation plan. For Further Information Contact: Allan T.
