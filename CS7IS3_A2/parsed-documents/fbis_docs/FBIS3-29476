Everyone has praised the decision of President Clinton as it is considered appropriate, conforming to the common trend of the final decade of the 20th century, the era regarded by various industrialized countries, including the United States, as one of achieving cooperation and mutual understanding in all fields. In light of this, why has the U.S. Senate recently approved the establishment of Radio Free Asia again with the intention of beaming news broadcasts to China, Myanmar [Burma], Tibet, the DPRK, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic? It has said with a straight face that the residents of these countries have not had full freedom to express their views. It has also noted that Radio Free Asia will serve as a tool to gather views in different fields from the people of those countries. This may not be the true purpose of Radio Free Asia. There must be others. It is difficult to answer this question. The questioner himself has not mentioned a correct answer. Nevertheless, radio experts are of the view that the new Radio Free Asia broadcasts will create interference on frequencies used by broadcasters in various countries in this region. Radio Free Asia has also reprimanded various nations in the region by saying that they have not maintained full rights and freedom of people to express their views. The Lao people, like the peoples of other Indochinese countries, China, Myanmar, Tibet, and the DPRK, already enjoy full rights and freedom of expression. They can freely speak on whatever they want without needing Radio Free Asia. They have also exercised the rights to effectively safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity by opposing outside intervention and aggression under various forms. Economically, the United States has announced the end of the trade embargo against Vietnam. It has done a precious thing. Why has it now announced the establishment of Radio Free Asia? Spiritually, this contradicts the economic interest of the peoples in the region. BBC radio, in its broadcast of 29 January, expressed the view that the United States wants to set up Radio Free Asia because of its experience with its Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty contributing to the collapse of communism in Europe four to five years ago. If the BBC is correct, the new Radio Free Asia will not be characterized at all by creativity. Its purpose also runs counter to the earnest aspirations of the nations in this region, which want to create mutual understanding and promote and expand cooperation in various fields with all countries in the world, including the United States. Generally, no matter what is behind the establishment of Radio Free Asia, if the owner of a radio station fails to understand the essential requirements, the true purpose of the establishment of the station will certainly be clear to the world in the future. The peoples in the region--the targets of the broadcasts--will even enhance their spirit of self-mastery and the spirit of being the owners of their countries, strengthening their cooperation in various fields to check all acts of outside intervention regardless of the form.
