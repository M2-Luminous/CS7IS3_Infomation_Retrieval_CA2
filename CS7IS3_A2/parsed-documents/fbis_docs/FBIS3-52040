He stopped discharging his duties at the beginning of the work by the budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee]. "I am tired, I have lived through a period of embitterment during the work by the CPI, and I must now rebuild my image before my supporters," he said in justifying his resignation. He added, however, that in addition to working with his grassroots he will use his time to prepare his defense for the investigation that the Chamber's supervisor [corregedoria] will conduct in light of the conclusions of the CPI report. Despite the fact that the CPI did not punish him with the cancellation of his mandate, the faction of the PPR bloc that is promoting a renewal has questioned his leadership. His resignation will facilitate the process. The PPR leadership is being exercised by Deputy for Porto Alegre Gerson Peres, the first deputy leader. He will summon a bloc meeting to debate the election of the new leader next week. The candidates are: Gerson Peres, Marcelino Romano (Sao Paulo), and Jose Lourenco (Bahia).
