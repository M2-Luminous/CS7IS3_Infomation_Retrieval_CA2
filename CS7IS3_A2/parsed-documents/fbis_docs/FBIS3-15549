Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk said that "we have discussed a whole spectrum of issues of mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic and other spheres. We held talks with the U.S. leadership as a democratic and independent state. All this has been recorded in respective American-Ukrainian documents, as well as statements made by President (Bill) Clinton. The next step would be the fulfillment by the Ukrainian side of all its obligations which we have assumed." "I would not link the success of the meeting with those credits which the United States has promised to grant us. The credits will not be able to provide for full economic recovery of the country anyway. They may help only when the economic mechanism begins working. But now we need U.S. investments and technological assistance badly," Kravchuk said.
