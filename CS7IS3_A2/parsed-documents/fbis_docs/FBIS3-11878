There were dramatic moments that jeopardized it throughout the process. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin had to use all of her strengths to win the OAS Secretariat General for Colombia: [Begin Sanin recording] There was a time when Foreign Minister Niehaus was leading. There was tension all the time. We, however, remained confident we would win, and finally, we garnered an absolute majority. [end recording] The days leading up to the election also featured dramatic moments that were witnessed by many, from President Gaviria at Narino Palace to the Colombian delegation in Washington headed by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. [Begin Sanin recording] We contained our anxiety while we confronted challenging moments over the past few days. We held countless talks on a daily basis. There were concerns, questions, and ideas; there were... [pauses] We had to outline our policies on countless occasions. [end recording] Now that Gaviria has been elected, the question is whether he, as the new OAS secretary general, will work to lift the suspension that this organization imposed on Cuba in 1962 because of its political system. [Begin Sanin recording] Colombia's current policy toward Cuba is sovereign and independent and is solely in keeping with Colombia's interests. President Gaviria's OAS policy should not follow Colombian policy but a policy common to the 34 nations that comprise the organization. [end recording]
