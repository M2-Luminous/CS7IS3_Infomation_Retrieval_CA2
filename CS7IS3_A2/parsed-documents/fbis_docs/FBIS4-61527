A big number of mines and explosives still remains on another Estonian island, Suur-Pakri, or Great Pakri, situated off the former Russian base town of Paldiski. While its neighboring small island of Vaike-Pakri looks relatively nice, Suur-Pakri looks like some kind of a "sea hedgehog," the government's special representative Juri Tikk has said. The Pakri islands were used as training fields by the Russian military. Tikk said the ammunition left on Suur-Pakri ranges from non-exploding training mines and bombs to shells filled 20-percent with ammunition. Crews of the Estonian Rescue Department are expected to start cleaning Suur-Pakri of this legacy within few weeks. Rescue Department experts say it is very difficult to determine the exact types of the shells, because many of them are covered with heavy rust.
