They said LDP President Yohei Kono will meet with Hosokawa later Wednesday to ask his government to implement the eight-point package. The package, adopted by the party's special panel to combat the recession, includes a proposal for an "early implementation of major income tax cuts," the officials said. The proposal did not mention the size of income tax cuts, but Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the party's Policy Affairs Research Council, told reporters it should be more than 5 trillion yen. The program also called for a substantial reduction or a two-year freeze of the land value tax and urged the reorganization of financial institutions to improve the nation's financial system.
