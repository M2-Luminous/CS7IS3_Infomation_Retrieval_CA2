Proposing a toast, Karimov said that the friendship between the peoples of China and Uzbekistan can be traced to centuries ago, when the "silk-road linked them together." "There is every reason to revitalize this road today, when conditions are ripe for developing full-scale bilateral friendly cooperation," he said. Premier Li Peng's visit marks the beginning of a new era in the relations between Uzbekistan and China, he said. As many Chinese entrepreneurs are tavelling with Premier Li Peng, this provides a good opportunity for expanding bilateral trade and economic cooperation, he noted. The direct links now existing between the businesses and localities of the two countries will undoubtedly bear fruits of cooperation, he said. Karimov spoke highly of China's reform and opening, saying Uzbekistan is following closely with what is happening in China and expects China to push ahead along the path, so as to make greater contributions to mankind. Li Peng, in his reply, said the warm reception accorded himself and his entourage reflects the profound friendly feelings the people of Uzbekistan hold towards their Chinese counterparts. He noted that the traditional friendship between the two peoples entered a new stage after Uzbekistan became independent and has been consolidated and furthered since then. As China is concentrating on its modernization drive, it needs a good international environment and follows an independent foreign policy of peace, Li said. "We are ready to develop ties with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence," he said. "In particular, we attach importance to developing good-neighborly relations of friendship and cooperation with the neighboring nations." Li said he expected to have indepth discussions with President Karimov and other leaders of Uzbekistan on bilateral ties, regional and international issues. Also, he expressed the conviction that this visit would serve to enhance the mutual understanding and cooperation in all fields between the two countries. He agreed with Karimov that the silk-road should be revitalized, saying China would work towards that.
