Pieter P. Bottelier, head of the bank's China branch, said China has done a "very good" job implementing World Bank loans. Making his remarks in a recent interview with China Daily, Bottelier said the bank's total lending to China is projected to reach $19 billion by the middle of this year. The international organization has lent $17 billion to China since it first made a loan in 1981. Last year, China received the largest amount of World Bank funds of any country in the world. New annual commitments are to total over $3 billion with projects concentrated in infrastructure construction, social development and environmental protection. The bank's lending programme for the coming years, Bottelier said, is to be around $3 to 3.5 billion, with about 15 to 17 projects annually. They are to focus on agriculture and removing transportation and energy "bottlenecks." Lending to bolster industry enterprises reform, urban development and alleviating poverty are also to receive greater emphasis. Bottlier said the World Bank, in addition to being a source of capital for China, also provides technical and policy advice through economic studies and technical assistance projects. He said assistance programmes this year and in coming years will focus on developing the legal system, financial sector and fiscal administration. The bank official also noted that Chinese companies are winning more international contracts under World Bank loans to other countries. This shows that Chinese contractors are becoming more competitive in the international economy, he said. Chinese suppliers secured about 3.3 percent of international World Bank contracts in 1992, compared with none five years ago. About 8 percent of contracts in 199's were awarded to Japanese firms. Bottelier also said the World Bank is very pleased with the quality of its relationship with China, which is regarded as a long- term co-operation project. "The World Bank is expected to help deepen and accelerate China's economic reform programme announced at the Third Plenary of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in November last year," he said. However, he said the relative contribution of the bank's capital will inevitably diminish as other sources of capital, especially the private foreign capital, becomes more important for China.
