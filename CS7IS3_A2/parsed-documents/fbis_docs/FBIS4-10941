In brief remarks to reporters at Planalto Palace, Franco also commented on the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] in his government and the implementation of the real: [Begin Franco recording] There is nothing to fear about the implementation of the real because the government will announce the date for its implementation 35 days in advance. The government has never stopped supporting the constitutional revision process, but I have stressed that the revision is an issue that falls within the specific jurisdiction of Congress. The government is, however, determined to successfully complete the constitutional revision process. It is not important at this time to discuss who is to blame for the impasse. If the members of Congress are willing to sit and discuss with us segments of the constitutional revision, we are ready to do that. I am a founding member of the PMDB; I was the eighth member to sign the national PMDB list. But the problem rests with the party. If the PMDB decides to withdraw its support for the government, it will do it. The PMDB should keep in mind, however, that PMDB members served for several months in important ministerial posts. Thus, if the government has not succeeded in meeting the PMDB's desires, then the PMDB should certainly assume its share of responsibility for this failure. [end recording]
