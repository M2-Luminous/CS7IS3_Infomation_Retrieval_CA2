Just a few hours ago Aleksandr Shkirando, our special correspondent, sent us a report from Blagoveshchensk on Boris Yeltsin's working trip to Amur oblast. [Begin recording] [Shkirando, over video showing Yeltsin in a workshop talking to staff; Blagoveshchensk identified by caption] The itinerary of the Russian president's working visit to Blagoveshchensk is extremely full. In the morning Boris Nikolayevich visited the shipyard and met its workers. [Yeltsin, surrounded by a crowd in workshop, addresses unidentified woman in the crowd] How much is your pension? [Woman] Seventy-three. [not further identified] [Yeltsin] Seventy-three. That is not much. [Woman] Yes, that is a small amount. [Yeltsin] Perhaps we need to raise pensions this year, in two or three months. I understand that your wages amount to about 200,000, 25000 or 300,000. Am I right? Three hundred thousand is enough to live on, is it not? Without luxuries but enough, especially considering that both food and consumer goods shops are full. Those things of the past just do not exist any longer. One no longer has to suffer the humiliation of waiting in lines. One can buy everything. But...of course, things are expensive. That is without doubt. [Shkirando] The president also talked about the problem of taxes, which is a dire problem for all Russian citizens. [Yeltsin] All production taxes, according to the 15 economic decrees I signed, will be cut by about 10-20 percent this year. It will vary from industry to industry. [Unidentified man] Production taxes? [Yeltsin] Yes, production taxes. As to the income tax, there will be several levels to it. We have rich people who earn 5 million a month. Their earnings must of course be properly chopped, while those who receive 300,000-400,000 or up to 500,000 should be taxed proportionately and in a balanced way. [Shkirando] To help the president address the whole range of issues, high ranking leaders and government officials, including Shokhin, Zaveryukha, and Shafrannik, arrived with him in Blagoveshchensk. Local authorities have expressed the hope that at long last a number of dire problems affecting all of the Far East will be addressed. [end recording]
