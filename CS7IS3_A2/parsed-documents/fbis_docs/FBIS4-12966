As far as the F-16 aircraft are concerned, they cannot be linked with the nuclear program. The United States should either hand over the aircraft to Pakistan or return the payment made for their delivery. The prime minister has forgotten about compensation. The payment should be collected along with compensation. One day prior to the arrival of the U.S. delegation to Pakistan, the prime minister precisely explained the country's stand on the nuclear program and also took efforts to dispel the doubts and apprehensions that the government would succumb to U.S. pressure or that the nuclear program would be rolled back or frozen and would be subjected to international inspection. Although the prime minister said this after getting a green signal from General Waheed, may God make her stick to her words and not succumb to any counsel on the question of the country's security and stability. In principle, the F-16 aircraft transaction has nothing to do with the nuclear program. Pakistan struck a deal with a U.S. firm for the purchase of more than 70 F-16 aircraft purely on a commercial basis and in the meantime had paid in installments an amount of $700 million, which is equivalent to the cost of 38 aircraft. The United States should fulfill its obligations in this direct commercial transaction and should not set a despicable example for dishonesty, breach of promise, and unethical business practices in international commercial dealings although earlier, it had committed such a practice in the Arshad Parvez case. If the pro-Indian and pro-Israeli lobby does not want to see Pakistan become strong, the United States should face this lobby with confidence and not kneel before it and involve it in the conspiracy to weaken the security of Pakistan. It is regrettable that influenced by the propaganda of this lobby, the United States Government has been persistently refusing to hand over the F-16 aircraft; and now, the latest case is that if Pakistan wants to get F-16's, it should roll back its nuclear program and should subject it to international inspection in order to get ratification for the level of its capping. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has arrived in Islamabad by passing through New Delhi and as per international media analysis, this visit is a ploy to exert pressure on Pakistan although Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had stated that Pakistan would not come under any pressure and would not accept any conditions unilaterally. Prior to this, Army Chief Abdul Waheed also voiced the same feeling. We, however, are of the opinion that the mere precondition "unilaterally" is not enough now and even at the regional level, Pakistan should not compromise. Even if India accepts the conditions of the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] (the chances for which are remote), its military superiority over Pakistan will be intact. Besides making a nuclear bomb, India has amassed a heap of missiles and acquired a huge quantity of weapons; in conventional weapons it also is better off than Pakistan. Therefore, as long as India's wings of aggression are not clipped and a cut is not imposed on its armed forces, defense allocation, and stockpile of arms under a collective and comprehensive package, there will always be the threat of a war being waged by India. Pakistan now should insist on the introduction of some sort of a collective and comprehensive package first, which does not put the balance of power in favor of India. Otherwise, Pakistan cannot sacrifice its defense capabilities. It is a blessing that the U.S. officials have revealed that Pakistan is capable of producing an atom bomb within minutes or seconds. There cannot be any other good news and a matter of satisfaction to the Pakistani people than this. So far, responsible institutions in Pakistan have declined to say anything to the people about this. Now, Pakistan can in no way forego this invaluable possession. It is imperative that the U.S. delegation should be given this impression and sent away from Pakistan.
