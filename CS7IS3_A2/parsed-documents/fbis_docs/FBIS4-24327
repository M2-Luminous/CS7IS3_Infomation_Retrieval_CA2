Since the outbreak of civil war almost four years ago, many thousands of people have died and inevitably as the man who began the insurrection against former President Samuel Doe, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader, Charles Taylor, has made no secret of his desire to take his place. Network's Cello Brooks has just visited Mr. Taylor's headquarters in Gbarnga. There, he asked him first why the people of Liberia should trust him with the leadership of their country. [Begin recording] [Taylor] The Liberian people know very well that I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. We started this revolution. We have the largest army in this country. We showed we have not blinked at the most powerful countries in this region. [Brooks] What do you think are some of the qualities the Liberian people will look at to say: Oh yes, this man is the man? [Taylor] We all need a leader that we can trust -- a leader who says that he can do something and do it. We do not need a puppet in this country. The Liberian people know very well that I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. They need a strong leader, they do not need a little roach in this country. They need a man that has guts, a man that has credibility, a man that is strong, firm and I think that I have these qualities. And if Liberians make a mistake by putting someone who is incapable, after the crisis, of bringing all parties together, to reconcile the parties from a position of confidence and strength, that will be the biggest mistake this country could ever make and it would lead us probably back into conflict. They need someone they can trust; I think I am that person. [Brooks] And so, are you really prepared to start up with the entire process, I mean, in terms of disarming, encamping, and demobilizing your men? [Taylor] Well, why wouldn't I be prepared? We've said for months ...[pauses] do not let us forget here that we've advanced all or most of the initiatives so far from the Geneva meeting to the Cotonou meetings to recuse ourselves from the process to give peace a chance. We have unilaterally declared certain aspects of the peace process. We have always been ready, we've insisted on fair play, we are very glad that the United Nations is here, we are very glad that the expanded ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is here. We, however, regret that they have not entered our area, our controlled area, we hope they can move as quickly as possible. We have always hoped to move the peace forward. [Brooks] Are you hoping to enter Monrovia in high spirits? [Taylor] I expect to win a landslide victory in these general and presidential elections and my party, I expect, will lead with a majority in the parliament; and so I have no qualms about going to Monrovia. We will judge the safety factor [words indistinct] given the extent of hostilities and after that we will go in when we think and feel that it is right. [end recording]
