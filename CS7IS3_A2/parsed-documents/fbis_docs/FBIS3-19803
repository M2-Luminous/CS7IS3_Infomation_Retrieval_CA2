Rexrodt said that, apart from the developments of the Middle East peace process, his one-hour talk with Al-Shar' in Bonn on Friday [18 March] focussed on the possibilities for developing German-Syrian economic ties. According to Rexrodt, Syrian exports to Germany totalled 1.12 billion German marks [DM] and were twice as high as German exports to Syria (DM546 million). The reason for the high Syrian trade balance surplus are Germany's oil imports from Syria. In the first 11 months of 1993, Germany's exports to Syria grew by 25 percent over the same period in the previous year, while imports from Syria only increased by 6 percent.
