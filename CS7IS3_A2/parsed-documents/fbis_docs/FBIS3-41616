Smirnova; from the ``Vesti'' newscast] [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed Gosatomnadzor [state body supervising nuclear and radiation safety] to carry out preventative checks at all nuclear power enterprises where there is a potential danger of radiation. Smirnova: A detailed inspection has just been finished at the Atomflot [nuclear fleet] technological repair yard. An authoritative Gosatomnadzor commission inspected the workshops, mooring lines, offices and, particularly carefully, the (Imandra) floating technical base, to which nuclear fuel was being delivered at the time. The commission had no serious complaints about the work of the enterprise's personnel. Its main conclusion coincided with the opinion of experts of the Russian-Norwegian expedition which studied radioactive pollution in the northern seas. A year ago they visited the technological repair yard of the nuclear ice-breaker fleet and also reached the conclusion that the system of ensuring nuclear and radioactive control there corresponds to all requirements and norms of radioactive safety.
