On Russian-Polish Relations"] [Excerpts] Warsaw, 21 Feb--It is planned to hold a Russian-Polish government-level conference under the motto "On the Path to New Partnership" 23-25 February in Krakow. A Russian delegation headed by Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev will take part. The aim of the conference is to assess the state of Russian-Polish political and economic relations and elaborate mechanisms to strengthen mutual cooperation. This meeting could play an important role in eliminating obstructions in the way of raising the effectiveness of our cooperation and finding compromises for the many controversial questions which have emerged following B. Yeltsin's visit to Poland last year. However, the prospects of a warmer climate in Moscow-Warsaw relations is evidently not to Washington's liking; judging by its actions, it has not given up plans for creating a "cordon sanitaire" around Russia. We say nothing about how this is being done at the diplomatic level, where everything is always shrouded in mystery; but at propaganda level such trends can be clearly outlined. You do not need to go far to find examples. Literally on the eve of the conference the influential WPROST periodical published an article by a staffer of the U.S. Hoover Institute in which the author, clearly distorting historical facts and making vague hints, dumbfounds readers with the claim that during World War II Krakow was saved from destruction by the Hitlerite invaders not through the heroism of liberating Soviet servicemen but as a result Vatican pressure on Berlin. [passage omitted] What is this -- the latest attempt to falsify history, and, what is more, so obviously? Evidently not! This is big-league stuff. It even includes elements of psychological warfare, aimed at setting Slavs at loggerheads with each other by playing on religious feelings, and even using blatant lies in the process. They are also counting on the fact that there are few eye-witnesses of these events left, and indeed that anti-Russian sentiments, stirred up by certain political circles on the Vistula, have been reinforced in Poland in the past four years. To follow these "sensational historical facts" the U.S. special services are putting new, "fresh" ones, into circulation. A few days ago THE WASHINGTON POST published an article which, citing a former high-ranking CIA staffer, claims that during the 1980's, without the USSR's knowledge, the Poles sold large consignments of state-of-the-art secret Soviet weapons to the Americans to the tune of over $200 million. Some types, notably the "Strela" missile launchers, were then sold by the Americans to the Afghan mojahedin, who used them to shoot down Soviet military aircraft. Such insinuations by THE WASHINGTON POST have clearly placed the Polish Ministry of National Defense in an impasse. Its spokesmen were clearly shocked. Polish National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk called the article an act of provocation. Whereas in the first case the Americans were making snide remarks about Poland, in the second this was obviously aimed at Russia, counting on the fact that Moscow was bound to be annoyed at the "perfidy" of its former Warsaw Pact ally. It cannot be ruled out the Washington is currently going through a period when its head is being turned with success following the collapse of the USSR and the significant weakening of Russia, which is busy with its own serious domestic problems. It is trying to dictate its terms of play to the world even by rewriting history and spreading obvious disinformation. The question is solely one of whether our two neighboring countries should be led by Washington and shut themselves off from each other by a wall of hostility. Or whether they should nevertheless be guided by pragmatism and reestablish relations on the principles of partnership and mutually advantageous cooperation. It looks as though the Russian-Polish conference in Krakow will provide some answers to these difficult questions.
