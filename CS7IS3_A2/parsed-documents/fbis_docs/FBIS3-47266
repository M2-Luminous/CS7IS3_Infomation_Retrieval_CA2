Dr. Chong Kwan-yong says this in an article contributed to NODONG SINMUN today. He explains the reasons why the revolutionary economic strategy of the WPK is correct as follows: The first reason is that the strategy makes it possible to radically improve the people's standard of living in a few years to come and bring the advantages and vitality of Korean-style socialism into fuller play. To this end, state investment in agriculture, the light industry, foreign trade and other sectors related to the people's living will be increased and the nation's fund, materials and equipment be directed first of all to the development of agriculture and the increase of the production of consumer goods and export products. Today when the heavy industry has a solid foundation, the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policy is a firm guarantee for steadily consolidating and expanding the nation's economic foundation as a whole and improving the people's standard of living. The revolutionary economic strategy of the WPK is a popular one because it indicates the road of rapidly developing all sectors of the national economy which are complicatedly interlinked by placing the desires and interests of the people in the centre and finding the master key in that direction. Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to consolidate the self-reliant foundation of the economy so that we may live on our own strength under the new, changed situation; It is the invariable principle of the WPK that we live on our own strength, firmly defending the honor and dignity of socialism under any circumstances. We must make full material preparations to live on our own strength if we are to defend and accomplish the cause of socialism in face of the vicious offensive of the allied forces of imperialism aimed at isolating, blockading and stifling the DPRK. The strategy makes it possible to continuously develop the coal and power industries, rail transport and the metal industry while concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and export products. Thus it will strengthen the chuche orientation and self- reliance of our economy and firmly ensure that our people live on their own strength under any circumstances. Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to secure a new base for reaching higher levels of socialism. It is very timely and correct for our party to have set the three years to come as a period of adjustment. And the policy of concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and foreign trade is so wise that we can secure a new base for higher levels. The strategy is, indeed, patent proof of the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who victoriously lead the building of the economy, turning adversity into a favorable condition and misfortune into a blessing with their rare wisdom and clairvoyant scientific insight.
