The imams affirmed in their Friday sermons yesterday that, God willing, victory will be for justice represented by the heroic Iraqi confrontation and steadfastness against the mean aims and interests of the forces of evil, infidelity, deception, and aggression headed by the United States. The imams praised leader President Saddam Husayn's generous offers that increased the wages of civil servants and low-income people and his orders to oblige grocers to ensure the supply of food for the people and to strike at greedy horders. The imams prayed to God almighty to preserve Iraq, its people, and struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, to strengthen the march of reconstruction and faith in God and the homeland, and to support the president against his unjust enemies.
