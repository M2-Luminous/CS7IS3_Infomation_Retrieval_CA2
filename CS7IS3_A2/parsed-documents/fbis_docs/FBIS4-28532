At the meeting, the two will focus on the National Assembly investigation of the Sangmudae scandal, which has been stalled by related agencies refusing to produce documents requested by parliamentary inspectors. Wednesday's luncheon was arranged for Kim to brief leaders of the three government branches and chairmen of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party and opposition Democratic Party on the results of his recent visits to Russia and Uzbekistan. Yi, recalling President Kim's promise at a May 28 meeting to instruct the cabinet to cooperate in the parliamentary investigation within legal limits, will urge Kim to make a decision so the probe can proceed to a smooth conclusion while the parliament's prestige is respected. The president, explaining the need for international sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program, will ask for the opposition party's cooperation in a supra-partisan approach to diplomatic and security issues, including the nuclear problem. The opposition leader, noting that adopting sanctions is not the best policy, will stress that the nuclear problem must be settled peacefully in the United Nations and propose a direct inter-Korean contact to find a solution. On Kim's appointment of six new justices, Yi will ask the president to exclude those who have cooperated with past military governments.
