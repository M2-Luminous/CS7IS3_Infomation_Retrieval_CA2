[Begin recording] [Gabriela Guevara] In order to obtain information and learn the views of various sectors regarding Nicaraguan problems and possible solutions, the Association of Diplomatic Officials at the new ambassadors level are meeting with some local, prominent figures. Today, these diplomats held a working breakfast with Commander Bayardo Arce, and they discussed various topics regarding the Nicaraguan situation. [Marcos Nunez, member of the Association of Diplomatic Officials] Personally, and not speaking for my embassy, I want to tell you the discussion was very good. I sensed a clear and sincere willingness by Commander Bayardo Arce to implement changes on substantial and basic aspects of the FSLN for Nicaragua's benefit. [Bayardo Arce, member of the FSLN Executive Commission] The diplomats' questions reflected the concerns that all Nicaraguans have, like how to achieve economic recovery and how to face socioeconomic problems. I believe they, as diplomatics, although they are not heads of mission, expressed a certain concern in their questions because they see that the government is not stimulating production. Obviously, we pointed out that that was our main complaint against the government's economic policy, namely, that it does not seek to stimulate production. Rather, the government's economic policy is more interested in scoring high marks with creditors. I believe that listening to our views will enable these officials to play a different role in their bilateral relations. [Pierre Salazar, official at the Venezuelan Embassy] In my question to Commander Bayardo, I mentioned that Nicaragua is a country facing a very serious situation with a balance of payments deficit, a drop in its foreign exchange, and a lack of foreign investment. For many reasons [pauses] currently everyone wants money. For instance, the Soviet Union wants $3 billion, the Arabs want money, and these circumstances all affect the situation. We must be realistic and consider all the circumstances. [Guevara] Another major point discussed was the FSLN's internal debates. [Arce] Regarding debates in the FSLN, I believe their questions were restrained. But since questions were asked on this topic, I told them that Sandinists have always had internal debates, so much so that at one point we split in three groups before beginning our fight against Somoza. We have always been characterized by internal debates, but since 1990, and under the new conditions, we have brought the debate out into public light. This debate has been passionate at times and not so passionate at others times, but that should not surprise anyone. [Guevara] The diplomats said the meeting was worthwhile because, according to them, firsthand information enables them to have a clear idea of the situation and therefore they can better contribute to Nicaragua.
