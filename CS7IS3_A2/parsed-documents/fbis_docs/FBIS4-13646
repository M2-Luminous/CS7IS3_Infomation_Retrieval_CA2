The statement asserts that the valiant popular resistance will be stepped up, and that jihad and military operations against the Zionist enemy will continue as long as the Zionist enemy continues to occupy our blessed Palestinian territories. The pursuit of this approach will continue until the liberation of all of our usurped Palestinian territories from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River. The statement also underscored that the negotiations between the 'Arafat leadership and the Zionist entity are doomed to failure, because they were based on consecrating injustice, aggression, and occupation. The statement noted that the statements and communiques issued by the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement have not contained what some attempted to promote, namely, that the movement recognizes the usurpative Zionist entity or accepts UN Security Council Resolution 242, or that it has abandoned its own platform as well as its noble Islamic constants, which deem Palestine to be Islamic territory whose abandonment is forbidden, and over which there can be no bargaining. Concluding its statement, the Islamic Resistance Movement has reiterated that it, along with all sincere elements of our people, will persist in the jihad and valiant resistance to the savage Zionist enemy along the path of victory and liberation.
