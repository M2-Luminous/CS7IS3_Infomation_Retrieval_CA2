In the interview conducted in the mountains of southeastern Mexico, the military strategist of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) said the rebels do not intend to take over power with weapons, which they have obtained "without foreign support." He said the main "detonator" of the 1 January Chiapas uprising was the land problem and, especially, reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution, by which the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari limited the existence of ejidos [a form of land tenure] in the area inhabited by more than 1 million Indians. "These reforms canceled all legal possibilities of having access to land," and they "closed the door on Indians surviving in a legal and peaceful manner," according to "Marcos." He added that "the agrarian problem should once again be discussed." Salinas' reforms should be eliminated as "a first step in opening wider discussions aimed at keeping the countryside in mind." He added that during the dialogue with the government, the date and place of which has still not been decided, the EZLN will call for the establishment of an "autonomous region similar to what the Basques or Catalans have [in Spain]" in order to attenuate the Indian communities' "distrust" toward the government. "We must negotiate an autonomy statute where our government and our administrative structure will be acknowledged by the Mexican government and we may live together without anyone interfering with us," "Marcos" asserted. After denying that the Chiapas Catholic Church had supported the guerrillas ("there was not even consent"), the rebel leader stated that the "Zapatist thunder of thousands" of Indians came after the "failure" of legal mechanisms to guarantee participation, self-government, and food self-sufficiency in the region. "If the Indians decided to organize cooperatives, right away they were lambasted. If they decided to organize to demand land, they were rejected. If they organize to take over land by force, they are killed. They have no health facilities; they are dying," he commented. Although he denied that the Zapatists intend to take over power by force, the guerrilla leader did say that the EZLN does favor "a national revolutionary movement" and that their demands "are nation-wide [nacionales]." With respect to the origins of the weapons under guerrilla control and reports that they had been training for the past ten years, he indicated that the weapons were obtained by "stockpiling bit by bit" -- "black market" weapons seized by the police from drug traffickers, weapons taken from the "white guards [guardias blancas]" (paramilitary) working for the region's farm owners, and rudimentary hunting weapons used by the peasants. "Marcos," whom reporters describe as a 40-year-old mestizo pointed out that the weapons in the hands of the EZLN consist of (Russian manufactured) AK-47 and (U.S. made) M-16 rifles, German UZI machine-guns, as well as lower caliber hunting rifles. He also added that the EZLN "originated as a self-defense group." The rebel leader, whose identity is still not known, said he is a "by-product" of the 1968 Mexican student movement and "everything else that came afterwards, mainly election fraud." He did not specify when he decided to go to the southeastern mountains but did indicate that he takes orders from an Indian group that makes up the EZLN "General Command." "Marcos" added that he became "subcommander" only after being a junior lieutenant, lieutenant, second captain, and then first captain.
