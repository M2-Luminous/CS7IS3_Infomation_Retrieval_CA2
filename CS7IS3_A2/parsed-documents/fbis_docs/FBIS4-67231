What Will Be the Result?"] [Text] Lately the capital has been agitated by rumors, each more wild than the next. Allegedly there have been several assassination attempts, including on Ministry of Internal Affairs officers, on the president of the Butya company, Bulat Abilov, and on other famous people. We called the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] press service and found out that these rumors were not news to them. "We know of this," said the deputy chief of the MVD press center, Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Vulf. "This information is not true, however. All the persons whose names are being mentioned in 'unofficial chronicles' are alive and well." "Nevertheless, residents of the capital noticed, for instance, unusual activism on the part of the militia over the past few days. Why?" Vulf said: In the past the militia has always worked in a special mode during holidays. The same was true over the past few days: The militia was put on a round-the-clock operation schedule, with reinforced patrols--that is why there was more special equipment on the streets than usual, and patrols were armed with submachine guns. This is not at all related to a crime surge. On the contrary, over the past four months the total number of crimes in the republic has dropped by 7 percent, and criminal investigations--by 10 percent. The number of murders, robberies, and assaults has dropped. In order to maintain this trend, the republic organs of internal affairs conducted Operation "Kuryk" ("Noose") a few days ago. Over a period of three days 1,288 crimes were registered, of which 888 were solved while the trail was hot. We also detained 1,153 suspects--63 for inflicting grave bodily harm, 92--for hooliganism, and 21--for assault. "Noose" also caught 252 drug addicts, from whom we confiscated 22.5 kg of drugs. On the basis of these facts, 1,069 criminal cases have been initiated. In the course of the operation 633 units of firearms were confiscated, 55 stolen cars were found, and 4,152 persons were delivered to medical sobering-up facilities. We checked dormitories, hotels, and "suspicious" apartments. It turned out that 425 foreign citizens were living in Kazakhstan not only without a residence permit but even without a passport. One hundred thirteens persons were expelled from the republic. These are the facts we were given at the MVD press center. And at the offices of the Butya company we were told that Bulat Abilov is in good health and actually is on a business trip to Japan. Of course, where there is smoke there is fire. But the rumors surrounding the incident that took place on 5 May near the famous Arasan bathhouse have taken on the appearance of a smoke-screen: Rumor had it that one of the top officials in the republic MVD died in a mafia score-settling incident. In reality the incident was far more prosaic. At 2330 Colonel A. Seitov, chief of the MVD criminal investigations department, who lives near Imeni 28 Panfilov Soldiers Park, was taking his dog for a walk as usual. This time his whole family had decided to get a bit of fresh air: A. Seitov himself, and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. Some intoxicated young men, who were "having fun" at a commercial kiosk near the bathhouse, took a liking to the beautiful dog. Two of the six confronted the family and pulled out a gun: "Give us the dog or we will kill it." Admonishments, verbal warnings, and even an MVD officer ID produced no effect: The drunks continued to brandish their weapon. Then the colonel pulled out his standard-issue weapon and fired a warning shot in the air. Instead of coming back to their senses, the drinkers attacked the colonel and wounded his daughter- in-law. Then A. Seitov, too, used his weapon. One of the attackers-- B. Alpysbayev, 30-year-old director of the bathhouse men's department--was killed, and the other one was wounded. The procuracy initiated criminal proceedings against the attackers. It was found that A. Seitov's use of a firearm had been justified. Thus, there was no "score-settling;" nevertheless, an attack on, of all people, a top criminal investigations official is indeed troublesome: After all, we mere mortals do not carry standard-issue weapons for self-defense...
