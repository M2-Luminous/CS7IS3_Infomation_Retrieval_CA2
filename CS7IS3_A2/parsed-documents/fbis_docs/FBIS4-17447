Despite maximum efforts made by Georgia, participants in this round of talks failed to reach a compromise over the definition of a political status for Abkhazia. The next round of talks will be held in Moscow on 10 May. Russia will probably be able to influence Abkhazia at home. It has apparently had a chance of this before, too, but evidently waited for an appropriate moment and circumstances. A compromise formula suggested by Russia and the United Nations will be discussed during the Moscow round of talks. This formula, which was proposed back in Geneva but not discussed, says that Abkhazia will be a subject which will be granted sovereign rights within a union state. There was not sufficient time for this formula to be discussed during the Geneva round of talks. However, sovereign rights and a union state sound a little suspicious. At least, this does not sound very encouraging for Georgia. It seems that the Georgian side is forced to recede from its positions both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. According to an official version, two documents will comprise the basis of the Moscow discussions. These will be the UN and Russian suggestions on the political and legislative basics of an all-embracing settlement and the establishment of a coordinating commission with the participation of the negotiating parties as well as UN and Russian diplomats. The coordinating commission is expected to be assigned to handle practical issues pertaining to supply, transport, and communications. To cut a long story short, yet another round of negotiations is still to come and there is still something to pin hopes on. Aleksandre Kavsadze, the Georgian head of state's personal envoy, is in hopeful mood, believing that there is a chance to come to an agreement about the deployment of peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. He has added that Georgia insists on the deployment of these forces across the whole territory of the conflict in order to secure the safe return of Georgian refugees to their homes.
