Among other things, it stressed the fact "we have not planned and are not planning to build military bases on Latvian territory. This has to do only with the temporary functioning of a single Russian establishment under civilian control, the radar station in the city of Skrunda". (KRASNAYA ZVEZDA covered relations between our nations in greater detail on 20 April). Public opinion has also forced President of the Republic of Latvia Guntis Ulmanis to alter his position. He spoke out in favor of an agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops prior to 31 August of this year, on social protection for servicemen for the period of troop withdrawal and for temporary retention of the radar station at Skrunda. Speaking of the fourth agreement, which has to do with social protection for military pensioners and their families residing in Latvia, Ulmanis proposed the establishment of a group of experts, which would continue the quest for mutually acceptable solutions for the next 10 days. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned yesterday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Latvian President Ulmanis had reached agreement by telephone to hold a meeting in Moscow in the immediate future. The precise date of the meeting, at which it is planned to sign the initialed agreements between the two countries, specifically the one on the withdrawal of Russian troops and rent for the radar station at Skrunda, has apparently not yet been set.
