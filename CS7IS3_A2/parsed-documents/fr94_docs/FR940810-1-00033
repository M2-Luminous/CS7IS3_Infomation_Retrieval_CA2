FR940810-1-00033 FR940810-1-00007 Wednesday August 10, 1994 Part VI Department of Education 34 CFR Part 682 Federal Family Education Loan Program; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 153␣/␣Wednesday, August 10, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 682 RIN 1840&hyph;AC06 Federal Family Education Loan Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations. These amendments are needed to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), giving the Secretary additional powers to assure the safety of reserve funds and assets maintained by guaranty agencies insuring educational loans under the FFEL Program pursuant to agreements with the Secretary. The amendments would further define ``reserve funds and assets'' and establish the substantive standard for the return of ``unnecessary'' reserves. They would also provide procedural due process for challenges to these orders and for orders requiring that reserve funds and assets outside of the guaranty agency's control be returned to it or to the Secretary. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Mr. Donald M. Feuerstein, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 4624, Regional Office Building 3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5343. A copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management and Budget at the address listed in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of this preamble. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Donald M. Feuerstein, telephone: (202) 401&hyph;2280. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan programs). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, added section 422(g)(1) of the HEA. The conference report on OBRA states, ``*␣*␣* the conferees wish to emphasize that this language is not intended to diminish the longstanding and judicially-supported view that a guaranty agency's assets are dedicated to the loan programs and may not be used for unauthorized purposes. It is the conferees' further intention that all references to guaranty agency reserves contained in amendments to section 422 refer only to the 'federal portion' of such reserves.'' In the course of the negotiated rulemaking the industry negotiators stated that ``*␣*␣* Section 422 defines the federal portion of reserves as federal advances and earnings made on those advances, and states that non-Federal reserves are not subject to recall, repayment or recovery by the Secretary, except in the case of the termination of the guarantor's agreement with the Secretary in accordance with Sections 428(c)(9) (E) and (F).'' To protect the Federal fiscal interest, OBRA authorized the Secretary to direct (1) the return of ``unnecessary'' reserves from guaranty agencies (section 422(g)(1)(A)), (2) the return to the guaranty agency or to the Secretary of guaranty agency reserves and assets held by, or under the control of, any other party (section 422(g)(1)(B)), and (3) guaranty agencies to cease and desist from ``misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure'' of reserve funds and assets (section 422(g)(1)(C)). Negotiated Rulemaking OBRA expressly provides that determinations under section 422(g)(1) (A) and (B) be based on standards set forth in regulations subject to negotiated rulemaking. The negotiated regulations are also to contain procedures for administrative due process. Although no such requirement was made for determinations under section 422(g)(1)(C), the conference report on OBRA expressed the conferees' intent that the issue of ``recovery'' in the case of misuse, misapplication, or improper expenditure be ``addressed'' during the negotiated rulemaking over the first two subsections.
