Deserving industrial enterprises are to receive the same level of--if not more--loans as last year while some of those with no hope of returning to profits will see the previous heavy transfusions of bank loans cut off. Analysts say the latest credit policy statements underscore a more determined approach to prevent moribund industrial enterprises drawing off funds which could be better used by those which are making profits, or showing signs of making real financial progress. The latest guidelines state that loans to profitable state enterprises in the next two years generally should not be less than last year's level. Indeed, more loans could be given to the money-making enterprises if bank deposits go up this year and next year. Money-losing enterprises which could reduce their losses in the next two years should continue to receive loans from banks to cover their working capital. "Appropriate support should be given to enterprises which could reduce their losses or even turn around in these two years to help them tide over their difficulties," says a report. "Credit should be tightened for those with no hope of turning around and whose assets cannot sustain their debts so that they could face bankruptcy." These guidelines come at a time when foreign economists are increasingly concerned that the biggest obstacles to the country's economic reform programme are the moribund state enterprises which still make up a sizeable portion of its industrial base. The fear that the political implications of removing them as burdens to the state could prove too arduous--at least, while paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is alive and no one is prepared to make stern decisions. A recent report by Baring Securities, for example, points out that there are 500 enterprises which lose more than 500 million yuan (about HK$445.5 million) a year. Tang Xu, deputy director of the Graduate School of the People's Bank, said while even some money-losing enterprises would continue to receive loans for working capital, they were under increasing pressure to tighten their operations. "The lending policy is certainly tighter now, as unprofitable enterprises will have to convince banks that they can become leaner and fitter in order to get loans," Mr Tang said. He added that as the country had yet to have a social security system in place, it would be unthinkable to force all money-losing enterprises to go under. "How do you take care of those who are laid off? That is a bigger social question which the central authorities will have to handle." State enterprises essentially still take care of the cradle-to-grave needs of their employees, and if many are forced to close, would become a politically destabilising influence. Indeed, some Hong Kong analysts believe that unemployment could become a potentially more serious problem than inflation, if not handled well.
