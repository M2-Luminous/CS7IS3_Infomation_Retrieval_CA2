Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe told this week's edition of THE NEWS magazine that a deal was done between General Gowon and Cameroon leader Ahmadou Ahidjo. This was the first time a senior Nigerian official acknowledged the deal since the dispute over Bakassi Peninsula, a 1,000 square kilometre territory in the Gulf of Guinea, flared again at the beginning of this year. Gowon has until now denied signing an accord ceding the territory. The treaty, however, was not ratified by the Supreme Military Council, the highest decision-making organ during the Gowon regime, before he was toppled in July 1975 in a coup, the minister said. The military governments of Generals Murtala Mohamed and Olusegun Obasanjo that succeeded his regime immediately repudiated the agreement, he added. Consequently, "that is a dead treaty" and "all the superficial arguments which Cameroon has been dangling (over the issue) do not help," he added. [passage omitted]
