FR940712-2-00092 FR940712-2-00063 [Release No. 34&hyph;34321; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;36] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Small Order Execution System Tier Size Classifications July 6, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NASD is submitting this filing to effectuate The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s (``Nasdaq'') periodic reclassification of Nasdaq National Market (``NNM'') securities into appropriate tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size tiers for Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq market makers in NNM securities. Since the NASD's proposal is an interpretation of existing NASD rules, there are no language changes. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the rule change is to effectuate Nasdaq's periodic reclassification of NNM securities into appropriate tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size tiers for SOES and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq market makers in NNM securities. Nasdaq reviews the tier level applicable to each security periodically (approximately every six months) to determine if the trading characteristics of the issue have changed so as to warrant a tier level adjustment. Such a review was conducted as of February 28, 1994, using the following established criteria: 1 1 The classification criteria is set forth in footnote 1 to Section (a)(7) of the SOES Rules and Section 2(a) of Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws. NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of 3,000 shares or more a day, a bid price less than or equal to $100, and three or more market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 1,000 shares and a maximum SOES order size of 500 shares; 2 2 On December 23, 1993, the Commission approved a reduction in the maximum SOES tier size to 500 shares from 1,000 shares. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33377 (Dec. 23, 1993), 58 FR 69419 (Dec. 30, 1993). Even though the maximum order size for SOES is now 500 shares, Nasdaq has continued to classify NNM securities within the 1,000 share tier size because Nasdaq market makers must continue to display a size of 1,000 shares in their quotations for these securities, and remain firm for a minimum of 1,000 shares at their publicized quotations in these securities for orders outside of SOES. NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of 1,000 shares or more a day, a bid price less than or equal to $150, and two or more market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 500 shares and a maximum SOES order size of 500 shares; and NNM securities with an average daily non-block volume of less than 1,000 shares a day, a bid price less than or equal to $250, and less than two market makers are subject to a minimum quotation size requirement of 200 shares and a maximum SOES order size of 200 shares. Pursuant to the application of this classification criteria, 500 NNM securities will be reclassified effective July 11, 1994. These 500 NNM securities are set out in the NASD's Notice To Members 94&hyph;48 (June 1994). In ranking NNM securities pursuant to the established classification criteria, Nasdaq followed the changes dictated by the criteria with two exceptions. First, an issue was not moved more than one tier size level. For example, if an issue was previously categorized in the 1,000-share tier size, it would not be permitted to move to the 200-share tier even if the reclassification criteria showed that such a move was warranted. In adopting this policy, Nasdaq was attempting to maintain adequate public investor access to the market for issues in which the tier size level decreased and minimize market maker exposure in issues for which the tier size level increased. Second, for eight securities priced below $1 where the reclassification called for a reduction in tier size, Nasdaq determined not to recommend a decline in tier size given the low price of these securities and the negligible effect on market maker exposure. As a result, five securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 200 shares from 500 shares remained at 500 shares and three securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 500 shares from 1,000 shares remained at 1,000 shares. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section 15A(b)(11) applies to the form and content of quotations. Section 15A(b)(11) requires that rules relating to quotations must be fair and informative so as to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations. The NASD believes that the reassignment of NNM securities within SOES tier size levels and minimum quotation size levels will further these ends by providing an efficient mechanism for small, retail investors to execute their orders on Nasdaq and providing investors with the assurance that they can effect trades up to a certain size at the quotations displayed on Nasdaq. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
