A source close to the FALA General Staff has said that such statements are a pretext by the Luanda regime to cover offensives launched by its forces in the area. Our source said there is no reason to investigate who, in fact, is responsible for what happened because this is part of a powerful propaganda campaign by the Eduardo dos Santos regime, which is searching for approval in the eyes of the U.S. Government. The same source said this is the second attack of this kind since the failed attempt to incriminate UNITA as responsible for the attack on Malongo in Cabinda Province. Our source concluded by appealing to the international community not to be taken in by the fallacious propaganda of the Luanda regime, since they are bent on boycotting the round of talks.
