FR940419-0-00102 FR940419-0-00020 A new §92.4 is added to implement a Department-wide policy that provides for the expiration of interim rules within a set period of time if they are not issued in final form before the end of the period. The expiration period may be extended by notice published in the Federal Register . The expiration date for the HOME interim rule is June 30, 1995. While reconstruction is considered a rehabilitation activity for the general purposes of the HOME Program, this would not always be the case for complying with the environmental review requirements at §92.352. If a HOME-assisted project is reconstructed upon the same foundation or footprint as the original structure, it may be treated as a rehabilitation project for the purposes of complying with part 50 and part 58. However, the reconstruction of a structure on another portion of the lot must be treated as new construction for purposes of part 50 and part 58. The treatment of administrative costs as eligible HOME costs is clarified in this rule. The definition of administrative costs is removed from §92.2 and incorporated into §92.207, a section previously held in reserve, where administrative and planning costs are listed as eligible costs. The reference to project delivery costs that were a part of the definition of administrative costs is deleted and a more specific and useful reference is made to staff and overhead costs directly related to a project. In addition, participating jurisdictions are given the option of charging such staff and overhead costs as a ``related soft cost'' of a project, under a new §92.206(c)(6), or as an administrative cost under §92.207. If charged as an administrative cost, these costs are included in the ten percent cap applicable to administrative and planning costs. If charged to specific projects as related soft costs, these costs must be prorated among HOME-assisted units, and are subject to the maximum per unit subsidy limits and matching requirements. A typographical error in the definition of single room occupancy in §92.2 is corrected by replacing, in the third sentence of the definition, the word ``residual'' with ``residential.'' Section 92.50(f) is redesignated as §92.50(d)(5), and its applicability is limited to paragraph 92.50(d) to conform to the intent expressed in Amendment No. 15 on page 14 of H.Rept. 103&hyph;273, the Conference Report for the Department's 1994 Fiscal Year appropriations with regard to minimum thresholds. The reference to ``housing strategy'' is deleted from the title of §92.61, since insular areas are no longer required to have one. A correction to §92.64(a)(1) (dealing with the applicability of HOME program requirements to insular areas) is made to delete references to §§92.208 through 92.210, which have been revised since first being cited in this section, and to the prohibition against using HOME funds to defray administrative costs. Section 92.150(b)(2) is revised to include the new eligible activities_administrative expenses, and community housing development organization (CHDO) operating expenses_as required in the program description that participating jurisdictions must submit. A conforming change is made to §92.204(a)(1) to remove the reference to §§92.208 through 92.210, which is no longer relevant because of amendments made to these sections.
