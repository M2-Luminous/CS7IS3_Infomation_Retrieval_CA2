France is a country "in which protection, deemed vital by the vast majority of the population, could be regarded as a constraint for the economy," the prime minister said, but "this constraint must be fully accepted." He explained that social security had "a great advantage in preventing risks of social conflagration, which would be inevitable if this system did not exist." The prime minister warned that we "must not expect that France, like other large countries, can create millions of jobs which are paid scarcely more than one-fourth of the minimum wage...; that is not our social and political system." Although it is necessary to make "efforts" to reduce business costs, we must "think" about means of funding social security by "other methods." Balladur wondered whether it would be possible to "partly substitute, add, or replace" the existing funding "based on salaries" by "methods of funding based on consumption or revenue." This big fall debate will probably turn this vast and necessary reform into one of the themes of the presidential campaign, which Mitterrand's successor will have to implement.
