Compliance costs compared to revenue 3. Methodology for Calculating Impacts a. Baseline. The baseline economic analysis evaluates each facility's financial operating condition prior to incurring compliance costs for this regulation. The purpose of the baseline analysis is to identify PFPR facilities that are currently experiencing or are projected to experience significant financial stress following the period for which the Survey was completed. These facilities are having or are expected to have serious financial difficulties regardless of the promulgation of effluent guidelines. Attribution of these financial difficulties to the effluent guidelines rather than to facilities' current financial problems would inaccurately represent the burden of the effluent guidelines. Facility financial viability is analyzed in the baseline scenario by calculating the three-year after-tax cash flow from the Survey data, incorporating the costs of EPA regulations effective after the Survey was administered. If a facility has lost cash on average over the three-year period, the facility is not expected to continue in operation and post-compliance impacts are not evaluated. This baseline analysis included the estimated costs associated with three significant EPA regulations which were not in place in 1988 (the base year) and whose costs were therefore not reflected in the annual operating expenses provided by facilities in the 1988 Survey. These regulations are: (1) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) land disposal restrictions (40 CFR part 268), (2) effluent limitations for the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) industry (40 CFR part 414), and (3) effluent limitations for the Pesticide Manufacturing Industry (40 CFR part 455). Also, Congress passed the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Amendments of 1988, most of which became effective in December, 1988. The annual product maintenance fees mandated by the amendments therefore would not have been included in the Survey responses and are therefore added to facility costs in the baseline. An estimated 18 facilities are projected to incur costs due to the RCRA land disposal restrictions in the baseline analysis. As a result of the RCRA restrictions, these 18 facilities are expected to incur annualized costs of $156,000, in 1988 dollars. These costs reflect compliance with land disposal restrictions and include outlays associated with landfills, surface impoundments, and waste piles. In addition, an estimated 15 facilities are projected to incur costs due to the OCPSF effluent guidelines in the baseline analysis. The OCPSF guidelines are estimated to impose annualized costs of $5.4 million, in 1988 dollars, on these 15 facilities. Two effects of effluent guidelines for pesticide manufacturers are included in the analysis. First, a portion of the compliance costs resulting from the effluent guidelines are expected to be passed on to the PFPR facilities. Therefore, PFPR facilities are expected to incur higher costs in purchasing PAIs that had costs under the manufacturing rule. Of the 634 PFPR facilities that discharge water from PFPR operations, 525 are expected to bear such increased costs, totaling $3.4 million per year. Not all of the compliance costs associated with the pesticide manufacturers effluent guideline, however, are expected to be passed on to consumers. Therefore, additional annualized costs ($5.6 million) are added to the baseline for the pesticide manufacturer facilities that also PFPR. Finally, all pesticide producing establishments must pay annual FIFRA maintenance fees. These fees are not expected to result in capital costs, but annual operating costs borne by the facilities are expected to increase by $3.0 million (1988). b. Post-compliance. For this EIA, a PFPR facility is defined as all operations conducted at a facility that formulates, packages, or repackages pesticide products. The facility closure analysis is based on an evaluation of baseline and post-compliance facility after-tax cash flows. Following calculation of baseline after-tax cash flow, projected regulatory costs were added to the baseline costs. Total post-compliance costs were then used to estimate a post-compliance cash flow. A facility closure is projected to result from the regulation if the baseline after-tax cash flow is positive and the post-compliance after-tax cash flow is negative (i.e., if a facility begins to lose cash due to the regulation). In theory, conversion of PFPR production lines would be predicted to occur at the point that the return on the assets employed in an alternate activity, adjusted for conversion costs, exceed the return from PFPR. The return available from another activity, however, would vary for each facility based on such factors as local/regional manufacturing activity, capacity availability, and business connections. However, in general, it is expected that alternate FPR opportunities exist in the operations characterized by SIC codes # 2899 (chemical preparations) and # 2842 (manufacturing furniture, metal, and other polishes.) These SIC codes were the most frequently reported primary SIC codes for PFPR facilities that obtain less than 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR.
