This year's "two sessions" are soon to open. The past year was the first year after the party proposed building the socialist market economy at its 14th national congress. Though the voyage has not been "soul-stirring," it nevertheless followed "an uneven course." It has been a year of moving toward maturity. At this year's "two sessions," the deputies [to the National People's Congress (NPC)] and members [of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) ] will deliberate and discuss the government work report. They will naturally have a lot to say about this major subject. Seize the Opportunity: A Year of Brilliant Achievements. The "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee Is An Important Sign of "Moving Toward Maturity" People probably still remember clearly, even without looking through the old papers, that the keynote or hottest topic at last year's "two sessions" was "to seize the opportunity and speed up development" and "to seize the opportunity and speed up reform." This inspiring, enthusiastic momentum was especially keenly felt at the news briefings held in various provinces. One year has passed. The situation and figures indicate that the desired results were achieved. The GDP exceeded 3 trillion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous year; a bumper agricultural harvest was reaped and the added value of agriculture grew by 4 percent, with total grain output reaching 456.4 billion kg; the "bottleneck" industries were strengthened, and new records were created in the construction of new railway lines and the conversion of single-line tracks to multiple tracks; the total retail volume of consumer goods grew 11.6 percent over the previous year, with price hikes factored in; and so on and so forth. In a word, last year, China's economy carried forward the fast growth it had experienced in 1992. On the front of reform, the regulations on the "change of mechanism" for state-owned enterprises were implemented; diverse economic sectors were developed; explorations were made for the establishment of a modern enterprise system; price reform was deepened; and grain prices were decontrolled in more than 90 percent of all counties (cities). More importantly, proposals for the reform of the financial and tax system, the monetary system, the investment system, and the foreign trade system were formulated and promulgated one after another. What is particularly important is that the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System," made at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last November showed so complete a structure, so well-defined a framework, so original a mental approach, and such closely combined theory and practice that it amazed people both in and outside China. The birth of this magnificent and scientific blueprint that maps out the reform of our country in this century signals that our reform has smoothly reached the critical stage of overall advance and is also the most important indication that we have begun "moving toward maturity." "Ah, the unique view unfolds on this side of the trail." (A line from a poem written by Mao Zedong in 1934) Today, what people both within and outside the country can see is a socialist China enjoying economic development, political stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress. Have the Chinese seized the opportunity? How was the government work in the past year? The talks made by the old-generation revolutionaries, such as Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Chen Yun, just before the Spring Festival can be seen as a positive answer to this question on behalf of the whole nation. Macroregulation and Control: The Unforgettable 1993. Deepening the Comprehensive Understanding of Socialist Market Economy Through Practice Is Yet Another Manifestation of "Moving Toward Maturity" "Macroregulation and control" was probably the most characteristic content in 1993 economic life. When people were throwing enormous fervor into economic development and when the planned economy was being converted to the market economy at an accelerated pace, the inadequacy of understanding, the lack of experience, and the limiting angles often gave rise to some "blind spots" in people's vision. In the context of rapid economic development, should we guard against "overheating?" How shall we assess the messages from the "development zone rush," the "stocks rush," and the "real estate rush?" Is the latent deep-level danger growing? Faced with these and other questions, for a time, people developed differing opinions. At the end of the year before last, the central authorities gave some warning to "prevent overheating." Last year, at the beginning of the year and in March and April, the central authorities issued more reminders. But people did not quickly come to a consensus. The thought that "if you are overheated, I am not" became an argument "not for publication;" "I will do it my way" was interpreted as "market behavior;" and the "uneven heat distribution" caused by structural and inter-regional imbalance seemed to provide "evidence" for such ideas. As proved time and again by history, the phenomenon of "rushing headlong into action" that overstepped the bounds of feasibility resulting from "emulation" in "doing something good" is the most difficult to stop. People have been too eager to speed up development. But the most sensitive economic barometer, commodity prices, issued a serious warning. Not only did the price of steel products soar, the cost of living index in large cities exceeded 22 percent! Furthermore, there was serious disorder in the monetary sector, the lifeblood of the national economy: unchecked interbank loaning, rampant fund-raising, direct and indirect participation of banks in speculative real estate deals, and the excessive release of banknotes. If these problems could not be solved in good time, major fluctuations would be inevitable. It was under these circumstances that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council resolutely made the decision to strengthen and improve macroregulation and control. After that, the people's ideas gradually converged. The work on macroregulation and control was naturally difficult, but the desired results were soon achieved and what is commonly known as a "soft landing" was realized. The phenomenon of "issuing IOU's to purchase agricultural products," the solution to which had been demanded for many years, has been greatly changed this year, winning praise. Yet there is no need for reticence about the fact that the effects of macroregulation and control on the economic life are also multifaceted. The latent problems in some areas, which were born out of "overheating" were exposed earlier than they would have been because of the implementation of the regulation and control measures; other parts, due to lack of experience in controlling the strength and method of regulation and control, felt new difficulties. "Macroregulation and control" itself, for a time, became the most talked about and thought about issue. Work as One: Overall Advancement of Reform. To Give Full Play to Our Advantages in Implementation Is an Important Guarantee for "Moving Toward Maturity" "Macroregulation and control" was designed not to "check and stifle," but to "check and enliven." The new practice and new thinking in this area have generated two achievements that are of profound and far-reaching significance. Achievement one: People have come to realize that the market economy also requires macroregulation and control, which, at the current stage in the transition, should be even strengthened; and that today's macroregulation and control must conform to the market economy and therefore must be improved. It is essential to reform as well as an important element of reform. Achievement two: Under the leadership of the central authorities, a blueprint for realizing the socialist market economy in China was well drawn in terms of theory and the overall framework. In terms of concrete operations, various reform proposals were well designed after sufficient investigation, research, and repeated consultations and, with the right opportunity, were promulgated in good time. During the system changeover, what must be avoided at all costs is the "overlapping" of two problems. What kind of trouble will be created if enterprises that are not yet capable of "self-restraint" and a "laissez-faire market" come together? In the final analysis, whether we are looking at a problem which macroregulation and control aims to solve or a difficulty that macroregulation and control itself encounters, there are always underlying causes in the system. That is why it is only logical that strengthening and improving "macroregulation and control" should lead the way in the overall deepening of reform. There were also all kinds of comments and worries about the various reform proposals, especially those for financial and tax reform. Considering the risks of the "merging of two exchange rates," even foreign experts were seized with deep concern for us. In June, the exchange rate of U.S. dollars to renminbi reached 1:12, and some people even predicted that it would go up to 1:15. Could we hold our ground? But no sooner had the macroregulation and control measures been published than the exchange rate started to drop. After moving on a downward curve for some time, it rebounded. But the state exercised regulation and control with economic means, quickly stabilized the situation, and kept it down. Through this process, the state even obtained more foreign exchange. Comments coming from China and overseas said: That was a brilliant job! The reform of the tax system is considered worldwide to be one of the most difficult reforms. It once took the Japanese Diet three terms to adopt a new tax regime. It has been said that Mrs. Thatcher's stepping down was somewhat related to the change in the tax regime. A senior U.S. official said: In the United States, whoever does this job is probably the most unpopular person in the entire country. This is because any change in the tax system would touch the most extensive scope of interests. The current situation of China's tax system reform is different from that in the West, but people are nevertheless still worried that it will run into obstruction, give rise to disputes, and cause a shock. But the actual progress that has been made so far may well be called another "exception to the rule." It has not only exceeded what was generally predicted abroad, but has also been much smoother than what we ourselves originally imagined. Judging from what happened in January this year, the operation of the new tax system was normal. Though there were some operational problems in the convergence of old and new procedures, they did not have any negative impact on production and circulation. Tax revenue in January was 61 percent higher than the same period last year. As well as being a result of growth in production, it is also an achievement of the new tax system. Naturally, however, this is just a beginning. The above facts are another proof of this truth: In socialist China led by the communist party, as long as the central authorities, local authorities, and the people at all levels in the whole country work with one mind and make concerted efforts, any difficulties on the path ahead can be surmounted. Deepen Reform: The Focal Point of This Year's Work. To Handle Well the Relationship Among Reform, Development, and Stability Is the Key to "Moving Toward Maturity" At the beginning of the year, the central authorities put forward the 20-character principle, namely, "to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability [zhua zhu ji yu, shen hua gai ge, kuo da kai fang, cu jin fa zhan, bao chi wen ding 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651 4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353]. The forthcoming two sessions are bound to understand and implement this principle at greater depth. This year, when a number of major reform measures were being promulgated at the same time, the "acceleration" had in a sense become reality; and to implement these proposals and to carry on with reform in greater depth and in a down-to-earth manner is now the most important task. Development is the last word. Development also requires a new mental approach. In the context of rapid development, the key to avoiding the "chronic maladies" that have easily cropped up in past years is to introduce new mechanisms through reform and to push forward and catalyze development with the new mechanisms. This might constitute the background against which last year's "acceleration" can be converted to this year's "deepening" and "promotion." --How shall we continue to handle well the relationship among reform, development, and stability? --How shall we continue to realize the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy? How should we interpret the word "healthy?" --How can the stabilization of commodity prices be achieved? How is it intrinsically related to control on the scale of capital construction? --How can the exploration of ways to establish a modern enterprise system be integrated with the enhancement of the economic efficiency of state-owned enterprises? --How can such matters as anticorruption operation and improvement on social security, which people are concerned with, continue to be strengthened? People are hoping that, at this year's two sessions, the deputies and members will discuss these important issues from a higher, deeper, and more comprehensive perspective and make the corresponding decisions. "Another year of yearning, to the twittering of the swallows." The "two sessions," to be held in the spring season which is full of vitality and hope, herald a still more colorful [duo zi duo cai 1122 1217 1122 1752] future. People believe that, on the road of China's construction of the socialist market economy, 1994 will certainly be another year of "moving toward maturity!"
