Chen Zhili, an activist of the "Shanghai clique" and the former head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, did not take up the post as director of RENMIN RIBAO, as the news spread among the people. The ultra-leftists still have considerable influence in the ideological field. According to a source from Beijing's intellectual circles, Xu Weicheng, a trusted person in the Cultural Revolution and the 4 June incident, still holds the position as executive deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee in charge of ideological and political work. In the Central Propaganda Department, except for the department head Ding Guangen (a member of the Politburo highly trusted by Deng Xiaoping), Xu Weicheng holds the highest position. Although Cheng Bijian, former political secretary of the late General Secretary Hu Yaobang, has been transferred to the Central Propaganda Department to take charge of theoretical and propaganda work, his actual position is lower than Xu Weicheng's because of the latter's seniority in the Central Propaganda Department. Recently, Xu Weicheng made a speech at a national meeting to review experience of ideological and political work in enterprises. He criticized the view that "ideological work in enterprises is not indispensable," and expressed the necessity of strengthening the confidence of cadres in charge of political work in enterprises. At present, CPC committees and branches are being set up in Hong Kong- and Taiwan-invested enterprises in various localities so that CPC committees are able to exercise control over the workers and staff members in foreign-invested enterprises. Xu Weicheng has participated in the activities of enterprise party committees to strengthen ideological and political work. He stressed the necessity of guarding against Hong Kong and Taiwan investors who may take advantage of investment to carry out "peaceful evolution." A noted personality in Beijing's intellectual circles disclosed that Deng Liqun (the former head of the Propaganda Department and secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee), a "leftist prince" who is more famous than Xu Weicheng, harbors "resistant sentiments" against the replacement of the planned economy by the market economy, and is privately writing articles of criticism on this subject. In addition, the "leftist princes" in the literary and artistic circles -- including Lin Mohan, Liu Baiyu, Malqinhu, Zang Kejia, and so on -- who had murderous looks on their faces during the 4 June incident, also are controlling some ultra-leftist publications and are resisting in-depth economic structural reform by roundabout ways. Personalities from Beijing's intellectual circles pointed out: Deng Xiaoping has always employed his "political left hand" and "economic right hand" simultaneously so as to exercise absolute control over the ideological field in order to prevent the recurrence of the Hu Qili and Zhu Houze error of stressing material progress at the expense of cultural and ideological progress. That is why he still installed Xu Weicheng and Wang Renzhi, former head of the Central Propaganda Department, in important positions. Previously, Xu Weicheng, a trusted follower of Zhang Chunqiao, had been in charge of Shanghai's party newspaper JIEFANG RIBAO for a long time, and was transferred to be editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO during the Cultural Revolution. At that time, he set up the "Model of Huang Shuai" who, "although a pupil, dared to scold her teachers," and became a pawn of Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao in Beijing's propaganda circles. Xu and a number of leftist princes still hold power in the CPC's propaganda, theoretical, cultural, and educational departments and their affiliated organizations, which signifies that the "leftist poison" on the mainland has not been eliminated.
