This has been announced by the leading economic research institutes in their spring reports. The researchers expressed limited optimism in their study. However, changes in the financial and wage policies are required for a sustained upswing. Thus, the solidarity surcharge that is to be reintroduced next year should be gradually abolished again as of 1996. The scientists also criticized the predominance of certain lines of business in the market, mentioning the banks explicitly. Despite the criticism by the institutes, Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) believes that his financial course has clearly been confirmed. His policy has made a major contribution to the emerging reversal in the economic development. It is now important to continue the course of consolidation that has been initiated. The economic spokesman of the Bundestag group of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, Graf Lambsdorff, stated that it is particularly striking that the report is calling for tax reductions as a condition for a dynamic economic development. The economic and financial spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Lafontaine, interpreted the report by the economic experts as a confirmation for his party's call for a surcharge on income tax. The German Trade Union Federation called on the government to introduce an investment grant and to carry out planned public investments earlier. In this way, the government could make an independent contribution to an economic upswing. It should not solely rely on a recovery of the world economy. The German Employees' Union accused the institutes of ignoring the dramatic situation in the labor market. The employers, however, support the institutes' view that the machine times must be extended. In fact the bargaining autonomy has proven itself in a difficult economic situation, but a wage policy continues to be required that takes into consideration the considerable lack of jobs, the National Union of German Employer Associations stressed. The Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) endorsed the view of the experts that only a moderate economic recovery can be expected for the time being. The politicians responsible for economic policy must realize that support from the finance and tax policies is urgently required. In this spirit, the DIHT backs the demand for the gradual abolition of the solidarity surcharge. The National Association of German Banks expressed surprise over the institutes' assertion that the high profits in the banking industry are a sign of a lack of competition. This creates once more the impression that the profits of the credit institutions are made at the expense of other lines of business. This prevailing prejudice does not become justified through constant repetition, it stressed.
