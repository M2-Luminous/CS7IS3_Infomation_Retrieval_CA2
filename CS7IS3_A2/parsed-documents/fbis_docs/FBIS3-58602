Doubts expressed regarding Fininvest's property. AVVENIRE calls the 45 percent share of the company a "mystery," and Berlusconi's people threaten to sue. Who owns Fininvest? Why, Silvio Berlusconi, right? To get to Berlusconi, however, you have to pass through a filter of 22 companies--Holding Italiana One, then Two, Three, and so on, in boring progression, all the way to Holding Italiana Twenty-two. Some of these companies, which in business and financial jargon are called "empty boxes," are in the hands of two trustees: Servizio Italia of BNL [National Bank of Labor] and Parmafid of Milan. A study of this tight, complicated network of holdings reveals that only 50.35 percent of Fininvest is held "directly" by Berlusconi, while the rest is managed as a trust by Servizio Italia (exactly 45.8 percent) and by Parmafid. The figures were supplied in an investigative report published yesterday by the Catholic daily, AVVENIRE, which is full of new information (we have known about the 22 boxes for some time, but the exact figures on the shares held by the trustees had never been made public). Why do they need to play this game of Chinese boxes? AVVENIRE spoke of "mysteries" and of "a troublesome atmosphere of ambiguity and embarrassing cunning surrounding Fininvest." And although it does not want "to join the ranks of those who suspect the existence of a mysterious secret partner behind Berlusconi's success," the daily does reveal how the "empty boxes" serve to provide the companies with substantial tax advantages and are a "perfect system for avoiding taxes." Berlusconi's people did not like this report one bit. In a letter sent by Fininvest Communications to the AVVENIRE publisher, they maintained that "100 percent of the Group's ownership is directly or indirectly in the hands of the Berlusconi family"; reminded him that authorities and the financial world have known for more than a decade about how Fininvest's capital stock was structured"; insisted that the trusteeships are a "perfectly legitimate" instrument"; affirmed that "documents and disclosures had been provided to CONSOB [Commission for the Supervision of Companies and Stock Exchanges], their backers, and the Revenue Guards; and, lastly, stated that the investigation "did not discover anything new or wrong." Therefore, it was a "deliberate contribution to the press's attempt to misinform and denigrate Silvio Berlusconi for obvious political ends." That was the letter. But Fininvest also let it be known that they are evaluating possible "legal actions" against those who want to "use" the story of the 22 companies to make insinuations about "secret partners." So, there will be no lack of controversy, which is likely to be centered mostly around the issues of taxation. Although the game of trading off the earnings and losses of various companies is routinely used by businesses to avoid paying excessive taxes on earnings and although "avoiding" taxes is legitimate (using all the legal tax loopholes is called "avoiding taxes"), it becomes a different story when the entrepreneur--in this case, Berlusconi--enters politics and wages one of his first campaigns against "high taxes." But let us take a closer look at the story of the trustees. Last December, Mediobanca, which organizes the shareholding structures and the budget statements of the leading Italian companies, reported that "the entire capital stock of Fininvest is directly or indirectly in the hands of Silvio Berlusconi." Armed with Mediobanca's judgment, the people at Fininvest are insisting that "everything is clear, everything belongs to the Doctor (as Berlusconi is deferentially referred to at headquarters in Arcore). The network of holdings, however, is intricate. "It was set up 15 years ago and sooner or later we may change it, but enough of these suspicions. There is nothing mysterious here," explodes Fedele Confalonieri who will become the chairman of Fininvest if and when Berlusconi decides to enter politics directly. So let us go back 15 years, to June 1978, when two tax accountants, Armando Minna and Nicla [as published] Crocitto, set up the 22 holding companies for Silvio Berlusconi with a sole director, Luigi Foscale, Berlusconi's uncle and the father of Giancarlo Foscale, the current president of the Standa chain. Still in 1978, two trustees of the BNL (which at that time was headed by the Socialist Nerio Nesi, who was then replaced in 1989 by another Socialist, Giampiero Cantoni), that is, the Servizio Italia and SAF [expansion unknown], were involved in the creation of Fininvest Roma, which in turn would incorporate Fininvest Milano. Servizio Italia is still being used. It holds trustee management ("passive, or nonoperational management," BNL points out) of 42 percent of Fininvest's capital stock to which must be added an additional 3 percent, if you consider Holding Italiana Seven's 55 percent, in order to arrive at the 45 percent we mentioned in the beginning of this article. Parmafid is also in the picture. It is a trustee headquartered at 2 Via Sant'Orsola in Milan and its director is the accountant Roberto Massimo Filippa. Parmafid controls 49 percent of Fininvest's Holding Italiana One and 10 percent of Holdings Two, Three, Four, Five, Twenty-one, and Twenty-two. The total is just over 4 percent of Fininvest and, thus, the figures add up. Why does Fininvest play this game of holdings and trusteeships? One explanation can be found if we look at three of the companies in this tangle: Nodit, Sodif (former Gaumont Italia), and Videotrading (former Costa, a "tax haven" of Costa Shipbuilders that Berlusconi bought in 1987). All three were loaded with debts, and the rather strong earnings in early years from the television rights paid by the Fininvest networks were, to a large extent, written off against their losses. In November 1992, L'ESPRESSO stated that in a few years' time "180 billion lire had passed from Fininvest to Berlusconi without being subject to taxation." It was all legal, of course, just like in so many other respectable companies.
