"The government has been in office since September last year when the ongoing executive power crisis was worsened by the energy and payment crises which resulted from the ill-considered price and credit policy of the previous government," he said. "At that time forecasts were heard both inside the government and in the media that Ukraine would not survive the crisis and would lose its sovereignty. Therefore, the new government's urgent steps included, first of all, prevention of the payment crisis. The government allocated 2,300 billion karbovantsi in credits and 6,300 billion karbovantsi in budget grants for the harvest and spring sowing. Already 1.3 million of the envisaged 2 million [metric] tonnes of oil products have been supplied to the countryside. The presidential decree `On provision of finance and credits toward food procurement' was aimed at creating more favorable conditions in agriculture." One of the government's achievements, according to Zvyahilskyy, was the overcoming of the energy crisis. The energy complex was on the brink of collapse, therefore, the government used hard currency to improve the situation and deliver fuel supplies on more favorable terms than last year. Over five million tonnes of coal was supplied to electric power stations. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of all types of energy in the industry and at home, "which did not make the government any more popular." However, a number of legislative acts were not passed, including a law on energy saving. The government coordinated the price, budget, and credit policies. "Price control by economic means must become part and parcel of our economic policy," Zvyahilskyy said. "We were warned that all government actions aimed at controlling the prices would lead to accumulation of inflation potential, therefore we had to keep looking for ways of curbing it irrespective of the economic situation. I believe that inflation would make progress if the present government's policy were suddenly changed. "During our discussions with the National Bank we concluded that it was not necessary to subordinate the National Bank of Ukraine to the Cabinet of Ministers. The government was forced to propose a deficit-free budget to the Supreme Council." As regards currency regulation, Zvyahilskyy believes, the government proceeds from the position that prices for energy-carriers, which condition prices for all other goods, including food, fuel and lubricants, and medicines depend on the level of the karbovanets exchange rate. The regulated exchange rate of the karbovanets, together with the government's other antiinflationary measures, facilitated the stabilization of prices on the domestic market. If the real exchange rate of the karbovanets in relation to the dollar fell by 43 times in commercial banks in the whole of 1993, and by 13 times in relation to the Russian ruble, then in five months of this year it fell by 45 percent in relation to the dollar, which corresponds to the volume of the National Bank's credit emission, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets in relation to the Russian ruble remains stable. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy expressed the conviction that the regulated exchange rate of the karbovanets should remain and that trading at the exchange should not be resumed until the karbovanets strengthens. Otherwise, on the first day [of trading] the measures to restrain inflation would have been exhausted. The level of the average wage is periodically reviewed in order to ensure the social protection of the population. Thus, if the average wage was 81,000 karbovantsi in August last year, then it was 880,000 karbovantsi in April of this year. The poverty level is determined and payments in connection with the price rises have been established with the aim of increasing the targeting of payments. The regulation of consumption funds has been reviewed. Foreign economic activity is an important factor in the development of the Ukrainian economy. This year, Ukraine's exports were $2.9 million, and imports were $2.9 million. The negative balance of foreign payments has been reduced by several times. Among the main problems needing urgent resolution, Yukhym Zvyahilskyy singled out the summer harvesting, timely preparations for the winter, and, the most important thing, overcoming the decline in production.
