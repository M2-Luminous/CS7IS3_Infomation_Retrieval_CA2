The following is presented as an example of how the OSHA-SLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this requirement. Data for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October 1980 through April 1986. Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently of one another. The standard deviation and the CV statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm 2 . A least squares regression was performed using the following equation: CV=antilog1 10 [A(log 10 (x)) 2 +B(log 10 (x))+C] where: x=the number of fibers/mm 2 Application of least squares gave: A=0.182205 B=^0.973343 C=0.327499 Using these values, the equation becomes: CV=antilog 10 [0.182205(log 10 (x)) 2 ^0.973343(log 10 (x))+0.327499]
