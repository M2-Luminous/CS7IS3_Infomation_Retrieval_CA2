He noted that the necessary financial assistance for Ingushetia and North Ossetia have not yet been received by the warring parties. Not a single refugee has been able to return back home. At the same time, Abdulatipov said that according to the results of criminal investigations, up to 1,000 criminal cases have been lodged in the conflict zone. He believes that Russia's uncertain policy toward Chechnya, as well as the absence of any coherent concept with regard to the north Caucasian region, plays a destabilizing role in the north Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation Council intends to appeal to Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of government, to accelerate the settlement of the problems stemming from the Ossetian-Ingush conflict.
