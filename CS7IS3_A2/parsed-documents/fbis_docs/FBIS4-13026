In an article today, the paper says that the incident involving two helicopters in Iraqi Kurdistan demonstrates to the entire world the nature of the complicated and dangerous situation faced by that dear part of Iraq under the coalition troops. It says that this situation requires the employment of all possible political means to secure the withdrawal of the aggressors from the region and the return of the Iraqi state to Kurdistan in order to help our Kurdish people and serve peace and security in the entire region. BABIL adds that, since the latest UN Security Council session on so-called human rights, the United States has been engaged in a systematic campaign against Iraq and has accused it of masterminding attacks against UN officials and observers in Kurdistan. This is despite Iraq's repeated denials of such allegations. This proves Washington's premeditated intentions against Iraq, especially to carry out a fresh aggression against Iraq, perhaps without referring to the Security Council.
