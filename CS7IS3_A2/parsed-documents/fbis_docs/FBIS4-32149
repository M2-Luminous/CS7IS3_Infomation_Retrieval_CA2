I do not believe that the president will be the one to stand in its way," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after his meeting with President Zhelyu Zhelev today. They talked about mass privatization and the Privatization Act for an hour. In the last few days, the president has been holding consultations with experts, law-makers, and representatives of the private business and the public sector on the Privatization Act amendments providing for mass privatization. The president is expected to decide whether to impose a suspensory veto on the act by June 23. Asked if Dr. Zhelev was going to veto the act, Dr. Berov said that it was up to the president to decide, adding that the balance was hardly tipped that way. "Referring the act back to parliament will be a losing move and I do not believe that the president will do it," Prime Minister Berov emphasized. In his view, those who advised the president against mass privatization were guided by self-seeking interests. "In addition to the implementing regulations, the Privatization Act should be complemented with an act on the investment privatization funds," Prof. Berov said. However, he doubts that the incumbent parliament will have time to adopt such legislation. He said that all issues arising in connection with the Mass Privatization Act will be regulated by decrees and ordinances. According to Prof. Berov, the list of the 500 enterprises subject to privatization is not final and can always be corrected, but it serves as a basis one can proceed from. "I have been mandated by this parliament to work until the end of September and do a certain job, and that is what I am doing. If the application of the Privatization Act is delayed, then parliament will have its say," Prime Minister Berov said when asked if he would resign in case of a presidential suspensory veto on the Privatization Act. "Parliament should either revote the act or accept the veto," he said.
