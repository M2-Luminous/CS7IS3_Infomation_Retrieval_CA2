Kovacevic believes this will be "yet another trick" of the Socialist Party of Serbia which, he believes, wants to retain the existing, completely unjust electoral system. "The Socialists would like to use this move to prolong their authority, despite the fact that two-thirds of Serbia's citizens do not vote for them," the SPO spokesman said.
