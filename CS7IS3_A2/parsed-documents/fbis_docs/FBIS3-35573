The Muslim Palestinians protested yesterday against this merciless killing, which has grievously wounded the conscience of mankind. They held strikes and, despite the curfew imposed by the Zionist armed forces, they spilled onto the streets to demonstrate and clashed with the Zionist soldiers. In these clashes, three Palestinians were killed by the Zionist executioners and nearly 50 others were wounded. Thus, the number of victims killed or wounded at the hands of the Zionist forces in the past two days has reached 300. The indignant Palestinian demonstrators attacked 40 Israeli targets with bombs. One of the most important and distinctive characteristics of the demonstrations in the past two days in the territories occupied since 1948--where the Palestinians are a minority of the population--is the flourishing of the intifadah. The staging of extensive demonstrations in the cities of Nazareth and Yafo and the southern environs of Tel Aviv by the incensed Palestinians and the setting afire of dozens of vehicles and stores belonging to the Zionists are unprecedented in the past decade. The anger and frenzy of the Palestinian Muslims at the staggering atrocity committed by the Zionists in the al-Ibrahimi shrine was so extensive that for the first time the Zionist regime has imposed a curfew in order to protect the lives of the Jews in the settlements the West Bank and Gaza Strip. According to political observers, at its session today the Zionist cabinet may make some decisions in order to placate the enraged Muslims because of the pressure due to the spread of the Palestinian Muslims' intifadah in the past two days. Some Palestinian prisoners may be released in this regard. The UN Security Council session is to conclude its deliberations today on the recent crime of the Zionists. In view of the fact that the United States gives quite a lot of arms and financial and economic assistance to the Zionist regime and thus is a de facto accomplice to all the crimes of this racist regime, it is possible that in its usual way the United States will use its influence in the Security Council to prevent the UN from playing its legitimate role in the Palestinian crisis. Political analysts believe that the heart wrenching crime at the al-Ibrahimi shrine has highlighted the fact that the greater the international legitimacy attributed to the Zionists, the more crimes they will commit. This incident further proves that the Zionist settlements in the occupied territories are a major problem, and coexistence between the Palestinians and the residents of the Zionist settlements, which is envisaged in the Gaza-Jericho accord, is very questionable. The extensive demonstrations by the people and students in Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, and the demand for the immediate cessation of the talks and the breaking of all kinds of relations with the transgressor Zionist regime show that the Muslim people of the region do not concur with the policies adopted by their governments. This places the Arab countries in a position where they have to make a fateful choice on whether to choose their people or the Zionist regime.
