Kebich survived a no confidence vote in the Belarussian parliament Wednesday [26 January], but the Belarusian lawmakers managed to oust Parliament Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich. Commenting on the developments in Minsk, Slezevicius told reporters Thursday that the search for solutions to several disputed problems, like the Adutiskis railroad station, has stopped and experts have "used up their ability" to deal with these matters. The Lithuanian premier said he is glad that Lithuania joins NATO's Partnership for Peace program. "We want Lithuania to be among the first in this field, and this is a very important step in enhancing security and considering Kozyrev's (Russian foreign minister) statements." Commenting on the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party's proposal to take a no confidence vote in the government, Slezevicius said the initiative is a "normal action...and the right of all politicians and political parties." The premier said the social democrats simply try "to attract attention to a petty party that is poorly represented in the parliament." Slezevicius said the earlier governments failed to stabilize the economy and to stop crime.
