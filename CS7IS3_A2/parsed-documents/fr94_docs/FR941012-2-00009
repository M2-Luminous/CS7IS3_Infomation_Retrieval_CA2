ACTION: Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On November 24, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT) the final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in Pulton Chain Co., v. United States (Slip Op. 93&hyph;202, October 18, 1993). On December 14, 1993, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 93&hyph;235). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and the April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, periods with respect to Pulton Chain Co. (Pulton). Pulton's rate is 5.22 percent for the 1981&hyph;1982 period and 5.45 percent for the 1982&hyph;1983 period. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas W. Prosser or Wendy J. Frankel, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 18, 1993, the CIT, in Pulton Chain Co., v. United States (Slip Op. 93&hyph;020, October 18, 1993), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of the April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on roller chain, other than bicycle, from Japan (38 FR 9226; April 12, 1973). In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Pulton roller chain sold or imported into the United States during the periods April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, was 15.92 percent. Pulton's dumping margin for those final results was based on best information available (BIA), in accordance with Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (the Act) ( see Roller Chain from Japan, Final Results of the Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, 56 FR 32175 (July 15, 1991)). On October 18, 1993, the CIT remanded this case to the Department ``to apply BIA rates based on the calculated rates for other exporters during the period at issue, or to calculate an actual antidumping duty rate for [Pulton]'' ( see Pulton Chain Co. v. United States (Slip Op. 93&hyph;202)). Final Remand Results In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Pulton for the 1981&hyph;1982 and 1982&hyph;1983 administrative reviews of roller chain from Japan. On the basis of the BIA margins sanctioned by the CIT, we determined that the revised weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, is 5.22 percent and the weighted-average margin for Pulton for the period April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983, is 5.45 percent. FINAL RESULTS OF REDETERMINATION: On December 14, 1993, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 93&hyph;235). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the April 1, 1981, through March 31, 1982, and the April 1, 1982, through March 31, 1983 periods with respect to Pulton. Pulton's rate for the 1981&hyph;1982 period is 5.22 percent and for the 1982&hyph;1983 period it is 5.45 percent. The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. This notice is in accordance with section 516(a)(e) of the Act. Dated: September 28, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25082 Filed 10&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
