In particular, we expected this move to give the bank a greater credibility vis-a-vis the markets, thus leading to the possibility of lower interest rates. Has this hope been realized? [Trichet] The Bank of France and its Monetary Policy Council [CPM] have been independent since the law of 4 August was completed by the law of 31 December. It appears to me that the franc has benefited by obtaining an increased level of credibility on all markets. The independence of the central bank has increased the reliability of a stable monetary policy required by law, and this has enabled us, for example, to halve interest rates since the start of 1993. The world and national markets must be convinced that the wise men on the CPM, charged by law with ensuring price stability, are making their decisions in all honesty and with the sole aim of respecting the law in the interests of our economy. [Robin] Has not defending the franc within the European Monetary System [EMS] become an overriding priority, to the detriment of all other considerations? [Trichet] The problem cannot be viewed that way. The law requires that we ensure price stability. Successive governments have attached a great deal of importance to the EMS exchange rate mechanism. The work of the CPM is aimed at the following strategic goal: The final objective is price stability -- less than 2 percent in future years. On the basis of that, our initial, intermediate aim is to ensure the stability of the external value of our currency in the framework of the EMS exchange rate mechanism, as confirmed by the ministers and [central bank] governors of the European Union [EU] on 2 August 1993. We also have a domestic monetary aim: the simultaneous monitoring of the M3 monetary aggregate and of the preferential indicator of total domestic borrowing. Leaving aside this technical explanation, I would like to make one very simple point: The CPM has clearly defined monetary policy for 1994 and the coming years in the context of noninflationary growth. This noninflationary growth had yet to appear by January 1994, the last time we met. It is more apparent now, as we can see from the INSEE [National Statistics Office] and Bank of France surveys. For five months now, since November 1993, company bosses have been telling our surveys that the economic climate is improving. [Robin] Is monetary stability compatible with rapid economic growth? [Trichet] Yes. I even think, if you take a step back and look at the situation, that it is a precondition for rapid growth. Anyway, there is not a single central bank governor who will state that he is implementing a weak or unstable monetary policy and who is not in favor of domestic monetary stability. I do not know anyone who would say that. [Robin] Even in the United States? [Trichet] Naturally, the Federal Reserve is no exception. We are living in a world system which even applies to the countries of the East and the former Soviet Union. We are really in a globalized system: If you deliberately project an image of weakness, you will immediately and quite rightly pay the price. Any investor in Tokyo, Singapore, or New York would be entitled to claim a "risk bonus" from a country that tells him he will be paid in an unstable currency! A responsible monetary strategy in the current world, and also in the French and European context, consists in supplementing economic policy with domestic and foreign currency stability. At the end of the day, this is the most effective way of obtaining the best level of investment. [Robin] For the Bundesbank, the stability of the German mark is seen as a function of a basket of 18 currencies. France, then, has to ensure the franc-mark parity. Do you not think that there is a degree of inequality between the positions of the two countries? [Trichet] No. The criterion that we use is membership of the multilateral European exchange rate mechanism, which unites nine economies and eight different currencies. Germany is a member, too. We have striven to externalize French monetary strategy -- as we have always done -- by stating our two objectives: an external aim, i.e., the exchange rate mechanism decided on by the EU governors and ministers on 2 August, and a domestic aim. Some countries go about it differently. That does not prevent these nine economies, including the French and the German economies, from participating in a multilateral system. It is a balanced system where all the countries obey the same rules. [Robin] Since it became independent, is not the Bank of France even more subjugated to the Bundesbank? [Trichet] The CPM defined France's monetary policy for 1994 in Paris, and makes its decisions on the basis of this policy in accordance with the law and in the interests of the French economy. In Frankfurt, the Bundesbank committee does the same thing for Germany. [Robin] At the current time, all European bond markets, and especially the French one, are suffering from the rise in U.S. interest rates. Is there not a way we could avoid this domino effect? [Trichet] All the markets have been caught up in the storm blowing in off the Atlantic. If we again take a step back, we see that the 10-year rates in France are 35 basis points off the German rates and 10 basis points off the Netherlands rates. In the general torment, the best performers so far have been the Germans, followed by the Dutch, with the French in third place. I have confidence in the main features of the French economy: low inflation, a foreign trade surplus, and healthy growth. I am convinced that the markets, after an understandably shaky period, will, as they have always done, take these objective factors into account since they argue the case for France and for Europe. [Robin] Can the European central banks continue to cut their key rates in this world context? [Trichet] The best way forward is to maintain a credible policy of monetary stability. You cannot navigate through a storm on a policy of instability. In these conditions, the European central banks can continue to cut their key rates if necessary, in a gradual and cautious way, and despite the rise in U.S. rates. This is the message that the governors of the European central banks have already sent out, notably Hans Tietmayer and myself, at last month's Frankfurt seminar. [Robin] In the letter that the governor of the Bank of France traditionally sends to the president of the Republic along with the bank's annual report, you express your concern about the size of the budget deficit. Is this your way of warning the government? [Trichet] The French Government, like all its European counterparts with the exception of the Luxembourg Government, has launched a medium-term budgetary recovery program. This is a good move which I applaud. I am convinced that this multiannual program will be methodically applied because it is important for the French economy. It is not a question of overdramatizing the situation: Our government debt today represents 44 percent of GDP, which is quite low compared with the European average. However, it is one more reason for us to maintain this relative advantage! [Robin] You say that the Bank of France's monetary strategy makes it possible, under the conditions of the world market, to have the lowest possible interest rate curve across the whole range of maturities. Does the level of short rates not constitute another handicap, especially for small- and medium-sized companies which have no other means of financing? [Trichet] This strategy of credibility and stability which does indeed take into account the whole range of interest rate curves, is definitely the strategy best suited to the country's investment requirements. Look at the situation: For our economy to be as active as possible, many observers or experts agree that housing and investment are important activating factors. In both cases, in France, financing at long- or medium-term fixed rates plays a key role: 90 percent of housing loans are made at long- or medium-term fixed rates. These are two excellent reasons for having a relatively low interest rate curve for long-term maturities, and this is indeed the case in France compared with other countries. Moreover, French households are net creditors, while, in many countries, they are debtors. When short-term rates drop, household incomes tend to fall. I do not think that that is an argument against cutting short-term rates, which are clearly also useful for the economy. However, this side of things has to be taken into account when you compare our monetary policy with other possible policies. Naturally, it is still true that our monetary policy has also made it possible to cut short-term rates significantly over the last 12 months by 600 base points, and that has helped small- and medium-sized companies and industries [SME-SMIs]. [Robin] These SME-SMIs are now complaining more than ever of a lack of credits. Does this not risk compromising the recovery? [Trichet] Some polls show that only 7 percent of managers complain about the cost of credit, much fewer than a year ago. The problem is therefore perhaps more about gaining access to credit than its actual cost. Of course, the central banks cannot be held responsible for that. However, the public authorities have thought about it and [Economics Minister] Alphandery has taken steps in this area. I am thinking especially of the guarantees accompanying SOFARIS [French Venture Capital company] loans, which could prove extremely useful at the current time. [Robin] Are you optimistic about the signs of economic recovery that has begun in France? [Trichet] The basic signs are good: We have a good rate of inflation and a large trade surplus, which means that the French economy is restarting in very healthy conditions. [Robin] The government debt, however, is increasing and, above all, a major share of it is held by foreign investors, which could frustrate a further reduction in interest rates. [Trichet] You have to look at our situation in the overall context. The total government debt, which is 44 percent of GDP, places us in a very favorable position with regard to the rest of Europe and the world. As for French securities (public and private shares and bonds) held by non-French nationals, they prove the international nature of our economy. We are the world's fourth largest exporter, the third largest per capita among the G-7 countries, and one of the leading foreign industrial investors. The French operate very much on the international level and perform very well, even if they do not always realize it. This neither brakes nor accelerates rate cuts. It simply means that, like all other major economies, we are involved in an interdependent worldwide system. [Robin] Tight monetary policy equals unemployment. How do you respond to this question? [Trichet] The countries that have been implementing a policy of monetary stability the longest are today those that are industrially the most powerful and who have experienced the highest overall growth: Germany and Japan. France itself, since it has had this kind of monetary policy, has equaled the best levels of growth over a long period. The real question is different: Why does French growth not create more jobs? This is an extremely complex problem which does not directly arise out of monetary policy. We have to show more imagination and make more of an effort to change our behavior in a number of areas so as to create more jobs for each "1 percent" of extra growth. [Robin] How do you explain the intense and continuing public criticism of monetary policy? Do you sometimes get the impression that the political world regrets ever having made the bank independent? [Trichet] Such criticism is rather a healthy factor in a democracy. Anyway, it proves that we are indeed independent! The worse thing for the franc would be if the Bank of France looked servile, if people sung our praises left and right, which would mean that the CPM was not really independent. That would run counter to the law and the interests of the country, since our independence was decided to increase the credibility of the franc. It is therefore a good thing that the bank appears so independent. However, the independence of the CPM does not mean we have cut off all contact between the bank and public officials, the president of the Republic, the prime minister, the economy minister, and Parliament. On the contrary, these relations are scrupulously defined by the law and are essential. Moreover, in a democracy it is the duty of every institution to listen, reflect, decide, explain, and, if possible, convince. The Bank of France's CPM will strive to listen as much as possible to the messages of our economy.
