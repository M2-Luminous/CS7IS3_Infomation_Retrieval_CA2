Therefore, the legislative branch is asked to give immediate attention to regulations on general elections and the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] SU [General Session], including the succession issue. Prof. Dawam Rahardjo said this Friday, 25 March, in Jakarta in reply to a KOMPAS question. Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan, member of the DPR [Parliament] from the FKP [Functional Group Faction], said in a separate interview that the mention of the succession issue by the chief of state is a sign that the issue needs to be discussed extensively. "This clearly was an effort by the chief of state to raise the political maturity of the Indonesian people," said Albert Hasibuan. Dawam Rahardjo is of the opinion that several matters actually are hidden behind the expanding issue of succession. First, there is the question of certainty as to whether Pak Harto [President Suharto] will be prepared to be president or not. If not, he said, there is the possibility of many political statements before the next MPR SU. Second, Dawam continued, is the succession process itself. Until now, this matter has appeared quite closed, such as, for example, with regard to presidential nominations. In the future, this matter must be made more transparent, so that people will know exactly whether a presidential candidate may campaign. "Up to now, what has happened has not been clear. Several days after the MPR SU, a presidential candidate emerges. Is that good for our country? Such a method implies that the presidency is decided only by certain groups. Although the MPR makes the decision, the people should participate in giving views on the candidates," Dawam said emphatically. President's Statement Touching on the president's recent explanations of succession, which he gave seven times, both Dawam and Albert Hasibuan felt it was a positive matter. The explanations were a sign from the chief of state that the time has come to discuss succession extensively and also an indication from the chief of state that he wants to increase the political maturity of the Indonesian people. According to Hasibuan, open discussion of the succession issue is an indication that democracy is developing, because one of the essences of democracy is freedom of discussion and expression of opinion, including discussion of political succession. Hasibuan sees the chief of state's statements on succession as not only an indication of political maturity and the existence of a democratic process, but also an effort to prevent the political unrest that usually occurs in some countries when political succession takes place. "I view the statements as a lesson from history, which often depicts political succession as accompanied by unrest," he said. Nevertheless, Dawam felt the president's repeated statements still did not appear very clear, because it turns out that they have been interpreted in various ways. Dawam feels that there are specific intentions behind the expanding discussion of succession. "There are those who want the next president to be a new person. Thus, there appears in these developments a desire to conduct a process of regeneration," Dawam explained. In connection with that, he continued, in order to face the new era the government should ensure that people begin to speak. If there are discussions on succession, the government should provide direction so that they are carried on in even greater detail. They should not be as in the past, when discussions were general and felt to be unclear. Many people still do not speak frankly. "The point is, there must be transparency," he asserted. No Taboos In this context, Hasibuan said, a discussion of succession requires that objectivity and rationality be important matters in political life. This means that all political arguments, deliberations, and interpretations must be based on principles of rationality and objectivity. The element of rationality, based on Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] and the 1945 Constitution, must be developed. With this in mind, Hasibuan said, there are automatically no political areas that are sacred or taboo. Therefore, succession needs to be discussed. "Although it may have been taboo in the past, it is not taboo now and needs to be discussed," he said. Hasibuan said further that discussion of succession must be oriented toward creation of political stability. "Thus, we cannot make talk of discussion taboo," he said. This means that a rational and objective discussion of succession encourages the view that leaders may come and go, but institutions continue. "That is political succession. Leaders come and go because of succession, but institutions continue," he said. Rational and objective political succession, Hasibuan said, encourages the choice of leaders when it is time. "We will discuss the criteria for leadership. 'The right leader, at the right place, at the right time.' Our rationale will be to select the one who is suited to be a leader," he said. A similar thought was expressed by Dawam, who feels that in the future the people expect improvements in succession processes and procedures, including the preparation of cadres. "A candidate should not be prepared by only one group, which also may be a small one. That is not what the people want. The people want a much more extensive process of political participation," Dawam asserted. Political Culture Meanwhile, Hotman M. Siahaan, lecturer at the Sociology and Political Science Faculty of Airlangga University, Surabaya, told KOMPAS that sociopolitical organizations need to anticipate the succession issue by improving the political culture, because the operation of the constitutional mechanism of succession will be much affected by the objective conditions of the political culture. If succession is expected to be democratic, efforts to renew the political culture must begin now, so that when the moment of succession comes, the democratic foundation will be strong. According to Hotman, a tradition of democracy and openness and a rational, objective attitude in political life do not yet have strong roots in the political culture in Indonesia. Remnants of feudal and aristocratic culture and of thinking based on primordial emotions still strongly color the political culture in Indonesia. The result is, when the succession issue--which basically is an essential and strategic matter in the life of a nation and state--emerges, it is considered strange and frightening. In this context, Hotman said, beginning now it is the responsibility of the sociopolitical organizations to begin developing cultural aspects: how to select the people and how the mechanism can be operated honestly, objectively, and openly.
