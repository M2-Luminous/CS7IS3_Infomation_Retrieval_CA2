International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai called an emergency press conference after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered his resignation earlier in the day. "The situation surrounding Japan-U.S. ties requires urgent action," Kumagai said. "There is not much time left before June." Japan pledged to show concrete market-opening plans in June or before the leaders of the world's seven major economies gather in Naples in July for their annual summit meeting. Kumagai said he understands Hosokawa's resignation offer, saying the prime minister must have reached the decision as a way to take responsibility for his financial dealings which have paralyzed Diet discussion of the fiscal 1994 budget. Hosokawa's coalition government was formed with top priority on establishing high ethical standards for politicians, Kumagai said. The trade minister said the Hosokawa administration has broken through many difficult problems its predecessor, the Liberal Democratic Party, was unable to handle, Kumagai said, citing political and administrative reforms, rice market opening, deregulations and tax reforms. What Hosokawa achieved is worthy of being remembered in an historical context, Kumagai said. Kumagai severely criticized the LDP for boycotting debate over this year's budget. "The LDP is committing a suicidal act that denies the fundamental function of the parliament," he said. Kumagai said he is uncertain whether the planned meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Morocco on April 15 will take place as scheduled. The meeting was intended to seek a breakthrough in the stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo and Washington. "Paving the way for resumption of the framework talks is something that should be taken care of by our cabinet but I don't know what will happen," Kumagai said. Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major coalition party, is tipped as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. Concerning a government to succeed the Hosokawa administration, Kumagai said it should be formed after parties concerned agree at least on the controversial tax issue. The current ruling coalition parties were sharply divided over how to finance tax cuts. This created political confusion earlier in the day that delayed formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget.
