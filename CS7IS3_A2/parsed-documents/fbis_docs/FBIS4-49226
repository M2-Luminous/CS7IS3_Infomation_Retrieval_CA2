The Zhejiang local procuratorial organs intend to conduct a public trial of the three suspects in the near future. To dispel doubts and misgivings, and to enable the people concerned to understand the details of the case, the mainland has sincerely asked Taiwan to send specialists and has invited relatives of the murdered to attend the trial as observers. The mainland has made utmost efforts to handle the Qiandao Lake murder case, and has made public the details of the case. This probably will be helpful in dispelling various doubts and reactions. However, in handling the Qiandao Lake murder case, differences and misunderstandings occurred as a result of differences in ideas and approach. This has provided people food for thought and examination. The Qiandao Lake murder case was originally a chance occurrence and an accident in tourism. Had the mainland side followed more appropriate procedures in investigation, gathering evidence, and solving the case, or had each side understood and respected the different approaches of the other, public feeling on the island would not have been aroused, and the press' misunderstanding that the mainland "intentionally withheld the truth" could have been avoided. As a matter of fact, viewed from the process of solving the Qiandao Lake murder case, the mainland had no intention of withholding the truth. On the contrary, it exerted its utmost efforts to bring the whole truth of the case to light as soon as possible. After the Qiandao Lake murder case occurred, President Jiang Zemin immediately gave instructions on "solving the case within a time limit," and "absolutely not withholding the truth." This was something rare in handing cases of chance occurrence on the mainland, was enough to show the extreme concern and attention at the high level over this serious murder case, which involved the lives of 32 compatriots of Taiwan and the mainland. Throughout the course of solving the case, 4,000 people from the central and local governments carried out investigations and gathered evidence, day and night, and succeeded in solving this complicated and confusing case within the short span of 17 days. The details then were made public in good time. It should be said that the mainland took an active and responsible attitude in handling the Qiandao Lake murder case, so why have there been queries overseas, despite the efforts exerted? Perhaps this is because the idea and approach in handling cases of chance occurrence of the mainland are different from those of the other side of the strait, thus making people feel at a loss as to what to do. Generally speaking, in handling similar cases on the mainland, especially the rare Qiandao Lake murder case -- a case of robbery, murder, and arson -- a case is made public usually on the basis of having a clear and unambiguous grasp of the whole story, testimonies of witnesses, and material evidence. In the course of solving a case, the press usually treats the case carefully and does not report anything about it so as to avoid leaking the details of the case and to prevent the criminals and suspects from taking advantage of such leaks to create difficulties for solving the case. On the contrary, the Taiwan side will make a case of chance occurrence widely known as soon as it happens. Any clue, be it useless or important, will be reported in full detail. The people on the island seem to be quite accustomed to this practice, and because of this, they could not understand, were resentful about, and raised questions on the mainland's entirely different way of dealing with the Qiandao Lake murder case. In fact, as for dealing with a case of chance occurrence, the mainland's way of handing a case carefully and of not rashly making it public should give no cause for much criticism. On the contrary, immediately making public whatever is discovered, before the details of a case are clear, may not be conducive to the investigation and solution of a case. Last year, the Yin Ching-feng ammunitions purchase-homicide case occurred in Taiwan. The prosecution was greatly troubled in the course of solving the case because the mass media competed with one another to report whatever traces and clues were discovered. The authorities concerned on the island did not agree twith such so-called "complete transparency" of news reporting, either. However, since the Qiandao Lake murder case involved the lives of compatriots on both sides of the strait, it attracted great attention, both at home and abroad. We should show understanding and sympathy for the relatives of the murdered, who were anxious to learn the details of the case. Had the mainland allowed people to report on details that would not have affected the solution of the case and on the progress in solving the case, unnecessary misunderstandings might have been reduced or even avoided. Now that the whole truth of the Qiandao Lake murder case has come out, the knot in the hearts of the people on both sides of the strait should be untied. However, in handling special cases similar to the Qiandao Lake murder case in the future, how both sides of the strait should readjust their respective ways of handling matters so as to avoid misunderstandings. This is a question both sides of the strait should think about and to which they should give an answer.
