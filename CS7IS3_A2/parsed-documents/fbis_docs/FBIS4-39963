In your view, whose party is it, in that case? [Gaydar] It is the party for those people who want a calm and dignified future for Russia. It is the party for those who do not wish their children to fight for a way out to the Indian Ocean. It is the party for those who are well aware that there is no going back, and that any experiments in that direction are dangerous, that we have one proper path -- namely, to be a civilized, democratic, market society. The problem with us is that we often do not know how to explain and defend these ideas and, as a result, yield the field of political struggle to people who have a single, very simple little idea, and a very dangerous little idea, namely: let's find a non-Russian enemy and try to turn Russian society against that enemy. So, in order to prevent such people from gaining the political arena we need a serious and effective democratic organization.
