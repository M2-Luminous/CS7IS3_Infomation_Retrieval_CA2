A failure to announce taking out a loan is fineable with up to 20,000 crowns (about 1,700 USD). But the party considers absurd the accusations published by Saturday's [26 February] issue of the Christian-orientated daily LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, formerly a KDU-CSL press organ, which alleged that the party had committed fraud and laundered money. According to the paper, Mosca was arrested for cocaine trafficking six months ago, but later released on bail. According to LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, Mosca responded to a KDU-CSL demand for a loan of three million crowns (about 100,000 USD) to be paid to the Ceska Typografie publisher, to which the paper had owed millions of crowns. But the debts were paid by Fidelis Schlee, who later became owner of the paper and [KDU-CSL Chairman and Deputy Premier Josef] Lux ordered the loan from Mosca to be transferred to the KDU-CSL account. The money has never been returned to Italy, the paper wrote. Rubacek said that as far as he was informed, KDU-CSL Chairman Josef Lux on Thursday signed a complaint against the persons responsible for the paper article. The party will also demand an apology from LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, he added. Rubacek blamed the breach of foreign currency regulations on the lawyers which the party had hired, adding that no party official had been involved. That is why the party is not considering any changes in the leadership, he added. The KDU-CSL has 15 out of a total of 200 seats in the Czech parliament.
