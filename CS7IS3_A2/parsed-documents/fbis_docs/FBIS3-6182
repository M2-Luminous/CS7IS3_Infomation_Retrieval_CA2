Team leader Olli Heinonen refused to comment on how the inspections went or to answer questions concerning rumors that the North Korean Government denied the team access to some of the seven agreed-upon nuclear sites. "We don't give any statements. That will be done in Vienna tonight," Heinonen said. "We had a nice pleasant trip. We all want to go home now." Upon arrival, the team immediately booked tickets out of Beijing, with five members scheduled to arrive in Zurich later Tuesday. The IAEA will release a statement in Vienna concerning the trip later Tuesday, Heinonen said. Prior to this round of inspections, North Korea had delayed for more than a year IAEA inspections of its nuclear program, fueling accusations that it was trying to develop nuclear weapons.
