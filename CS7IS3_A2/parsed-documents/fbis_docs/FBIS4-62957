Both in Moscow and Washington a further step has been taken toward the position expounded by former U.S. Secretary of State Eagleburger to the effect that, if people are firmly intent on killing one another, then everybody else has to stand aside and grant the belligerent parties freedom of action until their ardor abates. The economic blockade established by decision of the United Nations affects Serbia and Montenegro. It does not apply to Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia. However, all former SFRY countries find themselves under strict observation in the matter of weapons deliveries. Experts believe that this embargo is advantageous to Serbia and places its rivals in a known losing position. This concerns Bosnia in particular, insofar as Yugoslavia's entire defense industry is concentrated in Serbia and, to a lesser degree, in Croatia. Recent reports that the Iranian Government, in conjunction with those of certain other Muslim states, has been secretly supplying weapons to the Bosnian Government -- led, as it is, by fellow believers -- placed American legislators in a somewhat awkward position. Iran is still on the blacklist of countries which, according to information from the U.S. State Department, support international terrorism. However, on Capitol Hill, where the dome of the famous Congress Building rises over Washington, irritation over the half-hearted and inconsistent foreign policy of the Clinton administration has long been evident. This concerns not only the Bosnians, whose sufferings and tortures have long since become not so much an indictment of Clinton's indecisiveness as a weapon in the hands of his political opponents. The views of the president and a great many legislators also differ over the thrust of the crisis in Haiti, and the means through which to avert the highly likely appearance of nuclear weapons in North Korean hands. Alongside the number of senators and congressmen supporting the continuation of trade-related most-favored-nation status for China, despite its leaders harsh suppression of any political opposition, the ranks of those pushing for trade sanctions against China are swelling. Russia, having long been almost the only spot on the political map to enjoy the conciliation and accord of all the main U.S. political forces, is also becoming a trouble spot. Clinton is being criticized for overly blatant pro-Russianism and malleability in implementing NATO's Partnership for Peace program in granting Russia, the critics claim, a special right of veto on the full-fledged entry into NATO of certain former Warsaw Pact members. In voting by an overwhelming majority to halt the embargo on the delivery of arms to Bosnia, the Senate took "an easy, no-cost decision." Naturally, it avoids the introduction of American troops into the zone of hostilities, and even air strikes, all of which are fraught with possible losses of American lives. However, the prospect of the implementation of both resolutions -- that of the Russian Duma and the American Senate -- is not completely inoffensive. The appearance of heavy weaponry on the Bosnian side will jeopardize French, British, Ukrainian, and Russian lives, and will quite likely lead to their speedy withdrawal from Yugoslavia. The history of democracy has demonstrated time and again that the implementation of foreign policy cannot be realized by parliamentary ballot, even if the fantasy of an irreproachable parliament is brought into play. So it is not difficult to predict that both governments, Russian and American alike, will try to hide behind polite smiles their irritation at the legislators' interference in the prerogatives of the executive. During the Cold War, the lines of the division of interests were drawn so clearly that there was little room for opinions beyond the bounds of a simple "yes" and "no." Now everything is blurred, the majority of regional conflicts are notable for their striking complexity, and the involvement therein of the superpowers does not bode well. Which is why American legislators are criticizing the administration without counterposing their own positive programs. The reasons for this modesty are clear. First, a positive program has to be answered for -- and certainly before the elections. Second, the Americans, like the Russians, are becoming less and less interested in foreign policy, giving preference to problems closer to home.
