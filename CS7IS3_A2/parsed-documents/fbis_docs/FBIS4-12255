A statement, signed by two FIS officials who were released by the Algerian authorities on 23 March, says that the imprisoned FIS leaders, chief among whom are Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, believe that a proposal made by General Liamine Zeroual when he was defense minister was premature and ineffective. The FIS leaders' proposal calls for the drafting of an appeal urging the Algerian people to remain calm and confident. The two FIS officials cite three conditions laid down by the FIS leaders for a political settlement of the Algerian crisis. These conditions may be summed up as the total release of the front's leaders, the provision of comprehensive and detailed information on the general situation in the country, and the opening of a direct and comprehensive dialogue with various parties to decide the country's destiny.
