In the opinion of the critics of the decree, only the president can bring this bitter controversy to an end. What has the discussion shown? Perhaps it merely confirmed the truth that, as is often the case, there are two sides to every problem. Judge for yourselves. An appeal to the president by trading enterprises, such as the Menatep Trading House, Eksportkhleb, Medeya, Eksimer, and others, says reasonably that the adoption of the decree imperils the very opportunity to fulfill already signed contracts to import foodstuffs. The contracts have already been paid for; they were signed on the basis of the price situation that existed prior to adoption of the decree. Payment of new customs duties may now result in bankruptcy for most of these structures. After all, tens of thousands of tonnes of foodstuffs are at issue. For example, the Menatep Trading House alone has imported foodstuffs worth 80 billion rubles [R] to Moscow. Moscow, just like St. Petersburg, is a special case. This has to do with the fact that, as the leaders of the capital city testify, imported foodstuffs take up 52 percent of the foodstuffs market in the city. Minister of Agriculture Viktor Khlystun gives even more impressive numbers: He maintains that the proportion of foodstuffs from abroad in these cities comes to 70 percent. This makes understandable the concern of the mayors of these cities and Yekaterinburg, where the situation is by all signs similar. Prospects of a reduced selection and rapidly soaring prices of foodstuffs alarm the leaders. After all, this is not about exotic fruits and gourmet fare but, for example, powdered milk for dairy plants, meat products, and granulated sugar for the confectionery industry. Last year 70,000 tonnes of dry milk alone were purchased for the capital city through imports. Yuriy Luzhkov's anxiety is not without reason, that is the truth. Let us say that the quantity of milk and dairy products may diminish and, therefore, products made of milk will become more expensive. However, it is also true that, in the words of Anatoliy Petukhov, chairman of the Mozhayskiy joint-stock company in the vicinity of Moscow, the herd of cows on this former sovkhoz has been reduced by 200 head. What is the reason? They do not know what to do with natural milk; yet the procurement price per liter of milk in Moscow was R158 in February, while the retail price was R450-470. The picture in St. Petersburg was approximately the same. Therefore, the following observation by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha can be considered quite reasonable: Since the mayors are concerned about the possible growth of prices, they may very well apply themselves by reducing various intermediate services. For now, the selection in many shops of Moscow, for example, such as the Tverskoy delicatessen, consists of imported goods. Aleksey Filippov, commercial director of the store, thinks: "Eighty percent of our foodstuffs are foreign. Naturally, once the batches imported before 15 March run out, foodstuffs will become more expensive, and fewer of them will be purchased." Nonetheless, it is easy to notice that the new customs duties will entail superprotectionism for the domestic producer, will rule out imports as an "instructor" in the better quality of goods, and will eliminate the incentive to reduce costs. A situation whereby unprofitable farms will remain such under the new tariffs is quite possible: Structural changes in agriculture are proceeding too languidly; somehow we still cannot get down to reducing the producer cost of agricultural products. To be sure, for the sake of fairness we must note that, as our agrarians maintain, the uncompetitiveness of the Russian producer is also entailed by the fact that agricultural production is more than 50 percent subsidized in Western countries. What else is behind the increase in customs duties, apart from the proclaimed defense of the economic interests of Russian agricultural producers? I believe that it is, first, an attempt at more powerful state regulation of foreign economic activities and, second, the calculation that this action will yield almost $4 million [as published] for the state budget. It is hard to say what this calculation is based on: In the opinion of some experts, the traders already know how to bypass customs in the process of importing goods and how to understate their cost if they have to legally transport foodstuffs across the border. Nonetheless, for now the main question still remains--will foodstuffs become more expensive and by how much? Some believe that a 15-20 percent raise in customs duties will result in a twofold growth of retail prices due to credit costs. Others, including Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, have stated that the new duties will have virtually no influence on the growth of prices because substantial reserves of food staples have now been accumulated in Russia, which the peasants do not know what to do with. In particular, reserves of meat products in Russia as of 1 March came to 226,000 tonnes, which would suffice to supply the country for one month; reserves of milk come to 1.222 million tonnes, butter--45,500 tonnes, and sugar--594,000 tonnes, that is, there is 3.5 times more of it than there was last year. Nonetheless, the fight over the government decree on import duties goes on. Hence the terms in the vocabulary of the agricultural minister which are more fitting for a military commander. Viktor Khlystun is convinced that "massive agricultural intervention from abroad, especially in 1993, is one of the reasons for the current crisis in the Russian agrarian sector." The "heavy artillery" has also thundered. In a telegram to the president and the prime minister, the chairmen of the agrarian committees of the Council of the Federation and the State Duma, Vyacheslav Zvolinskiy and Aleksandr Nazarchuk, called for "preventing cancellation of the decree on confirming rates of customs duties on imports." What are we, the civilian population, dejectedly looking at the price tags in the stores every day, to do? Wait and, like in any war, pray and hope for mercy from the victor, all the more so because Minister of Agriculture Viktor Khlystun has promised: "In 1994 the Russian peasants are capable of meeting the country's needs for foodstuffs, and lacking food items can be delivered from CIS countries for which duty-free trading procedures remain in effect." This might be so. However, reports are already coming in: Having assessed the situation, domestic producers in some locations have raised prices for butter and poultry, chicken in particular. Ultimately, one thing is clear: The duties that have been introduced are a temporary measure. The main decisions lie ahead.
