Addressing the other OAS foreign ministers, the Paraguayan foreign minister also endorsed the enhancement, development, and progress of the democratic system in all the American countries. Ramirez Boettner criticized the gap between rich and poor countries, claiming that after the end of the Cold War, world assistance funds to overcome poverty and seek development have become increasingly scarce and inaccessible. Ramirez Boettner emphasized: "And it is surprisingly paradoxical that, when the new international order makes clamorous announcements of an era of international cooperation and solidarity, there actually are so many symptoms of a growing and fragmentary isolationism between the rich and the poor." Ramirez Boettner then asked for increased cooperation between rich and poor countries for the sake of the development and well-being of most countries. He added that international aid to enhance democracy and reduce poverty "has become elusive and preconditioned." Democracy for All In his message to the OAS foreign ministers' meeting, Ramirez Boettner deplored the fact that democracy has not reached all American countries and that there still are exceptions. Ramirez Boettner said: "All of us want all our American brothers to equally join in democratic development and progress, with the restoration of all liberties." In order to receive more technical and financial assistance from the "rich" countries, the foreign minister pointed out that it is necessary for American countries to close ranks and raise in successive meetings the hopes of the poorest countries. In his message to the OAS General Assembly, the Paraguayan foreign minister asked that the Inter-American System be enhanced and strengthened. Will Return Tomorrow After participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly in this Brazilian city, Ramirez Boettner will return to our country at 1050 on 8 June. On 9 June, Ramirez Boettner will join President Wasmosy on a visit to Montevideo, Uruguay, to dedicate the dredging of the Martin Garcia channel.
