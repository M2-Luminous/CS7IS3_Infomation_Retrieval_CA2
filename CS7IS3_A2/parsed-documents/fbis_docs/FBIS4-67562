Eighteen years ago on May 16, 1976 the late leader of the suffering people, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhasani, brought out a huge procession comprising several hundred thousand people to demand an equitable share of the Ganges River water. People from all walks of life in Bangladesh from Teknaf [southernmost tip of the country] to Tetulia [northernmost tip of the country] joined this long march, which was led by Maulana Bhasani. This long march started at 1000 from Dhaka on May 16. The processionists travelled (?456) miles and made an overnight halt at Chapainawabganj [District]. On the morning of May 17 when this procession marched toward the border at that time the whole path was converted into a huge sea of agitated people. The procession stopped at a spot [name indistinct] about three miles inside the border at 1600. On that day, the people of South Asia and the whole world witnessed through this massive procession the demand raised by the people of Bangladesh for a fair share of the waters of the Ganges River. The world was amazed to see this huge procession by the people of this country to realize their legitimate share of the water of an international river. The world had extended its support to this cause of the people of Bangladesh long before this procession took place. The adverse effect created in Bangladesh due to the construction of the Farakka Barrage on the Ganges River is now discernible. The situation has further deteriorated. Vast tracts of land in Bangladesh are becoming deserts due to this withdrawal of the Ganges water at Farakka. The part of the Ganges River that flows into Bangladesh is known as the Padma. This Padma was once a mighty river, and the people living along its banks led a very affluent and prosperous life. The part of Bangladesh through which this river flows was once lush, green, and full of crops. At present, these coastal areas have been turned into deserts. The vast bed of the Padma River has now turned into a desert and has become sandy. Many parts of the Padma River have also become grazing ground for cattle. The river has become totally unnavigable in several areas. The level of underground water in the areas adjoining the Padma River has fallen tremendously due to the shortage of water in the river. This has led to the destruction of agricultural lands and trees. Scarcity of water in the river has also severely affected navigation and shipping transport. This has directly affected the life of about 30 million people living on the banks of the Padma River and has posed a threat to their livelihood. This situation has created a negative impact on the economy of a least developed country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh wants to be relieved from this unbearable situation and demands its legitimate share of the water of the Ganges, which is an international river. Bangladesh is making efforts at the bilateral level for a peaceful settlement of the water sharing issue. In this regard, several meetings were held in India and Bangladesh at different levels. It is unfortunate that no remedy has been found yet for this problem. [Words indistinct] This Ganges River problem is a life and death problem for about 30 million people in Bangladesh. Since the present democratic government came to power, it has been holding direct talks with the Indian Government at different levels with a view to resolving this Ganges water sharing problem. So far the talks have not yielded any positive results. On the other hand, the talks have become long and drawn out. During her visit to India, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia held talks with the Indian prime minister, Narasimha Rao, on the issue of resolving this Ganges water problem. India gave its assurance that it would take active measures to resolve this problem. After this, several rounds of talks were held between the officials of the two countries for working out a solution to the problem, but no progress has been made. Bangladesh has raised this issue regarding the sharing of the Ganges River water at the Commonwealth summit, the Nonaligned Movement, and in various international forums. It has also held talks with different countries of the world seeking their active cooperation in securing an equitable share of the Ganges River water. The world has extended its support to the demand raised by Bangladesh for an equitable share of the Ganges River water. Diplomatic efforts have also been made for a peaceful solution of the Ganges River water problem but no progress has been made in this regard. Today is 16 May. It commemorates the historic Farakka Day. On this day, the people of Bangladesh demand an early solution to the water sharing problem -- which is their life and death question. This demand was also raised at the discussion meetings, seminars, symposia, and rallies held today in observance of the day. The Ganges water sharing issue is solely a humanitarian problem. It is not a political problem. It would be inhuman to consider this problem as a political issue. We hope that in the interest of good neighborly relations, India will take effective measures for an early solution to this problem.
