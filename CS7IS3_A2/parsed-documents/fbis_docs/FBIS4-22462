Zhirinovskiy into power in our country no later than this coming fall. We asked A. Chubays to explain what he meant. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] What sources do you have for such contentions? [Chubays] The sources of information are quite simple: A special trait of figures like Zhirinovskiy is that they cannot keep their mouth shut, which lets them down, especially when they publish in "their" publications. They get a little "carried away" and say things they had not intended to say. I have in my possession the newspaper ZAVTRA, which published a dialogue between A. Prokhanov and Mr. Zhirinovskiy. In it, Zhirinovskiy states: "...and in Russia, in order to wake up the Russian nation, it can be awaken by bloodshed." I think this statement does not need any comment. Next A. Prokhanov asks V. Zhirinovskiy: "You mean that reintegration will occur through the tragedy of these people?" (meaning unification of the former USSR republics). V. Zhirinovskiy replies: "Through death! The death of millions of Tajiks, Georgians, Uzbeks." I want to draw your attention also to the title of this material: "I Will Move Into the Kremlin!" He also names the time frame--this coming fall. I did not invent all this--I simply reproduced what Vladimir Volfovich himself said. It is interesting to see how he reacted to my comments in the BBC program. This is what REUTER writes. V. Zhirinovskiy is asked: "What is your reaction to what A. Chubays said?" He replies: "Chubays told the truth. He is absolutely right." Next he says that there have been two putsches: "These two putsches were without our participation, and that is why they failed. With our participation, victory will be ensured. The third time will be with our participation." What follows from this? It is obvious that these people understand very well that the only way for them to come to power is through bloodshed. It is clear that they will attempt to provoke this bloodshed. Of course, all our economic difficulties, all problems are fertile soil for them, on which they have grown in the first place. The worse the economic situation, the better it is for them, the more chances that they will be able to rock the boat and "move into the Kremlin" in the fall. Why in the fall? So far there are no presidential elections scheduled for the fall. They are scheduled for 1996. If a political figure, a leader of a party, says "I will move into the Kremlin in the fall," it means that he is speaking of an unconstitutional method of seizing power. All other words: "by peaceful means," "people themselves will carry me in," "I will be given a ticket to move into the Kremlin"--these are just window dressing to cover the plot. That is why I see this situation as so serious. And I treat it not as empty bantering but as a slip Zhirinovskiy has made regarding plans that are actually being hatched by his supporters. And I am convinced that both government bodies and public organizations should treat it seriously. The president has already said that he will watch carefully over any actions violating the law, on the part of both those who have been amnestied and those who are in cohort with them. Our actions with respect to setting up the Russia's Choice Party are directly linked with this. We do not need a debating club that discusses various general political problems--we need a well-defined political structure with a staff, cadres, communications, and finances, capable of providing resistance to provocation. We can only fight this threat by united efforts: of the state, which resorts to the enforcement apparatus in the event the law is violated, and social forces, for which the road of plots is unacceptable. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It is strange to hear a reformer predict V. Zhirinovskiy's victory. [Chubays] I never said Zhirinovskiy would win, because I am convinced that fascism cannot win in Russia--at least legally. I do not believe that Russia will ever give its vote to a fascist leader. For me it is also impossible because I am a son of a military man who fought the war from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. As to the threat of fascism, I spoke of it as long ago as 13 December 1993.
