FR940303-2-00038 FR940303-2-00026 Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Application [Docket No. CP94&hyph;252&hyph;000] February 25, 1994. Take notice that on February 24, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE., Charleston, West Virginia 25314&hyph;1599, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;252&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of certain natural gas facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Columbia states that to ensure reliable operation of its pipeline facilities, Columbia has initiated a program to install pig launching and receiving facilities in segments of its existing storage fields which, in certain storage fields, would result in the need to replace short segments of pipeline to provide for a uniform pipe size between launchers and receivers. As part of this program, Columbia says that it proposes to construct and operate approximately 0.8 mile of 16-inch pipeline to replace approximately 0.8 mile of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 16-inch pipeline on its Line SL&hyph;2709, a bidirectional launcher and receiver, as well as various appurtenant facilities, located in Columbia's Medina Storage Field, Medina County, Ohio. Columbia states that it does not request authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia further states that the estimated cost of the proposed construction is $686,400 and would be financed with funds generated from internal sources. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 14, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Columbia to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
