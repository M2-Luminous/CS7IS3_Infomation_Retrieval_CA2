SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances Title: Certification and Training of Pesticide Applicators. (EPA ICR No. 0155.05; OMB No. 2070&hyph;0029). This is a request for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved collection with no changes. Abstract: In compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and to minimize the threat to human health and the environment, EPA classifies pesticides as general or restricted use. Restricted-use pesticides can only be used by or under the supervision of a certified applicator. EPA conducts a program to certify pesticide applicators in states whose programs have not received Agency approval (Colorado for private applicators and Nebraska for private and commercial applicators). Individuals applying for or renewing certification as applicators of restricted-use pesticides, must complete EPA form 8500&hyph;17. Applicants for certification must establish their competency in pesticide use through completion of a training program. Certified commercial applicators and dealers of restricted-use pesticides are required to maintain records of use and sale of restricted-use pesticides. In addition, states, Indian tribes, and Federal Agencies with EPA-approved certification programs must submit to the Agency an annual report of their sale and use of restricted-use pesticides. EPA uses the information to determine compliance with FIFRA, and, when necessary, as evidence in enforcement cases. Burden Statement: The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .92 hour per response for reporting, and 3.5 hours per recordkeeper annually. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data needed, and review the collection of information. Respondents: Private and commercial applicators, and dealers of restricted-use pesticides. States, Indian tribes, and Federal Agencies. Estimated Number of Respondents: 11,809 for reporting, and 351,100 for recordkeeping. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 1,241,400 hours. Frequency of Collection: Annually and on occasion. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of the information collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Matthew Mitchell, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20530.
