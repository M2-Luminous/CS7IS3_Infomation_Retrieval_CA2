ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) previously published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend its offshore Net Profit Share Lease (NPSL) regulations relating to record maintenance requirements and certain audit requirements. The MMS now is issuing a further notice of proposed rulemaking on this proposed change. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail your written comments to the Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management Program, Rules and Procedures Staff, P.O. Box 25165, Mail Stop 3901, Denver, Colorado 80225&hyph;0165, Attention: David S. Guzy. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David S. Guzy, Chief, Rules and Procedures Staff at (303) 231&hyph;3432. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The principal author of this proposed rule is David A. Hubbard of the MMS Royalty Management Program, Valuation and Standards Division, Lakewood, Colorado. I. Background (a) History of NPSL Accounting Rules A chronology of the NPSL rules follows: •May 30, 1980_before Congress passes the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), 30 U.S.C., 1701 et seq. _the Department of Energy (DOE) publishes regulations on accounting procedures for offshore NPSL's (10 CFR part 390). •December 1981_the Secretary of the Interior receives authority to administer the NPSL rules (Pub. L. 97&hyph;100). •January 11, 1983 (48 FR 1182)_NPSL rules transferred to the Department of the Interior (Department), MMS, and redesignated 30 CFR part 261. •August 5, 1983_30 CFR part 261 is redesignated 30 CFR part 220 (48 FR 35642). (b) Current and Original Rules Compared Other than minor administrative changes, MMS' version of the NPSL accounting rules in 30 CFR part 220 duplicates DOE's original rules in 10 CFR part 390. Both provide that: •Ledger cards showing charges and credits to the NPSL capital account must be maintained for 36 months after the lessee ceases NPSL operations; •All other documents, journals, and records must be maintained for 36 months from the due date or date of mailing of the statement of account on an NPSL, whichever comes later; •The Department has the right to start an audit any time within 36 months of the due date of the statement to be audited or the date it was mailed, whichever is later. (c) NPSL vs. FOGRMA Recordkeeping Requirements The record maintenance periods in the NPSL rules conflict with current statutory record maintenance requirements on all Federal and Indian oil and gas leases, including leases on the OCS. Section 103 of FOGRMA, 30 U.S.C. 1713, ``Required Recordkeeping,'' states, in part that a lessee, operator, or other person *␣*␣* shall establish and maintain any records, make any reports, and provide any information that the Secretary may, by rule, reasonably require *␣*␣*. Upon the request of any officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary or any State or Indian tribe *␣*␣* the appropriate records, reports, or information *␣*␣* shall be made available for inspection and duplication by such officer or employee, State, or Indian tribe. Records *␣*␣* shall be maintained for 6 years *␣*␣* unless the Secretary notifies the record holder that he has initiated an audit *␣*␣* and that such records must be maintained for a longer period. In any case when an audit or investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the Secretary releases the record holder of the obligation to maintain such records.
