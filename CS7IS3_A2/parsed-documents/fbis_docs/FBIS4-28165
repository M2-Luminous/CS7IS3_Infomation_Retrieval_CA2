The next step is to see when, what, and how sanctions will be imposed. While shouldering the national task for peaceful reunification, we are again heading toward taking a step which may propel confrontation and hatred instead of reconciliation, exchange, and cooperation, without presenting a self-reliant [chuchejok] resolution. North Korea may be blamed for darkening the nuclear issue with its tenacious use of its nuclear card. However, the pushing of North Korea, which is already in a dilemma, into a tight corner by the United States, can not be overlooked. The United States once alleged that the radiochemical laboratory was the key to ascertaining the status of North Korea's nuclear development and strongly charged North Korea of blocking inspections. North Korea eventually allowed inspections at the laboratory, and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors reportedly extracted samples. Nothing has been reported about the result of the examination or analysis. Judging from recent developments in the situation, it is speculated that nothing substantial was discovered to prove that North Korea had secured enough plutonium to develop nuclear weapons. The United States and the IAEA's repeated demands for inspections on the two undeclared nuclear facilities strongly backs up this rumor. The IAEA is refuting North Korea's assertion that sampling and examination is still possible because the removed fuel rods have been numbered. We do not have any scientific grounds to judge which side is right. Even if we accept the IAEA's assertion, we still doubt that this justifies the demand for inspections on undeclared facilities as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty stipulates inspections on declared facilities only. Moreover, the United States and North Korea came to an agreement that inspections on the two undeclared facilities would be discussed at the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks. North Korea seems to be preoccupied with the concern that the nuclear card has lost its effectiveness prior to a third-round of talks without guaranteeing the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States. North Korea should realize, even at this late stage, that it was wrong from the start to think of using the issue of the development of nuclear weapons, which is invariably linked to national issues, as its bargaining card. Reviewing developments in the North Korean nuclear issue during the past 15 months, it becomes apparent that the United States is partly responsible for the tense situation. Thus, it should not raise its voice for sanctions but do its best to seek a more effective measure to completely solve the problem. An unconditional third round of talks would be a desirable step toward this end, but if this is difficult, then at least conditions should be made more accessible to being accepted by North Korea. If, by saying "No concessions can be made," President Clinton meant that he does not care about any tragedy concerning the Korean peninsula, we who live on this land cannot accept this. A strong leader is more apt to have room for flexibility and should work toward goals flexibly.
