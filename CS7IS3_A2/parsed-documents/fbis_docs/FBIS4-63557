The meeting took place behind closed doors. As INTERFAX has learned from a source close to the Moldavian president, the leaders continued to discuss a bill on giving Gagauz settlements a special administrative status. Conclusions of experts from the Council of Europe and proposals of other international bodies were taken into account. The Gagauz side is reported to have accepted a compromise formula, according to which the Gagauz country is an autonomous ethnic territorial entity rather than a state autonomous territorial entity on which it has insisted so far. As the Moldavian President's State Counselor Victor Grebenshikov has told Interfax, "there are reasons to believe that the Gagauz issue will be solved soon." In his opinion, "a parliamentary commission has been working hard to draft a Gagauz autonomy accord." "I think -- he remarked -- the document will ensure the interests of Moldavia -- its territorial integrity and sovereignty -- and will guarantee the existence and development of Gagauz settlements." Grebenshikov stressed that during their talks the leaders of Moldavia and Gagauzia saw eye to eye on all matters discussed. Meanwhile, during the work of the parliamentary commission on Gagauzia, the two sides have agreed to keep the concrete issues under discussion out of media coverage to avoid agitation.
