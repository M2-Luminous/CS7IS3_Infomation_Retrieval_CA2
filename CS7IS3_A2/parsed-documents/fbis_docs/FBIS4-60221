'Ali Nasir Muhammad expressed his total rejection of the idea of secession and asked al-Bid to change his mind about establishing a state in south Yemen and to search for a solution within the framework of Yemeni unity. In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said he was ready to play a new mediation role to solve the crisis within this framework and to return to Yemen within 48 hours. However, the decision to secede and the subsequent developments have prevented him from conducting this mediation. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad warned that the secession decision will not solve Yemen's problem but will complicate it further, lead to a series of new conflicts, and partition Yemen into small entities and states.
