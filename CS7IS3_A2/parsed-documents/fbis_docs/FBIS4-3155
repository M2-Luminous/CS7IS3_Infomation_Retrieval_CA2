Clinton told reporters at the White House that since the U.N. has taken a more vigorous approach, asked NATO to provide close air support and created the safe zone around Sarajevo, "substantial progress has been made." "We've had relative peace in the Sarajevo area," he added, "we've had the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims which is holding." Clinton conceded that there were "some friction as a result of the last round of very modest airstrikes as a result of the shelling of Gorazde." Under U.N. and NATO direction, U.S. warplanes carried out air strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde on Monday [11 April] and Tuesday. Clinton claimed that "we can't have our U.N. personnel there vulnerable to shelling and to attack with no one there to defend them." But, the President said, "the United States has no interest in having NATO become involved in this war and trying to gain advantage for one side over the other." "Our position is to be firm but not provocation and not trying to change the military balance," he stressed. Clinton called upon all the parties to get back to the negotiations, saying that is "the most important thing."
