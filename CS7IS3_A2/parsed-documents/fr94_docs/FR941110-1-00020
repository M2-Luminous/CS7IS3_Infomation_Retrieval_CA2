FR941110-1-00020 FR941110-1-00006 Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program Section 187(a)(6) of the Act requires implementation of enhanced inspection and maintenance programs in moderate 2 carbon monoxide nonattainment areas which includes provisions as required under section 182(c)(3) concerning serious ozone nonattainment areas. Such provisions require implementation of an enhanced inspection and maintenance program in urbanized areas with a population greater than 200,000. On November 15, 1993 New Jersey submitted proposed regulations and other information pertaining to the enhanced inspection and maintenance program. Since New Jersey did not submit a fully adopted enhanced inspection and maintenance program, on February 2, 1994 EPA notified the State that this submittal was incomplete and a sanctions process was begun. Because these regulations were not adopted at the time of their submittal (or since), EPA is proposing the disapproval of the enhanced inspection and maintenance program as submitted. Oxygenated Fuels Rule_Subchapter 25 Section 211(m) of the Act requires that states submit revisions to their SIPs to require an oxygenated gasoline program by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment areas having a design value of 9.1 ppm or greater based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Each state's oxygenated gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7% oxygen by weight during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide. Under section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements generally are to cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in the larger of either the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area or the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months unless a state can demonstrate that, because of meteorological conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances outside of such reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47849). In this guidance, EPA also announced the availability of an oxygenated gasoline credit program. Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content than is required (i.e. an oxygen content greater than 2.7% by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight. EPA also issued labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act, which were published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992. New Jersey was required to submit a revised SIP by November 15, 1992 under section 110 and part D of title I of the Act and which was to include an oxygenated gasoline program for the New Jersey portions of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. As part of the November 15, 1992, submittal, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) submitted adopted amendments and new rule Subchapter 25, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Vehicular Fuels,'' of Chapter 27, Title 7 of the New Jersey Administrative Code. Subchapter 25 contains the requirements for New Jersey's oxygenated gasoline program, which was adopted by New Jersey on September 1, 1992.
