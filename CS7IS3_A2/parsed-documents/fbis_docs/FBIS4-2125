In an interview with XINHUA reporters on the eve of his trip to China, Balladur said that although the French-Chinese relations encountered some difficulties in the past few years, 30 years of fruitful exchanges have laid a sound foundation for such relations. He said the two countries should now try their best to boost the positive atmosphere that has reappeared between them. He said he will discuss with Chinese leaders major international issues, especially the situation in Asia and Europe. He stressed that the two countries should build a more trusting relationship on a new basis. It is important for France and China, both of them permanent members of the UN Security council, to exchange views on major international issues and to closely cooperate in international affairs such as the settlement of regional crisis, the prime minister added. He believed that the development of bilateral relations also conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries. Balladur hoped that his visit, though a political one, could help strengthen economic ties. He also said that France supports in principle China's efforts to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).
