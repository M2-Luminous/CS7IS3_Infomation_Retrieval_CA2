Carl Bildt says urbanely into the local radio's microphone in the icy school playground that it is always wonderful to come here. But the truth is that he is uneasy, just as uneasy as opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson that the unruly people who mine ore will vote to a man against membership in the European Union [EU]. That is why little Gallivare, with its 19,000 inhabitants, has become an attractive destination for politicians advocating a yes vote in the run-up to the national referendum. Yet the prime minister is good at concealing his uneasiness. He explains and discusses, during visits to schools and at nighttime meetings, the fear Norrbotten residents have of the Brussels bureaucracy. The answer to almost every question, whether it pertains to the legal right of access to private land, hunting, alcohol, or support for Norrland, is consistently introduced with "we will decide that ourselves..." Next comes a speech outlining what the consequences of membership will be. So, for example, each EU krona provided to subsidize Norrland is a bonus that will get added to the usual Swedish subsidy. Ingvar Carlsson, who was here last week, was less precise, but then he does not have the same direct channel to Brussels as Carl Bildt. He left it at saying that EU membership could only be positive for Norrbotten. Opposition Decreases When the public opinion figures on EU membership were studied in detail one year ago, 75 percent of Norrbotten residents were definitely opposed. Moderate Party ombudsman Tommy Eriksson, Lulea, said that he had gotten "signals" that the opposition has now been pushed down to 60 percent. More people have become undecided. "It will come down even more, and we hope we prevail with the help of our Moderate Party ministers in particular," he said. He has just scheduled Justice Minister Gun Hellsvik for a trip to Gallivare in April. Tax Minister Bo Lundgren has paid a visit, EC Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is thought to have done well for himself in Gallivare, while party secretary Gunnar Hokmark tried to make the people in Boden see reason. Education Minister Per Unckel "will do Haparanda in May" and Industry Minister Per Westerberg is on the ombudsman's wish list for a longer visit. Schools as the Key "All of Norrbotten is a challenge. That is obviously true in Gallivare, which is more communist than other places, with the Swedish Communist Party [SKP] still in power," said Eriksson as he rode about during the minister's visit. During each visit Eriksson schedules a school. So each Moderate Party minister has obligingly stood at a lectern. Because it is among youth that they see an opportunity to win over the growing group of those who are undecided. In Gallivare Prime Minister Bildt ventured out on a fearless operation by urging youth "to listen and think for themselves," not to be too impressed by the naysaying older generation being understood. The Moderates, who are supported by approximately 12 percent of the voters in the province, know they are somewhat frustrated by the other nonsocialist parties where winning Norrbotten residents over to the EU is concerned. The Liberal Party is lying low, the Christian Democratic Party is heard from most often as being opposed, and when Labor Market Minister Borje Hornlund (Center Party) was with the prime minister in Karesuando, there was "only demonstrations and misery." Carl Bildt, on the other hand, went out and talked calmly with the unemployed who were demonstrating, telling them that the EC was not a danger but rather would produce jobs, not least in Norrbotten.
