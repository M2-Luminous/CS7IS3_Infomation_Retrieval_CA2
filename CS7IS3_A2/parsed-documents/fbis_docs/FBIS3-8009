We took the opportunity to ask him for a brief interview. [Chalupa] Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech Republic, described, in an interview for our newspaper, Czech-Slovak relations as being very favorable. Do you identify with this view? [Bratinka] Of course, relations between the Czech and Slovak Republics are good, but they could be better. After all, the economies of the two states are more dependent on each other and, for this reason, there should be as few problems as possible in mutual trade. It is obvious that there will be certain problems; we have to work to get rid of them. [Chalupa] Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia Central Committee Chairman Grebenicek declared at a recent news conference that pressure from various groups abroad is behind the various approaches in the government coalition to resolving the Bosnian crisis.... [Bratinka] If someone were to say that different states have different interests, it would be the truth--the banal truth. However, I steadfastly reject any suggestion that a struggle among various foreign power-wielding groups is taking place in the government. [Chalupa] Your ministry is preparing a draft government decree that should make it easier for individual compatriots to resettle in the Czech Republic. This decree should also concern the Kazakh Czechs. When will this matter be discussed in the government? [Bratinka] This decree is being prepared by the Interior Ministry, and we should merely add our comments. I cannot tell you at the moment when this will come onto the government's agenda; this is within the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office and the prime minister himself. The question is whether these people should be given, without bureaucratic holdups, permanent residency permits, at least for the first phase. The Foreign Ministry is monitoring the situation in Kazakhstan; we can add our points of view. If people are to be resettled, then, of course, our diplomats and our representative offices will be very active in this matter. [Chalupa] What do you think of the chances for the recently initiated Middle East peace process following the bloody massacre in Hebron? [Bratinka] The peace process was initiated because logic was moving in this direction. Although it will be slowed down or in a way impaired, the overall headway and the overall direction and aim will be maintained. This is a matter of reason, a matter that, the longer it is postponed, the greater the risk of such murderous behavior on both sides. This massacre highlights the need for a definitive solution. I do not think that the Middle East peace process has ended.
