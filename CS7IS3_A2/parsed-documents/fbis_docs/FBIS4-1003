FBIS4-1003 "drafr075_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Commission Explains Voting Station Procedures Commission Explains Voting Station Procedures MB1804083794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0740 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804083794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 18 April] [Text] Each of the approximately 10,000 voting stations in the country will be surrounded by an area with controlled entrances and exits. This "inner perimeter" as it is known, will be opened at 07h00 on each of April 27 and 28, and will close at 19h00. Voters who have entered the inner perimeter before the closing time on either day will be allowed to continue to vote. Strict security measures will be applied at all voting stations, and no member of the public will be allowed into the inner perimeter if he or she is in possession a weapon of any kind. Bags and/or parcels will be subject to search. An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] official will be on hand to deal with any general inquiries, to ensure that voters are in possession of the correct identity documents, and to help the elderly or disabled to the front of the queue. At the entrance to the voting station, a further two IEC officials will ensure that the required documentation is ready, and will direct each voter via an usher to the ultra-violet (UV) scanning table, which is controlled by an IEC official. The voter will be asked to place his or her hands, palms down, under the blue UV light. If an ink-mark is detected, the voter will be escorted to the presiding officer's table, where one of three IEC officials will again check the voter's hands beneath a UV light, and make a ruling on whether to allow the voter to proceed with voting, or be escorted from the inner perimeter. If no ink-mark is detected, the voter will be directed to the document-checking table, where a relevant and valid identity document -- as set out by the IEC -- will be requested and checked. If the identity document presented by the voter does not comply with the requirements, the voter will be taken to the presiding officer's table, where a decision will be made on whether or not the voter may continue to vote, or be escorted from the inner perimeter. If the document complies with the IEC requirements, it will be market with an invisible ink and returned to the voter. Temporary voter cards (TVC's) issued to voters for the purpose of the election will be retained by the IEC official at the document checking table at this stage. The voter will then be directed to the ink-marking table, where the back of the fingers of the voter's right hand (including the fingers) will be marked with an invisible ink by an official. If this should be impractical or impossible, the voter will be taken to the presiding officer's table, where his or her details will be taken down and kept together with reasons for the ink-marking not being possible. Voters will be given a paper towel or tissue with which to wipe their ink-marked hand, and will be asked again to put the hands under the UV light. If the ink-mark does not show up, the marking procedure will be repeated. When ink-marking is completed, the voter will be directed to the national ballot paper issue table, which is controlled by two IEC officials. The first official will tear a single national ballot paper out of the ballot bjok and hand this to the second official, who will fold it three times -- in half from top to bottom, from right to left in one-third, and from right to left in half again. The official voting station stamp will then be placed on the paper, which will be handed to the voter. The voter will be asked whether he or she requires assistance in voting because of blindness, illiteracy or disability. If so, this will be arranged by the officials at the presiding officer's table. If not, the voter will be ushered to the first available voting booth, and left alone to make his or her mark on the national ballot paper and folding it. On leaving the booth, the voter will be taken to the national ballot box table, where an IEC official will check the folded ballot paper -- without infringing secrecy -- to ensure that it bears the correct voting station stamp before the voter is allowed to place the paper in the national ballot box. The voter will then be asked if he or she would like to cast a vote in the provincial ballot. If yes, he or she proceeds to the provincial ballot paper issue table. If no, the voter will be escorted to the voting station exit. If the voter does want to vote in the provincial ballot, the procedure is identical to that of the national ballot -- a ballot paper is issued, folded, stamped, marked and placed in the provincial ballot box. Note: The presiding officer's table is staffed by officials who are available to provide assistance and resolve discrepancies or disputes.
