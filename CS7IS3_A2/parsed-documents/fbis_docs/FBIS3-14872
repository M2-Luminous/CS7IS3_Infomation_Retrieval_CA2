This is stated in a letter from Alia Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, which was forwarded to the current president of the UN Security Council on Monday [28 February]. This document, which has not been officially issued yet, was obtained by an Itar-Tass correspondent. "The behavior of the Russian soldiers after their arrival in Sarajevo has annoyed UN [words indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since their arrival they have displayed their support for the aggressor. Attitudes which remind us of certain episodes in the past have been strongly demonstrated. Our people regard this as a provocation which could cause an incident," Izetbegovic pointed out. "We do not endorse the arrival of additional Russian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. "We believe that any such decision should be put off."
