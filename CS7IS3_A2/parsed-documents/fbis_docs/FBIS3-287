He spoke about the arrest of the Association of Malian Students and Pupils secretary general, as well as the latest upsurge in violence. Boubakar Toure has the details: [Begin recording] [Toure] The minister first spoke on the cabinet's adoption of a draft bill on methods of taxing public contracts in the state budget. This measure was aimed at avoiding double tax exemptions and curbing government spending. The minister and the newsmen spoke at length on recent developments in the school crisis, especially the confirmation that the AEEM secretary general had been arrested, as well as the violent incidents of 2 March. Minister Cheickna Kamissoko was unequivocal about this. He condemned vandalism and stated that no one was above the law. Zanarawa had to be brought to justice. [Kamissoko] Yehia Zarawana was indeed arrested yesterday morning by the police. Just like the other students who had been arrested before him, he will have to answer for acts that he has publicly acknowledged and admitted to in a radio broadcast. It is at his instigation and that of his association that students, and others who were not even students -- this has been proven by those who were judged initially -- set up roadblocks and vandalized public and private buildings, property, and health vehicles and [words indistinct] Unfortunately, the same thing happened last year in the suburbs. That was the result of an action that he masterminded and claimed responsibility for. The situation is very clear: When one accepts responsibility for a criminal act one has to answer for it. In that sense, no one can be above the law. [Toure] The minister also stressed that this could have a spillover effect on highway banditry. He urged parents to assume their responsibilities. Furthermore, he said the government was open to dialogue and that schools would be reopened as soon as the situation was favorable. When questioned on the situation in the north following Saloum Bilal's death, the minister conceded that tension was high in the region, and that a commission of enquiry would be dispatched to the area to throw more light on the matter.
