The silk industry, like other traditional manufacturing sectors in Zhejiang and elsewhere in China, has been enlivened through input of new and high technology. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Zhejiang has focused on the development of industries that concentrate on high technology and are capital intensive, and yield high added value. High-tech development zones have been set up in this provincial capital, the port city of Ningbo and Wenzhou, where private enterprise thrives. The machinery, chemicals, construction materials, textiles and light industry sectors have achieved better product quality and lower costs through the introduction of advanced technology. According to Chang Jinming, deputy director of the provincial science and technology commission, as a province rich in labor but short on energy, resources and transportation, the only way for Zhejiang to gain a competitive edge in a market economy is to bring labor resources and technology into full play.
