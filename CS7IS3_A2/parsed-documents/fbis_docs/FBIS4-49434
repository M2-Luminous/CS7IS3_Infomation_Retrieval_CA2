The Law on Urban Real Estate Management (draft), on which officials and experts have worked for six years, is expected to provide the legal basis for real estate development and make it a pillar of the national economy. The draft contains 79 articles in seven chapters governing use of land for real estate development, housing property development, real estate trading, registration of real estate property rights and other subjects. In explaining the draft to the NPC Standing Committee, Vice Minister of Construction Ye Rutang noted the rapid expansion of real estate development in recent years. "But a host of problems cry for resolution, and provision of a legal base is the fundamental solution," the official said. According to the draft, transfer of land shall, in most cases, be executed through auction or bidding. Under specific circumstances, however, land may be transferred through negotiated agreement with approval of the State Council or a higher level authority of the local government with the power to approve such matters. The draft specifies that land for construction of commercial, tourist and reactional facilities as well as villas shall be transferred through auction or bidding. According to statistics available to XINHUA, of the total amount of land obtained for construction between early 1992 and July 1993, bidding was employed for only 0.78 percent and auction for another 0.32 percent. The rest was obtained either by administrative allocations or through negotiated agreement. To uphold the state monopoly over urban land, the draft stipulates that transfer of land shall conform to the overall planning for use of land and urban development and be incorporated with the construction of specific projects. The land developer, says the draft, must abide by the contractual terms for the development project on the land and within the contractual period for the development. With regard to advance sales of housing property, the draft, apparently to prevent profiteering speculation, prohibits transfer of housing already sold but not yet finished and occupied.
