We understood, and suggested that we wait for 12 months and then conduct an extensive interview. Now that a year has elapsed, we can offer our readers what may be the most extensive interview the minister has given to the Cuban press, in which he answers a variety of substantive questions on Cuba and its place in a world that has changed dramatically in the last five years. Our readers will receive a report with a gestation period of a year. To some extent, it is a report on the performance by the head of Cuban diplomacy during this time. [Vinas Alfonso] There has been persistent talk of a strong diplomatic offensive since you became foreign minister. Is that true? [Robaina] People should instead talk of an ongoing offensive by Cuban diplomacy in the last 35 years. A tremendous diplomatic battle was waged by Roa in the United Nations in April 1961, while in another -- though not precisely international -- arena our forces repelled the mercenaries' attack at the Bay of Pigs. That has been our style since 1959: exterior work based on what we Cubans are doing inside our country. Our foreign minister's diplomatic arguments were so solid because our people were at that very time defending their destiny on the battlefield. Now we have again come to a crucial moment in the history of the revolution, when not only is the sovereignty of our nation at stake, but also the very existence of the nation. Our diplomacy must be capable of meeting the challenge of today's circumstances, and that requires giving a new impetus to this offensive. I do not believe it has so much to do with who is in charge of this work, but instead with the pace that the new times impose. I maintain that those of us who have the duty of explaining abroad what is happening in Cuba face a task that is incomparably less difficult than the effort a housewife makes every day in her kitchen, or a worker expends in reaching his workplace early. At the same time, it is a tremendous challenge to give the world a true image of Cuba, as we are surrounded by a powerful information monopoly as unipolar as the world in which we live. That is what we are doing now, and we certainly talk of a diplomatic offensive, which we need now: special diplomacy for a special period. [Vinas Alfonso] What are Cuba's foreign policy priorities now? [Robaina] Since last year we have established a minimal number of priorities, so we will know exactly where to focus our work. In the very first place is our legitimate struggle against the U.S. embargo, the growing effort by the international community to condemn this embargo, and taking steps to neutralize the negative effects of that policy of economic isolation. The dissemination of our real image around the world, with strengths and weaknesses, but a real image as I have explained, is another of our priorities. The great information multinationals have for a long time distorted the Cuban reality, which was been a way of justifying to international public opinion specific political actions taken against Cuba. With our modest resources we must, and we can, every day subvert this situation. The famous human rights issue is one of the most extensively manipulated enemy campaigns, and as we honor the truth, we will not remain seated on the bench of the accused when the greatest violator is trying to serve as our judge. Other priorities are working to develop economic relations abroad; working for the true democratization of the United Nations and of international relations; our growing ties with the countries of our continent, and specifically with the Caribbean nations; and becoming more active in regional organizations. Finally, we work constantly to strengthen the solidarity movement with Cuba. It is easy to realize that our goals are not so great as everything we need to do to achieve them. Time will have the last word. [Vinas Alfonso] Does Cuba have a presence in Africa now? What are the prospects for our relationship with the "Dark Continent"? [Robaina] I can categorically answer yes to that question; we do maintain a presence in Africa, and we could not do otherwise. Cuba shares with the African countries, in addition to our strong ties of blood and a similar culture and habits, the fact that we belong to the underdeveloped world, so we need to work together to emerge from underdevelopment; this is obviously related to our combat against the present manifestations of colonialism, neocolonialism, and racism. Our presence in Africa is shown by our 16 embassies and several hundred Cubans who work in various fields, primarily health care, as well as in education, sports, and other areas of economic, scientific, technical, and cultural activity. This is all a consequence of the numerous bilateral accords we have signed, and of our participation in multilateral cooperation organizations. In addition, despite the enormous limitations imposed by the special period, Cuba continues to provide Africa with extraordinary support, like the training we provide to mid- and upper-level technicians and professionals in all fields, who later will contribute to the development of their own countries. Africans make up almost two-thirds of the foreign scholarship students studying in our country. In our relationship with Africa, we certainly intend to continue developing these ties that which benefit us both bilaterally, and the Third World as a whole. [Vinas Alfonso] Can we now discuss the integration of our country with the rest of the Caribbean nations, or is that an objective? [Robaina] I do not think we can talk about integration. Integration as such has not been achieved in the region. Nor of integration as an objective. Instead, I believe this is a process that in recent years has taken on great momentum. Do not forget that in the 1970's we began to develop cooperation plans for sectors like health care and education with other Caribbean countries. During our trip to the seven English-speaking Caribbean states with which we have diplomatic relations, one of the constants was their governments' gratitude for the aid Cuba has provided for years in education and health care. Just in university education, during these years we have graduated over 600 students from that region. The contribution made by Cuban medical brigades to Caribbean countries like Guyana and Belize is widely recognized. And this is also part of the integration process I was talking to you about. One of the main steps taken recently is the creation of the Joint Cuba-Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] Commission, which should promote cooperation and relations with the 13 English-speaking Caribbean nations of the Caribbean Community, in specific sectors such as biotechnology, fishing, agriculture, culture, information, and other areas. In this move toward regional integration, the projected Association of Caribbean States should play a very important role. This is expected to become a reality in 1994, and Cuba should be a full member of this association. As you see, this process is going at a good pace, and it really does have great prospects. [Vinas Alfonso] What might be the future of Latin America if the FTA [Free Trade Association] were to be extended to the entire continent? If that happened, what would happen to our insistence on regional integration? [Robaina] Free trade has become a trend of our times, especially in our hemisphere, after the formation of large economic blocs in Europe, Asia, and North America. In addition to the recent FTA, there are in our continent Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Group of Three (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Andean Pact, Caricom, and SIECA [Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration], all of which are moving toward establishing free trade systems among our countries. Brazil's government recently proposed creating a Free Trade Zone for South America, and its intention to extend this to other geographic areas of Latin America. Cuba is watching the evolution and execution of all these mechanisms. It would take a long time for the FTA (known by its English acronym, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]) to be extended all over the continent, and many difficulties would need to be overcome. One difficulty is that the United States would have to be really prepared to eliminate all impediments in its trade with our region, and treat us as equals. This would primarily mean that they would need to take into account the differences existing between that country and our peoples. Cuba also supports free trade. Because of our geographic position and the development of our economy, we have always been open to integration mechanisms. However, the embargo the United States maintains against Cuba is an obstacle, and one of the contradictions of those who proclaim free trade as a philosophy, while at the same time they maintain this embargo, apply pressure, and prevent Cuba from exercising this right. If we now moved toward a "fast track" implementation of the FTA on a hemispheric level, our Latin American countries would have to negotiate separately in bilateral dealings with the United States, which would obviously be a great advantage for the United States. At the next Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, one issue on the agenda will be integration. Cuba will state its position, which may be summarized like this: before reaching a hemispheric Free Trade Agreement, we should go through a process of strictly Latin American integration, which will enable us to talk with the United States from stronger positions. There is still a long road to travel before arriving at a continental FTA. [Vinas Alfonso] Where are our relations with the European Union? [Robaina] At a point where we perceive new prospects for cooperation. Starting in 1993, a gradual and encouraging change has begun in Cuban-European relations. An example of this is the aid sent after the "hurricane of the century" and the neuropathy epidemic, aid for which all our people are grateful. Another example is the European Union's rejection of the extraterritorial nature of the Torricelli Amendment and the European Parliament's condemnation of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. The seminar held in Havana last December demonstrated that it is possible to talk in a climate of respect and that there is consensus on continuing to develop bilateral relations. I am sure we will move ahead in that direction. [Vinas Alfonso] In Cuba's case, does Spain fully play its historic role as the representative of Hispanic America in the European Union? [Robaina] I really think you should ask Spain that question. That said, let me point out that, in fact, Spain has historically served as the bridge between Latin America and the European Economic Community (now the European Union), and it has worked to defend the interests of the continent, which Cuba looks upon with favor. In the bilateral area, we have very extensive relations with Spain in all sectors, and we would like them to continue and expand. This is appropriate because of the strong solidarity, affection, and shared identity between the peoples of Spain and Cuba. [Vinas Alfonso] What about our relations with the former socialist nations? [Robaina] After a period of adjustment and even a considerable decline in ties of all sorts as a consequence of the changes in the countries of East Europe, relations are entering a new phase of normalization and a search for ties which may be of mutual benefit for our peoples. Of course, the economic ties have been considerably affected, not because of a political decision on either side, but rather because of the lack of real possibilities for fluid trade. Nevertheless, there are other channels for cooperation, and we are working on that. The relations we have developed for over 30 years cannot and must not disappear overnight. [Vinas Alfonso] Can you tell us about ties with the new republics in the former USSR, especially with Russia and Ukraine? [Robaina] Bilateral relations with those countries, which after the dismembering of the USSR were at an impasse, have begun to revive and we now see fluid exchanges in both directions. Cuba maintains relations with the majority of the states that were part of the former USSR. We have ambassadors accredited to the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Latvia, and we also are represented in Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus, and Estonia. With the Russian Federation the most difficult moment in bilateral relations is now behind us. People have become aware of the potential that exists, and there is an obvious desire to restore exchanges and active cooperation in various areas on mutually advantageous terms. With Ukraine relations are proceeding normally; we want to renew the legal basis of these relations and begin a new phase in trade. Recently the Embassy of Ukraine was officially opened in Havana, and in general we maintain a fluid interchange in political matters. The Ukrainian Government recently approved a significant amount of humanitarian aid for Cuba, which we will receive shortly. In a general sense, our relations with these new states have a tradition of over 30 years that unites us with their peoples. Now we need to restructure our ties on new foundations, based on the changing situation in today's world. At the end of last year we were working on some new agreements that have still not been fully executed, but we are confident that the situation of relative stagnation that at one moment threatened our fraternal trade ties has been overcome to our mutual benefit. [Vinas Alfonso] The "Nation and Emigration" conference will soon take place. How might that help to promote a change in the now old and stale hostility between Washington and Havana? [Robaina] In the first place, let me make it clear that the old conflict between Cuba and the United States is not on the agenda of this conference. As it has been said, this is a meeting of Cubans who live in over 50 countries all over the world. The issues to be discussed concern only that nation-emigres relationship. Moreover, it is no secret to anyone that the largest number of Cuban emigres live in the United States, as it is also no secret to anyone that for 35 years that emigration has been used by the aggressive policy of that country against Cuba. In the same way, I am not saying anything new when I say that in recent times a large part of that emigre community is changing in terms of their relationship toward the island and their positions on U.S. policy toward Cuba. Obviously, all this is the context of Cuba's relations with the emigre community, and it would be impossible to avoid touching on this situation during the conference. Cuba's relations with the United States will definitely not be promoted at that conference. I will reaffirm once again our readiness to discuss the issue directly with that government, without intermediaries and at any time, but in a climate of mutual respect, equality of conditions, and without any preconditions or pressure. [Vinas Alfonso] Will this meeting be the start of an ongoing exchange? How does it benefit Cubans both here and abroad? [Robaina] Contacts with our emigres throughout the world have always existed, with some more, with others less, but those contacts have been maintained. Though to be honest, relations with the Cuban community living in the United States have been, as I explained, for a long time tainted by the conflict between the two countries. Working to normalize relations with the emigre community is one of the fundamental objectives of the conference. It was preceded by the dialogue in 1978, which was certainly an important step taken by the Cuban Government, by means of which effective answers were given to specific problems affecting Cuban emigres. The forthcoming conference in Havana will provide a followup to that first meeting and solve new problems in the emigre-nation relationship. Cubans on the island who have relatives abroad and those in that emigre community who want to maintain normal ties with Cuba and their families will both benefit. [Vinas Alfonso] In Miami some spokespersons on the far right are saying that the conference is trying to divide the emigre community. What do you think? [Robaina] The fact that they are "spokespersons on the far right" confirms what I already said, that every day that emigre community is more divided about how to handle their relationship with Cuba. So it cannot be an objective of the conference to trigger a process that has already begun on its own. Obviously, there are different ways of viewing that emigration, and the presence at the conference of some people for and others against will actually be the demonstration of a fact, and not its cause. [Vinas Alfonso] At all international forums, Cuba insists on the need to end the embargo. Could there be a possibility of that happening anytime soon? Might our problems then be eliminated? [Robaina] The first is another question that should be addressed to the U.S. Congress or the White House. But we are not going to give up our right to denounce the criminal, antiquated, and ineffective embargo at any forum where a Cuban representative is present. And we are working every day to add new forces to the already overwhelming mass of countries, organizations, and public figures all over the world, even in the United States, who speak out against that brutal step that violates the principal human right of an entire people, the right to life. If one day reason triumphs and the embargo is lifted, I can assure you that would eliminate one of our major problems and many others that derive from it. But in no way would that be the end of our difficulties, which have other well-known causes, and against which we are also working every day. [Vinas Alfonso] You have just returned from a trip to Asia. What can you tell us about that region, which is both so remote and so close? [Robaina] Precisely that. It is worthwhile to travel that far, if only to realize that we have very good friends in that part of the world, some perhaps, our most loyal friends. The trip included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and had more or less the same objectives as our former visits to other areas of the world. As always, we brought the truth about Cuba and learned from close at hand about others--experiences like those of Vietnam, which in some aspects coincide with our own economic transformations. There is much that we can, should, and are going to apply here. With the governments we talked about issues of mutual interest: bilateral and multilateral relations, and the Non-Aligned Movement, which is now being chaired by an Asian nation, Indonesia. We met with ministers, political leaders, and businessmen, and saw the possibilities of exchanges in various areas, including economics of course, and we discussed prospects for joint investments. Because of the distance separating us, we have to work creatively to find the most viable mechanisms to increase our exchanges. Finally, I want to say that one of the interesting experiences of my visit was seeing how our diplomatic missions in those countries, while small and modest, honorably represent Cuba and are a true example of how to make up with efficiency and intelligence for the lack of personnel or greater resources. [Vinas Alfonso] Your appointment a year ago aroused some opposition. What is the situation now? [Robaina] Once again, I am not the person who can best answer that. But I can tell you what I think now, a year after my selection as foreign minister. These have been 12 months filled with a great deal of work and learning, of experiences of all types; a year in which I have traveled to various parts of the world, to some 30 countries in all. I have taken part in numerous international events and talks with personalities from all over the world. It has been a year to adapt, while on the job, to new responsibilities, a new workplace, new comrades. The year has gone well, and I feel pleased about it, although as I am never satisfied, I think a lot more could have been done, and in fact that is now the challenge I face for the next 12 months. Let us see what will happen then.
