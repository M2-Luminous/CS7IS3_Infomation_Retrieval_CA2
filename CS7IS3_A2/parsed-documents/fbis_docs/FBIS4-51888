A newspaper yesterday quoted Lt Col Suphachai Sirisap, deputy chief of the Foreign Affairs Division, as saying police will arrest Peter Bourne when they see him. He also was quoted as saying that Bourne, a former adviser on narcotics to the Carter administration, appeared to have crossed into Burma illegally from Thailand. Bourne, 60, was relieved of his job as presidential adviser on narcotics after allegedly abusing his position, according to the report. Lt Col Suphachai said yesterday he had never been interviewed as reported by the newspaper. "I don't know about the issue at all. The report has damaged my reputation," he said. Suphachai said he told reporters that any country wanting Thailand to arrest a foreigner must first contact the Foreign Ministry, which would then inform the Interior Ministry. The Interior Ministry would consider whether to order the Police Department to take legal action.
