Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "There Is a Problem With Crimea, Yet, It Is Not in Meshkov"] [Text] [Nepomnyashcha] Before the Crimean elections, [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk said that the problem is not whether there will be a president, but what powers he will have. Today, when a month has already passed since the election of Yuriy Meshkov as [Crimean] president, do you think that there still is a problem with the Crimea? [Mykhalchenko] There is a problem, but it is an objective one, and it does not depend on who is in power there -- [Crimean Supreme Council Chairman Mykola] Bahrov or Meshkov. In general, the problem with Crimea is not who is the leader -- the speaker or the president -- but what social forces are active on the peninsula. We see that pro-Russian forces are very active there. Moreover, their activities are aimed at separation from Ukraine. This is the problem. These activities, however, are doomed to failure. Nobody in the world claims that the documents according to which the Crimea was handed over to Ukraine were illegal. The Crimea is an integral part of our territory. Not only Ukraine but also all of Europe will base its position on this fact. Perhaps this position is also convenient for Russia, because if it acts differently, it will position itself in a very inconvenient situation. In such a case, Germany will have a reason to address the issue of East Prussia, currently Kaliningrad Oblast. The issue of Kuril Islands and other territories, which were acquired by Russia in the 20th century, may also be addressed more sharply. This problem is like an iceberg. Yuriy Meshkov will undoubtedly define his strategy and tactics soon. Russia has been supporting him in his activities so far. However, when he went to Russia already as the president, neither the Russian president nor the prime minister, nor even a deputy prime minister, received him. This was very symptomatic. Russia understands that the Crimea is an autonomous body in the composition of Ukraine, and it should be treated as an autonomous republic. Regarding Crimea's cooperation with the CIS and other Western or Eastern countries, the Ukrainian leadership has never been against that. Such cooperation can be conducted directly, however, only within the competence available for the Crimea. The issues of foreign relations, borders, customs houses, and so on, fall under the competence of the central government. [Nepomnyashcha] Yuriy Meshkov goes to Russia and, according to him, agrees to put the Russian ruble into circulation in the Crimea. Does the leader of the autonomous republic have the right to do that? [Mykhalchenko] In this case, his wishes are presented as reality. First of all, at a meeting between both presidents -- Kravchuk and Meshkov -- when the latter addressed this issue, Kravchuk did not respond positively. The issue was submitted for consideration by a working group. Second, Russia will never put its ruble into circulation without approval from the central Ukrainian Government, because this would be a financial aggression. In general, even if there are two currencies in the Crimea, this will not be really bad for Ukraine. The consequences will be worse for Russia, because it will expose itself to the blow of inflation, opening a free path for its currency to sneak away. [Nepomnyashcha] Who will repay the loans that the Crimean president wants to negotiate currently? [Mykhalchenko] If the loans are granted without the central government's approval, Ukraine will not take any responsibility for them. I have recently had a conversation with an official of the European Bank of Cooperation, who said that his company will not grant the $100 million in the form of a loan for building hotels, etc., unless there is the approval of the Kiev government. If the central government acts as a guarantor of the loan, it will not allow it to be wasted. Those who will obtain any loans without Kiev's guarantees will be responsible for repaying them. [Nepomnyashcha] In other words, these will be private loans... [Mykhalchenko] Yes. [Nepomnyashcha] Is the Ukrainian leadership going to put the following emphasis in its policy: The peninsula wanted to get a president, and it has received one. The president has promised a lot in his election campaign, and this means that he should implement this now. Thus, the responsibility of the Crimean authorities for living conditions must increase now? [Mykhalchenko] We could follow this reasoning, particularly, taking into account the fact that 50 percent of the Crimean budget is composed of central government subsidies. We could say: If you do not want to cooperate with us, we will not give you any subsidies. I know, however, that the central government will never put strong pressure on the Crimea to bring it to its knees. We understand that the people who live there need energy and housing, and that local enterprises need assistance. The subsidies have therefore been preserved. The Crimean government, however, should not forget that it is able to secure the life of the peninsula only half way. A situation when subsidies are coming from the center but revenues are left home is inadmissible. The Crimea should also pay taxes, contribute to the pension fund, etc. [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the fact that Yuriy Meshkov has invited Yevhen Saburov, one of Silayev's deputies in a former Russian Government, to assume the office of Crimean prime minister? [Mykhalchenko] Since I personally know Saburov very well, I do not see any revolt here. Such a practice is known throughout the world. There is one judicial problem however. Ukrainian legislation regarding state service says that state offices can be held only by Ukrainian citizens. Yevhen Saburov was born in Yalta, and if he wanted to receive Ukrainian citizenship, there would be no obstacles. This would be beneficial for the Crimea, because he is a top level economist. [Nepomnyashcha] Meshkov's viewpoint regarding the Black Sea Fleet is essentially different than the opinions of official Kiev. What will become of the fleet in such a case? [Mykhalchenko] It will become what it is to become, regardless of Meshkov. This is not his competence, but that of the central Russian and Ukrainian Governments. During his meeting with Meshkov, Kravchuk said that although the Crimean government will attend the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet, the decision will be made by the Ukrainian and Russian Governments and presidents, as provided for by agreements. The position of the Crimean government is purely consultative. [Nepomnyashcha] Does the Crimean Constitution fall in line with the Ukrainian one currently? [Mykhalchenko] No. In many cases it does not. I would not like to provide these examples, because this issue is currently being examined by the parliament, which will make it completely clear. I will only say that the Crimean Constitution must be brought in line with the Ukrainian one. There is no other way. [Nepomnyashcha] What if there is resistance? [Mykhalchenko] The power of law should be applied. The Ukrainian Constitution is superior with regard to the Crimean one, and the minority should be subordinated to the majority. [Nepomnyashcha] It is easy to say that the power of law must be applied. What if it will be impossible to do this legally? [Mykhalchenko] Other powers should be exercised then, to ensure that Ukrainian laws are effective. I believe, however, that certain reasonable circles will be found in the Crimea, which will understand that resistance has no future. Otherwise, they will have to take responsibility for the fate of the people. There is another issue in the Crimea however, which is to be defined in both the Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions. There are indigenous people in the Crimea -- the Crimean Tatars -- and their status should be defined in the Crimean Constitution. I believe that this territorial autonomy can be gradually transformed into nationally-territorial one, the constitution of which will denote that the Crimean Tatars are its indigenous people. Otherwise, all international organizations will see there violation of the rights of a native people. [Nepomnyashcha] On 1 December [1991] during the referendum, the majority of people in Sevastopol voted in favor of Ukrainian independence, which Leonid Kravchuk used to emphasize. Recently, however, the city has voted for other ideals, having supported Yuriy Meshkov. [Mykhalchenko] At that time, many politicians claimed that if Ukraine separated from Russia, we would live much better. And people believed in this. You probably remember how strong the propaganda was at that time: Everything is being carried away from Ukraine, and therefore, we are hungry and barefoot. But when we begin to live on our own, we will immediately get rich, our bellies will be full, and we will be well clad. Later, instead of conducting structural reform of the economy, we began our tug of war. Meanwhile, the crisis deepened, and living conditions declined, by the way, also in Russia. Now, people believe that it was better when we lived together, and when we became independent, it got worse. The point, however, is not the independence, but that we should move forward instead of remaining in the same place, or even worse, going back.
