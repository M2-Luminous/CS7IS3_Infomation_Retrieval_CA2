Which is not entirely correct. They have simply begun speaking about this at last. But the reformers had a different intent. To prepare a draft order by the minister of defense without unnecessary fanfare. He would sign it hastily without considering it carefully. And the deed was done, the reorganization took place. Who needs this? One viewpoint. "We have three central organs for the Ministry of Defense--KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the weekly SYN OTECHESTVA, the semimonthly journal ARMIYA, and 13 travel and other magazines. Altogether, 102 editions. At the same time, for example, the Pentagon publishes about 400 magazines and 1,000 newspapers. In the FRG they publish about 100 military newspapers and magazines, and Britain publishes more than 110. A subsidy of 1,241,462,000 rubles [R] is required. As a comparison, it costs the state budget roughly R1.5 billion to publish just the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA alone." (From an interview last year with Vladimir Kosarev, chief of the Information and Press Administration of the Ministry of Defense.) The following episode took place last year in one of the MO [Ministry of Defense] collegium meetings. "Is a large amount of money required to support our press?" the minister asked. They answered him. "And how many houses can be built with this?" Pavel Grachev asked. "Three or four," the general in charge of finances reported. "Well, we should build them," the minister sighed. "The housing for officers is really a catastrophe." As we know, any sigh by the chief is interpreted as a directive in the Army. An arithmetic lesson. Speaking of the need for reform, all the military officials say the primary cause is the shortage of money (at the same time, though, they prefer to call it "optimizing" the press or "putting it in order"), stating more specifically that most of the funds go toward the wages of editorial staff collectives. The conclusion is obvious--to be squeezed. Some of the large-edition publications will really disappear soon. This amounts to kopecks, however. You cannot shut down the district newspapers. They decided to fill up the Ministry of Defense's empty purse at the cost of the Moscow editions. Asking that his name not be given, an officer from the Information and Press Administration said the finance people simply ordered straight out at first: leave only one newspaper and one journal. But their ardor was restrained. It looks as if only the SYN OTECHESTVA and six magazines are being sent for the slaughter in the end. But two new ones are being established (we have to pay to order them, by the way). No one could tell me if there is a substantial economic gain from such deviations. There are probably no such assessments at all. But according to my estimates, it is very questionable. The most profitable military publications which are issued regularly and are not losing subscribers are on the list of the ones curtailed. At the same time, CHEST IMEYU (formerly SOVETSKIY VOIN), a literary and artistic journal with excessively inflated staffs (55 officers and 63 employees, with 12 correspondents stationed in the districts), turned out only six issues last year and is up to its ears in debt. The supplement to CHEST IMEYU--BOYEVOY TOVARISHCH--has not been issued for a year. Aleksey Petrenko, who heads the supplement, implores: "Dismiss us in the staff reduction." "No, stay," they respond. Altogether, about 100 officer-journalists are being released in the publications being abolished. A few more than the number left in the Information and Press Administration. But not many more. Even during the times of the unforgettable GlavPUR [Main Political Directorate], the octopus which squeezed the Armed Forces, the entire military press was headed by a department with under 10 soldiers. But now the official category of chief of the administration is a lieutenant general, his deputy is a major general, and the heads of departments are colonels, who are in charge of more colonels. According to my information, the administration is staffed by 62 persons. There are 40, according to its chief. Although this does not change the point. The prime mover of the reform. When I expressed my doubts to one of the administration's employees, he just smiled: "Everything runs smoothly as long as our lady is with us." The boss of the military press today is Yelena Agapova. The new administration--information and press--was established in the Ministry of Defense precisely because she asked for it. According to Grachev's order, "The chief of the administration is subordinate to the Russian Federation minister of defense's assistant for public and press relations," that is, to Yelena Aleksandrovna. She was formerly the deputy editor in chief of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Her subordinate, Vladimir Kosarev, who has headed the administration and received his general's shoulder boards with the speed of lightning, also comes from KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. And there are no mysteries for military readers with respect to CHEST IMEYU. When Nikolay Ivanov no longer wished to head the journal after the tragic October, and Aleksandr Tkachev, who headed the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA cultural department, took his place, Agapova was still a reporter for it. So the encirclement is being reinforced, step by step, "with her own people." As General Kosarev explained it to me, his administration will decide which publications to shut down and whom to appoint as editors of the new ones. They do not even intend to consult with the Ministry of Defense collegium about the publications being abolished (they include two central organs of the Ministry of Defense: SYN OTECHESTVA and ARMIYA, the only military-political journal in the Armed Forces). "This matter is too minor to divert the collegium's attention." But I know not all the minister's deputies and commanders in chief of the service branches are prepared to be content with the role of extras.
