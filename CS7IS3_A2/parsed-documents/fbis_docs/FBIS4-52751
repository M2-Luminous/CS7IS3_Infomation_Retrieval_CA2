Participants in a meeting of a working group on government administrative reform which convened at the prime minister's official residence noted the profound change in information and communications, saying, "drastic deregulation is necessary, not administrative measures in small dollops," the officials said. The telecom industry is hampered by existing regulations from freely taking the initiative in business, they said. They criticized the measures taken so far by the Postal Ministry, saying that deregulation "must be clear-cut to both users and the industry." The working group, which met for the sixth time, will draw up a final report at the next meeting on May 27, the officials said. The government will take the report into account when drawing up specific deregulation policies before the end of June.
