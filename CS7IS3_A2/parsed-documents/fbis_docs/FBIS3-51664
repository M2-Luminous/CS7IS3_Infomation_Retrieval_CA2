Brazil might reopen its embassy in Vietnam sometime this year, facilitating enhanced ties with Hanoi. The diplomats who will be participating in the trade delegation might discuss this issue with the Vietnamese. The Brazilian ambassador to Singapore is also the concurrent Brazilian ambassador to Vietnam. Among the Asian countries, Vietnam is much in demand by European businessmen. The tourism industry, in addition to other forms of cooperation, has been developing significantly over the past two years. Hanoi authorities seem to be determined to follow the Chinese path of "market socialism," with an economic opening but keeping a closed political system. In Vietnam there is a growth rate of 5 to 7 percent per year and an inflation rate of 5 percent per year. There are 72 million inhabitants, of whom 40 percent are under 15 years of age. Labor costs, which are still very economical, range between $30 and $40 per month. Foreign capital is slowly returning to Vietnam. Efforts are also being made to integrate the country into international financial organizations. Vietnam is scheduled to receive an average of $2 billion per year in foreign investments.
