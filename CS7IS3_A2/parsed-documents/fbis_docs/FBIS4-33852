As for statements by Congressman Robert Torricelli, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said that U.S. aid is in no way in jeopardy. Minister Lacayo said that, as soon as the laws to reinforce bond values and on the privatization of Telcor [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute] are published, it will become evident once again that the domestic compensation system is moving in the right direction. He added that Torricelli's statements are in keeping with his duty as a U.S. congressman: [Begin recording] [Lacayo] That is his work, to ensure that in Nicaragua we remain on this path to maintain excellent relations with the United States. But that does not imply that the aid is in jeopardy. I want to clarify that the aid is not in jeopardy. We are very confident with what we have done since 1990 in this regard. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] also has congressmen friends in the United States. Do you believe that the government will not need to implement a diplomat strategy or visit Washington to ensure that the aid is not jeopardized or that the amendment is not enforced? [Lacayo] We must show that our domestic process works. To ensure this we need to reinforce our bond system. We already have many alternatives in this regard, and we are presently working on this. We are trying to reach consensus agreements with the National Assembly. We must show that cases continue to be settled. Three or four cases that are important to them were settled recently. Two, three, four, five, or as many cases as possible will be settled next week involving not only U.S. citizens, but also Spaniards, Germans, and so on. [end recording] As for the plans of certain workers to block the privatization of Telcor, he pointed out that this privatization is a strategic need for the country in order to obtain resources and compensate those who were unjustly confiscated: [Begin Lacayo recording] Those opposing the privatization of Telcor will oppose the distribution of title deeds and oppose the legalization process. In other words, they would oppose the entire Sandinist leadership's wishes that they have voiced to us. They would also contradict the wishes of the entire leadership of the former UNO [National Opposition Unity] political parties and the wishes of a great majority of our country. In other words, they have no representation, because a majority of the people want title deeds issued to the new beneficiaries, and they want compensation paid to those who had property unjustly confiscated. Two birds will be killed with one stone: the privatization of Telcor. [end recording] Minister Lacayo added that Nicaragua is the country that has settled the most cases. So far, he added, 117 properties owned by U.S. citizens have been settled, that is, 42 percent of the total. USAID recently offered support to continue the compensation process, and this shows that the government of President Chamorro is indeed solving a problem it inherited.
