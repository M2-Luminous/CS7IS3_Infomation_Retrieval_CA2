Continuous Incidents (Part Four of Four) -- The Yang Yang Affair [Text] The Yang Yang affair also occurred during the same period. Yang Yang was a Beijing swimmer who had overstayed a tour of Hong Kong and not returned, and who publicly claimed that he feared persecution if he returned to China, so was asking for political aslyum. While I at first throught that he was the Jiangsu badminton player of the same name, I later heard that he was a Beijing athlete, so sent someone to find out and make inquiries in Beijing, finding that Yang Yang would certainly not be persecuted, but simply did not want to go home. Our investigation showed that while the British Hong Kong government had not yet made contact with Yang Yang at the time, a Taiwanese party had, and the Taiwanese authorities had expressed a willingness to take him in. As we were quite concerned that he might go to Taiwan, we sent someone to work with him, in hopes that he would return to China. Ji Shaoxiang [4764 4801 4382], our NCNA branch's Foreign Affairs Department director, reported directly to us that the British Hong Kong government had said that as long as we issued a statement to guarantee that Yang Yang would not be persecuted after he returned to mainland China, they would send Yang Yang, who they had in custody, back to China according to the practice for dealing with those who overstay visits. I replied that this was possible and, after obtaining Beijing's consent, issued the statement, the gist of which was that mainland residents left behind in Hong Kong around the time of the 4 June incident, regardless of whether they had taken part in any political activities, would without exception not be investigated after they returned to the mainland. But after the statement was issued, the U.S. consulate general still gave Yang Yang a visa allowing him to go to the U.S. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs learned of this, it immediately took it up with the British Hong Kong government, which claimed that the person had already left, so was "powerless" in the matter. How could we continue in the future to work with such an untrustworthy British Hong Kong approach? And when Ji Shaoxiang took it up with a [British Hong Kong] political advisor, he was offered only regrets. So Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and NCNA consulted on how to curb the British Hong Kong government's untrustworthy approach, demanding a test of strength with Britain. As every day brought mainlanders fleeing illegally to Hong Kong, and both China and Britain had agreed that those seized by the Hong Kong government's border guards would be repatriated immediately on the same day they were caught, we decided that unless we obtained a better promise from Britain on this matter, we would refuse to accept the repatriatees. When British Hong Kong missed the point of our negotiations, we began to refuse to accept repatriatees on our border, which brought a very strong response in Hong Kong society. As I considered at the time that allowing this to drag on for long would be adverse to winning over public support, I asked Pao Yu-kang [0545 3768 0474] to go and see the Hong Kong governor, to tell him that the hard line being taken by Beijing was Deng Xiaoping's idea, not a decision taken by subordinates. I also asked Pao Yu-kang to tell the Hong Kong governor that to resolve the Yang Yang incident, we were only asking the Hong Kong government to promise again that such incidents would not occur again in the future. Meanwhile, Ji Shaoxiang also made the same request to political advisors. But after Pao Yu-kang had disclosed this news to the Hong Kong government, there was no response. So I specially sought out Chia Tao-li [0857 6670 3810], asking him to use his influence to once again convey this information to the British Hong Kong government. A day later, Chia Tao-li told me that "as to the matter that you asked me to take care of, I have done it, and now we have to wait for the response." Sure enough, a Hong Kong government political advisor gave Ji Shaoxiang a verbal promise, after which we felt that the affair was over. When someone in the media asked about it, we announced the British Hong Kong promise. But then the political advisor denied it, forcing a clarification. Finally, the Hong Kong government published on the front page of the 26 October 1989 edition of NAN-HUA TSAO-PAO [SOUTHERN CHINA MORNING NEWS] their promise, stating that the Hong Kong government would not allow Hong Kong to be used as a base for activities designed to overthrow the PRC, ...... [LIEN HO PAO ellipsis], and that the Hong Kong government would continue to carefully consider matters and interests of concern to Hong Kong's special conditions and the Chinese Government. On 23 October 1989, after the Hong Kong government's private verbal promise, we stopped refusing to accept repatriatees. Throughout the whole affair, Guangdong Province was very supportive, with Guangdong's border guards acting in very fine coordination.
