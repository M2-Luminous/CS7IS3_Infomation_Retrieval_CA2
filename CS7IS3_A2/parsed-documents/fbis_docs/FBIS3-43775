FBIS3-43775 "drafr010_e_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 WEST AFRICA Guinea-Bissau Witness Says Opposition Leader `Falsely Accused' AB1301194894 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 12 Jan 94 AB1301194894 London BBC World Service Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] It looks as if the Guinea-Bissau opposition leader, Joao da Costa, may escape a prison sentence altogether following a dramatic development of his trial on the charges of plotting a coup last year against the government of President Vieira. The trial began just over a week ago and da Costa and 16 others were in the dock. But today one of the main prosecution witnesses, an Army officer, took the stand to talk about the alleged plot, and the soldier's testimony came as something of a surprise, as Eduardo Lubao reports in this telex from Bissau for VOICES news agency: Army Sub-Lieutenant Amadu Mane withdrew his accusations against Joao da Costa in a testimony today at the military court in Bisalanka outside the capital, Bissau. Mr. Mane said he had not met Joao da Costa for two years since the time when Mr. da Costa left the ruling PAIGC [African Party for the Independence of Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde] Party in order to form his own opposition party. He said the government security chief had persuaded him to falsely accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup d'etat. Mr. Mane, who is now an outspoken critic of poor conditions in the Army, explained how he had shot Major Obolo da Pino in March last year after da Pino has tried to kill him. Maj. Obolo da Pino was a close aide to President Nino Vieira and head of one of the Army's crack military units. Mane denied government charges that the killing was aimed at sparking off a mutiny against the government. He described how he fled abroad after the shooting, was captured in neighboring Gambia, and flown back to Bissau under military escort. He said that the interior minister, Abubacar Balde; the director general of the government security services; the chief of the Presidency; and the commander of the Frontier Guard then persuaded him to accuse Joao da Costa of plotting a coup d'etat. Mane said they had told him several other arrested soldiers had already agreed to accuse Mr. da Costa of plotting a coup and that he would be freed after the trial if he went along with the story. Last week, several other witnesses who appeared before the military court withdrew earlier accusations against Mr. da Costa, saying they had been obliged to sign false statements.
