FR940428-2-00083 FR940428-2-00052 If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri 1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director): Petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50&hyph;528, STN 50&hyph;529, and STN 50&hyph;530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona Date of Amendment Requests: January 4, 1994. Description of Amendment Requests: The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 3/4.2.3 Azimuthal Power Tilt and its associated bases. The licensee proposed to change the Azimuthal Power Tilt limit from less than or equal to 10 percent to less than or equal to 3 percent when the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System is out of service. Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Standard 1 _Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Decreasing the COLSS [Core Operating Limit Supervisory System] out-of service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification limit does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Technical Specification operating limit is being conservatively reduced to conform to the assumptions used in the safety analysis. The reduced operating limit requires a more uniform power distribution in the reactor core. The uniform power distribution may reduce the consequences of an accident previously evaluated by not allowing regions in the core to operate at higher power levels. Standard 2 _Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. The proposed amendment will result in an alarm setpoint change, but does not involve any equipment changes and will not alter the manner in which the plant will be operated. For this reason, this amendment will not create the possibility of an new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed operating range is smaller and completely within the existing Technical Specification limits; thus, there are no mechanisms to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. Standard 3 _Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment conservatively reduces the COLSS out-of-service Azimuthal Power Tilt Technical Specification limit, thereby increasing the margin of safety. The proposed operating range is smaller and completely bounded by the existing Technical Specification limits. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;400, Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina Date of Amendment Request: March 25, 1994. Description of Amendment Request: The amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.8.4.2, Motor Operated Valves Thermal Overload Protection, with a more accurate description of the motor-operated valve (MOV) bypass configuration. Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change is administrative in nature, providing a more accurate description of the MOV electrical supply configuration related to the thermal overload bypass function. Therefore, the change in terminology would not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation of the plant will not be affected. Therefore, the change in MOV thermal overload bypass function terminology would not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed terminology change does not affect any parameters which relate to the margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specifications or in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
