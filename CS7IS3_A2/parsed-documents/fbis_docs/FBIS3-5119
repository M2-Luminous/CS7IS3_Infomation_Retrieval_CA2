Noting that the nuclear waste dumped into the sea by the South Korean authorities in seven years, from 1986 to 1992, amounted to 11,000 trillion becquerels (about 100,000 curies), the statement brands this as an anti-national crime to throttle the South Korean people and the whole nation and reduce the country to a barren land contaminated with nuclear substances and a crude violation of the international law and convention. "The nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppets today is unthinkable apart from the nuclear development which is being promoted in secrecy in South Korea. Their nuclear development which began in the early 1970s under the `nuclear umbrella' of the United States has entered a very grave stage at present," the statement says, adding: "The puppets, taking issue with the fictitious `nuclear problem' of the North, have launched a malicious anti-DPRK smear campaign. One of its purposes is to divert to the North the attention of the home and foreign public and then step up their nuclear development". The statement continues: "The traitor Kim Yong-sam is steeped in flunkeyist treachery, fascism, confrontation with the North and splittist moves and, as if it were not enough, is committing even radioactive waste dumping threatening the existence of the nation. With him left alone, the independence and democracy of the South Korean society and peace and peaceful reunification of the country cannot be expected nor can our nation escape the danger of nuclear holocaust. "The South Korean ruling quarters must immediately open to the public their past nuclear waste dumping and apologize to the entire nation for it. "If they continue dumping nuclear waste and promote nuclear development in secrecy, they will face a stern judgement by the entire nation and history." The statement expresses the hope that the political parties and organizations and peoples of all countries and international organizations that love peace and aspire after social justice and progress, will lift up louder voices of condemnation, paying a due attention to the South Korean rulers' dumping of radioactive waste, and take necessary measures to check it.
