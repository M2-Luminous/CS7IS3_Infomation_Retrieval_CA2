The decision was made at a Unification and Security Policy Coordination Committee Meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku here Friday [17 June]. Former President of the United States Jimmy Carter, who is currently on a visit in Pyongyang, held first round of talks with the DPRK's President Kim Il-song yesterday on ways to find a solution to the nuclear issue. Kim was quoted as telling Carter that his country has changed its mind and will let two inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) remain in the DPRK. Meanwhile, Carter reportedly said that Washington-Pyongyang high- level talks may resume if the DPRK freezes its nuclear program. The U.S. and the DPRK held two rounds of high-level talks on the nuclear issue in June and July last year. The third round of talks, which had been scheduled for March 21 this year, was cancelled due to differences between the two sides. The South Korean Government will announce its position on Pyongyang's new sign of reconciliation after President Kim Yong-sam meets with Carter again over the weekend, officials here said. Carter, who went to Pyongyang through the heavily-fortified border village of Panmunjom after a three-day visit to South Korea, will return to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks with DPRK leaders before heading back to Washington. The former U.S. President said earlier that his trip would be a private one aiming "to discuss some of the important issues of the day with leaders of the area." The United States yesterday submitted a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for sanctions against the DPRK, which on Monday withdrew from IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and declared not to accept any more inspections of its nuclear program.
