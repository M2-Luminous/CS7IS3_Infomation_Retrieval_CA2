According to the edict, starting on 1 April 1994, the minimum wage scale in the republic is established at 176 drams, and in remote and border population centers, established by the government of the republic, 194 drams. The official salaries of workers of budgetary institutions that are not paid according to the multiplier coefficient with respect to the minimum wage, pensions designated in the event of full length of service, and the pensions of servicemen are increased by a factor of 1.6. The edict shows a clearly differentiated approach to the question of supplementary social support to the low income elements of the population. Additional monetary supplements, after indexation, were established for workers of budgetary institutions who are on a scale of less than 880 drams, for pensions with full length of service, and for the pensions of servicemen. What is also very important for a substantial part of the population is that, given an incomplete length of service, the scales of work pensions for age and disability, social pensions for old age and disability, and also the pensions of servicemen, and the supplementary payments to them, are determined from a calculation of the minimum wage with an additional supplement of 191 drams. Stipends to students of state higher educational institutions are established at a scale of 296 drams, for graduation classes--330 drams, and in the event of outstanding progress--370 drams. Starting on 1 April, the stipends for graduate students will be 500 drams, and for doctoral students--700 drams. Allowances of various kinds for children are being increased by a factor of 3 and more. A supplementary payment of 194 drams is established for unemployment benefits. The edict of the president of the Republic of Armenia will be published in full in one of the issues of RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in the near future.
