The military chief indicated that every day U.S. economic aid is minimized and conditioned on various situations. "It is assistance conditioned on many situations, even on sanctions by the U.S. Government, because of U.S. preoccupation with domestic policy. Nevertheless, I think the 1954 agreement is necessary," he said. According to Gen. Discua, the state should review both the agreement and the two protocols signed by the two governments in subsequent years. "The Armed Forces are proposing the review because we are no longer in the Cold War or an ideological war. In other words, the world situation has changed completely. Therefore, the agreements must be reviewed to update them according to the current situation," he commented. Discua indicated that certain rules are established in these types of agreements. "We can see that in the treaty and in the protocols there are many things that no longer agree with current times," he added. He explained that the military wants to update the documents to see what commitments Honduras has as a state as a result of the military aid. "We are not asking for benefits. I think the rules of the game have already been established. The U.S. Government has been very clear by reducing defense expenditures," he indicated. "Treaties are no longer bilateral agreements but multilateral agreements on integration and globalization. In other words, it is a new foreign policy," he added. For the military chief, the treaties signed in the 1950's reflect a clear anticommunist position to strengthen democracy and to cope with the Cold War and the ideological war. The U.S. Government has set the rules of the game by promoting the changes, he said. Asked whether the Armed Forces favor a military presence in Palmerola, he indicated that "they state that it is the will and they are at the disposal of the Honduran Government and policy." [sentence as published] "We are now advising Congress to analyze this agreement, without violating international regulations and laws, and without seeking confrontation," he said. "We want the agreement to be updated in accordance with the new U.S. political agenda for the region and for Honduras. I think that is fair," he stressed. He recalled that the Armed Forces have presented to the legislative branch a suggestion. "We clearly understand that it is up to the civilian power to decide what it wants or what should be done," he added.
