Following instructions from his superiors, he has set out to capture the left bank of the Una River. Artillery and tank attacks along the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and the Bihac front went on throughout the night, while artillery attacks at Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin intensified this morning. After yesterday's attacks in the Cazin-Velika Kladusa Commune, the so-called army of so-called Kladusa autonomy was somewhat quieter overnight, but it resumed attacking this morning. All this is an illustration of the peace in [Velika] Kladusa that Fikret Abdic claims he agreed yesterday with Karadzic [16 Feb]. [passage omitted] As we report this, the chetniks have stepped-up attacks on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and also on the demarcation lines with the remains of Abdic's rebel army.
