This international conference is attended by U.S. senators and congressmen, Russian legislators, politicians, top executives of enterprises and corporations from the two countries. The present "Aspen dialogue" is the fifth in number. It was held in the city of Aspen, Colorado State, for the first time in August 1991 by the international association of industrial managers headed by Konsantin Zatulin (now chairman of the lower house committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States) and the U.S. international centre of civil administration headed by B. Sivella. In the opinion of forum participants, it is being held now in the conditions when recent romanticism of Russian-American relations is passing into oblivion. Andranik Migranyan, member of the presidential council and chief expert of the lower house committee on the CIS, noted that "on withdrawing from the Soviet Union, Russia has not found its bearings with its national and state interests as well as aims. ``The Russian foreign policy at the first stage was the continuation of the old Soviet and was aimed at responding to initiatives of Western countries. ``This policy created false impression about Russia as a country which had no specific national and state interests and seeks to join `the big seven' and to pursue the same policy.'' "We now witness the painful formation of Russian foreign policy," Migranyan noted. This transition will be also promoted by the representative Russian-American forum "Aspen dialogue," which will work for five days.
