The meeting showed very clearly that the private sector wants deregulation to be carried out while the bureaucrats want to resist it. In the meeting, the private-sector representatives openly complained to ministry bureau directors general: "As long as government offices act this way, it will be extremely difficult to achieve any significant results in deregulation that would be acceptable both at home and abroad." The government offices' position in trying to defend vested rights showed up so clearly that the people around the prime minister were alarmed, saying: "This way, we can never get any significant plan adopted by the end of June." The meeting of the day saw five private-sector members of the group, which included Professor Tajima of Gakushuin University, exchange views with director general-level officials from the Ministries of Finance, International Trade and Industry, and Transport on topics of controls on commodity distribution, specifications and permits, and import procedures. It began with explanations by government officials on the present conditions of regulation and on the reasons for them. Some of the officials said: "We will take positive actions [for deregulation]"; but most of them showed a negative stand, insisting, "Under the given conditions, we cannot decide for deregulation." The private-sector group members reacted strongly against the position of the offices resisting deregulation, some saying, "It is truly regrettable that there is no change in the government offices' strong attitude toward defending [regulation]. Others said: "The economy should be free of control in principle. You must change the attitude of defending regulation, citing Japan's special circumstances as the reason."
