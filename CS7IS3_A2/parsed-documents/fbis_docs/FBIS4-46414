What is your general assessment of this situation in light of these changes? Fadlallah: [passage omitted] We notice that the jihad operations carried out by Islamist Palestinians have attracted much attention from U.S. officials to the extent that they deal with 'Arafat based on his rejection of these operations. They want 'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in harsh words and strong denunciation, not just regret, when the United States is satisfied with just expressing regret for all massacres of Muslims committed by the Jews. [passage omitted] Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or national movements that reality generates. We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East steered by the American strategy that is open to other strategies in the region. Ahmad: Are we content with the role of bystander or do you have a specific vision of this confrontation? Fadlallah: We talk about monitoring because we are trying to analyze reality and future prospects. But in the meantime, we are not neutral regarding that reality. As Islamists, we seek to revive the Islamic inclination by all means possible. We have our own rational and diligent study that measures reality against objectives to distort that American-Israeli plan. As Islamists, we proceed on the basis of integration with pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to free the Arab political, security, and economic aspects from the American fist and if they have not already sunk in the dreams America is trying to make them live by using words like moderation and so on. I believe that we have to relate with nationalists, pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed different from ours. [passage omitted] Ahmad: A final word by Your Eminence to your readers in Egypt. Fadlallah: As I speak about the great Islamic homeland in Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow citizens that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for Arabs, Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for anyone who seeks freedom and justice. We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness, and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence game. We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither now nor in the future because the international ploy does not want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our problems. We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and do not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not like one who seeks and does what is wrong." If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken, because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate with it.
