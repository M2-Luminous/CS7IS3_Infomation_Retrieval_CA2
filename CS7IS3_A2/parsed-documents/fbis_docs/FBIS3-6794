Meetings are being one after another at the Chongwadae [presidential office] and the White House daily. Foreign and domestic news reports sound like a war would break out any time. Surprisingly, however, citizens' responses are rather apathetic. With the 9.85-point drop in the composite index when the stock market opened at 9:40 AM [0040 GMT, 21 March], people said: "So people are shaken as expected." However, the predictions of employees at security companies were off the mark as stock prices rose shortly thereafter. Consequently, the stock market yesterday ended with the usual range of fluctuation. The so-called "North- related items," that should have obviously plunged if "Seoul is to become a sea of fire," showed no particular changes. The same applied to travel agencies who are used to being swamped by heightened airline ticket sales and visa inquiries whenever North-South relations have gone awry in the past. Saying that "nothing has changed," Na Yong-sok, 39-year-old sales manager for Global Tours, said "I would rather have our business suffer than receive such telephone inquiries in the future." There has not been much shopping in bulk either. Chong Yong-kil, 37-year-old president of the Kwangmyong Ha-an branch of Nongsimga [a supermarket chain], said, "It seems like citizens don't see much likelihood of war as they haven't been buying in bulk." The college scene is also quiet. Why are the citizens so unperturbed? Yi Hyok-chu, chief of the marketing department of Lucky Securities Co., assesses that, "It seems that people have developed their own sense of the international situation from the prolonged negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and that they are well aware of North Korea's situation." A member of Seoul National University's General Student Council commented, "The `Seoul sea of fire theory' is merely North Korea's gesture to secure an advantageous position in nuclear negotiations." Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense views this phenomenon from two contradictory positions -- that "it reflects a maturity in people's views," and that "it reflects that people have become desensitized to the security issue."
