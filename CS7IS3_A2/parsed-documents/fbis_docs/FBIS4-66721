The Department of Space and Arianespace have signed an agreement for launching the INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D multipurpose communication satellites being built by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the second half of 1995 and 1996. The agreement was signed by the ISRO Chairman, Prof. U.R. Rao, and Arianespace Chairman, Mr. Bigot, in Paris on March 4, according to an ISRO press release issued here this evening. Arianespace was selected to launch the satellites after a thorough evaluation of request for proposals received from various leading commercial launch services in the international market. The second generation INSAT satellites were being built by ISRO. INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B, launched on July 10, 1992, and July 23, 1993, by Arianespace, were working `very satisfactorily' and providing various services. The INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D, weighing around 2,100 kg each, would add to the capacity available for communications. They would carry 3 KU-band transponders in addition to the C-band, S-band and extended C-band transponders. The C-transponders will have increased power levels that will enhance TV coverage capabilities and business and remote area communication services. For the first time in the INSAT system, mobile satellite communication services will also be introduced. Using this facility, vehicles fitted with suitable equipment could communicate with their offices or other vehicles while on the move. INSAT-2C and 2D will not carry meteorological instruments and will have double-sided solar panels providing about 1,600 watts of electric power to operate the equipment on board the satellite.
