He urged Conservatives to stand as "the party of Europe," confident that the UK government's vision of a loose, free-trading European Union was now becoming the new orthodoxy in Europe. Mr Hurd's anxiety is as understandable as it is acute. In the ordinary course of events, the European parliament election campaign would be likely to be fought as a plebiscite on the government's domestic record, not on the future of the EU [European Union]. Since the government is deeply unpopular, the elections risk being a disaster for the Tories. But the disaster will be all the greater if, in addition, the campaign becomes the scene for another virulent slanging match over Europe between the two halves of the Tory party. If Mr Hurd succeeds in papering over his party's split over Europe, he will be lucky. Unfortunately, it is simply not true that the UK government's vision of a loose EU is now the new orthodoxy in Europe. What is true is that there is now no accepted orthodoxy on the future of the EU, because the Union is in a state of profound political malaise. The reason for this malaise is that the Union has been completely overtaken by the speed and scale of events in the real world outside. When the Maastricht Treaty was put together, in the brief moment of ecstasy after the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl thought they were concluding a grand Franco-German Euro-bargain for the internal development of the EU, as a counterpart to German unification. They did not foresee that their private deal might be ship-wrecked by the storms on the world's foreign exchange markets, or by war in the Balkans. In addition, the Union has lost credibility with the voters, and therefore with politicians, because it has failed to exorcise recession or avert rising structural unemployment. Once upon a time, Europe was sold on the prospectus that economic integration would deliver growth, in spite of the transitional pain of European economic liberalism. Today, Europe's workers are being asked to accept that their jobs and the postwar European socioeconomic model may be thrown on the garbage heap for the sake of a global economic liberalism that bypasses anything decided in Brussels or indeed in any national capital. As a result, the EU is now plunged into a gloom as deep as the phase of Euro-pessimism of 10 years ago. Since that earlier pessimism then gave way to an equally intense phase of Euro-phoria, with the Single European Act and the collapse of communism, some may reasonably ask if the present depression may not turn out to be just another passing phase. It may. But there at least two reasons why it may not. The first lies in the shortcomings of the Maastricht treaty. The plan for economic and monetary union may not be dead, as the jeering Euro-sceptics would have us believe, but its future is at best uncertain. The equally grand scheme for a common foreign and security policy always looked over-ambitious; in the light of events in former Yugoslavia, it now looks merely flatulent. With hindsight it seems clear that the practical prescriptions contained in the Maastricht Treaty fell short of the stated objectives. If the member states really want monetary union, they probably need to make a bigger political commitment; if they want a common foreign policy, they obviously have to make a much bigger political commitment. Right now the Union has a treaty whose stated ambitions exceed its grasp; but there is no general willingness to strengthen the treaty so as to make its aims attainable. But the disagreement between the member states on where the EU is going, or how to get there, is made much worse because they do not know how many members it will have; and this is the second reason for gloom. The fall of the Berlin Wall has released a flood of eager candidates: four members of the European Free Trade Association are negotiating now, and there is a platoon of other countries waiting to join. It should be obvious that a much larger Union will be a very different Union. But the present member states cannot resolve the problem of what such a large EU should look like, because they are still impaled on the ideological argument between nationalists and federalists. This unresolved ideological argument is bound to cut across the question of EU enlargement, and might conceivably prevent it. The European parliament, which now has the power to ratify enlargement, said two years ago that it would not agree to new members unless its own powers were strengthened; yet it seems unlikely that members will renegotiate the Maastricht treaty, and certainly not in the middle of negotiations with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] candidates. In the event, parliament may hesitate to veto enlargement. But this week such a threat came from Spain, which suggested that it might block the admission of the rich EFTA countries, without an increase in regional aid to the poorer countries of the Mediterranean. In other words, enlargement may yet become a negotiating pivot for the Union's old ideological arguments. But these arguments cannot effectively be addressed at least until France has a new president next year, and probably not until the Maastricht review conference of 1996. The present phase of Euro-gloom could be with us for a long time yet.
