Then came the big fish, catching Agnelli by surprise. Minds change in a hurry. Now there is an army behind Forza Italia, an army that is almost as big as the Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry]. Silvio in the midst of the salami makers. Friday, 6 May, Berlusconi will be the guest of honor at the food industry's convention. For the first time in the history of the Republic, a head of state will make his debut among the manufacturers of bologna and mozzarella. For Berlusconi, however, this is almost a mandatory act of appreciation. In fact, it is the victorious general who goes out to thank his most faithful veterans. It was the leaders of the food industry, guided by their president, Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara from Bologna (in other words, the owner of the well-known company Idrolitina), who were the most enthusiastic supporters of Berlusconi's entrance into the political arena. By now, however, they represent just the older nucleus of the army of followers that the Forza Italia leader can count on among the industrialists. Even though the Confindustria president, Luigi Abete, continues to repeat vigorously that "the Confindustria does not take sides," in reality, the industrialists have indeed taken sides, and how. And of course, they are on the winner's side. Evidence of their approval of Berlusconi was demonstrated at the meeting the industrialists' organization held in Verona on 15 and 16 April. An audience of owners, large and small, almost clapped their hands off whenever any speaker made favorable mention of the new majority's platforms. Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi received only scattered applause out of courtesy. Worse yet, a charismatic entrepreneur like FIAT president Gianni Agnelli risked a confrontation when he let it be known that in the Senate he would still vote for Giovanni Spadolini for speaker of the house, and not for Carlo Scognamiglio, Berlusconi's candidate. The opposition to Agnelli was too strong to have come only from Gazzoni Frascara and the other pioneers of Forza Italia. They were joined by a crowd of converts, even though they represented different shades and meanings. Berlusconi's last-minute followers included many anonymous figures, but also many prominent Italian industrialists who, until recently, had not hidden their animosity toward the Fininvest president. Even Pietro Marzotto, who has always been considered an almost overly independent man and someone who is completely averse to following the latest trends, has begun to take sides. "If I were Agnelli," he stated at the end of the Verona meeting, "I would take into consideration the way the industrialists applauded Scognamiglio." In short, Marzotto would have voted according to Berlusconi's wishes. And yet, it was he who, 12 days earlier (and, therefore, even after the elections), had pronounced the following, unequivocal words: "Berlusconi as prime minister would be a mistake. Not from a lack of appreciation, but I find it unthinkable that a large publisher, an entrepreneur who owns newspapers and television channels, could become the head of the government." But when the unthinkable becomes reality, even Marzotto adapts. His Veneto region gave the right 53 percent of their votes and, without a doubt, the Venetian industrialists under the long-time leadership of Marzotto contributed to this success. It is necessary, therefore, to bow to the will of the masses. A similar turnabout occurred in Rome on Thursday, 7 April, during the Confindustria directors' meeting. The industrialists' leaders are still in shock over the elections results. "We miscalculated," Abete admits to his closest colleagues. The magnitude of Berlusconi's victory stunned the Confindustria leadership, which had hoped that the center would hold better than it did. All the people who previously had been critical of Berlusconi have been left speechless by Forza Italia's triumph. Abete is silent and so is Aldo Fumagalli, the feisty president of the young entrepreneurs who is a strong believer in the Pact for Italy and tends to sympathize with the Democratic Alliance. Instead, the leader of the oil industrialists,Gian Marco Moratti, is talking. From the very first comments of his speech, it is immediately clear that the only incompatibility existing between him and Berlusconi is that he is an Inter soccer team fan. Other than that, Moratti adheres closely to the political positions held by the owner of the Milan soccer team and the future Prime Minister. "As long as there is no government," Moratti concluded, "Italy Inc. is closed. Therefore, it is better to set aside doubts and concerns and clear the way for Berlusconi." No sooner said than done. The number of industrialists siding with Berlusconi are increasing every day. As a consequence, those individuals who had already chosen Forza Italia have gained importance within the Confindustria. People like Gazzoni Frascara or the Assolombarda [Industrial Association of Lombardy] president, Ennio Presutti. The stock of the Northern League's Vito Gnutti, whom everyone expects will be a minister in Berlusconi's future government, has also risen. And even an unknown, like Giampiero Beccaria, the managing director of Necchi who was elected in Pavia for the Freedom Alliance has become a political reference point. But the feelings of the masses cannot be left in the hands of individuals such as these. Confindustria leaders know this and have started to make up for lost time. Behind the scenes of the Verona convention, Abete had harsh words of criticism for Ciampi: "He cannot come here as Prime Minister and then speak like a politician." The industrialists who hear these words immediately think that Abete has a plan. First, he will bury Ciampi's government, whose work he had generously supported, and then he will make overtures to Berlusconi's government. Other industrialists do not even bother to proceed step by step. Former Confindustria president, Vittorio Merloni, has now rejected both his old Christian Democratic persuasion and his more recent one of approval for Mario Segni's Pact for Italy. Now all his affections are reserved for Forza Italia. Like the true entrepreneur that he is, Merloni can even give an explanation for this change in marketing terms: A preelection survey in his Marches region predicted a massive swing of the population away from the center and toward Forza Italia. And Merloni moved along with them. Further north, the battle flag is being lowered by another former Confindustria president, Luigi Lucchini, who in Brescia had stubbornly resisted the rising of the League. When Berlusconi decided to become a candidate, Lucchini commented--citing an old Lombardy proverb--that everyone should stick to their own jobs. Two months later in Verona, Lucchini was among those who tried to explain to Agnelli that he should not unduly insist on Spadolini's nomination as Senate speaker of the house. Furthermore, the former Confindustria president, like Moratti, now states that a Berlusconi government is the only, and therefore, the best solution. This attitude is increasing among the Roman Catholic industrialists. For them there is even a theological explanation for the success of the Forza Italia leader: Berlusconi is an "inferior being," but he is still the result of God's will. In more down-to-earth terms, it means: Since he exists, better that he govern with us than without us or even against us. So, the platoon of industrialists who had preferred Segni or Martinazzoli is thinning out more and more. The feisty Fumagalli continues to keep silent and prepares to hand over the reins to Alessandro Riello, who certainly does not appear to be an anti-Berlusconi warrior. And even if Fumagalli does not know it, there could be a dramatic change in his attitude, since the Right intends to put forward his name for president of RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. Unexpected capitulations confirm that the group of non-Berlusconi supporters is in the process of dispersing. An incorrigible like Giancarlo Lombardi is beginning to admit that the Forza Italia leader knows how to restore the country's confidence. Until the end of March he, too, had said that Berlusconi could not expect to have the unanimous support of the industrialists and, above all, that the right did not have convincing platforms. Now their positions have softened. Many, including Abete, are making a few demands. For example, they are asking the Berlusconi government not to reopen the issue of the wage agreement that has improved the competitiveness of Italian businesses. But it seems that these are actually conditions for an even greater support of the government. There is no trace of a desire to oppose Berlusconi. If proof be needed, there is an abundance. The industrialists have never favored playing the role of opponent.
