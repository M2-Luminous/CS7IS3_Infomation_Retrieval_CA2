Masahisa Naito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau (class of 1961), Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], was suddenly summoned by a telephone call from the minister's private secretary, "Please come immediately." What can it be? Tilting his head to one side, he thought, "It must be that." A few days before, Naito had sat around a table of Chinese food with MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. It was about that time. "Hey, I'm asking you for economic countermeasures," said the small-statured minister. It was a scene where he impishly began massaging both of Naito's shoulders in an exaggerated manner and the associates who were with them convulsed with laughter. The Diet was being pressed for discussion on the political reform bill and economic countermeasures, and Kasumigaseki was also being pressed for measures. Moreover, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] had left public office with the July general election, the 1955 rule that had built postwar Japan had collapsed, and the coalition cabinet that was borne in its place had been calling for reform of the bureaucratic system which continued to support the old rule. The bureaucratic society of Kasumigaseki was about to face a crisis, but those around Naito were full of peace and harmony. Minister Kumagai has been criticized as "a capricious man who is an associate or lackey" of Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general (political source), but he is a former MITI bureaucrat two years junior to Naito and they are not entire strangers to each other. Thinking that it must be a discussion on economic countermeasures, Naito trotted toward the minister's office carrying the related data. However, when Naito stepped into the minister's office, he noticed something unusual about Kumagai. He usually keeps his private secretary present, but for some odd reason, Kumagai seemed not to want his secretary around, but to be alone with Naito, and he was trying to feel out Naito's demeanor with an upward place. When Naito sat down, abruptly Kumagai said coldly, just as if in jest, "It's hard for me to say this to you, but I want you to resign." "Based on cabinet policy, I want to change public feeling completely," he added. The blood ran out of Naito's whole body. Frightened, he asked in return "Er, when?" "During this month or next month. I would like it carried out as soon as the personnel system is settled." It normally is the Kasumigaseki custom that the administrative vice minister orders personnel changes. This case was unprecedented. When Naito rushed into the vice minister's office flustered by this unexpected development, Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano said with an expression filled with bitterness, "Actually, I spoke with him two hours last night and one hour this morning for a total of three hours, but couldn't get him to change his mind." "How many are targeted for resignation?" "...only one, you." "That is strange. That is absurd. There can't be complete change in public feeling with the resignation of just one person. I cannot accept it." When Naito protested, Kumano merely hung his head and was silent. What about the deputy vice minister? The deputy vice minister, who is said to be one with the vice minister, should have known about this matter. When Deputy Vice Minister Chikara Makino heard Naito's story, however, he squeaked, "What?" He jumped back with his mouth still wide open. "I haven't heard anything about that!" Not only MITI, but Kasumigaseki got wind of this sudden affair and it ultimately became an uproar. Furthermore, this became the occasion for the factional strife that secretly had been proceeding in MITI and the move by Shinseito to gain supremacy over MITI to surface all at once. Some even said that politics was intervening in administration. However, why was Naito, who was the number one candidate for next administrative vice minister and was called Mister MITI, forced to resign? When one investigates into the particulars, one will comes to feel that actually a preposterous scheme lurks behind this strife, and the firing of Naito is in line with a carefully and minutely elaborated scenario. Naito met with the treachery of his colleagues who, so to speak, have stepped over the fence between administration and politics and "shaken hands with the devil," and his bureaucratic career of 32 years and nine months came to an end. This was a kind of coup d'etat. At the same time, this tumult unintentionally brought to the light the "greatest shame" which had been fervently concealed for many years by MITI, reputed to be a first-class government agency -- the factional strife which has even involved officials' wives who hang out in MITI and some allegations concerning grants of the Japan Keirin Association (bicycle racing) that was called the MITI moneybag. "Responsibility for Darkening MITI" The issue of the resignation of Director Naito of the MITI Industrial Policy Bureau that shook Kasumigaseki at the end of 1993 was widely reported even by first-rate newspapers. Ultimately, this uproar was seen to have calmed down some because Naito accepted the minister's advice to resign on 22 December and gave his resignation dated the 24 December 1993. However, here again the issue has begun to fan a new fire. "Why did Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau have to resign?" There is no sufficient reason to explain that. Minister Kumagai made public two reasons for recommending Naito's resignation. They were: 1) on the occasion of Hirobumi (1987 group), eldest son of the former Administrative Vice Minister Yuji Tanahashi, retiring from MITI in January 1993 to run in the general election of July 1993, Naito, who was then the deputy vice minister, was responsible for using favoritism in a prestigious personnel change, and 2) responsibility for darkening MITI. Regarding the first reason, the majority was occupied by those who said that "Prestigious personnel changes were a customary practice in Kasumigaseki and certainly cannot be called good. However, what about the sacking? This was absurd like pronouncing a death sentence by commiting a public indecency like urination by the roadside. What explanation would he offer about Minister Kumagai himself receiving that prestige when he set out in the political world" (MITI former official)? Regarding "chief of the Policy Discussion Office, Small and Medium Enterprise Agency," the prestigious post which Minister Kumagai himself received, the people in Kasumigaseki firmly believe that "It was nothing like the post, `planning officer,' of Hirobumi Tanahashi which has now become the issue, Kumagai's post was closely associated with local small and medium enterprises, and it was a highly prestigious position that served straight in the election. The title, study abroad at Harvard University which Minister Kumagai effectively uses in election [campaigns], is also a permission for study abroad which Naito originally received after passing a rigorous examination, and Minister Kumagai has received concession of the privilege for nothing. He should not bear a grudge when he owes Naito gratitude. "Tanahashi is said to have a special promotion to seventh class with prestige, but that too is misunderstood. There was no skipping of years and no pay raise. It is difficult to understand why he said such a thing when the minister himself should have known that" (MITI former official). Then there is the second reason. That originated by the circulation of a mysterious defamatory document that divulged the prestigious personnel change of former Vice Minister Tanahashi's son and censured the former vice minister (consultant to Industrial Research Center) in the first part of August 1993. A second mysterious defamatory document appeared in September. After this happened, at the beginning of October, a Komeito representative in the House of Representatives Budget Committee questioned this incident and Minister Kumagai promised enforcement of official discipline. Meanwhile, a clamor arose when a group of lawyers brought a charge against former Vice Minister Tanahashi to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor. However, it has also been strongly voiced that "What darkened the ministry was the one who circulated the mysterious defamatory documents. The mysterious defamatory documents generally censured Tanahashi and did not directly reproach Naito. In spite of that, Naito was forced to resign for merely having been the confidant of Tanahashi. If this is allowed to go unchallenged, the people who are put out the mysterious defamatory documents will all have to resign. Conceding that it is a dispute between fellow factions, the Tanahashi faction versus the anti-Tanahashi faction, the common sense is that the two guilty parties should be punished together. It is absurd that just to have Director Naito resign" (MITI division chief). Moreover, the questioning in the House of Representatives is reported to have been an extremely shabby collusive backdoor maneuver of questioning. It was said to have been requested by Minister Kumagai himself who handed over the mysterious defamatory document to a Komeito Diet member (he has denied it in the newspapers), and the allegations have raised bugbears. Regardless of the special promotion and so forth, a powerful vice minister's preferential treatment in the ministry for his own son to sent him out in the election with a completely new title cannot escape censure of mixing public and private matters. On that point, the disparity with general common sense and the lack of work ethic that permeates all of Kasumigaseki is outrageous. Moreover, criticism cannot be helped of the deviation from political neutrality which is sought in public servants such as the closeness between Tanahashi and leaders of the LDP such as Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary general, and the assistance in his son's election, which was touched on by the series of mysterious defamatory documents censuring Tanahashi. Actually, the initial general response of public opinion was strong cries for proper punishment in this drama of dismissal from office. However, the issue is that this drama of dismissal from office was a scheme devised to correct such indulgences of bureaucratic society and slackening of official discipline. In the first place, regardless of how much responsibility there is as the authority in personnel matters, the dismissal from office of the incumbent director of the Industrial Policy Bureau just for that is utterly unreasonable. In other words, the reason for recommending Naito's resignation is not clear. Far from that, it is now openly mentioned in Kasumigaseki that "The ringleader who contrived the resignation of Director Naito related in any form to the mysterious defamatory documents was Takashima, director of the Industrial Location and Environmental Protection Bureau (1963 group, two years below Naito) of the anti-Tanahashi faction with cooperation of Hisashi Hosokawa, director of the Basic Industries Bureau (1964 group); Masataka Nakano, director of the International Economics Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group); and Takeyuki Isayama, director of the Economic Cooperation Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group), and that it linked to Yukiharu Kodama, former administrative vice minister (director of Central Cooperative Bank for Commerce and Industry)." However, it is said that "Neither the minister nor Vice Minister Kumano has any intention of finding the culprit" (MITI source). What in the world is this? Is Director Takashima really the ringleader? We will investigate this matter in due time, but before that, let's touch a little more on the details of the Naito resignation uproar. One can feel as if one were actually being there how MITI might have fallen into the absurd situation with this drama of personnel change. Whole Story of Dismissal From Office Drama Combining the testimony of Naito that was obtained at the end 1993, several opinions from inside MITI together with the testimony of former Vice Minister Tanahashi, we shall try to reproduce that time as faithfully as possible. Having suddenly received the advice to resign on the morning of the 16th, Naito immediately made telephone calls from the Industrial Policy Bureau director's office to former officials Toshinobu Wada (president, Petroleum Resources Development Co.), Keiichi Ohase (president, Arabia Oil Co.), and Yoshihiki Morozumi (power development consultant) with experience as a successive administrative vice ministers. It has been a common practice in the past to put a call through in some form to the former officials about such personnel changes. However, they knew nothing about it. Meanwhile, Minister Kumagai was making calls to the former officials to explain the situation about the same time that Naito was making the calls. However, in addition to those two reasons mentioned earlier, the minister had two more reasons: One was the issue of Naito's closeness to specific businesses. The other was that he had gone too far into politics. Regarding the latter, the minister made the explanation to the former officials that "Former Administrative Vice Minister Tanahashi, who has deep connections with the LDP, has been carrying out a movement to unseat the cabinet, and Naito has cooperated in leaking information to him. Or, Naito is on close terms with Secretary General Takemura of Sakigake [Harbinger] and has leaked information that the minister himself does not know. Moreover, when the minister went visiting back home after becoming minister, Naito, who went with him to Shizuoka as an aide, humiliated him by saying that "You should discuss such an important matter with Kajiyama" when he received petitions from local supporters. Regardless of whether the details are authentic, undoubtedly there was a political opposition structure of "Sakigake versus Shinseito" under the coalition regime or "Ozawa/Kumagai Shinseito versus Kajiyama LDP" behind this tumult from the start. Meanwhile, what about collusion to special enterprises. This was the involvement in a scandal long ago with receipt of a kickback from an oil company with close ties to MITI. However, Minister Kumagai, when he mentioned that, was perplexed at the reply returned by one of the former officials that "Is there clear proof of that?" and backed down threatened back by, "We are absolutely opposed to the firing of Naito. If you do such an unreasonable thing, all of MITI will become your enemy. All right?" That night, it is said that in the ministry, "Vice Minister Kumano summoned Bureau Director Takashima and the two had a secret discussion alone for about an hour and a half. Moreover, Minister Kumagai and Deputy Vice Minister Makino discussed the Naito problem, but there was no headway in agreement on the matter, and later Vice Minister Kumano joined them" (talk inside MITI). What did they discuss? On 16 December 1993, the political world was in great disarray by the death of former Prime Minister Tanaka. In the afternoon, Vice Minister Kumano entered the prime minister's official residence in a fluster. There is evidence that a considerable quarrel took place there about the Naito problem. That night, a person identifying himself as "someone from MITI" telephoned newspapers and reported: "Industrial Policy Bureau Chief Naito just received the advise to resign. The reason was favoritism in personnel changes and closeness to special businesses." Someone clearly had come to stab Naito. On the next day, the 17th, at 1100, in the minister's office, Kumagai again pressed for Naito's resignation, citing two reasons. "Whether it was common practice or not, I apologize for having carried out the prestigious personnel changes. However, I cannot accept the assessment of resignation. After all, you too move out to the political world with a prestigious personnel change." When Naito protested this way, Kumagai asserted, "It is not an issue of legality. It is an issue of propriety." When Naito touched upon his collusion with special businesses, etc. which Kumagai himself spread, Kumagai suddenly changed his attitude, and holding his head in his hands and even with a smile on his face, he said: "Oh, what to do! I am troubled because you say such a thing. I am troubled that such misleading information has been circulating around when I haven't said anything about the slightest dishonesty regarding you." Ultimately, Naito stood up and left, saying, "If you must insist on my resignation, why don't you fire me?" When he went immediately to the administrative vice minister's office, Vice Minister Kumano looked at the state of Naito and in a fluster called Makino, "Deputy Vice Minister, Deputy Vice Minister!" The two, however, only bowed their heads upon receiving Naito's report. The silence was unbroken. Ultimately, the three remained silent for five minutes. Within the ministry, on the other hand, "The rumor of Takashima's quite unforeseen appointment to director of the Industrial Policy Bureau circulated." (MITI employee) Around 1400, Naito again confronted both Kumano and Makino in the vice minister's office. Here, for the first time, Kumano broached the matter, "As the authority for personnel changes, I would like you to resign." However, when he was told by Naito that this was a strange way of making a personnel change, he said, "It cannot be helped because it is an order from the minister." When asked the reason, he again said, "The same reasons as those of the minister." Moreover, when he was questioned by Naito on the propriety of each reason for dismissal, he mentioned that "No, I myself do not believe the second one that you have darkened it (ministry)...." "Actually, when the first mysterious defamatory document came out, Director Naito twice advised Vice Minister Kumano to seek the culprit. However, the vice minister refused, saying that `The ministry will be darkened if there is a search for the culprit.' In September, however, the second mysterious defamatory document came out. It was senseless ethics because even the responsibility for the second mysterious defamatory document came to hang over the head of Naito by saying that `he had darkened the ministry'" (MITI bureaucrat). Ultimately, Vice Minister Kumano broke off with Naito by persisting, "Resign right now." Administrative Vice Minister Kumano Laments However, an unexpected situation occurred. The news, "Naito advised to resign," was reported in the evening edition of that day's ASAHI SHIMBUN. Confound it! Although this was what he thought, it was too late. Naito was resigned to the fact that he no longer would work beneath the surface. However, this report drew out unexpected results. The MITI bureaucrats who became clearly aware of the situation by this pushed their way into the administrative vice minister's office in a body. That continued the next day, Saturday, and Sunday, and it is said that they exceeded 100 in number. Many pressed Vice Minister Kumano, "Can you permit such an absurd personnel change? This is improper political intervention." However, surprised Vice Minister Kumano "only cried bitterly with no explanation of the reasons at all, and we, too, were perplexed" (MITI bureaucrat). Among them, the group who had joined the ministry in 1978 gave notice, "Since all 13 of us are submitting letters of resignation, both the administrative vice minister and deputy vice minister should also submit them and negotiate with the minister. Such a thing cannot be permitted." In the common sense view of Kasumigaseki, it is the invariable principle that in such a case the vice minister also write a letter of resignation and battle with the minister. However, Vice Minister Kumano just cried at this point and made no move to act. On the other hand, there were constant telephone calls of encouragement to Naito who kept to his home on Saturday and Sunday, and even bureaucrats from other government agencies visited his home to encourage him. Hails came from acquaintances in the United States. At this point, however, Naito and the bureaucrats were seized by an idea. In other words, everyone thought that the reasons for the advice to resign clearly made no sense at all. Therefore, there must be something bigger behind this series of unusual situations, and the real reason could be that such as the whole MITI itself would be saved by Naito's resignation. At the beginning of the week on the 20th, Naito himself pressed Vice Minister Kumano for an answer on that point. However, the scene that unfolded from that was even more strange. Naito pressed Vice Minister Kumano twice on this day, but Kumano only said, "It's not that." When Naito appealed to him with a desperate expression that he should tell him now if he were hiding something and if he did not let everything out in the open, MITI will be questioned about it and would be eternally devastated by politics in the future, lo and behold, Kumano began crying in a loud voice. "I haven't lied to you for 30 years, please believe me. Please believe me." Then, the lamenting vice minister faced the deputy vice minister next to him, "Hey, Makino, what do you say?" Then this time, Makino in turn let out a big cry, "Naito! You are the senior that I most respect. I am speaking only from my heart. There is absolutely no such thing." The two merely cried. On this day, Naito decided to write his resignation. Something collapsed within his heart. He felt that work should not be stagnated because of him. Soon afterwards, white flowers were delivered to Naito's home. "I was told that it was a bouquet of whilte lilies. Since they are funeral flowers, Naito was surprised and looked for the name of sender and found that it was from the wife of former Vice Minister Kodama. I thought that it was so thoughtless when I heard about it, so I told them to `throw them away!'" (wife of an acquaintance of Naito family). This wife of Kodama was called the grande dame of the association of wives of MITI bureaucrats. Like the factions of their husbands, factions have been built up in the society of wives. We will mention more on this later. Who Ensnared Naito? Speaking about the factional struggle in MITI, there was the "Sabashi incident" that occurred during the era of the Ikeda cabinet. This originated from unscrupulous Shigeru Sabashi, who called himself "a unique bureaucrat," formed factions with forced personnel changes and resulted in the creation of an anti-Sabashi faction in the ministry. Sabashi was seated in the chair of Corporate Bureau (now Industrial Policy Bureau) director, which was called specified seat for those who were expected to become vice minister, but in 1963, when the long-desired vice ministry was imminent, he was disliked by then minister Hajime Fukuda and skipped over. This became an occasion for the factional struggle within the ministry to intensify. At a glance, it seems to resemble the current tumult. In the "Sabashi incident," however, a policy dispute between the Sabashi faction (national faction) and anti-Sabashi faction (international faction) surrounding the propriety of economic liberalization that would control Japanese commercial policy in the future was at the root. However, there is no policy debate in the recent tumult. Whether it be the mysterious defamatory documents or the actions of Minister Kumagai, only a fairly deep-rooted malice can be felt in the undercurrents of the recent tumult. Naito grumbles, "I still don't know why I had to resign." It will be much easier to understand if we interpret this tumult that the firing of Naito was the sole objective and the reason for his dismissal from office by favoritism in personnel changes was appended afterward. Who in the world ensnared Naito, then? The fingerprints appear in the first mysterious defamatory document which became the origin of the resignation drama. It was distributed at the beginning of August 1993. According to a MITI source, it was mailed to all those who were division chief or above and about 600 copies were sent. There is a point that we should note. The senders were "all concerned younger members of MITI," but the contents of the document was not something that they ounger members could have written. For example, the information about Hirobumi Tanahashi's appointment as planning officer (prestigious) on 25 December 1992 and retiring from the post one week after and that the same post was eliminated (recently changed to that form) after that, etc... The specific date pointed out in the mysterious defamatory document and the fact that the post was eliminated (recently changed to that form) were known only to specific people at a considerably high level among those concerned at MITI who were familiar with personnel change information. "The information in the mysterious defamatory document has to be perceived as coming from people inside MITI" (Masahiro Fujita, chief of Public Relations Division, MITI). In other words, it is certain that people inside MITI contributed to preparation of the mysterious defamatory document. This is a decisive fact. Who was that? Actually, the name of the "culprit" was already rumored within MITI from the time of the first mysterious defamatory document delivery. For example, there is this story: About 20 days before circulation of the first mysterious defamatory document, "There was a person who said to a person from a certain private think tank, "`It'll be creating a big problem. I'll do it thoroughly. I'll turn it upside down. But you must absolutely keep this matter quiet" (MITI former official). It was the director of the Industrial Location and Environmental Protection Bureau Takashima, of the anti-Tanahashi faction. Then there was the delivery of the mysterious defamatory document. July and August are around the time in government offices when the ordinary June personnel change transfers have been completed. "It is amazing that the mysterious defamatory document was delivered accurately to residences. Although there were people who had just moved and changed addresses and therefore they were not yet in the register, the mysterious defamatory document was accurately delivered to them. It is only that person who had the information on personnel changes could have known the new addresses of those who were not yet on the list (the same former MITI official). It's amazing. According to MITI sources, there is an officer who is called "the boss of the Personnel Division that handles personnel changes." There is only one person who has had experience as the assistant to the chief of the Personnel Division, chief of the Personnel Division, and who has been the general affairs councilor in the Secretariat and can get complete information even from the non-career people. This is also Director Takashima. What is this? It is openly acknowledged that Takashima is in the anti-Tanahashi faction. "He became closeer to Kodama. The two often discussed `who would be the next vice minister and who would be the deputy minister.' He was a generous person and often treated junior members to sumptuous meals. He was on the vice minister course and the man himself was of that mind. "However, when he fought with Makino for the post of chief secretary which is called a mandatory post to a vice minister, in spite of Kodama's recommendation, Tanahashi chose Makino, and he was transferred to director of the Industrial Location and Environmental Protection Bureau. It seems that was unbearable for him, and Takashima was often seen with Kodama and speak maliciously of Tanahashi at restaurants. For about the past year, he has borne a grudge against Tanahashi, complaining that `the rail (personnel changes) laid by Kodama was destroyed by this'" (MITI former official). Let's take a look at the actions of the anti-Tanahashi faction. First, there is Kodama. When Minister Kumagai cited the words "darkened the ministry" as the second reason for recommending Naito to resign, there was an former official who was startled when he heard it. According to him, "Around summer of 1993, Kodama was frequently telling the crowd in MITI that `I'll never let Naito become vice minister.' As the reason, Kodama said, `If Naito is made vice minister, the ministry will be darkened.'" Then, as for Director Hosokawa, "There is a famous story in MITI that at the time of the first mysterious defamatory document was circulated, when a certain employee asked, `Hosokawa, you must have distributed this,' he unintentionally divulged, `No, it wasn't me. It was Kodama'" (MITI division class chief). Moreover, when the recent tumult began, Hosokawa made a lot of telephone calls to presidents in the oil industry and reported unilaterally that, "You should not associate with Naito. He is acting smart now, but he will soon be arrested." In September, the second mysterious defamatory document was distributed. This was largely divided into three items, and it criticised Tanahashi with various specific examples such as "election measures for his son" and "closeness with politicians." However, fingerprints remain here also. "The special conference expense is pointed out here. The document points out that while Tanahashi was vice minister, `the special conference expense quickly increased from 30 million yen a year to 60 million yen.' Since the mysterious defamatory document was distributed, I was flustered. So, I checked into the matter and found that it was true. However, this would not be known unless you checked by leafing through the chits from restaurants, etc., one by one. It is not information that can be known except for a specific bureau. The one that has those qualifications is the Budget and Accounts Division of the Secretariat. The division chief at that time was Isayama" (MITI former official). He is also said to be in the anti-Tanahashi faction. Kodama Faction Knew!? The more you investigate, the more figures who gathered in the anti-Tanahashi faction network with Kodama at the top that could be called the Kodama faction are making an appearance. Actually, Vice Minister Kumano, who recently took an incomprehensible action, is tied to this Kodama faction. Kodama and Kumano come from the same high school affiliated with Hiroshima University, have a senior-junior relationship, and it is said in MITI that they are closer friends than brothers. They were so close in this tumult that it is rumored "Kumano calls Kodama's place every night and complains" (MITI source). It seems that Kumano has come to be ridiculed in MITI as "the crying Kumano" due to this tumult, but there is a possibility that this crying has been an act. As mentioned before, Kumano explained to Naito that he first heard about the intention to fire Naito from Kumagai on 15 December. However, it seems that he knew it far in advance. "In the latter part of September 1993, Kumagai summoned Nobutsugu Fukugawa, a former powerful vice minister from Kobe (vice president of Kobe Steel) and they met at a restaurant in the city. On that occasion, Kumagai discussed the firing of Naito. Fukugawa said, `That is outrageous,' but it seems that Kumagai stubbornly refused to listen. Fukugawa immediately called Kumano. When he explained the situation, Kumano just said, `That's too bad'" (one of the former top MITI executives). Why didn't Kumano discuss it immediately with Naito or the deputy vice minister? Because of his responsible post as vice minister endeavoring to protect his own ministry, it is customerly that he devise some countermeasures. Kumano's actions are utterly difficult to understand. Of course, the possibility is great that this matter was reported by Kumano to Kodama. In short, the Kodama faction knew about Kumagai's intention to "fire Naito" considerably in advance, and there is suspicion that they conspired in it. Right after 16 December when Naito received the advice to resign, a Diet member said to be a close associate of Ozawa revealed the following: "Kumagai has considered this firing since directly after his appointment as minister. I did not know about the timing. The cause was the coercive methods of the former Vice Minister Tanahashi. He flung his son into the electoral district of Iwao Matsuda (Shinseito) of whom Kumagai is fond, and MITI did not support him when Kumagai ran as a candidate. It truly was a grudge of many years. Ozawa said, `Do whatever you can.'" There are two points here. One is that Ozawa and Shinseito participated in this personnel change, and the other is that there was a grudge against MITI or against Tanahashi in the origin of this recent Kumagai action. Kumagai and Takashima are very friendly. "In MITI which did not support Kumagai, Takashima was the only friend of Kumagai" (political source). The two have a grudge in common. Furthermore, the grudges against Tanahashi and Naito are shared by all of the Kodama faction. Instances believed to have become the cause have been revealed by several people in MITI. This will be mentioned later, but among the successive administrative vice ministers, the attacked Tanahashi is reputed to be the one who stood out from the crowd in policy capability and political power. Tanahashi is the son-in-law of former House of Representatives Diet member Yukiyasu Matsuno, and his eldest son Hirobumi, who became the recent problem, run for candidacy to taking over that base. He has strong friendship with LDP Diet members topped by former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, and along with the recent dramatic change in political administrations, "There has been a move, centering on the Shinseito, to hunt bureaucratic war criminals under the old rule. Beginning around fall of last year, the information has been circulating that there have been sackings one by one from MITI, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Different from MITI, MOF has solidified into a monolith of unity and seems to have checked this move" (Nagata-cho source). If this story is true, it is not strange that he would be put in the position of the number one target. Grounds for Tanahashi and Naito Were Detested Naito, who was supported by Tanahashi, overwhelmed others in the ministry with his capability. Both shared being "the ablest workmasters of MITI" recognized both by themselves and others." There is a very interesting episode. During the semiconductor negotiations when Tanahashi and Naito formed a team for the first time, Tanahashi was deputy director of the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, and Naito was chief of the Secretariat General Coordination Division. The words that MITI officers spoken to Tanahashi upon viewing this matching were that "We have placed a subordinate who is difficult to employ with a superior who is difficult to serve." It seems that both were strict in policy evaluation and arguing without regard to who was superior or subordinate. For that reason, they were harsh on unreasonable statements and the failures of their fellow workers. Although valued within the ministry, "they stung subordinates more than necessary and made them nervous" (younger bureaucrat). Later, the two built a golden era with Vice Minister Tanahashi who was "the greatest political expert in Kasumigaseki" and Deputy Vice Minister Naito who was "the first international policy man since MITI began." It was the whole Kodama faction who embraced a sense of crisis about these two. There was once that Kodama tried to squash the Naito's chance by pressing Tanahashi that he should put "Masaaki Nangaku, director of the Consumer Goods Industries Bureau (at the time, same class as Naito), in as deputy vice minister." "In the `VAN [value added telecommunications network] war' fought by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and MITI, the front line commander was Kodama and the his junior Kumano took general command of the battalion. The result, however, was a crushing defeat for MITI. Responsibility for what the Kodama-Kumano line had done at the time was shifted on others. Single-minded Naito criticized this like a raging fire. Kodama and others have painful thoughts of that time. "Unfortunately, however, it was the Tanahashi-Naito team who succeeded afterward. They plotted a repechage and fought with the Ministry of Education concerning computer program rights along with revision of the copyright law where Kodama had failed and scored a real gain. This also angered Kodama" (a MITI old boy). Moreover, in his days as chief of the Basic Chemicals Division, when Naito was appointed post, the petrochemical industry, which up to then Kodama had boasted was "my industry," instantly was swayed by Naito. Kodama was said to have been extremely angry about this. Moreover, unfortunately, "Takashima and then Hosokawa followed as his successors, but the industry went to Naito for discussion when anything happened and took no notice of them" (MITI officer). Gradually, Tanahashi and Naito began to incur hatred from the Kodama faction because of their excellence. There was an incident that when various ministries were united in drawing up two bills related to information processing, with Naito as its leader, "It happened that Nakano forgot about making a budget request for a `law concerning promotion of information processing.' It was an unbelievable error, and his responsibility amounted to whether he should resign. Ultimately, Naito ran around appealing to the Cabinet Legislation Bureau and succeeded without incident. Nakano could not hold up his head before Naito" (MITI former official). However, that conversely became the occasion for the birth of the buds of hatred for Naito within the heart of Nakano. There is another story that when Isayama went full of confidence to the post of JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization] industrial investigator in the United States which is considered to be an elite course in MITI, he became dispirited confronted by an enormous network of Naito who is reputed to be internationalist. There is still more story that after Kodama retired from government office as vice minister, he was rejected by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. where he was supposed to have gone as vice president with implications of president, and after that, he had difficulty in golden parachuting. "Kodama was said to have complained to those around him that `This, too, is the result of Tanahashi and Naito not being staunch for me,' and he felt resentment toward them" (MITI former official). In short, for the Kodama faction, Tanahashi and Naito were an eyesore. That may be the natural result produced by the enormous envy and lust for power of the elite bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki hidden in the lining of their well-pressed suits. Apart from Tanahashi who has retired from government office, there would be no favors to them if a Vice Minister Naito were born. That probably produced in the hearts of Takashima and others an impatience resembling a sense of panic. "The people in Kodama faction were saying, `It's either Naito dies or we will be done for'" (MITI source). Shinseito or Minister Kumagai can take advantage of a vulnerable point there. With regard to the Kodama faction, another faction is pasted to them as a lining, forming a pair with the male faction. It probably is necessary to touch on this too. The fact that Kodama's wife runs the association of MITI elite bureaucrat wives was touched upon a little previously. The name of that association is "Ranfini." In French, it means "infinity." This association also is tremendous. "The wives who dress up in high-quality brand clothes begin talking about Paris or Spain. They do not appear to be wives of public servants at all. Their manicures are perfect. Some of them wear rings with huge jewels and when they place their hands on the table, their palms turn over with the weight" (a participant). This wives' association holds intact the scheme of opposition of their husbands who continue the factional strife in Kasumigaseki and at present is forming "a wives' version of the Kodama faction." The core members are the wife of Kodama on down to the wife of Kumano, the wife of Nangaku, and others. Only the wives of officers who sometimes are permitted there can participate. One wife who participated says, "I really hate it, but I participate to have my husband pulled along." Worried, a husband would come asking, "I wonder if everything is all right; no one has called yet to invite my wife" (MITI source). The husbands and wives together have tremendous influence. What is more surprising is the activities of these wives. Bearing the dignified name of "an association of wives of MITI," they go on tours once or twice a month to businesses under the jurisdiction of MITI. Moreover, the members are the wives of officers only. It flusters the places to which they visit. "Let's Go for a Ride in Tank" On a factory tour of a chemical company, the chairman expressly came out and sweating with an uncertain hand, prepared food and served them. How ridiculous! Moreover, the wife of Kodama suddenly said, "Let's ride in a tank." So, she planned a tour of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and surprised the members. Actually, it is said that Naito dealt harshly with such collusive groups. This too grated against the nerves of the Kodama faction. However, a more serious secret is hidden in the Kodama faction. That is the unusual closeness with Ozawa and Shinseito. In 1991, when Ozawa visited the Soviet Union and had a audience with then President Gorbachev, he took with him a plan called "return of the northern territories in exchange for $24 billion of economic aid." Actually, it was the Kodama faction that prepared this plan. "Kumagai introduced Kodama to Ozawa, and Kodama is linked to Takashima and Nakano. It was Nakano who put together the substance and Takashima was the captain. "When that plan for $24 billion surfaced, MITI received protest from the various related ministries such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance because it was an unprecedented act exceeding authority. This has also became a problem in MITI itself" (MITI former official). Moreover, it is said that Nakano and Isayama were in charge of the parts relating to MITI in Ozawa's book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan, and Takashima is said to be a member of "the association to make Ozawa prime minister" in Kasumigaseki. Ozawa and the Kodama faction have been very close ever since the old LDP era. Viewing the series of introduction, development, turn, and conclusion which started with the mysterious defamatory document uproar, there is a possibility that the Kodama faction was deeply involved in the recent Naito dismissal drama. From here on is only bold inference. However, we think that the Kodama faction that had been nervous about birth of a Vice Minister Naito was waiting for a chance to overturn prescribed personnel changes when the unforeseen collapse of the 1955 rule occurred, and a coalition regime substantially controlled by Ozawa and Shinseito was born. It was the chance of a lifetime. The luck of MITI minister appeared to Kumagai. The scenario started from here. Kumagai's aim is "securing the vested interests of Shinseito. In the political contribution allocation ratio to political parties by industry, the steel, auto, and electric power industries, which are called the three great families, stand side by side. The decision on the percentages by the three great families is made from January to February every year. The maximum influence should be exerted on the industry directly before that" (political source). Naito was the target. They would fire Mister MITI. The effect would be tremendous and there would be merits for both sides. What they miscalculated, however, was that there was no decisive scandal about Naito. Therefore, they put the Tanahashi scandal on Naito. So, on that fateful day, 16 December 1993, Kumagai gave Naito advice to resign.... Of course, this is not outside the realm of conjecture. However, the voices of Ozawa's Shinseito about this tumult in Kasumigaseki have overwhelmingly been, "It is a warning and threat to us." It is no reason just to fire him. If that is the case, the recent uproar has become the greatest scheme in Kasumigaseki executed in the name of "bureaucratic reform." On 1 January 1994, Kumano made an appearance at the prime minister's official residence. He was accompanied by his wife and paid a New Year's greetings to the prime minister. "In a normal year, all the Kasumigaseki vice ministers and wives come to the official residence. This year, however, everyone hesitated because of the tumult over Naito's sacking at the end of 1993, and the vice ministers refrained from making New Year's greetings to keep their distance from politics. It was surprising that Kumano came. He was the only vice minister that came" (official residence beat reporter). Kumano was said to have been happy, looking askance at this atmosphere in Kasumigaseki. Then, on 6 January, "Minister Kumagai, accompanied by Director Takashima, met Ichiro Ozawa at a restaurant in the city. An executive of Itochu was present there, and according to him, Director Takashima was in unusually high spirits and talkative" (MITI former official). The new year without Naito was probably the beginning of a happy lot for the Kodama faction. Meanwhile, however, the irritation at MITI was becoming bigger. "Consultation for `wanting to resign' by younger career men is growing because of the criticism and feeling of despair about the recent uproar. Criticism against the Takashima group has appeared in the ministry" (MITI source). Voices such as "dismantle MITI and establish a Resources and Energy Ministry" are heard from other government agencies. MITI has suffered its biggest crisis since the war. The appearance of two mysterious defamatory documents during the recent tumult was previously mentioned. However, another mysterious defamatory document which should be called phantasmal exists. It was distributed around September 1992, and for some reason, this was said to have collected and put lid on it. Why was a lid put on it? This document, entitled "Suspicious Issues Concerning a Previous MITI Administrative Vice Minister," comprised six items, and "suspicions of backdoor money concerning the Japan Keirin Association" were pointed out. When we pursued this issue, some strange information gushed forth, and from among that, the company IBC, Ltd. surfaced. When inquiring about this company, however, several MITI bureaucrats said, "That is Takashima's company." On the occasion of establishing the company, Takashima and Nakano and Isayama who are his juniors seemed to have put considerable effort in the related section. The brunt of the suspicions on the Japan Keirin Association backdoor money noted in the mysterious defamatory document pursuing Tanahashi conversely are directed to the people in the anti-Tanahashi faction. That is probably the reason that this mysterious defamatory document was sealed. IBC is a mysterious company. It is well known that the the Japan Keirin Association transfers about 3 to 5 percent of the sales for bicycle racing to public corporations. A MITI source says, "Accounting is rigorously checked by the Vehicle Races Council. It is in full view." On the other hand, however, there are voices saying that "the Japan Keirin Association is MITI's moneybag, so to speak." It is said that "In the office regulations at MITI, government offices will look after employees until they are 70 years old. A system for taking care of them has been created so that when MITI bureaucrats assigned to related public corporations after retirement, money is given from the Japan Keirin Association to their destined corporation to help with the meager salary" (MITI career man). In other words, although the check is rigorous when money is transferred from the Japan Keirin Association to the public corporations, there probably are various methods for the way that it is used after that. Unexpected Networks one After the Other The money from the Japan Keirin Association flows into IBC. There are suspicious that the system where money of the Japan Keirin Association flows to individuals through corporations, which the aforementioned MITI career man pointed out, is applied here. In order to understand this IBC, we find our way to a company called TeleJapan International (hereafter, TeleJapan), which should be called its predecessor, and here again, an anti-Tanahashi faction surfaces. Toshiko Tsuji, who has been called "political and bureaucratic wirepuller" or "patron of bureaucrats," is involved in the company called TeleJapan. Tsuji is the daughter of that fixer, Kiroku Tsuji, who drew the capital for founding the Liberal Party, predecessor of the LDP, from Yoshio Kodama. Takashima, Isayama and all go in and out of Tsuji's office which is in Bicycle Kaikan Building, and "Not just MITI, but elite MOF bureaucrats, all visit Tsuji. At MITI, currently Director Takashima is said to be the central member" (a bureaucrat). It can be said that Tsuji still has a fixer-type existence which boasts hidden power. The TeleJapan was established in 1982, and "it was created by Dentsu and Nippon Shineseru, each with a 50 percent investment ratio, with MITI leading the chorus and influenced industry" (person concerned at the time). The president is a person called Junichi Kiyonaga. Tsuji substantially controls this Nippon Shineseru and it is a company that is jointly managed with Kiyonaga. Incidentally, Kiyonaga is the husband of actress Shio Fujimura and former private secretary of Yasujiro Tsutsumi, Seibu Group founder. The business is movie production and PR [public relations]. First, let's touch on a part of the relationship between the company and MITI. For example, 94 of the 96 videos ordered by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology from fiscal 1980 to fiscal 1988 were made by Nippon Shineseru. (See "Government and Government Related Agencies Foreign Language PR Film and Video List.") Furthermore, "if the people of Nippon Shineseru are refused business by a company, a call immediately comes from MITI. `We hear that you refused them, is that true?' They are so blunt" (other production company). Moreover, a bureaucrat says, "I received Shio Fujimura dance tickets from Nippon Shineseru, so I went to the theater. When turn about to look, to my surprise, the threater was the heads of MITI bureaucrats and their wives line the place." At the time of its establishment, MITI was prompted by the necessity of PR and lobby activities for the United States. Therefore, TeleJapan was created and the plan was to develop activities with money flowing in from industrial groups. However, it was held up because of a fight over interests with MOFA. Ultimately, a system of cooperation was created whereby the money from industry groups entered a MOFA-related group once, and after a certain percentage was paid for activity costs, it flowed intact to TeleJapan. This MOFA-related group was no more than a window for accepting capital. According to people concerned at the time, the annual budget was about 1 billion yen. The capital was supplied by the auto industry, electrical-related, or the Japan Machinery Industry Federation, etc., and "millions of yen annually" (person concerned at the time) from the Japan Keirin Association came in through the Japan Machinery Industry Federation. However, the use of this about 1 billion yen which came in every year without doing anything is not understood very well. This money is said to have been used to the fullest. While there are people who say, "Production of videos for PR use was done and it was all in full view of the public," there is a person concerned at the time who says, "It seems to have had a money laundering aspect for money which government officials could not use publicly. That TeleJapan entered a sabbatical state in 1990 because of trouble in the United States. At the same time, IBC was established with Hiroshi Yomo, a former newspaper reporter in a Kiyonaga-related company, as the substantially responsible person and senior managing director. The configuration was creation of the IBCC (International Business Communication Council) a voluntary group with the Automobile Industry Association, Electronic Industries Association of Japan, and Japan Machinery Industry Federation, etc., as members, the influx of money from the members there, and entry into IBC. You might say that both are one body and the group is simply no more than a tunnel existence for passing money. Moreover, about 250 million in money from the Japan Keirin Association came in through the Japan Machinery Industry Federation. It is exactly the same system as TeleJapan. The annual budget is about 700 million yen. This enters IBC without doing anything and it uses up all that money. However, it is not clear what it does. It is called "overseas business communication business," (Japan Machinery Industry Federation source). Upon investigating, we found that it contributes to welfare groups of the United States or hold journalist symposiums. It irregularly sends out bulletins and newsletters from the United States to its members, but to be honest, these are of poor quality. Also it has a branch office on first class land in New York. While saying it is communications business with abroad, Yomo, the substantially responsible person, cannot speak English. It has only 13 employees and yet it uses up about 700 million yen every year. It is a strange company. "When they closed TeleJapan after it became embroiled in trouble, MITI wanted to keep something similar to a TeleJapan. So, they established IBC. (TeleJapan source) Yomo, of course, denies this and says that there is no MITI involvement at all. However, a MITI bureaucrat says, "We are participating in everything, from budget allocations, etc." What is this? Speaking in regards to Takashima, people say that he lives in grand style. He lives by renting an ultra-high class apartment at Shoto in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo where "house rent is about 1.5 million yen. If it were the Bubble era, it would be 2 million yen" (realtor remark) and takes subordinates to high class restaurants, paying the bills on the spot. However, about two or three years ago, he was said to have been complaining to a superior, saying that "I must purchase a condo because I have to look after my mother, but I do not have the money." It is a fact that in the deputy vice minister personnel change, which was the start of Takashima's hatred of Tanahashi and Naito, one of the former top level official vigorously opposed, saying that "Takashima as deputy vice minister is absolutely no good. A money scandal will surface." In the ministry now, various information is running wild, and the untransparent portions of MITI are being brought to light. Why was Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau forced to resign? We have asked Minister Kumagai, key persons of the Kodama faction from Vice Minister Kumano and on down, and former officials for information; however, they have all not complied with our request. Answers are escaping still far away. When one considers it, bureaucratic reform has formed the nucleus of the policy vision worked out by Ichiro Ozawa. It is true that the bureaucratic kingdom of Japan is demanded of restructuring. The advice for Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau to resign is believed to be the first step. However, not even looking at the facts of the recent tumult, this has destroyed the point that distinguishes politics from bureaucracy and even smashed the basic rules that bureaucrats execute administration by fairly maintaining political neutrality. Naito, who has been called as Mr. MITI, is to leave Japan for a while and is to become a visiting professor at Georgetown University in the United States. He was, perhaps, a bureaucrat who was caught up in an unexpected storm of the collapse of the 1955 rule.
