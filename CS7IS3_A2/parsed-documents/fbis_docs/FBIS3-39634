Laurens Brinkhorst, who is director general of the environmental protection directorate under the EU Commission, finds it hard to conceal his amazement at Norway's negotiating strategy. Instead of accepting an opt-out clause which would give Norway permission to catch whales for a two-year trial period, Norway has responded to the EU with total "radio silence," as he put it. The Norwegian side takes the view that the proposal from the EU has not been made officially -- and that it is really only about the right of access which all have to opt-out arrangements in EU rules. The objection has been voiced that Norway will not be able to decide the future of Norwegian whaling independently, because the EU side will the whole time have a right of veto. But given the way spokesmen for the Commission are now choosing their words, an opening is being left for Norway to continue whaling for minke whales for a two-year period. Thereafter there will be an environmental investigation of several criteria -- such as size of minke whale stocks, the amount of fish they eat, and so on. It will then be decided whether Norway can continue whaling. In the view of the European Commission, this means that a lifeline has been left. Signals from central Norwegian sources in negotiating circles indicate that in the final phase of the EU negotiations Norway is willing to consider solutions like these that prevent a head-on collision between Norway and the EU. But the two sides have not as yet come to grips with each other in the negotiations proper. This could happen as early as tomorrow at one of the negotiating meetings in Brussels. EU Director General Laurens Brinkhorst has already been to Norway and talked to Industry and Energy Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Environment Ministry Under Secretary of State Borre Pettersen, among others.
