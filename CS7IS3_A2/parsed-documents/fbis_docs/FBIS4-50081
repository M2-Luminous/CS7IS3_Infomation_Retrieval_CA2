The corporation's reforms and exploration are still in progress and its experience is only preliminary. The main reason for a series of reports to be published on it is that we want the reading public to more thoroughly understand the basic train of thought of the corporation's reform. It would never be our aim to encourage everyone simply to copy the corporation without paying any attention to his own conditions, neither do we intend to popularize the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a so-called "model." Since different localities have different conditions, the exploration of reform can be and should be varied, but a common point of departure must be grasped firmly, which is to develop and strengthen the state-owned economy and to ensure that the value of state-owned assets can be maintained and increased. This is also the basic point of the reform experience of Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. Once the train of thought of reform is determined, concrete work must be done in a safe and discreet manner. Strategic considerations are not tantamount to tactical operations. Negative effects may be brought about if one stresses only good wishes while doing one's work, but disregards the peculiarities of the time and the situation. For example, we can never take the flexible use of assets as simply the reorientation of land use; neither can we set off another upsurge of real estate development in the name of learning from the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. State-owned assets cover a very wide range, and land is only a very small part. Shortage of funds, overabundance of personnel, and rigid asset application are the three problems generally being encountered by state-owned enterprises at present. Under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's southern-tour remarks and the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation proceeded from reality to blaze a new trail of comprehensive reforms in asset appreciation, transformation of industries, transformation of functions, transformation of the mechanism, and transfer of workers and staff to other work units, thus finding the key to solving these three problems. According to comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, rigid asset application is the knot of the three problems, and the others can be solved readily once this knot is untied. Therefore, although many aspects are involved in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform, the enterprise ownership reform remains its nucleus. How did they untie the knot? What kind of key did they find? We will publish four reports to answer these questions one by one. Our reporters still found it interesting to address the issue after finishing four reports on it. Hence, we will publish a fifth report, in which the reporter and people concerned will speak on what we actually get from the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. Of course, the reading public is very welcome to discuss this with us. [end editor's note] "The starting point of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation is not a premeditated scheme, but practice. Up to now, they have taken an entirely step-by-step approach to work." -- Opening remarks made by a comrade of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation who was familiar with the whole process of systematic reform In a football game, "offside" means breaking the rules. In order to find a way out for the enterprise, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation was unconsciously on the "offside"--turning its attention from dealing with products to dealing with state-owned assets. A fortuitous "offside" made an impact on the whole system. State-owned enterprises abstain from talking about "death," and so did the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. Although the Bankruptcy Law was introduced several years ago, and the idea of "euthanasia" is accepted by more and more people, after all, owing to environmental limitations, only a few enterprises have resorted to "euthanasia." Many enterprises originally thinking of an "easy death" often give up the idea because they "cannot bear such a death" and they are still bitterly fighting for their "mere existence." To our surprise, however, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation miraculously and quietly "died" in the past two years or so, without causing any sloppiness or trouble. The first case in point was the former Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant. From 1984 on, faced with increasingly fierce market competition, the plant failed again and again. In 1991, the capacity utilization rate was less than 30 percent, the annual per capita income of workers and staff was a mere 2,400 yuan, and the plant's deficits accumulated to 1.2 million yuan. At the same time, hundreds of individual household traders emerged around there who were running eyeglasses industries and processing eyeglasses, and their business was good. After conscientiously weighing the pros and cons, the plant decided to "transfer" from the "secondary industry" to "tertiary industry." With the support of industrial and commercial departments, in August 1991, the Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant was transformed into a specialized eyeglasses wholesale market with over 500 stalls, which attracted not only numerous individual household traders in the area, but foreign businessmen as well. The annual turnover reached 130 million yuan, which not only offset the enterprise's deficits, but reaped more than 1 million yuan of profits. Former staff and workers changed their occupations and acted as security guards, cleaners, and transport personnel, and the annual per capita income almost doubled. Last year, the Beijing No. 1 Eyeglasses Plant -- an "associate" of the Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant which also was running in the red -- was incorporated into the eyeglasses market. The largest eyeglasses center in our country will be built here. The second case was that of the No. 1 Branch Factory of the Beijing Lighting Equipment Company. From 1988 onward, this factory -- which produced traditional lamps for civilian, industrial, and mining use -- was in a predicament. In 1991, it incurred more than 500,000 yuan in deficits. The company took notice of the superiority of the No. 1 Branch Factory's location, in the bustling Xizhimen section, and decided to rebuild it into a commercial building that would specialize in selling communications equipment. In August 1992, the building opened for business. Although it was owned by the state, the business was privately run and contracted by staff and workers. In consequence, it reaped 160,000 yuan in profits in 1992 and over 2 million yuan the following year. The third case was that of the Beijing Lamp Factory. Owing to its running in the red and incurring debts year after year, the factory was incorporated into the Xinhai Instrument Company in September 1992. The lamp factory's former main production building was rebuilt into the Caishikou Xinguang Commercial Building, of which some floors were leased, while some others were used by the company for sales of instruments and lamps. Last year, the commercial building reaped more than 700,000 yuan in profits and the income of staff and workers increased by over 40 percent. Most of the staff and workers were transferred to a piano plant that was short of labor. In consequence, the piano plant was able quickly to expand its scale of production and increase its output, profits, and taxes. Viewed from the product angle, these factories -- as enterprises manufacturing certain kinds of light industrial products -- really are "dead," and they have been removed from the "roll" of secondary industry. Viewed from the enterprise angle, they are still open for business, and their staff and workers are still working and being paid because, even though the "secondary industry" is dead, the "tertiary industry" was born. Viewed from the angle of assets, state-owned assets -- which are created by state investment -- are neither dead nor lost, but reinvigorated with their value greatly increased! All these things are neither readjustment of the product structure nor simply industrial transformation, but indicate a kind of change in nature -- breaking through the barriers of products and industries, and achieving a transformation from the running of a certain kind of products to the running of state-owned assets. Although the transformation was started unconsciously and at a time when the goal of socialist market economic reform had not been clearly fixed, real actions were taken, and they have successfully redistributed resources while standing in the commanding position of running the main body of assets and following the market course. This kind of unconscious "offside" practice has not only reshaped the enterprises' external images and transformed their internal mechanism, but more important, has had a huge impact on the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a whole. An "offside" is often the starting point of reform. When people are aware of the fact that an "offside" precisely fills the "gap" of owners (representatives) of state-owned assets, "filling the gap" will become a strong voluntary demand. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which was formed and departmentalized according to product categories during the planned-economy period, once scored brilliant achievements. Not to mention the "three renowned pieces" -- watches, bicycles, and sewing machines -- which were popular, personnel of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation are really proud of the fact that the "Beibingyang" soft drink and "Hongxing" sorghum spirits monopolized the capital's market for a long time. After the policy of reform and opening up was started, however, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation came across the problems generally encountered by state-owned enterprises. Moreover, the corporation was faced with more and more special problems: Small production scale, obsolete equipment, overabundance of personnel, and low-technology products. In consequence, the corporation failed again and again because it could hardly adapt itself to the intense market competition. The most distressing problem was that owing to the expansion of urban districts, many factories that lay between residential and commercial districts became annoyances and were urgently required to move elsewhere. However, there simply was no way to raise 1.5 billion yuan for moving expenses. Up to the early 1990's, 30 percent of the more than 120 enterprises under the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation were in the red, and products manufactured by over 35 percent of these enterprises were unsalable. From 1990 to 1992, the whole corporation earned fewer and fewer profits, which dropped from 110 million yuan to 90 million yuan and then to just over 60 million yuan. As a matter of fact, like all other state-owned enterprises in the last decade or so, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation also made constant progress by following the general trend of reform. It delegated power to lower levels and let them retain a proportion of profits, changed profits into taxes, implemented the contract responsibility system, and put the Regulations into effect, without missing any single link. All of these reforms played a positive part in promoting the development of the enterprises, and a small number of the enterprises still were faring quite well. We should say that without implementing these reform measures, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation certainly would have encountered many more difficulties than it did. As far as the whole body is concerned, however, the situation of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation was becoming more and more grimm. By drawing on the experience of coastal areas and by conscientiously analyzing the situation of the enterprises under the corporation after Comrade Xiaoping had made his southern-tour remarks in 1992, the decision-makers at the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation concluded: Objectively speaking, the corporation was being surrounded by five "circles" -- joint-venture enterprises, town and township enterprises, enterprises in special economic zones, civilian-run enterprises, and import goods -- and subjectively speaking, the corporation was still fettered by five shackles -- the petty production concept, the influence of "leftist" ideology, the sluggish transformation of government functions, the ossified administrative system, and an inflexible operational mechanism. In addition, the corporation bore three heavy burdens --overabundance of personnel, shortage of funds, and difficulties in making an inventory of assets. Where does the crux of this situation lie? -- Sluggish reform. A vertical view shows that in the past, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation based its reform primarily on improving a single type of product, to the benefit of a single enterprise, but nothing was done explicitly to set a goal for preserving and heightening the value of state-owned assets. Moreover, its enterprises did not have the right to manage the assets and they need not and could not flexibly distribute resources within a wider scope in light of changes in market demand, hence its enterprises could not sustain deficits once incurred. As far as the ultimate ownership is concerned, the assets of these enterprises belong to the state, a fact that is never ambiguous, but in reality, it is very difficult for the state to be concretely in charge of each of the enterprises, thus giving rise to the phenomenon of a "gap" in the main body of ownership. Filling the "gap" has become a task of paramount importance in deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises. One of the important factors accounting for stronger vitality of joint-venture, private, and stockholding enterprises is precisely the availability of ownership representatives, and basically, the nonexistence of the nominal post of "person-in charge." A lateral view shows that past reform attached importance to making a breakthrough in a single area while neglecting the importance of promoting corresponding progress in other areas, hence the short-term effect was prominent, but after some time, the effect gradually faded and the reform was subject to various limitations. The market is ruthless, and market competition at present is, in reality, a competition of reform. Anyone who is sluggish in reform will become passive and may be thrown out of the market, which is developing at a high speed! This is the truth proven by innumerable facts. Reform must be deepened vigorously! Reform must be promoted in a comprehensive manner! At a moment when its fate hung in the balance, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation had no retreat, but could only make this choice. How to make things work, however, is a very realistic problem. Some people suggested that the 120 or so enterprises could part company with each other and each seek its own way out. However, as proven by practice, this method will not work. Some enterprises can "fight their way out of the heavy encirclement," but owing to different bases and qualities, a considerable number of enterprises still, just as in the past several years, will be in a state of not knowing whether they can survive or not, and it is inevitable that they will blindly readjust their structure, thus causing great losses to the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which is a state-owned asset. As far as comprehensive reform is concerned, it is impossible for any single enterprise to accomplish it. Not to mention other problems, under the present circumstances in which the social security system is not yet perfect, the mere existence of several tens of thousands of personnel seeking reemployment and over 20,000 retired staff and workers is sufficient to have quite a large impact on social stability. Could all the work be handled and administered entirely by the municipal government? Such a practice does not accord with the reform orientation of separating the functions and responsibilities of administration from those of management, and in reality, this will not work. In the past several decades, the government has played a role of chief factory director bearing "unlimited responsibilities." The conclusion was reached long ago in history: Facing the volatile market and tens of thousands of enterprises, the government cannot and does not have the strength to handle all the work. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, with billions in state-owned assets, had an urgent need for a genuine "person-in-charge," and the corporation's more than 100 enterprises were eager to have an "operator" to coordinate their comprehensive reform. It was precisely under such circumstances that a new role mounted the great stage of the market economy, and the first company in Beijing for the management of state-owned assets -- the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation -- emerged as required by the times!
