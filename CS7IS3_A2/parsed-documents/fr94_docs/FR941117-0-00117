FR941117-0-00117 FR941117-0-00011 (b) 72&hyph;76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to §22.413. However, for use within 50 meters (164 feet) of a TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, 72&hyph;76 MHZ channels may be assigned under a regular authorization, rather than a developmental authorization. §22.601 Assignment of microwave channels. Assignment of the microwave channels listed in §22.591 is subject to the transition rules in §22.602. No new systems will be authorized under this part. (a) Coordination required. Before filing applications for authority to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to such applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, using the procedure outlined in §22.150, with affected parties in this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the Multipoint Distribution Service. Affected parties are licensees and other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the existing station in terms of interference. (b) System parameters. In designing a system modification, the applicant must select sites, equipment and channels that will avoid harmful interference to other users. All parties must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, a party receiving notification is not obligated to suggest changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. The applicant must identify in the application all parties with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical problems are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to coordination efforts within 30 days after notification, an explanation must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are resolved by an agreement between the parties that requires special procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference (such as the use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof must be contained in the application. (c) Bandwidth. Applicants must request the minimum emission bandwidth necessary. The FCC does not authorize bandwidths larger than 800 kHz under this part. §22.602 Transition of the 2110&hyph;2130 and 2160&hyph;2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies. The microwave channels listed in §22.591 have been allocated for use by emerging technologies services (ETS). No new systems will be authorized under this part. The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which existing Paging and Radiotelephone Service (PARS) licensees using these channels may relocate operations to other media or to other fixed channels, including those in other microwave bands. For PARS licensees relocating operations to other microwave bands, authorization must be obtained under part 21 of this chapter. (a) Licensees proposing to implement ETS may negotiate with PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would_ (1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or other media, or alternatively, (2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ETS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the PARS operations. (b) PARS operations on these channels will continue to be co-primary with other users of this spectrum until two years after the FCC commences acceptance of applications for ETS, and until one year after an ETS licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations. (c) After the periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section, existing PARS operations become secondary to ETS operations, provided that: (1) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative guarantees payment of all relocation costs, including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any reasonable additional costs that the PARS licensee might incur as a result of relocation to another fixed band or migration to another medium; (2) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbent's behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and (3) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 2 GHz system. (d) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff. (e) If, within one year after the relocation to new facilities, the PARS licensee demonstrates that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the PARS licensee back to its former (or equivalent) 2 GHz channels. §22.603 488&hyph;494 MHz fixed service in Hawaii. Before filing applications for authorization of inter-island control and/or repeater stations, applicants must coordinate the planned channel usage with existing licensees and other applicants with previously filed applications, using the procedure outlined in §22.150. Applicants and licensees shall cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve any channel usage conflicts. In situations where technical solutions to such conflicts cannot be devised, the FCC may select a channel or channels to assign or may designate the application(s) for hearing. To be acceptable for filing, applications and major technical amendments must contain a certification that coordination has been completed and an exhibit listing the name(s) of the licensees and applicants with which the planned channel usage has been coordinated. Point-to-Multipoint Operation §22.621 Channels for point-to-multipoint operation. The following channels are allocated for assignment to transmitters utilized within point-to-multipoint systems that support transmitters that provide public mobile service. Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.
