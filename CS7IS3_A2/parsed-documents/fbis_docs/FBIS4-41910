A total of 25 million 800 voters took part in the presidential election. Under the Ukrainian law if neither candidate collects 50 percent of the votes at once, the two top candidates qualify for a run-off. The central electoral commission is going to set a date for the election of the Ukrainian president later this week. The run-off is to be held no later than two weeks after the first round. The chief of the presidential service Vladimir Shlyaposhnikov has told IF that Kravchuk's victory was not a surprise. As for the complete failure of the ex-speaker Ivan Plyushch, who according to early returns holds sixth place, it was totally unexpected. The returns from the first round of the presidential election in Ukraine are evidence that neither candidate is regarded as a a consolidating figure and that the trend of Ukraine's split along geographic and political lines goes on. The West voted for Kravchuk, and the East for Kuchma, the chairman of the State Duma's Committee for the CIS affairs and contacts with compatriots Konstantin Zatulin has said. He led the Russian parliament's observer delegation monitoring the election. He believes that irrespective of the results of the run-off it is clear that Kravchuk has lost the status of the national leader. Zatulin has described the relatively high percentage of votes cast for Kuchma as his major success, emphasized by the fact that the entire state machinery worked against him throughout the election campaign. Zatulin pointed to the fact that in contrast to the parliamentary elections the presidential election was attended by far fewer international observers, which may lead to election rigging. Zatulin said that by not sending their observers the Western countries gave Leonid Kravchuk and the party in power in Ukraine a chance to influence the outcome of the elections.
