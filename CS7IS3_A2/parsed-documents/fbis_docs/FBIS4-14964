The previous round was held last November. The Moldovan chief negotiator, ambassador to Moscow Anatol Taran, told Interfax that the deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian Army remained the only unresolved issue. In his words, "all other problems have been practically resolved" and the draft treaty "nearly ironed out." "If this round of talks succeeded in determining the deadline for the withdrawal of the army, this would make a significant progress," Taran said. Thus far, he said, "the two sides hold their ground and it would be difficult to work out a compromise." Taran also said that the two sides discussed the contribution Moldova could make to the housing of the army following its withdrawal. The Moldovan delegation agrees to raise the cash from two sources, selling the flats of leaving Russian officers and auctioning some of the army's realties. Taran said that the Russian delegation wanted Kishinev [Chisinau] to add a third source, money from the Moldovan state budget. Moldova, permanently hard up, said it could not afford it. Taran also said that his country had invited members of the CSCE permanent mission members in the Republic to be present at the talks as observers. The Russian negotiators did not think their presence essential and suggested that the mission could be informed on the results of the talks when they ended. The two sides had agreed thus far that Transdniestria representatives would be present at the talks as observers.
