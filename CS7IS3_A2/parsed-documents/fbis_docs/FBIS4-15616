The republics where it will have bases are to retain ownership of the leased territory and property. A worker on the staff of Ukrainian President Kravchuk said that in an interview with Interfax. The man preferred to remain unidentified. The Kravchuk Administration felt the naval facilities of Sevastopol could be leased to Russia but must still be regarded as Ukrainian naval facilities on lease to Russia. If they were regarded as Russian property, said the unidentified Administration spokesman, the situation would compare to that around the Guantanamo base in Cuba. In the meantime, chief Aleksandr Kluban of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service told Interfax-Ukraine that the deployment of Russian armymen outside Russia was not Ukraine's headache. He said Russia had so far made no such proposition to his republic.
