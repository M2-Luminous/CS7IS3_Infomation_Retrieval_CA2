The armaments procurement company had issued 631 export permits for arms worth more than 820m R[rand] over the past two years. Smith told military correspondents at a briefing that SA would most likely become a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime by October and Armscor was positioning itself for this prospect. SA was finalising a national arms control policy in terms of which all arms-related control measures would be centralised under the Defence Ministry, he said. "Armscor has committed itself to becoming more transparent and accountable, especially regarding aspects such as its arms exports in international terms." But, Smith said, Armscor found it difficult to thoroughly police the final destiny and use of armaments manufactured in SA because of a lack of co-operation between government bodies such as the SA Police Services, Customs and Excise and the Trade and Industry Department. However, Armscor was committed to adhering to government regulations and rules regarding client countries. Smith said SA had a firm policy in terms of export clients and would under no circumstances export to certain countries. He said the list of client countries was classified, but, for example, SA had stopped supplying Rwanda several months ago when civil war broke out there. Smith said although Armscor suggested clients to whom SA should sell its armaments, government had the final say in the matter. "After all, we are only civil servants." Smith agreed that Armscor, to a certain extent, had a credibility problem because of its operations during the sanctions years. But he said the company "never allowed anybody in the industry to break SA's own rules and regulations". He said it was Armscor's first priority to have the UN embargoes lifted, and to achieve that, it would not tolerate any transgression of any international regulation.
