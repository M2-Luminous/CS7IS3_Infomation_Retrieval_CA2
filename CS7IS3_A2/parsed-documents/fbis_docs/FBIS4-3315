China, as a major power, plays a key role in world affairs, Musa told a press conference on the eve of Mubarak's visit which takes place from April 21 to 23. Praising relations between China and Egypt and between President Mubarak and the Chinese leadership as time-tested and distinguished, the foreign minister said that intensive consultations between the two countries over the past 10 years have laid down a base for further promotion of Sino-Egyptian relations. A number of economic agreements will be concluded during this visit, Musa said. He said Egypt and China enjoy close ties. Egypt is the first Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of China. Since 1956, friendly relations have developed on the basis of understanding and mutual cooperation. He said Egypt supports China's joining of the GATT agreement, adding China's tremendous development in industry and free zones calls for enhanced co-operation between the two nations. Musa voiced hope that the volume of trade between the two countries will increase. The two-way trade stood at 224 million U.S. dollars in 1993. Musa will leave Cairo Wednesday [27 April] and join the delegation accompanying President Mubarak during his official visit to China. Mubarak is now in Oman.
