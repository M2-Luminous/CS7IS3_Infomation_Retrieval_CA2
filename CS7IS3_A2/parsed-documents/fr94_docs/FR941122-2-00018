FR941122-2-00018 FR941122-2-00010 Public Involvement Opportunities DOE will develop a stakeholder involvement plan to guide the public review aspects of this EIS. To assist with developing the stakeholder involvement plan, DOE requests suggestions by the public on how this EIS process should be conducted, including suggestions regarding the type, format and conduct of public involvement opportunities. Through this Notice, DOE formally invites the State, tribes, other government agencies and the public to comment on the scope of the EIS. DOE will offer informational briefings to tribal governments, local (county and municipal) governments, and the State of New Mexico. A second formal opportunity for comment will be provided after DOE issues the draft EIS, expected in mid-1995. Public hearings will be held in conjunction with that comment period. DOE will inform the State, tribes, local governments, other agencies and the general public of its final decisions at the time the Record of Decision is issued, expected in October 1995. In addition to formal opportunities for comment, any person may submit comments at any time during the NEPA review process; however, to ensure that comments are considered at specific points in the NEPA review, and to best assist DOE, the public is encouraged to comment during the formally established comment periods. Copies of DARHT design and other background documents, written comments, records of public meetings, and other materials related to the development and analyses of the EIS have been and are being placed in the Los Alamos National Laboratory Community Reading Room, 1450 Central Avenue, Suite 101, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87544. For information on the availability of specific documents and hours of operation, please contact the reading room at (505)665&hyph;2127 or (800)543&hyph;2342. Signed in Washington, D.C., this 18 day of November 1994, for the United States Department of Energy. Tara O'Toole, Assistant Secretary, Environment, Safety and Health.
