Klevtsov, chairman of the Sakhalin District Electoral Commission, delivered temporary credentials to deputies in the new Russian parliament Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov, Mikhail Romanovskiy, and Boris Tretyak. In addition, Klevtsov handed over to the deputies the voters' mandates that the commission had received. The chief mandate is to do everything possible and impossible to preserve civil peace in the country. The second is to strengthen legality, and to fight decisively and in an uncompromising manner against corruption and organized crime. After the ceremonies were over, the deputies answered the journalists' questions. Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov thanked the public of Sakhalin Oblast for the work that had been done. "Our task," he said, "is to represent the population properly in the Federal Assembly. We must influence the process of reforms and must make them more reasonable, especially when this pertains to shock therapy. Currently we are being advised to do more therapy and less shock. I am opposed to shock therapy in the Far East. The three of us have already met and we have decided to act as a single bloc, and in the new parliament we shall try to unite the Far East deputies into a single front." Boris Tretyak assured the journalists that he is going to Moscow to work, and for him Sakhalin will be in first place. "I am in no hurry to enter any blocs," he said. "For me the basic consideration will be the Sakhalin voters." At the same time, after the journalists' direct questions, the deputies admitted that they do have definite political priorities. For example, Romanovskiy and Tretyak keep more to the "center," and they like the Shakhray bloc. But Krasnoyarov prefers "Russia's Choice," with one stipulation -- excluding from its program the shock therapy for the Far East. Speaking about the future election to the local parliament, the oblast's administration head said, "Within a few days I shall sign the statute governing elections. We will have to create a new organ, consisting of two houses. The lower house -- the oblast Duma -- will include 19 persons. Eighteen of them will be elected by districts from an equal number of residents. One deputy will represent the indigenous nationalities of Sakhalin, and he will be elected for a single district -- the oblast district. The upper house -- the Oblast Council -- will consist of one representative from each rayon." The journalists were also interested in hearing about the positions taken by the new people on the political scene, Romanovskiy and Tretyak, concerning a serious question -- the question of the "northern territories." Replying to this, Boris Tretyak said, "This is a complicated question, and we must study it. But if we are talking about whether or not to give back the Kuriles, I take a very cautious attitude toward the concept of `giving back.' Especially when this pertains to Russian land. That which currently exists in Russia belongs to Russia, and to Russians. But, to put it honestly, I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about the history of this question." Mikhail Romanovskiy agreed with his colleague that this is a very complicated problem: "I was asked that question frequently when I met with the public. Once I gave this answer: Gorbachev said that there is no problem, since we won that war. Yeltsin said that we should wait 10-15 years and let a younger population deal with it. But I think that today we should not make this question any larger than it actually is. The country is in a complicated economic and political situation. There are many national conflicts, and if we give back part of the territory this will cause a row. There will be a confrontation of forces --leftists, rightists, and others. Therefore we currently should give back absolutely nothing -- either in Kaliningrad, in Karelia, or on the border with China. We ought to wait three or four years and then return to the problem, because the problem does exist and should be resolved. "Currently we should invest money in the Kuriles. Otherwise the population there will go to Japan, if we do not change the attitude to those islands and do not develop them."
