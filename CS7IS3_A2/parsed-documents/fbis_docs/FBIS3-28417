Chong Ki-hae, age 52, told a press conference that food rations in the North had consisted mainly of soy beans and corns mixed with those grains reserved for livestock feeds until early last year. "Beginning last May, however, even these ceased to be rationed. Our family had to live on potatoes alone in the past six months," Chong said. The defector, a repatriate from Japan, said he had earned 176 North Korean won a month as a work team head at the Unhung mine machinery plant in Yanggang Province. He said that only about 60 percent of the wage had actually been paid, with which, he said, it was extremely difficult to support his family. Because of his being a repatriate, Chong said, he had been placed under close surveillance by public security authorities for 30-odd years since his repatriation from Japan in June 1960. "Like me, all other repatriates had chosen to move to North Korea at sugar-coated promises by North Korea," Chong said. "They are leading miserable lives under the watchful eyes of the security authorities." The defector said he crossed the Tuman River into China on Dec. 30 last year and stayed in Yanji for about 20 days before reaching Pusan. He declined to say how he could come to South Korea. Chong said his wife and five children are staying in North Korea, adding that his father was born at Yongchon near Taegu in South Korea.
