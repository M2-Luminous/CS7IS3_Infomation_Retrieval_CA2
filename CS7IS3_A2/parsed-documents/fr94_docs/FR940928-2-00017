Southern Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;785&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 16, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), Post Office Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama, 35202&hyph;2563 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;785&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a new point of delivery in Effingham County, Georgia, under Southern's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;406&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Southern proposes to construct and operate certain measurement and other appurtenant facilities at or near Mile Post 95 on its Wrens-Savannah Lines in Effingham County, George in order to provide transportation service to Atlanta Gas Light Company (Atlanta) so that Atlanta may provide natural gas service for peaking purposes to Savannah Electric and Power Company. Southern estimates the cost of the proposed facilities to be constructed by Southern to be $1,801,209 and it advises that Atlanta has agreed to reimburse Southern for the cost of the construction. Additionally, Southern states that it will provide service to Atlanta at the new deliver point, the AGL-Plant McIntosh, under Atlanta's existing Service Agreements with Southern pursuant to Southern's Rate Schedules FT and IT. Southern also states that Atlanta does not propose to add any transportation demand to its firm service as a result of the addition of the delivery point. Southern further advises that, because the gas will be delivered primarily in the summer, the installation of the proposed facilities will have no adverse effect on Southern's ability to provide its peak day or annual deliveries. Comment date: November 4, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.
