The PHA shall retain for a minimum of 5 years the following documents that may have been submitted to the PHA by the family, or provided to the PHA as part of the INS appeal or the PHA informal hearing process: (1) The application for financial assistance; (2) The form completed by the family for income re-examination; (3) Photocopies of any original documents (front and back), including original INS documents; (4) The signed verification consent form; (5) The INS verification results; (6) The request for an INS appeal; (7) The final INS determination; (8) The request for a PHA informal hearing; and (9) The final PHA hearing decision. §912.10 Preservation of mixed families and other families. (a) Assistance available for mixed families. (1) Assistance available for tenant mixed families. For a mixed family assisted under a Section 214 covered program on [insert the effective date of the final rule], one of the following three types of assistance may be available to the family: (i) Continued assistance (see paragraph (b) of this section); (ii) Prorated assistance (see §912.11); or (iii) Temporary deferral of termination of assistance (see paragraph (c) of this section). (2) Assistance available for applicant mixed families. Prorated assistance is also available for mixed families applying for assistance as provided in §912.11. (3) Assistance available to other families in occupancy. For families receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on the [insert the effective date of the final rule] and who have no members with eligible immigration status, the PHA may grant the family temporary deferral of termination of assistance. (b) Continued assistance. A mixed family may receive continued housing assistance if all of the following conditions are met: (1) The family was receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on [insert the effective date of the final rule]; (2) The family's head of household or spouse has eligible immigration status as described in §912.5; and (3) The family does not include any person (who does not have eligible immigration status) other than the head of household, any spouse of the head of household, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, or any children of the head of household or spouse. (c) Temporary deferral of termination of assistance. (1) Eligibility for this type of assistance. If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard, that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent. (2) Time limit on deferral period. If temporary deferral of termination of assistance is granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period not to exceed six months. The initial period may be renewed for additional periods of six months, but the aggregate deferral period shall not exceed a period of three years. (3) Notification requirements for beginning of each deferral period. At the beginning of each deferral period, the PHA must inform the family of its ineligibility for financial assistance and offer the family information concerning, and referrals to assist in finding, other affordable housing. (4) Determination of availability of affordable housing at end of each deferral period. Before the end of each deferral period, the PHA must: (i) Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on evidence of conditions which when taken together will demonstrate an inadequate supply of affordable housing for the area in which the project is located, the CHAS (if applicable), the PHA's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant family's efforts to locate such housing; and (ii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed three years), and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available; or (iii) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination of financial assistance will not be deferred because either granting another deferral will result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed three years, or a determination has been made that other affordable housing is available. (d) Notification of decision on family preservation assistance. A PHA shall notify the family of it's decision concerning the family's qualification for assistance under this section. If the family is ineligible for assistance under this section, the notification shall state the reasons, which must be based on relevant factors. For tenant families, the notice also shall inform the family of any applicable appeal rights. §912.11 Proration of assistance. (a) Applicability. This section applies to a mixed family other than a family receiving continued assistance under §912.10(b), or other than a family for which termination of assistance is temporarily deferred under §912.10(c). (b) Method of prorating assistance. The PHA shall prorate the family's assistance by: (1) Step 1. Determining total tenant payment in accordance with 24 CFR 913.107(a) (annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status). (2) Step 2. Subtracting the total tenant payment from a HUD-supplied ``public housing maximum rent'' applicable to the unit or the housing authority. (Public housing maximum rent shall be determined by HUD using the 95th percentile rent for the housing authority.) The result is the maximum subsidy for which the family could qualify if all members were eligible (``family maximum subsidy'').
