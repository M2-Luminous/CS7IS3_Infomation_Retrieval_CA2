At a press conference on the same day, BNF representative Syarhey Navumchik said that signatures in favor of Z. Paznyak will be collected among Supreme Soviet deputies and Belarusian citizens. In the words of S. Navumchik, while one should not count on support from the deputies, the signature drive among citizens might bring very good results. According to S. Navumchik, activists from the Free Trade Union are conducting a survey among workers at several enterprises to single out the most popular presidential candidates. Initial results are as follows: of 800 workers at the Minsk Tractor Plant, only one person each spoke in favor of Stanislav Shushkevich and Alyaksandr Lukashenka, while the other 798 respondents expressed support for Zyanon Paznyak.
