According to statistics, these zones exported 2.47 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods last year, an increase of 78.7 percent over the previous year. The zones are located in the eight cities of Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, Weifang, Zibo, Rizhao, Jinan and Dongying. A local official attributed the good result to a positive expansion of foreign economic cooperation. In addition to increases in imports and exports, a survey shows that these open cities, empowered to export their products by themselves, have absorbed foreign funds, offered labor service, opened enterprises overseas and conducted international tourist service. Aiming for the international market, the peninsula has combined agriculture with industry and trade to form an all-embracing export-oriented setup.
