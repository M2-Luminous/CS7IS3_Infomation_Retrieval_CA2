In official language, this means organizing the legal status and the procedure and timetable for the withdrawal of the Russian military formations temporarily present in the Republic of Moldova. Despite the smiles and the correct formulas from the delegation heads (Russia is represented by special envoy V. Kitayev, while Moldova is represented by A. Tsaran [name as transliterated], ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary), judging by everything, the talks have been difficult. The main point of difference has been the timetable for the withdrawal. The Moldovan side, which had been insisting on July 1994, is prepared to wait another year or two, while the Russian side, without setting any precise timeframe, considers a longer period to be more realistic. There is one other point on which the sides were unable to reach full mutual understanding. An agreement signed by the two presidents -- Boris Yeltsin and Mircea Snegur -- stipulates the principle of synchronizing the timetable for the 14th Army's withdrawal with the adoption of legal status for the Dniester Region. And, as the Russian side stressed, it is a question of a joint accord, rather than a unilateral Russian initiative or its interference in another state's internal affairs. But Moldovan Ambassador Tsaran believes that the synchronization principle has not proved its worth and has turned into a brake on the negotiating process. V. Kitayev expressed the conviction that the Dniester problem would be solved, and Russia is actively supporting the political settlement process. As for the synchronization principle, from his standpoint, it would be far more productive to conduct the talks themselves rather than to complain about unsuitable principles. The question of creating a military base to replace the 14th Army was not discussed. As for General Lebed and his political activeness, E. Vorobyev, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, said that the 14th Army commander is highly valued as a professional and honest general, but people do not approve of his predilection for various political statements. The 14th Army's property -- which, judging by the edict from Dniester Region President I. Smirnov, that region claims -- belongs to Russia, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has issued an official statement on this score. But, on the whole, observers made a positive assessment of the last round of talks. From their standpoint there was some progress in this area. In particular, draft agreements on questions of jurisdiction, mutual legal aid, and issues relating to social guarantees for servicemen and pensions provision were initialed. A jointly elaborated methodology for defining the technical timetable for the withdrawal of troops and military cargo from Moldovan territory has been signed. The next meeting is planned for May. Thus, new realities have emerged in the protracted talks. In this connection our correspondent asked Georgiy Marakutsa, chairman of the Dniester Region Supreme Soviet, to comment on the current situation. "The Dniester Region Supreme Soviet expressed its attitude," he said, "in a statement which says that the results of the elections to the Moldovan parliament and an opinion poll show that there is a new sociopolitical situation in the Republic, and that this makes it possible to hope for an end to political extremism at state level. "In the current Moldovan parliament Agrarians and Socialists make up a bloc with which dialogue is possible. But I am not expecting any immediate results. It will take time to rid ourselves of national-patriotic euphoria and illusions, as well as of the idea that the Dniester Republic was allegedly the artificial fruit of a group of politicians. "If we cite the will of the people, their view of our region was expressed at the recent elections. Out of 485,000 voters only 6,800 took part in the formation of the new Moldovan parliament. International observers did not record a single instance of any obstacles being erected on our part. Those who wanted to vote could do so. ``Some 1.5 percent made their choice, and that is their right, but the rest of the population, by their failure to participate in the elections, also expressed their will, thereby confirming that the Dniester Republic was created by the people rather than by individual politicians, as people in Chisinau have been claiming hitherto. If the Moldovan leadership realizes its mistake there is hope that there will be a dialogue, although there will be many obstacles to it. ``Chisinau is paying lip-service to the idea of the indivisibility and integrity of Moldova, but in fact our relations have long since moved to the level of interstate relations. If we are one state, then why is a national currency being unilaterally introduced, why are the balance of trade and mutual transactions with us conducted as they would be with Ukraine or Belarus? Or take the loans from the West -- of which we have not received a single kopek. Who will repay them? All of us together? We will not stand for that. Just name a single country where internal relations are conducted on this basis. ``M. Snegur's trip to Brussels to sign NATO's `Partnership For Peace' program is further evidence of our separateness. Moldova is seeking security guarantees there. Who from? From Russia? Ukraine? Of course not. Wouldn't it be better to choose another way -- self-demilitarization, as we have long suggested? ``In short, there are many issues. And they require solution. We recognize the integrity of the Republic of Moldova and its external borders, and we are prepared for any compromises, but only up to a certain point. That point has been defined -- the statehood of the Dniester Region. ``This is not a whim or a caprice, it is not a question of clinging on to power, as Chisinau makes out, rather it is the only way to deal with our destiny in such a way as to ensure that nobody is ever able -- irrespective of the changing political weather in Chisinau -- to dictate terms to this region. We will not retreat from statehood. Filling it with content is another matter. This can be decided around the negotiating table, and we are ready to sit down at it.''
