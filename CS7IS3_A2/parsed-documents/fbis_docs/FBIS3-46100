An official from the department of household registration of the Beijing Public Security Bureau revealed that the migrant population posed many problems, especially those of public order which has seen half of the criminals arrested in the municipality being non- permanent residents even though this group of the population made a contribution to the prosperity of the municipality. A seminar held by local bureaus of public security in Beijing was aimed at collecting opinions from the public in a bid to work out measures to maintain public order. Many of those who expressed an opinion at the seminar said that the increase in use of police radio for reporting of crimes should be employed. Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shen Zui, in a speech praised the introduction of the police patrol system, saying he was convinced that the police should patrol with police dogs in order to impose further deterrence on criminals. He also called for the installation of the more telephones for the reporting of crime. An expert on teenage education pointed out that great attention should be paid to the fact that the age of criminals was becoming younger and that education in the law for teenagers had to be boosted. A public security official said that the administration of public order had to be based on the strict cracking down on crime. He added that reform of public security work should be carried out with the aim of keeping in line with the socialist market economy system.
