Standing at over 1 billion yuan, export volume was slightly more than the import volume. As the Vietnamese side continuously raised import tariff rates for Chinese goods at the second half of last year, it is now more difficult to carry out border trade than it was before. Guangxi plans to turn the focus of economic cooperation with Vietnam to upgrading Vietnam's outdated enterprises. In reply to reporters' questions a few days ago, Lei Yu said: Now that Vietnam is engaging in post-war reconstruction and conducting reform and opening up, Guangxi has become the most favorable place in China to do business with Vietnam. In his view, trade contacts between the two countries are beneficial to both parties and some of the outstanding issues in border trade can be resolved through consultation. Lei pointed out: In the past, when China and Vietnam had intimate relations, China helped Vietnam build a large number of industrial projects. The equipment of these enterprises is now very old and needs to be renovated, while China's manufacturing technology, managerial expertise, and equipment technology are most suitable to the existing level in Vietnam. Guangxi is currently holding talks with Vietnam on helping them renovate those projects. Lei disclosed: Guangxi has successfully helped Vietnam upgrade a chemical fertilizer plant, expanding the plant's annual production capacity from 20,000 metric tons to 100,000 metric tons. It has also helped them build a fairly large modern market in Haiphong, Vietnam. Moreover, Guangxi plans to hold a commodity fair in Ho Chi Minh City very soon to further promote Chinese products in Vietnam.
