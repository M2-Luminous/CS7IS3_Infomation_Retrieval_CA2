KYODO reported this citing Chinese sources, and said that while China's top priority last year was on the development of Sino- Japanese relations, the order of priority has changed this year. KYODO said that China will list North Korea-China friendly relations first on China's priority list in Premier Li Peng's foreign policy action report apparently to proclaim the complete restoration of Sino-North Korean relations which have cooled off since the establishment of Sino-ROK relations in August 1992.
