The organisation's secretary general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, issued the denial barely two hours after IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had learnt that the ANC had withdrawn these charges. Stressing the anc's commitment to accept the results of a free and fair election, Mr Ramaphosa said his organisation had presented new evidence of irregularity to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). "The ANC has new evidence that it has submitted to the IEC, further strengthening its case on the irregularities in KwaZulu/Natal. It is the firm hope of the ANC that outstanding problems contributing to the delay in counting will be speedily resolved to allow the country to embark on the many tasks awaiting the government of national unity." Earlier, IEC spokesman Mr Glenn McDougall confirmed the commission had found no evidence of extensive voting fraud in KwaZulu/Natal, as claimed by the ANC.
