FR940630-2-00154 FR940630-2-00120 Federal Railroad Administration [Docket No. RSAD&hyph;91&hyph;3] Test Program to Evaluate Random Drug Testing Rate AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Notice of Extension of Test Program. SUMMARY: FRA extends an experimental program designed to evaluate the effect of different random drug testing rates on general deterrence. In a recent notice, the Department of Transportation proposed a system which would authorize FRA to lower the minimum random drug testing rate for railroads from 50 percent to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent for 2 calendar years. If the Department adopts this proposal, FRA could use existing data from its previous annual reporting system as a basis for adjusting the minimum railroad random drug testing rate. Extending FRA's experimental program indefinitely will allow four test railroads that have been conducting random drug testing at a 25 percent rate to provide additional data on the relative effectiveness of the two testing rates. DATES: FRA will extend the current conditional waivers indefinitely beginning on July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter C. Rockey, Executive Assistant (RRS&hyph;3), Office of Safety, FRA, Washington, DC 20590 (Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0897) or Patricia V. Sun, Trial Attorney (RCC&hyph;30), Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Washington, DC 20590 (Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4002). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In February of 1991, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) filed a petition proposing an experimental program that would permit a test group of railroads to conduct random drug testing at a 25 percent rate for one year, for comparison against a group of control railroads which would continue to test at the required 50 percent rate. Data from the two groups could then be analyzed to determine the effect of different testing rates on deterrence. FRA agreed with the AAR that an experimental program would be useful. To create a group of test railroads, FRA granted four railroads (three Class I freight railroads and one commuter railroad) a waiver to conduct random drug testing at a 25 percent rate (instead of the required 50 percent rate) beginning on July 1, 1991. FRA also designated a control group of three additional Class I freight railroads and one additional commuter railroad which would continue to test at the 50 percent rate. FRA monitored the program by reviewing quarterly test reports submitted by the test and control railroads. In the program's first two years, positive test rates did not vary appreciably between the test and control groups. Through June 30, 1993, the four test railroads conducted 19,958 random drug tests, with a positive test rate of .90 percent. The four control railroads conducted 34,121 random drug tests, with a positive rate of .85 percent. (The positive test rate for the industry as a whole was .89 percent in 1991, .79 percent in 1992, and .72 percent in 1993). The last three quarters of data, however, show a greater improvement in the aggregated positive test rate for the control group, (.75 percent), than for the test group (.83). This trend suggests caution when considering further reductions in the random drug testing rate. Railroads should also continue to use a mix of countermeasures, in addition to random testing, to ensure deterrence. On February 15, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to allow the operating administrations to lower the minimum random drug testing rate from 50 percent to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent for 2 calendar years [59 FR 7614]. Under this proposed system, FRA could use existing data from railroad annual reports as a basis for lowering the minimum railroad random drug testing rate to 25 percent. In light of this notice, the AAR has requested an extension of the experimental program, currently set to expire on June 30, 1994, to allow the test railroads to continue testing at a 25 percent random rate until the Department decides whether or not to adopt this proposal. FRA intends to grant the AAR's request to extend the experimental program, and capture more data on the relative effectiveness of the two testing rates. By letter, FRA will extend the current conditional waivers indefinitely. FRA will continue to require all participating railroads to comply with its previously established protocols covering test conditions and reporting requirements. As before, FRA reserves the right to terminate or modify the experimental program on 10 days notice if any party fails to comply with any conditions specified in the protocols, if quarterly reports indicate a particularly serious degrading of performance by one or more of the test railroads, or if FRA finds material deficiencies in railroad alcohol/drug program administration. FRA does not intend to grant the AAR's proposal for a second experimental program to study the effect of further lowering the random drug testing rate to 10 percent. As stated above, the latest data from FRA's current experimental program shows a stronger trend of improvement in the positive test rate of the control railroads, which have continued to test at 50 percent. Moreover, the minimum testing rate should be set at that point which balances the value of additional deterrence against the increased cost of testing. As mentioned above, the Department has already considered this issue, and has proposed to lower the random drug testing rate to 25 percent if an industry achieves a positive test rate of less than 1.0 percent for two years. FRA's current experimental rate of 25 percent is consistent with the Department's proposal, and is not excessively burdensome in view of the residual rate of drug use in the rail industry. FRA therefore believes that an additional, separate rail experimental program to study the effect of a 10 percent rate is unnecessary, and will so notify the AAR by letter.
