Speaking today in his regular radio programme "Talks in Lany", Havel said that it was not up to the government, the political parties, let alone the president, to decide whether Jezek should remain in his post. The decision is in the powers of the FNM leadership, he added. The bankruptcies of little banks can be a sort of appeal to those who quickly, and perhaps too quickly, have entered the world of the market economy, Havel said about the critical situation of the Bohemia a AB Mlada Boleslav banks. He expressed his conviction that the Czech bank sector was healthy as a whole. Havel said that all the work of previous four years to improve the image of the Presidential Office and Prague Castle collapsed within two days because all the media have reported "how we steal here." This has created the situation when it will be difficult to find new sponsors, he said. "However, the articles are not based on real knowledge of the ruling by the inspecting office," Havel stated. He said he considered this "a certain disaster." Havel said that the administrative mistakes (in the management of the Presidential Office) had not robbed the taxpayers of a single crown. Asked whether journalists should be blamed for the misinterpretation of the report on management, Havel replied that the current situation has not been caused only by journalists. "The very unfortunate way of presenting the ruling without the relevant protocol," i.e. without an analysis or commentary, must be taken into account, too, he added.
