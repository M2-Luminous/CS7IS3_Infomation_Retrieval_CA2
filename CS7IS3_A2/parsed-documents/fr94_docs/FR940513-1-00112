FR940513-1-00112 FR940513-1-00022 1. Food Processing HO 10 currently prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in certain occupations involving slaughtering, meat-packing or processing, or rendering. There are no comparable restrictions involving poultry processing and fish and seafood processing. Should the Department adopt restrictions in these industries, and, if so, are there particular machines or operations which should be restricted? To what extent are minors under 18 employed in such industries, and what is the nature of the work performed? Should such restrictions encompass all food processing? Do studies, injury and illness data, etc., exist which support prohibiting the employment of minors under the age of 18 in all food processing activity? 2. Hazardous Wastes and Toxic Substances Existing regulations do not address exposures to hazardous wastes and toxic substances in nonagricultural employment. In agriculture, the handling of or applying toxic agricultural chemicals by youth under the age of 16 is prohibited (see ยง570.71(a)(9)). The model State child labor law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition, discussed above, would ban all occupations involving the loading, mixing, applying, handling, or working around or near any fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, insecticides, and/or any other chemical. In addition, this model legislation would prohibit the loading, handling, mixing, or applying of chemicals, including cleaning agents or disinfectants, which could result in allergic reactions, poisonings, or internal or external injuries. The use or handling of heavy metals, including mercury and lead, would also be prohibited by the proposed model legislation. A number of States have adopted standards along the same lines. Several States, for example, prohibit exposure to carcinogenic, corrosive, or toxic substances. Working with lead, working in the manufacturing of paint, acids or poisons, and exposure to asbestos and related substances are other areas banned by particular States. Is there a commonly understood definition of toxic or hazardous substances, and what standards or criteria would be appropriate for use in Federal standards for workers under 18 years old? Should different standards apply to 14- and 15-year-olds? Are there data to support such standards or criteria? Should specific substances or materials be identified in an HO, or would a more generic framework be appropriate? Is an occupational and/or industry framework a reasonable alternative, and, if so, which occupations and/or industries create the greatest concerns that such exposure is detrimental to the health and well-being of youth under age 18? What are the compliance difficulties associated with limiting employment in this area, and how can they be minimized? 3. Electric Apparatus and Wiring Available injury and illness data indicate a high incidence of fatal injuries in the construction industry resulting from electric shock. A significant number of these deaths were suffered by workers between the ages of 16 and 19. Construction industry accidents involving electric shock are attributed to working directly with electricity, using hand held power driven tools, from electric cords, and from ladders, scaffolds and other equipment coming in contact with overhead wires. While the current child labor regulations do not deal with electricity, at least six States prohibit young workers from working with electric apparatus and wiring. Should consideration be given to establishing a prohibition of such activity in the construction industry? Why? Should a broad-based generic prohibition be considered as opposed to occupational-specific prohibitions, and, if so, how should the prohibition be formulated? Should an exemption be permitted for employment of 16- and 17-year-old apprentices and student learners as in the case of certain other HOs (HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17)? 4. Heights Under HO 16, all occupations in roofing operations are prohibited. The HO's prohibition does not include gutter and downspout work; the construction of the sheathing or base of roofs; or the installation of television antennas, air conditioners, exhaust and ventilating equipment, or similar appliances attached to roofs. Several States currently restrict work above certain heights by young workers. These standards either involve work performed at heights above 10 feet or at heights 6 feet above ground, and include elevated surfaces such as scaffolds and ladders. While work in roofing occupations is specifically prohibited by HO 16, work in other occupations requiring work on a roof are not. Should all occupations involving work on roofs be prohibited? If so, why? As above, should consideration be given to the possible development of a generic restriction with cross-industry application or to particular occupations and/or industries, e.g., the construction industry? Also, should an exemption be permitted for employment of 16- and 17-year-old apprentices and student learners? 5. Body Fluids and Infectious Agents The States of Wisconsin and Washington have prohibited all minors from working in occupations involving exposure to body fluids including blood or infectious agents, and in 1993 the States of North Dakota and Illinois banned such employment for minors under the age of 16. Other States accomplish a similar objective using an industry/occupation approach. In Virginia, for example, minors under the age of 16 cannot work as laboratory helpers, therapists, orderlies, or nurses' aides in any hospital, nursing home, clinic, or other establishment providing care for resident patients. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited by the State of Washington from employment in the occupation of nurses' aid, except as a student or after training, and by the State of Wisconsin from employment in hospitals and nursing homes. The model State law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition, referred to above, would ban all occupations involving the handling or storage of blood, blood products, body fluids and body tissues, and medical or other dangerous wastes.
