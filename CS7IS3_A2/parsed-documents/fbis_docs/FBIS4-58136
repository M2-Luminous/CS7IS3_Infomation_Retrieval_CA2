This was reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. Jerusalem believes that if al-Asad is made aware of the nature of the permanent agreement between the two countries at an early stage, he will be willing to accept the stages of the interim agreement Israel is offering. Yesterday, the offer raised at the time by James Baker -- that U.S. forces be stationed on the Golan Heights -- was also discussed. The parties further discussed the economic aid Israel would receive from the United States if an agreement is signed with Syria. Senior political sources further told our correspondent that in Damascus, Christopher will discuss bilateral Syrian-U.S. issues such as removing Syria from the list of terror sponsoring countries, Syria's status in Lebanon, and its involvement in the international drug trade. Syria will also be asked to lift its boycott on the multilateral talks.
