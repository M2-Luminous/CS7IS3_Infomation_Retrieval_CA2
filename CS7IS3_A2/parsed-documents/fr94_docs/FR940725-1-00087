FR940725-1-00087 FR940725-1-00010 (b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, the steady angle of climb/descent, determined under §23.77(a), must be furnished. (c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if appropriate, for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the following information must be furnished_ (1) The takeoff distance, determined under §23.53 and the type of surface for which it is valid. (2) The effect on takeoff distance of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under §23.45(g); (3) The effect on takeoff distance of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component; (4) For multiengine reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and multiengine turbine powered airplanes, the one-engine-inoperative takeoff climb/descent gradient, determined under §23.66; (5) For multiengine airplanes, the enroute rate and gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, determined under §23.69(b); and (6) For single-engine airplanes, the glide performance determined under §23.71. (d) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for commuter category airplanes, the following information must be furnished_ (1) The accelerate-stop distance determined under §23.55; (2) The takeoff distance determined under §23.59(a); (3) At the option of the applicant, the takeoff run determined under §23.59(b); (4) The effect on accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance and, if determined, takeoff run, of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under §23.45(g); (5) The effect on accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance, and if determined, takeoff run, of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component; (6) The net takeoff flight path determined under §23.61(b); (7) The enroute gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, determined under §23.69(b); (8) The effect, on the net takeoff flight path and on the enroute gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, of 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component; (9) Overweight landing performance information (determined by extrapolation and computed for the range of weights between the maximum landing and maximum takeoff weights) as follows_ (i) The maximum weight for each airport altitude and ambient temperature at which the airplane complies with the climb requirements of §23.63(d)(2); and (ii) The landing distance determined under §23.75 for each airport altitude and standard temperature. (10) The relationship between IAS and CAS determined in accordance with §23.1323(b) and (c). (11) The altimeter system calibration required by §23.1325(e). 57. Section 23.1589 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §23.1589 Loading information. * * * * * (b) Appropriate loading instructions for each possible loading condition between the maximum and minimum weights established under §23.25, to facilitate the center of gravity remaining within the limits established under §23.23.
