The press center of the Pacific Fleet reports that this decision has been prompted by a recent warning issued to commanders of military units stating that their water and power will be cut off due to the arrears in payments which have now reached 4.5 billion rubles. At the sanction of the head of the town administration, an attempt was undertaken to disconnect water and power from the headquarters and other units of the Kamchatka flotilla. The military quickly retaliated by posting armed guards. As a result, the town authorities are in trouble. To add insult to injury, an attempt of duty managers to disconnect the supply was stopped by a preventive gunshot of the guard.
