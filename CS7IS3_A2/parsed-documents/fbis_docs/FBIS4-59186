Narasimha Rao. After the firm reiteration by the Under-Secretary of State, Lynn Davis, of the US resolve to go through with the supply of F-16s in return for capping Pakistan's nuclear programme, the Chairman of the House of Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton, has fired a more menacing missile at New Delhi. If Davis ostensibly tried to put the record straight without undue provocation, the high-ranking Democratic Congressman had no difficulty in taking a sledgehammer approach. Hamilton convinced himself that the cause of nuclear non-proliferation is so great, that he, as a prominent law-maker of the lane superpower is entitled to put India in its place. Quite forgetting the US's shameful record on the subject in north-east Asia. China is unabashedly a nuclear-weapons power and so the US has realised the limits of its capacity to brow-beat that country into meekly falling in line on the non-proliferation issue. But Washington has found it next to impossible so far to whip even North Korea into obedience although it is only suspected to be trying to achieve nuclear-weapons capability. After months of threatening Kim Il Sung of dire consequences if he refuses to permit full inspection of his nuclear facilities, the Clinton administration seems to be toying with the idea of defusing the tension on the Korean peninsula, at least for the time being, by going some way to placate the communist dictator. What else could be the meaning of the recent statement of the Defence Secretary, William Perry, when he says the US aims "to try to keep North Korea from getting a significant nuclear weapons capability". The climb-down makes a mockery of the American alarm over the suspected North Korean nuclear programme in the past year. It is difficult to resist the impression that it is non-proliferation idealism rather than a realistic appraisal of apprehended nuclear dangers that has prompted specific US policies towards each area in question. This factor coupled with Clinton's desperate need to register a notable foreign policy triumph -- especially a clear headway in giving an impetus to non-proliferation -- is really behind the American fixation about the assumed nuclear confrontation in South Asia. Recently Shanghai hosted a conference of experts from China, Pakistan, India and the US on the nuclear issue in Asia. According to the former lndian Foreign Secretary, A. P. Venkateswaran, Indian as well as Pakistani participants in the conference stated categorically that there is no likelihood of a nuclear conflict between their countries. It is time Clinton took a second look at his list of priorities. If he does so sincerely, there is just a chance of his realising that there is no case for a cold war against India on the nuclear issue.
