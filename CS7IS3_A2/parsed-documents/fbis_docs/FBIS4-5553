He stressed the need to remain loyal to the great leader President Kim Il-song, founder of the immortal chuche idea, and dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, guide of the socialist cause, for the victory of the human cause of socialism and the cause of independence and to effect a new turn in propagandising and disseminating the chuche idea.
