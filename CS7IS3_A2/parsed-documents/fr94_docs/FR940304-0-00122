FR940304-0-00122 FR940304-0-00021 Under ยง279.10(g)(4) of today's rule, used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking is exempt from the part 279 standards provided that the used oil meets the used oil specification prior to insertion. Used oil remains subject to part 279 standards up until its actual insertion into the petroleum refining process. As previously discussed, used oil generated on-site must be stored according to part 279, subpart C standards for used oil generators. Used oil generated off-site must be transported according to the part 279, subpart E standards for transporters and transfer facilities and stored according to the part 279, subpart F standards for used oil processor/re-refiners. EPA's use of the terms ``before'' and ``after'' crude distillation or catalytic cracking is intended to distinguish between the initial part of the petroleum refining process where crude oil is the primary feedstock and is refined by undergoing crude distillation or catalytic cracking and the latter part of the petroleum refining process where crude oil residuals constitute the primary feed, and coke and asphalt are the primary products. Refinery processes that occur after crude distillation or catalytic cracking do not provide refining to the same extent as that which occurs as a result of crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Crude distillation or catalytic cracking is expressly designed to remove, alter, or otherwise immobilize contaminants in the normal course of the refining process. EPA has insufficient information on post-crude distillation or catalytic cracking units identified by commenters (e.g., asphalt towers, petroleum cokers), and is concerned about the possible environmental effects (e.g., air emissions, transfer of inorganics to asphalt or petroleum coke) of placing large amounts of off-specification used oil into the petroleum refining process without passing through the crude distillation or catalytic cracking units. In contrast, on-specification used oil may be burned in the same manner as virgin petroleum fuel in other situations, therefore it makes little sense to restrict its use as a feedstock to the petroleum coker (or in any other process ``after'' crude distillation or catalytic cracking). It should be noted that if off-specification used oil is inserted into petroleum refining processes after crude distillation or catalytic cracking (e.g., a coker), the facility would be subject to the used oil processing requirements in part 279, subpart F. In addition, petroleum refining facilities that wish to insert on-specification used oil into the refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking and that are the first to claim that the used oil is on-specification (whether generated at the refinery, or at an off-site location), would be defined as marketers subject to the requirements for used oil marketers found in part 279, subpart H.
