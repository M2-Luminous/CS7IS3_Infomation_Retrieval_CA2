The contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina began separate talks in the French tourist resort of Talloires, close to the Swiss border, on Wednesday with two delegations -- of Moslems and Croats and of the Bosnian Serbs. The official platform for the talks is the Geneva declaration signed on May 13 by ministers of the United States, Russia and the European Union (E.U.), it was announced. Under this declaration, the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina are urged to sign a four-month ceasefire, during which time they would agree on the division of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the E.U. formula of 49 percent for the Serbs and 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation. In a statement to Bosnian Serb television, Buha said that the talks today had primarily focused on territorial delimitation. He said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had insisted that other criteria, in addition to the one of percentage of population, be also taken into consideration in the delimitation. These criteria include property, resources, and certainly, the one of functionality of the two future states in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslem-Croat federation and the Serb Republic, he said. According to land registers, 64 percent of the land in Bosnia- Herzegovina is owned by Serbs. "It is my impression that the members of the contact group are very interested in these arguments and I believe that, if they have not accepted them, then that they have seriously taken them into consideration. It remains to be seen what will come out in the end," Buha said. The contact group includes diplomats from the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France and Germany. Buha said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had made it clear at the very beginning that it considered the international conference on former Yugoslavia as the valid body, and that the contact group could only be a place where views will be exchanged and possible new suggestions be made. The members of the contact group "have accepted such a role and they did not have any greater ambitions than to be part of the diplomatic process within the conference on former Yugoslavia," Buha said. Representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats said upon arrival in Talloires that they would demand 58 percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for their federation, but foreign agencies reported that they had agreed later during the day to discuss the division of territory on the basis of 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Serb state. Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic announced ahead of the talks in Talloires that the Moslem side would negotiate and wage war until it wins 58 percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
