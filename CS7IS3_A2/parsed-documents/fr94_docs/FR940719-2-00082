FR940719-2-00082 FR940719-2-00052 •There is widespread concern within the disability community and among families of children with disabilities that coverage is inadequate for long term rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and home care services under virtually all health care reform proposals. Yet little information exists on the potential demand for and cost-effectiveness of such services for children with disabilities. •The number of children receiving SSI doubled from nearly 300 thousand in 1989 to over 770 thousand in 1993. The 1990 Zebley v. Sullivan Supreme Court decision, which invalidated the use of a medical ``listings only'' approach and replaced it with individualized functional assessments, contributed to some, but not all growth in SSI. There is considerable concern about the size of the potential pool of children who may qualify for SSI benefits in the future and how much SSI expenditures are likely to grow as a result. •Private health insurers increasingly attempt to control costs by offering managed care plans. Families of children with disabilities and their advocates argue that managed care plans are inadequate for onging, chronic health-related problems associated with disability and chronic illness. •Both school systems and Medicaid agencies have responsibility to provide services for children with disabilities. As school systems become increasingly strapped for funds to meet the entitlement requirements of Federal special education law, they have incentives to bill Medicaid for health related services; Federal Medicaid cost sharing is much higher than Federal special education funding. The implications of such billing practices on the lives of children and on Federal and state budgets need to be examined. In light of these trends and policy issues, the primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a clearer understanding of children's disability. Available data on persons with disabilities, particularly that found in national data sets, pertain primarily to adults. It is anticipated that this understanding will give policy makers information on which to base prudent statutory, regulatory, and funding decisions pertinent to current programs as well as regarding health care and welfare reform. Potential users of the research include Federal and State officials involved in disability, health care, income security, and educational policy, program development, program administration, and financing affecting children with disabilities. Additionally, research findings may be used by hospital and facility administrators, school administrators, service providers, home health agencies, rehabilitation agencies, and the insurance industry. Part II_Required Research Issue Areas Research conducted under grants awarded through this announcement will advance the state of knowledge regarding children with disabilities in the following issue areas: (A) Definitions and measurement; (B) demographic and socio-economic characteristics; (C) service use, expenditures, and effectiveness; (D) private cost of care; (E) financing of services and supports; and (F) system organization. However, these questions are intended merely as illustrations. Applicants may propose other questions related to the issue areas. These issue areas may be combined and other areas may be proposed if they are clearly demonstrated to be relevant to policies regarding children with disabilities. We encourage secondary data analysis. Given the dearth of national data, the applicant is encouraged to select information from states, school systems, clinical-level data, or other available data sets, which could contain the relevant analytic variables. Other methodologies may be appropriate. The following sections list the kinds of questions envisioned under each of the above issue areas.
