A responsible source at the Bahraini Ministry of Foreign Affairs has described this massacre as a terrorist act and held the Israeli Government and its security organs fully responsible for the terrorist acts these terrorist settlers carry out, which violate all international laws, norms, and charters and endanger the comprehensive, just, and lasting peace process in the region. The source called on the international community and the UN Security Council, particularly its permanent members, to fully assume their responsibilities toward this act by not just denouncing and condemning it but by taking measures to protect the Palestinian people and secure their legitimate right to the establishment of their independent state on their national soil.
