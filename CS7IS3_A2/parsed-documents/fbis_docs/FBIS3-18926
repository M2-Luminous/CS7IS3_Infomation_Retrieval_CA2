Kinkel regretted that the breakthrough "in the vexatious fishing issue" has failed because of Spain. It is not justified to speak of a crisis, even in view of the differences of opinion with Great Britain concerning the majorities in a 16-member EU. Kinkel appealed to the European Parliament in Strasbourg not to let the procedure for membership fail because of the pressure of time before the new elections. He is convinced that the negotiations with Norway will be concluded successfully.
