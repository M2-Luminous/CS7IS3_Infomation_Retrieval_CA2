Commenting on the treaty, signed in Moscow by Defense Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Geydar Aliyev said that "this document infringes upon Azerbaijan's interests, but we signed it for the sake of peaceful regulation of the conflict". Answering the question of the journalists about the perspectives of peaceful regulation of Armenian-Azeri conflict, Aliyev said "we adhere to the peaceful regulation, but the recent reports about the Armenian offensive on Tauzskiy region of Azerbaijan testify that Armenia is not ready for the peaceful regulation of the conflict". Aliyev also said that "in the light of the new Armenian attack upon the territory of Azerbaijan, the prospects of signing a long-termed peace agreement becomes hardly probable".
