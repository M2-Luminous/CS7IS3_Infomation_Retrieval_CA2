In a statement, the Mapagpalayang Kilusan ng mga Anak Bayan [Liberal Movement of Children of the Nation] (Makabayan) said that since they share the same views and principles espoused by the CPP's "breakaway" faction, they are probably guilty of the same "crime" Felimon Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, allegedly committed against Sison. Sison reportedly issued an order for Lagman's arrest and trial in a revolutionary people's court where evidence against him will be presented. Makabayan described Sison as a "madman from Utrecht" who is a "terminal case of revolutionary insanity." The group called on Joma to cease and desist from his "kind of deadly game." "You have lost your sense of principles and revolutionary morals... And you have lost and bungled the revolution you yourself started twenty-five years ago," Makabayan said. The Bukluran ng mga Manggagawa Para sa Pagbabago [Union of Workers for a Change] (BMP), meanwhile, criticized Sison for "dragging legitimate people organizations like the BMP and Sanlakas [Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan -- Foundation of Freedom and Democracy of the People]... into their planned bloody purges." The BMP defended Tony Cabardo whom they said "has done nothing but work for the success of people's struggles." Cabardo, the BMP said, worked for the P [pesos] 35 workers' wage campaign last year and the Kilusang [Movement] Rollback against oil price increase.
