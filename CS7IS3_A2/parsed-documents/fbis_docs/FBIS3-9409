It has been anticipated for a long time, and there is good reason for it. However, it will not be the arguments that will decide on this. This is how Defense Minister Janez Jansa assessed the rumors about an interpellation over the Smolnikar case. We can agree with everything except the minister's last statement. In an interview with our radio station he himself admitted that the preliminary results of the internal investigation have shown that some things are controversial, namely the justification of the use of force and incursion into a personal vehicle by camouflaged special brigade soldiers, and the time that elapsed between the detention of a civilian, his transportation to the ministry, and the police being informed. However, the essence of the problem lies elsewhere: in the army's interference in the civilian sphere and the understanding of a rule-of-law state, regardless of what the civilian in question might have done. This is another story to which there will be an epilogue, if the accusations are true. According to information so far, there is no justification for the behavior of the Interior Ministry members. The minister himself made the biggest mistake here because he did not take steps against his subordinates by at least temporarily suspending them until the completion of the inquiry, particularly since this was not the first excess of this type and it puts the entire army in a bad light. Had we lived in a normal country, he himself would have submitted his resignation and everybody would have viewed this as an honorable act. At the end of the day, the government might even have fallen because of Sunday's events. However, in the heated political atmosphere with political clashes and meetings constantly in the air, along with all sorts of mutual suspicions, imputations, and tactical games, one cannot hope for a rational approach. A normal political struggle has in Slovenia transformed itself into a battle for new and final victories. Everybody has now left the decision to the prime minister.
