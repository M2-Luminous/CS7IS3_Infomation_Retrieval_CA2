(Sumitomo Metal), has developed a boride-dispersed, titanium-based composite alloy with improvements of more than 30 percent over the previous values in both rigidity and fatigue strength. Sumitomo Metal was able to eradicate the weaknesses of titanium alloys, i.e., poor wear resistance and low rigidity, by adding approximately one percent boron. The new alloys can be mass-produced on the same vacuum-arc-resolution (VAR) method-based production line as before, and they can be sold at approximately the same price as that for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy, the most common titanium alloy. Sumitomo Metal has already begun sample shipment to some aircraft manufacturers. The company plans to continue application development for the new alloy with the emphasis on automotive and aircraft components. Titanium alloys, despite their high strength and corrosion resistance, have had limited applications because of their poor rigidity, roughly half that of steel. Sumitomo Metal did not use the typical, sintering method-based alloy production process to develop the new alloy, but rather used the grain dispersion composite alloy formation method, called the in-situ method, to melt, solidify and disperse titanium and Al-boron. Instead of using chrome and vanadium, which tended to decrease rigidity, aluminum and boron were used and crystallized on the alloy surface. Thus, microfine titanium boride single crystals were dispersed uniformly to show excellent conformity between grains and the matrix in the new alloy. The boron content of the new alloy was optimized at approximately one weight percent to maintain excellent ductility and machinability for the new alloy, because these properties declined when the boron content was higher. The newly developed high-rigidity alloy showed a Young's modulus value, an index for rigidity, of 15,000 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], which was 30 percent higher than 11,550 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the 6-aluminum-4-vanadium alloy. Moreover, the new alloy's fatigue strength was 63 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/], surpassing 45 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] for the previous material. Thus, the new alloy is suitable for use in components that require strength. Specific applications being considered for the new alloy include automotive components, including exhaust system parts, such as valves, crankshafts, connecting rods and piston wristpins. Sumitomo Metal is all set to distribute samples of the new alloy and is hoping for its early commercialization.
