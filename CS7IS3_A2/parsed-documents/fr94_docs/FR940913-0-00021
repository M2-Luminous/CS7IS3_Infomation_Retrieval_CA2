FR940913-0-00021 FR940913-0-00005 There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season, and there are about 1,200 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR ยง121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which include handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. The majority of olives are produced in central California. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is essentially a domestic market. A few shipments of California olives are exported. Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993&hyph;94 production totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited use olives are too small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives. However, they are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. Paragraph (a)(3) of ยง932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in ยง932.51(a)(3) and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in ยง932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended. The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94, the committee recommended sizes smaller than those previously authorized. The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965.
