ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Today's rule provides emission standards and test procedures for the certification of new natural gas-fueled, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty engines and vehicles, and motorcycles. The regulations are effective with the 1997 model year, although optional certification prior to the 1997 model year will be available. Today's rule also provides fuel economy test procedures and calculation equations for natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and trucks, effective upon publication, to allow these vehicles to be included in a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). Finally, today's rule provides procedures for the certification of aftermarket conversion equipment to allow a vehicle or engine to operate completely or in part on a fuel other than the fuel for which it was originally designed and manufactured. This action is being taken in order to remove the possibility that the absence of such standards could hinder the development of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as transportation fuels. These standards are intended to provide a comparable degree of environmental protection to that afforded by the standards applicable to gasoline, diesel and methanol vehicles, and to ensure that aftermarket conversions do not degrade the emissions performance of the vehicles or engines being converted. DATES: Except as specified elsewhere in this DATES section, this final rule is effective September 21, 1994. The effective date of §§80.32, 80.33, 86.001&hyph;9(d)(1)(iv), 86.001&hyph;28(h), 86.004&hyph;9(d)(1)(iv), 86.004&hyph;28(h), 86.098&hyph;8(d)(1)(iv), 86.098&hyph;28(h), 86.099&hyph;8(d)(1)(iv), 86.150&hyph;98(d) and 86.157&hyph;98 is November 21, 1994, unless notice is received by October 21, 1994 that interested parties wish to submit adverse or critical comments on these sections. If the effective date is changed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 21, 1994, except as specified elsewhere in this DATES section. 40 CFR 85.503, 85.505, 86.542&hyph;90, 86.094&hyph;23, 86.095&hyph;24, 86.095&hyph;35, 86.1242&hyph;90, 86.098&hyph;28, 86.113&hyph;94, 86.1344&hyph;94, 86.142&hyph;90, 86.150&hyph;98, 86.513&hyph;94 and 600.113&hyph;93 are not effective until the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in them. A document will be published in the Federal Register when OMB has approved the information collection requirements. ADDRESSES: Written comments on those sections effective November 21, 1994 should be submitted both to the contact person for this rule (see For Further Information Contact ) and to the docket for this rulemaking at the following address.
