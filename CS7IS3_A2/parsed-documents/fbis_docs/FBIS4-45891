In an interview with ITAR--TASS, Leon Akopov, chairman of the council that represents Moscow's emergency medical technicians, stated that "the strike committee is not going to back down on its demands". He was alluding to the Main Medical Authority's plans to reorganize ambulance services and place them under a different authority. As before, ambulance service management and the Main Medical Authority are not acknowledging the striker's demands and are preparing to take disciplinary action. According to a report issued by the council, four of the striking sub-stations sent a letter today to the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, demanding that the reorganization process be stopped and that the mayor personally assume supervision of ambulance services.
