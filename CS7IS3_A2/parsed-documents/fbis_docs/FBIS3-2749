Supported by all kinds of factors, hardliners are gaining the upper hand and will, under the precondition of "stability" overwhelming everything, take a strong attitude on the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues and toward the United States. This informed source revealed that "some people in Zhongnanhai do not sleep well every day" and that all kinds of contradictions are causing a change in policy. A week ago, Wei Jingsheng told a friend that the CPC's policy on political dissidents will not change, nor would the human rights record change much. This high-level CPC official also revealed that the CPC's attitude toward "Wei Jingsheng and the like" has not changed and that it will continue to release political dissidents who "have given a good account of themselves." What has caused the CPC to change its plan and strategy in a week? The United States has always regarded the treatment meted out to pro-democracy activists, including Wei Jingsheng, Wang Juntao, Chen Ziming, and Wang Dan as a criterion to appraise the CPC's human rights record. Has the high-level CPC leadership suddenly "become ferocious" regardless of the connection between Chinese-U.S. political and economic relations on the one hand and U.S. concern for Wei Jingsheng et al and the treatment of political dissidents on the other? Is the CPC ready to take a hard-line policy? Has it worked out a complete plan to resist U.S. pressure? The high-level CPC official revealed that a silent two-line struggle is taking place for top-level power and that the participation of the gerontocrats has made this struggle for power and the two lines and policies even more complicated. He pointed out: No conclusion can be made now and no one has won or lost the struggle; as this struggle involves a wide range of aspects, it is very difficult to say whether or not there will be personnel changes or whether or not someone "will be hit by an arrow and fall off his horse?" The hardliners have gained the upper hand in counterattacking U.S. human rights pressure. This could possibly involve China's foreign policy. On whether or not local officials, who maintain delicate relations with the central authorities, are involved in this two- line struggle, the high-level CPC official said that most local leaders with real power are taking a "wait-and-see" attitude until the "situation is clear." Viewing the CPC's strong attitude on the Hong Kong issue, its leap in economic reform, its liveliness in diplomatic relations, its response to U.S. human rights policy, as well as economic and trade pressure, and its way of handling inflation and social problems, we can explicitly see the change from "fluctuation" to "aggravation" in the high-level CPC two-line struggle. The CPC official indicated that this struggle started at the beginning of this year and became more intense after Lunar New Year. Surrounded by pressures from all sides, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is seeking more cooperation and support. On the other hand, the conservative forces' activities are also noteworthy. As learned, apart from using "strong words" in finally revising the section on the Hong Kong issue in the government work report to the upcoming National People's Congress, the section on diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan will also be strongly worded. This informed source in Beijing said that Deng Xiaoping's health will have a major impact on this struggle. After a video showing of Deng Xiaoping's public appearance, conservatives were overjoyed and became active in engaging in foreign economic and trade relations. The change in policy toward Wei Jingsheng et al is an advance indication of the adoption of a hard-line attitude. Some people believe that Deng Xiaoping's condition is worse than thought, while Chen Yun's condition is much better. No one knows who will win in this power struggle. This high-level CPC official said that "some people in the Central Committee are really worried about Deng Xiaoping's health. Deng Xiaoping's condition is worse than last year." There is a close connection between Chinese-U.S. relations and Wei Jingsheng et al's behavior as well as political dissidents' contacts with organizations outside China, this CPC official indicated. The CPC will not allow these people to form organizations or undermine social "stability," still less will it allow them to collaborate with hostile forces outside the borders. Of course, it will not allow these people to harm "state interests." Under this hard-line policy, even if Christopher arrives with strong human rights pressure, the CPC will not yield to this pressure; it will only make concessions on the Korean peninsula issue, nuclear arms control, and some economic and trade restrictions unless "there is a major internal change." And this depends on these two weeks. A Western observer said that the feeling in Beijing in March this year is similar to that in the spring of 1989. The people's resentment against speculating officials, bribery, and corruption is high, commodity price hikes are out of control, inflation is serious, the peasant issue is worsening, the gap between rich and poor is widening, and there are more problems in state-owned enterprise reform and the worker issue--all these are pummeling Beijing. Whenever the CPC faces internal pressures, it generally assumes a posture of being strong on foreign policy, carrying out retrenchment in the economy, and becoming conservative in politics. The Wei Jingsheng case is the prelude to a big case. The high-level CPC official said that the upcoming sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference could possibly reflect many problems, such as the Hong Kong issue, attitudes toward the United States, the agricultural question, the relationship between the central and local authorities, imbalanced development, and setbacks in five reforms; but these are not the focal points facing the high-level CPC leadership, the focal point lies in Zhongnanhai.
