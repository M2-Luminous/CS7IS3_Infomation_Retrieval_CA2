The Chairman of the Russian State Duma Believes: `Black October' Must Not Happen Again. Ivan Petrovich Does Not Intend Quarrelling with Boris Nikolayevich and Hopes for Reciprocity"] [Text] Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Russian State Duma, is inaccessible to the majority of journalists for the simple reason that they are not allowed into the hall of sessions, so it is very fortunate that he is my neighbor -- the windows of our buildings face one another. It seemed to me that this was reason enough to meet one evening, have a drink, and have a neighborly chat. Especially since Ivan Petrovich did not object but only asked that we restrict ourselves to tea. Therefore, when I went to visit him at his home I did not take any champagne with me but took instead a jar of cherry jam. The State Duma speaker met me in the entrance hall and appropriately enough was wearing carpet slippers. When he had brewed some strong, aromatic tea himself (it was late and his domestics were already in bed) and poured some jam into the dishes, I made the somewhat unfortunate gaff of saying rather inopportunely that the last time I had met with a speaker was also at night -- in the White House at the end of September. Generally speaking we have not had much luck with speakers.... [Rybkin] Indeed, neither Lukyanov nor Khasbulatov had an enviable fate. But as for my fears about my own future and drawing parallels with my predecessors.... I can say only one thing: In those parts where I was born -- the Khoper region -- they respect somewhat different qualities in people. Consequently, when sitting in the chair of the leader of the State Duma, I do not feel timid and certainly have no fears for my career. [Gamov] Ivan Petrovich, is it true that the Duma members intend creating a special deputies' commission to investigate the events of September and October? [Rybkin] Let us not dodge the issue here -- clearly some deputies do have that intention and with good reason. It was Talleyrand who said: "In a revolution no one is innocent. Everyone is guilty!" If it were up to me alone I would grant an amnesty to the participants in the events of August 1991 and September-October 1993. With the exception of those who committed flagrant crimes. That would be a necessary prerequisite for civil peace and accord, things which are very necessary to Russia now. Society suffered a very serious blow after the October events, and so did parliamentarianism. In these conditions the State Duma and the Federation Council simply must cooperate as closely as possible with both the president and the government. I personally am firmly in favor of that. After all, we were elected not for our own sakes or for some ambitions that we may have but so as to establish stability, calm, and order in the country at last. [Gamov] But how do you intend forming relations with the upper chamber? People are already describing the State Duma and the Federation Council as polar opposites.... [Rybkin] As of the present moment -- Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko and I have already spoken about this -- there are no insuperable obstacles between the State Duma and the Federation Council. In both chambers there are people from the same places with similar habits and outlooks. Their views, opinions, and convictions easily coincide with one another and I hope that they will adapt just as easily to the kind of professional draft laws that Russia urgently needs today. Shumeyko and I also discussed the possibility of close cooperation between deputies from the two chambers on questions affecting the set of draft laws on the economy. Today the legislative base is lagging behind events in the economy. For a very long time we criticized industrialists for the fact that they forgot which words are associated with the noun "industry" -- earning a living, perhaps? Now they understand those words -- but in what sense? Billions of dollars are still flowing out of the country. Some people suggest resorting to tough administrative measures to prevent that. But I think that first of all we must give our industrialists an economic incentive to keep their money in Russia so that it can work for the good of the country. Although in those places where there is flagrant theft going it is necessary to use authority, of course. Generally speaking I support a strong authority in Russia. But in my view that can only be achieved when all the branches of power are working in conditions of mutual support. Even those who consider themselves political opponents cannot live without each other today. The time for a Russian version of the Moncloa pact -- the pact which once dragged Spain out of the most dire crisis and transformed it into a prosperous country -- passed long ago. In Volgograd we once managed to work out that kind of agreement. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about that, by the way -- that pact of local significance is still operating there today. But it was difficult to do that on a Russia-wide scale -- the ability and desire were lacking. But I believe that all is not yet lost. There is a simple piece of what I would call peasant philosophy which I find encouraging. It runs like this: Where there is harmony there is prosperity, too. I know that the overwhelming majority of members of the State Duma and the Federation Council feel the same way. [Gamov] Listening to you talk it sounds as though the speaker's chair is the domain not of higher education professors but of peasants from the land.... [Rybkin] It is best to ask Khasbulatov himself why things did not work out for him in parliament. Especially since I do not want to portray myself as a simple peasant. Our present parliamentarians and leaders of the State Duma and Federal Assembly have experienced something which neither the deputies of the former parliament nor its speaker had experience of -- I mean "Black October." I believe that it was a painful experience for the president and the government, too. The events which unfolded last fall are a grave warning to us all. If we draw the correct conclusions from all that happened we will of course benefit greatly. We are simply fated to achieve accord! [Gamov] You know, Ivan Petrovich, that I have attended sessions of the Duma, I compared it with the previous Supreme Soviet and it seemed to me that elements of buffoonery are appearing in the Russian parliamentary system... [Rybkin] That also worries and alarms me. But in the present situation this is inevitable. Deputies are seeking to make a statement about themselves, they are anxious and that is why there is a somewhat tense atmosphere and a certain eccentricity here.... But do not forget that in the old Supreme Soviet there were 252 people working with 126 people holding sessions in each of the chambers, whereas now there are 450 deputies. By the old standards that is a whole congress! And trying to make this mechanism work efficiently and smoothly from the very outset is very difficult. Incidentally, I would like to make use of this occasion to tell the representatives of the Russian and foreign mass media not to take offense at us. We are not allowing Duma sessions to be filmed at present and certainly not to be broadcast live because we have the usual routine work to get through, the running-in period, as it were. This is hardly of interest to the outside observer. But I hope that this will not take long. The factions and committees are beginning work.... [Gamov] But what then? [Rybkin] Our program of legislative activity is very extensive. The Russian President's Legislative Proposals Commission and our deputies' commissions have worked hard to draw it up and many Duma members came to Moscow with a whole set of drafts and proposals. All these things are being processed and considered. Incidentally, I would like to warn people that it is certainly not the frenzied activity of sessions in the Duma that will decide the fate of draft laws. Factions and committees are the main structural units of lawmaking, this is where we intend to do the main "fine-tuning" work on documents. In this regard our fundamental premise is that the factions express the intentions of certain groups of voters and the ideas of coordinating the interests of all strata of the population will be implemented through them. But the Duma will have to meet in session four to five hours a couple of times a week to adopt the final decisions. If you look at it closely you will see that we do not have all that much time. [Gamov] Indeed.... [Rybkin] The first month of our term as deputies is already over, if you discount the three months spent on the new election campaign at the end of the term that leaves us with 12 months. Our task is to make the maximum use of that time so as to highlight those top-quality draft laws which relate first and foremost to the development of the economy. We must restore its manageability as soon as possible and at the very least neutralize the worst consequences of the crisis. [Gamov] Do you also intend trying to influence the president and the government as the Supreme Soviet tried to do? [Rybkin] The situation in society is difficult, there is a major social differentiation in progress: People have divided into the very rich and the very poor, one-half of the country's population is below the poverty line and around 10 percent are in desperate conditions. The president is right when he says that it was dire necessity above all which brought people out into the streets in the fall. We must remember that. Taking all this into account, of course, we intend to influence the formation of the government, its line of conduct, and the process of implementing the economic program -- but within the framework of the Constitution, nowhere else. I believe that far more significant influence can be achieved through mutual understanding. After all, if people insult one another and order each other about there will be no progress. The most important thing is not to cross the line where opposition turns into enmity and opponents into enemies, when people forget the reason why they began the argument in the first place. That is the most dangerous thing.
