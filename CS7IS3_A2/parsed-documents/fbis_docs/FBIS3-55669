"Our (the Coalition Party's -- BNS) position is that the head of government is failing to cope with his tasks," Vahi said. Vahi, the predecessor of Mart Laar in the prime minister's office, said his party would be ready for cooperation if the opportunity came up to appoint a new prime minister candidate. Vahi said there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia, as the constitution gives the president the right to sack ministers and approve new ministers into office. "How the authors of the constitution meant it, is quite another thing," Vahi said. But the Coalition Party leader also added he had been somewhat bewildered by the president's decision not to relieve the economics minister of office. "In my personal opinion, this can be interpreted as the president's wish to shape the setup of Mart Laar's Cabinet," he said. Vahi added that the interior political crisis emerged in Estonia had to be resolved by intensive negotiations between the prime minister and the president.
