His elder brother Vojin Vuckovic (age 31), better known by his nickname Zuca, commander of the Yellow Ants, is charged with unauthorized possession of a sizable quantity of weapons and has been released on bail pending trial. All the details in the indictment have not yet been made public, but it is known that during the investigation the brothers were suspected of having released bloodthirsty pit bull terriers to attack imprisoned civilians and of organizing nighttime duels, that is, compelled the Muslims to fight each other to the death with knives. The winner was promised freedom. It is not known whether the investigation was able to support those suspicions with evidence or witness testimony. Branko Njegovan, district public prosecutor, says that on 27 or 28 June 1992 Dusan Vuckovic cut off the ear of a prisoner in the culture center in the village of Celopek, where inhabitants of the village Divic had been imprisoned. (This was a commonplace gesture in units made up of convicts released from prison to fight on battlefields in Bosnia. They would prove their accomplishment in ethnic cleansing with the ears they had cut off, and this was closely bound up with reduction of their sentences.) Then he fired an entire burst (of 30 rounds) from a Kalashnikov into civilians. Dusan Vuckovic has reportedly confessed to having killed seven people. In a trial of volunteers from some paramilitary unit (which one has not been announced) the other day in the same court, Andjelko Trninic (age 27), a machine technician from Klupci near Loznica, and his contemporary Dragomir Zekic, an electrician from the vicinity of Zvornik, the prosecutor says, murdered Milenko Vidovic, a physician from Mali Zvornik, in a perfidious way on 16 July 1992. What is special about that crime is the motive and the manner in which it was committed. Arrested exactly a year ago, during the entire time of criminal proceedings and the trial Andjelko Trninic was categorical: "I cut the doctor's throat on patriotic grounds." Trninic actually is not defending himself, he is not contrite. He speaks of the crime as though he expects recognition for patriotic service. Andjelko Trninic's explanation delivered to the court is interesting: "We heard that Dr. Vidovic was smuggling drugs and medical supplies, and so Zekic and I went to check it out. When we had drunk the drink the doctor offered, I pulled out a pistol and ordered him to show us everything that he had there in the house. There was a sizable quantity of drugs piled on the sofa, shelves, and in bureaus. The doctor's justification was that the drugs were needed for the patients he treats privately. It was clear to me that Vidovic was a traitor to the Serbian people," Trninic concluded. Dragomir Zekic described the act of execution in more detail: "Trninic then went into the bathroom with Vidovic, and on the basis of what I heard, I concluded that they were still talking about the drugs. Some 10 minutes later he asked me to bring him the knife from the kitchen. I thought he needed it to open some box or to frighten Vidovic. Then Trninic ordered the doctor to kneel down beside the bathtub...." They put Milenko Vidovic with his throat slit into the bathtub and took an automatic rifle and pistol from the apartment. Trninic says that he received the order to execute the doctor from his command, which was stationed at that time in Zvornik. Expert witnesses concluded that Andjelko Trninic was at the time he committed [text missing from original]. From White to Yellow All the things that happened along the left bank of the Drina beginning in early spring 1992 have largely remained unknown to the public. In Mali Zvornik, the very first glance made it clear at that time that something strange was happening in Zvornik; on the Serbian side, the bridges were blocked with sandbags, on which were machine guns with loaded belts, aimed at the other bank of the Drina, where a big sign said "Srpska republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina" to mark the border. In addition to the weapons, uniformed police, members of the military police, men in camouflage uniforms without insignia, and several civilians whom all addressed with deference (the republic MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs]) were also keeping a close eye on what happened on the other side. "You do not know, my friend, what kind of riffraff had collected in Zvornik. Offspring of an evil father and a mother who was worse. Better not to go there unless you had to," suggested the border guards on the bridge whom we mentioned, also remarking that "twice the looters from Zvornik have attacked the bridge with weapons in an attempt to carry away booty and arms into Serbia." Zvornik was at that time crowded with various armed groupings: the White Eagles, the Dragon's People (they referred to their leader as the Dragon), the Yellow Ants, the Yellow Jackets, Cele's Volunteers, Peja's Guards, unidentified little groups that called themselves "special units," various detachments for special purposes.... They all looked askance at one another with weapons in their hands and a bullet in the chamber. "A quiet war is being waged here for power, and the situation is very tense," explained the Zvornik TO [Territorial Defense] commander, who introduced himself as Marko, although the chiefs of certain units close to the authorities in Belgrade said that this was a certain Branko Popovic, Mihalj Kertes' man, who had done a great deal in bringing down the advocates of autonomy in Vojvodina. From what Marko said, as soon as an armed group would burst into the city, it would immediately try to take power, that is, to disarm Marko and the TO forces, and then to confront the menacing rival armed groups which were also laying claim to power, and the attempt would fail. Marko was surviving as commander without any authority or the strength to restore order. A few km from Zvornik, in a restaurant named "The Four Teats" (owned by two sisters), the leader of one of the most numerous groups (it is not wise to mention the names even today) openly said that he had come to Zvornik as a Serbian patriot above political parties to use his men to purge the Serbian land of Muslims, justifying the necessity for ethnic cleansing with the words of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, that "the Serbs no longer have any reason whatsoever to beg the Muslims to live together in the same state." Judging, however, by the great number of gold chains around his neck, mostly women's, and the rings on his fingers, one got the impression that for the members of the paramilitary units killing Muslims was only a cover for looting. "Tonight, we did our work in the nearby Muslim village with cold steel, we did not fire a round," the volunteers would relate in the restaurant, slapping the knives decorated with cockades that hung from their belts. Psychiatrists would have said of many of them that they are personally unhappy and mentally poisoned and corrupted people who are able to nurture this kind of aggressiveness thanks to a corrupted environment. The Ants of Zuca (Vojin Vuckovic) were spoken of in eastern Bosnia as one of the most cruel units. "They left nothing alive behind," members of other quite similar paramilitary units would remark respectfully. The other day, there was a newspaper article (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 13 May) that said that "the Yellow Ants have done much evil in Bosnia, and in early August 1992 the special forces from Pale managed to disarm and arrest them." This is what kids would call baloney. The allegedly arrested Ants were even shown on TV. However, that same evening the arrestees and the special forces celebrated their successful farce in the restaurant near Zvornik we have mentioned; its purpose was obviously to deceive the public. It was supposed to be interpreted in terms of the law-governed state in Pale effectively removing the criminals and looters from its territory. Torching of Villages Up to the end of August 1992 there were so many problematical people armed to the teeth in Zvornik and environs that there was no force to disarm them and drive them out of a city overwhelmed by lawlessness. Anyone could do what he wanted to, loot or kill, without fear of being subject to criminal prosecution or pursuit of any kind, in spite of the assertion of the TO commander that "all the institutions of the temporary government, such as the prosecutor's office and the court, were in operation," which was absurd anyway because no one even dared to look crossways at the members of the "liberation units." The desire to drive the bands out of Zvornik remained in the domain of wishes. "We have problems with several armed groups," newsmen were told at the time by Marko, "but we do not know to whom they belong. We have contacted Bogdanovic (Serbian minister of police at that time) and Seselj. They answered that they could not help, because those groups had gotten away from them. Today, for example, Azdaja and his people burst into the offices of the TO and threatened to kill us at gunpoint if we continued to insist that the paramilitary forces leave the city." The commander of the most numerous group, who always appeared accompanied by two glum TO soldiers, had an explanation as to why there was a conflict with members of the TO. "It seems that Mr. Marko sent the military police to disarm the volunteers. But because the volunteers are better fighters, they disarmed the police. We can expect all this to work out when the gentleman politicians finally realize that war is not waged in armchairs, but with a gun in your hand. I think that this new communist movement is behind these splits," the commander said. It can hardly be said that those "robber bands," as the police in Mali Zvornik refer to them, were waging war in eastern Bosnia. This was actually heedless murdering and looting. On 10 May 1992, Muslim houses burned in Skelani and in the nearby villages Mihaljevici, Redzici, Lonjin, Krasanpolje, Rzine, Dzafici, Osamsko.... "I wanted to see it burn. The owner and his family had fled, because this restaurant was a meeting place of the Green Berets under command of Ahmet Tihic," said a TO member with glowing eyes who poured gasoline on Bekim Fehic's restaurant at the entrance to Skelani. A bulldozer then razed the torched Muslim houses. The explanation for the burnings, except for the desire we have mentioned, was rather unconvincing. Allegedly, the Muslims never returned to the burned-out ruins of their houses. "Never before have there been so many vultures circling in the sky along the course of the Drina," observed local people in the Serbian villages on the right bank of the river. They stood and watched the torched Muslim houses burning on the other side of the river, accompanied by the sporadic fire of automatic rifles. It was clear to everyone that ethnic cleansing was taking place. "Evil will come from all this. One day the Muslims will return and take revenge," an old man expressed his suspicion out loud, while the others kept silent. No one was gladdened by the burning of the houses of those who had been neighbors until the day before. The old man's prediction came true after a few months: The Muslims returned to some mixed and Serbian villages and took revenge in kind. They torched the Serbian houses and murdered the Serbian inhabitants. Even by that time there were hardly any volunteers from Serbia in eastern Bosnia. Most of them had fled to Serbia, carrying away the booty they had looted and their weapons. The Sanctions, and so Forth The outcome of the trial of Dusan Vuckovic, the first Serb accused of war crimes, is uncertain, and at this point it is difficult to judge whether criminal prosecution of criminals will ensue on a larger scale. Especially because the international court for war crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia will not recognize the decisions of the national courts. As Antonio Cassese, presiding judge of the international court, said in the most recent May issue of the Italian magazine COOPERATIONE, "a number of effective measures to deter them from that kind of behavior has been envisaged against those countries which refuse to extradite suspected war criminals and thereby withhold cooperation from the court. One such measure might be imposing sanctions of the Security Council." Because we are already under sanctions, there seems nothing for us to do but to see what those "other measures" are.
