FR941005-1-00005 FR941005-1-00002 The petitioner notes that current NRC requirements contained in 10 CFR 2.804 through 10 CFR 2.807 establish a procedure for the publication of proposed changes, participation by interested persons, and notification of changes, and believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures is specified for Agreement States in 10 CFR 150.31. The petitioner claims that the current rulemaking and notification procedure contained in 10 CFR 150.31 fails to provide a mechanism for persons located outside of any particular Agreement State to learn about proposed changes in that State's regulations. The petitioner believes that the legislative intent of 10 CFR 150.31 is to provide a mechanism for interested persons to participate in the rulemaking process. However, the petitioner claims that because there is no current notification procedure required for Agreement States, the petitioner and other persons do not have ample opportunity to participate in discussion of proposed rules. The petitioner states that under both its specific license for device distribution issued by the Agreement State of California and the general license issued by other Agreement States, it is required to provide generally licensed device recipients with a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner also indicates that although it makes a substantial effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC and Agreement State regulations, it is not always notified of actual changes that may directly affect it and its customers in Agreement States. The petitioner believes that the proposed amendments to 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 would alert NRC and Agreement State licensees to all relevant Agreement State requirements and permit them to more fully participate in the rulemaking process. The NRC is soliciting public comment on the petition for rulemaking submitted by Measurex Corporation that requests the changes to the regulations in 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 as discussed below. The Petitioner The petitioner is a manufacturer, distributor, and supplier of service for process control sensors used by NRC licensees throughout the United States. The petitioner states that it and its customers are directly affected by regulations adopted by the NRC and Agreement States. The petitioner also states that both its specific license for device distribution issued by California, an Agreement State, and other Agreement State licenses require it to provide generally licensed recipients a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. For these reasons, the petitioner claims that it makes a considerable effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC and Agreement State regulations. The petitioner indicates that it is submitting this petition for rulemaking to amend 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 because it believes that the current regulations completely fail to provide a mechanism for persons located outside any particular Agreement State to learn about proposed and completed changes to that State's regulations. The petitioner believes that because there is no adequate mechanism to keep NRC licensees aware of current Agreement State regulations, it is unable to fully participate in discussion of proposed rules and is often unaware of actual regulatory changes that directly affect it and its customers in Agreement States. Discussion of the Petition The petitioner has submitted this petition for rulemaking because it believes that it is adversely affected by the current regulations that do not provide an adequate mechanism for NRC licensees to learn about proposed and adopted changes in applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner states that although the current NRC regulations in 10 CFR 2.804 through 2.807 establish a procedure for the notification and publication of regulatory changes and participation by interested persons, it believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures is specified for Agreement States in 10 CFR 150.31.
