FR940712-1-00053 FR940712-1-00012 Four, mountaintops generally are intensively developed and often command premium rental payments when compared to single use sites. The multiple user sites provide a mixture of high and low power communication uses, including radio, television, and mobile radio and cellular. These sites often include large buildings, a variety of towers, and well maintained public or private roads. Five, various nonbroadcast uses are not dependent upon the population served. These uses include microwave, cellular, and mobile radio facilities in rural areas. Rental payments for these uses are related to general real estate values in the immediate area of the site. Six, there is little difference in the rental payment for single use sites in small rural markets. Often rent paid in the private rural market does not vary significantly among the various communication uses. This is due to local economic conditions and forces within the market to provide a basic level of communication service. In developing the schedule, consideration was given to current assessed rent. Since current BLM rentals are based on individual appraisals, rental payments established in the last 5 years were considered to reflect fair market value. This information was used as a benchmark for assessing reasonableness and providing a measure of consistency in areas where there was little direct market information. Industry groups have objected to use of market information for setting rental payments on public lands. They argue that the rights authorized under terms of a BLM or FS grant are different than those provided under a private lease, and that private landowners provide more service and do not require compliance with stringent environmental requirements. They also argue that television and radio broadcasters provide a public service and, therefore, that rental payments should be partially or totally waived. The few cases in which there has been competitive bidding for communication uses on Federal or State lands do not support these contentions. Practical considerations also contributed to development of a rental schedule. The FS has been engaged in a 10-year effort, which BLM joined in 1990, to determine fair market rent for communication site uses. In addition, both the BLM and the FS have supported the use of a regulatory schedule to reduce the costs and delays associated with obtaining individual appraisals. It is estimated that the annual costs of updating and appraising BLM right-of-way grants for communication use would be $3&hyph;4 million. This is approximately double the current annual revenues from communication site rights-of-way. Use of a schedule would be more cost effective. Rents charged in the private market are not based upon schedules. Instead, rents are based upon negotiations between the landowner and the prospective user. The rent is set on a individual basis, depending on the use and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement. To the extent practicable, the schedules proposed attempt to approximate a reasonable rent for the authorized use. They do not attempt to replicate site-specific appraisal values. Instead, the schedule merely establishes a reasonable amount of rent to be assessed for the type of authorized use based on location or population criteria. Therefore, the BLM believes the proposed rental schedule reflects fair market value. Bureau of Land Management Communication Use Program The BLM currently administers approximately 3,200 communication use authorizations. In accordance with agency regulations, approximately 50 percent of the authorizations pay no rent. Right-of-way holders not required to pay annual rent include Federal, State, and local government agencies. The remaining communication use right-of-way holders pay an annual rental based upon agency-approved appraisals. Generally, communication use authorizations are reappraised every 5 years and new rental payments are established. However, for a variety of reasons, most of the communication use rental fees are currently out of date. Section 2803.1&hyph;2(c)(3)(i) of 43 CFR states that the rental shall be based on either a market survey of comparable rentals, or on a value determination for specific parcels or groups of parcels. Most communication use rental fees are based upon individual appraisals prepared by agency staff appraisers. Some BLM State Offices have instituted market surveys or administrative schedules for setting rental payments. Current regulations also allow use of competitive bidding for purposes of determining rental for the use of public lands. Bids less than fair market rental value of the lands are not considered.
