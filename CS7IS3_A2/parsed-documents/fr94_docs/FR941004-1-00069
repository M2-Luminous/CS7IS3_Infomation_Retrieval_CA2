ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Administration for Children and Families is proposing to amend existing regulations pertaining to child and family services to implement a new services program, ``Family Preservation and Support Services,'' subpart 2 of title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act. This new subpart aims to promote family strength and stability, enhance parental functioning, and protect children through funding a capped entitlement for States and eligible Indian tribes to develop, establish, expand, and operate family preservation services and community-based family support services, which the law defines broadly. To receive funding in FY 1995, States and eligible Indian tribes are required to submit a five-year plan, which must be developed jointly by the State or Indian tribe and ACF after broad consultation with appropriate public and nonprofit private agencies and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs of services for children and families, including family support and preservation services. The plan may be submitted at any time after completion of the planning processes but no later than June 30, 1995. In order to reduce administrative burden and emphasize the potential for a more comprehensive effective child and family services system, the regulations propose to consolidate this plan with similar plan requirements under title IV-B, subpart 1, ``Child Welfare Services.'' In addition, we propose to require that the plan include information on three closely related child and family services programs: the Independent Living Program under Section 477 of the Social Security Act; and two State formula grants under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act: Part I, Basic State grants and Part II, Medical Neglect/Disabled Infants State grants. DATES: In order to be considered, comments on this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking must be received on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please address comments to Commissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, P.O. Box 1182, Washington, DC, 20013, Attention: Dan Lewis. ACF will not accept comments by FAX. It would be helpful if agencies and organizations submitted copies in duplicate. Two weeks after the close of the comment period, all comments and letters will be available for public inspection in Room 2070, 330 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20201, Monday through Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
