FR940926-2-00081 FR940926-2-00070 OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations AGENCY: Office of Management and Budget. ACTION: Proposed Revision to OMB Circular A&hyph;122. SUMMARY: This Notice is a corrected version of the Notice previously printed on September 16, 1994 (59 FR 47657). This corrected version contains additional text under ``Supplementary Information.'' This Notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on a proposed revision to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The revision will allow Federal agencies to reimburse non-profit organizations for interest on debt used to finance the purchase of buildings and equipment, when purchasing using debt financing is less costly than leasing. DATES: All comments on this proposal should be in writing and must be received by November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Financial Management, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Room 6025, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Telephone (202) 395&hyph;3993, Facsimile (202) 395&hyph;3952. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Hoogeveen, Financial Standards and Reporting Branch, Office of Federal Financial Management. Telephone (202) 395&hyph;3993. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this revision is to: (1) Encourage non-profit organizations to acquire building space and equipment necessary for administering Federal programs at the lowest possible cost to the Federal Government, and (2) bring greater consistency to Federal policies covering the allowability of interest by organizations receiving Federal awards. As the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated in 1980, it had been ``a longstanding policy not to recognize interest as a cost'' (45 FR 46022, 46023, July 8, 1980). Accordingly, the OMB circulars setting forth the cost principles for State and local governments, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations did not originally allow interest as an expense. Over time, however, OMB has gradually expanded the allowability of interest. The first change was made with respect to State and local governments. In 1980, Circular 74&hyph;4, ``Cost Principles for Grants to States and Local Governments,'' was revised to allow interest on buildings, but not on equipment (45 FR 27363, April 22, 1980). This policy was retained when Circular 74&hyph;4 was reissued the following year as revised OMB Circular A&hyph;87 (46 FR 9548, January 28, 1981).
