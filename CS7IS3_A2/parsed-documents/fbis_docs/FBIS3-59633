But this in a way that is noticeably friendlier to the environment than that to which we are currently accustomed, with less discharge of noxious emissions and dust, better quality, and more recycling of residues. Right next to the Maas Power Plant, a large conventional coal-burning plant for generating electricity that is scheduled to be shut down in 2000, the Cooperating Electricity Production Enterprises (SEP) have built a demonstration plant that is to gasify coal based on a process developed by Shell. This new power plant, with a capacity of 253 megawatts of electricity (MWe), is currently the largest of its kind in the world. The system must prove itself during a three-year demonstration phase. If successful, a big brother of "Buggenum" will be built in Borsele, Zeeland, with a capacity of 600 megawatts. The part of the Limburg installation that generates electricity is already operating on natural gas as an element of the startup program, and is providing 100 megawatts of electricity to the public network. In a few weeks the colossal coal gasifier will also be started up, says Eng. G.D. Zon, the project director of Demkolec, a subsidiary of the SEP set up specifically for the new project. After that, the capacity will be gradually increased to the maximum. Ultimately the power plant will process 2,000 metric tons of coal a day. According to Zon, the electricity that his installation will then deliver is still about 20 percent more expensive than that coming from a 600-megawatt powdered coal plant, but "Buggenum" is intended to be a model for the large-scale application of coal gasification. "At a capacity of 600 megawatts with high efficiency, the production price is competitive. But we are primarily interested in the environmental advantages. If all this succeeds, and you put price tags on all the aspects, then I think that a coal gasifier will end up being cheaper." Coal gasification is not a new technology, as many Limburgers in particular know, because right in front of city hall in Maastricht stands a statue of Father Prof. Pieter Johan Minckelers, who discovered 210 years ago that heating pit coal in an old barrel releases gas that is well-suited to launching hot-air balloons and to lighting and heating. Since the beginning of this century, the system has been applied by municipalities on a large scale for the production for city gas, but in the 1960's it was supplanted by cheaper and much cleaner natural gas. For decades, industry has used the cheap gas obtained from the production of coke, and during World War II the Germans made synthetic gasoline from coal gas. Beginning in 1935, tests were also conducted with the underground gasification of pit coal, but this has yet to yield commercial success. Coal gas as a fuel for generating electricity is indeed new. In the late 1980's, Shell emerged as the winner of a bitter struggle with competitors Texaco and British Gas Lurgi and was able to provide the SEP with its technology, which came from the technique that the company uses for oil gasification. All the oil companies threw themselves into gasification technology during the 1970's, says Eng. Zon. "After the first oil crisis, they expected a shortage and a sharp price increase for oil and natural gas. Because of that, the raw materials for the petrochemical industry would also become much more expensive, and so an alternative was sought. Synthesis gas, which is created from coal gasification, is also suitable as feedstock for the chemicals industry. That is why you now see all the oil companies following this route. They have invested a great deal of money in it. Coal gasification also generates hydrogen, and the petrochemical industry always needs that. And it is easy to combine the carbon in the gas with the hydrogen to create substances that you need in the chemicals industry." Modern natural gas-fired electric power plants can easily achieve efficiency of more than 50 percent or even a little higher. The test installation in Buggenum achieves 43 percent, because of the applied technique. "Just look at our STEG unit (steam and gas are both fed into turbines and the power is converted into electricity via a generator) and then we will achieve more than 50 percent," says Zon. "Then you have to consider that we produce our own gas, while a natural gas plant has its fuel delivered ready to use. But for this sort of power plant there is an entire battery of equipment that treats the gas and keeps it under pressure." According to the director of Demkolec, a 600-megawatt coal gasification plant should be able to achieve efficiency of 47 percent, and theoretically even 50 percent. But Zon is no fetishist; he points out that the most modern powdered coal plants will match the performance of coal gasification in terms of efficiency and environmental properties. "I think that you should install both systems side by side, in a competitive relationship, with regard to power plant availability, cost per kilowatt hour, and environmental performance." This opinion diverges from the Master Plan for Electricity Supply, in which the government, if "Buggenum" is successful, expresses a preference for pit coal gasification alone in generating electricity, aside from the two other fuels: natural gas and uranium. The government and electricity producers are in complete agreement that coal is absolutely essential to the large-scale generation of electricity. In the 1970's, the ideal mix of fuels was determined to be one-third natural gas, one-third coal, and one-third nuclear energy, but that mix was never achieved due to the problems with opposition to nuclear power plants. Zon, who was the director of the Nucon engineering firm for a number of years, which specializes in nuclear energy: "If we were to decide tomorrow to build new nuclear power plants, then in my opinion you would have to regard coal gasification differently, because nuclear energy remains cleaner and cheaper. Three fuels with one-third each: That should remain the goal, that is preferable in terms of the environment and price and also in terms of fuel availability." The assortment of fuels used right now is quite different. Last year, 57 percent of the electricity produced in the Netherlands was generated with natural gas, 37 percent with coal, and 6 percent with uranium. In order to maintain the share of coal--a relatively cheap and widely available fuel--at that level, coal gasification is essential as one of the techniques for cleaner burning. The coal is combined with pure oxygen in a gasifier at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 30 atmospheres. The coal gas product is then cooled, purified, and subjected to "deep desulfurization," Zon explains, through which the discharge of sulfur dioxide (SO<inf> 2</inf> ) is sharply reduced. The pure sulfur residue can be easily sold on the domestic market, because the Netherlands currently still imports sulfur. By diluting the coal gas, the content of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is sharply reduced. Purification (with water) of the gas ensures a very limited discharge of matter from the power plant. The water is purified again and evaporated, which leaves salts as residue. Coal gasification has another environmental advantage: The greenhouse gas CO<inf> 2</inf> can be captured easily and cheaply before combustion, although that has a negative effect on efficiency. This is not yet being done in Buggenum, but it can be considered for new, larger power plants. Over the next two years, Demkolec will test seven types of coal of various composition in the power plant and based on that draw up a "blueprint" for new gasification plants. In the third year, "Buggenum" will work with the SEP's National Efficiency Program, the goal being to show that the availability of the power plant is greater than 70 percent. There are currently 120 people working at the plant on day-to-day operations, plus another 35 experts, including a number of people from Shell and KEMA [Arnem Institute for the Testing of Electrical Engineering Equipment], for testing, the demonstration program, and evaluation. "Shell has worked for 15 years on the total course of this technology," says Zon. "But the potential for large-scale application of this clean technology has increased sharply over the past five years in particular, so that we can now say confidently that it is becoming affordable and competitive for the Netherlands, which together with Germany has the strictest environmental regulations in the world."
