Isakov, chairman of the principal Duma committee, on legislation and judicial and legal reform, unexpectedly proposed a new way of electing the Russian president. Not by a nationwide vote, but by a kind of new Assembly of the Land, comprising the members of the Federation Council and representatives of the territories. V. Isakov's reasoning was that nationwide presidential elections would lead to the destabilization of the political situation in Russia and could split it into several warring camps. So, in his view, depriving voters of the only check on the supreme authority they have left following the adoption of the new Constitution -- the right to elect the country's president once every four years -- is a stabilizing factor. It is worth noting that V. Isakov's proposal sounded as though it was supposed to develop the detailed report by Duma chairman I. Rybkin, the main theme of which was approximately as follows: The Duma is switching from political battles to productive lawmaking. The main grounds for this switch, it was indicated, is the prospect of achieving civil peace and accord in the country. In fact, support for the ideas put forward by the president in his message to parliament on the part of very diverse political forces represented in the Duma was all but the leitmotiv of the 11 March debate. In particular, representatives of the communists and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] voiced considerable approval, noting that B. Yeltsin's program coincided with their own party programs. Perhaps only "Russia's Choice" was critical of the ideas announced by the executive authority, thus ending up in a minority. But does this mean one can say that the evolution of the president's views, as recorded in his message to parliament and confirmed by the draft budget message, paves the way for the longed-for civil peace? I. Rybkin immediately and publicly disavowed V. Isakov's statement, saying that he did it "off his own bat." But, knowing V. Isakov, as I do, from his activities in the old Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, it is hard to imagine that one of the most experienced parliamentary politicians would have gotten carried away suddenly and would have put forward for no particular reason ideas that grossly contradict the basic provisions of the Constitution. The timing was very specific. The results of the vote on the question of the 23 February political amnesty convincingly demonstrated that the section of the Duma in opposition to the president had managed to form an overwhelming majority by winning over a number of centrist factions. According to the calculations of analytical group experts A. Sobyanin, E. Gelman, and O. Kayunov, this majority needs 20-25 votes to obtain a two-thirds advantage and the corresponding opportunity to adopt the constitutional decisions it needs. According to these experts, the political temperature in the State Duma today is similar to what it was at the seventh Congress of Russian Federation People's Deputies. So there are grounds for saying that the opposition has succeeded in capturing the first planned position in its fight against the president and it is massing for an assault on the second position. This position was very clearly indicated by V. Isakov -- the president as the "main source of destabilization." Addressing his colleagues on Friday, the Duma speaker shared with them his idea of turning every Duma committee into a "miniparliament," in which all work on the preparation and discussion of draft laws is to be concentrated. All the voting on draft laws and other acts that have been prepared and agreed in advance is to be carried out at these sittings, without any debate. The idea is not new and has been used with some success in world parliamentary practice. In Japan, for instance, or the United States, whence the Duma speaker returned on the eve of the sitting. Certainly, the new scheme for organizing lawmaking work, proposed by I. Rybkin, will make it possible to avoid the various excesses taking place at plenary sittings, which immediately become known to the general electorate and are not nice for the Duma. Indeed, it would save considerable time. But, at the same time, all these obvious merits are relevant only to an established political system in which the rules of the game are clearly defined and are strictly observed by everyone. The gist of the rules is that the opinion of all political factions and groups in parliament will definitely be considered when draft laws are being devised. But in the case of the Russian Duma there is strong reason to believe that extensive discussion is probably being replaced by the diktat of committees in which, as a rule, one faction or another occupies key positions. At any rate, that was precisely the case in the old Russian Supreme Soviet, and the same trends are apparent in the Duma. Among the key legislative acts in the Duma's drafting program three very important draft laws are to be devised (and effectively adopted, if I. Rybkin's proposed drafting model is introduced) by the Committee on Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform headed by V. Isakov. They are draft laws on the Constitutional Court, on the elections to the State Duma, and on Russian presidential elections. In view of the very real possibility of the Duma democratic minority's being denied participation in the preparation of these draft laws and the opposition's possession of a virtual constitutional majority, the likelihood of the adoption of a Law on the Constitutional Court enabling the opposition to subject the president to an impeachment procedure or of a Law on Presidential Elections along the lines of that proposed by V. Isakov, should be regarded as very real. It is hard to say right now to what extent nationwide presidential elections might destabilize the situation among ordinary Russian voters. But they are certainly destabilizing the situation among the central and regional bureaucracy. The Duma politicians on whom the nomenklatura is banking are themselves very well aware that none of them has any chance of winning the presidential race. So it is highly likely that a "dark horse" will breast the tape and cause really serious trouble for the political and nomenklatura elite both in the capital and in the provinces. It was for that very reason, presumably, that the proposal to keep the consideration of new presidential candidates and, accordingly, the membership of the new government "in the family" was made. To conduct the bargaining without witnesses and share out top state posts in accordance with the principle: You support our candidate for this post and we will support your candidate for that post. This is the only way the political forces behind V. Isakov will have a chance to get back into power in Russia. It is typical that in the corridors of the Duma V. Isakov expressed every confidence that his idea would meet with approval in the Federation Council. So V. Isakov's statement looks more than anything like a trial balloon, launched in order to discover how far it is possible to go at the moment in the proposed direction, along the path leading, whether V. Isakov likes it or not, to the establishment of nomenklatura diktat in the country and creation of a state system over which citizens would have no control (in this respect I. Rybkin's proposal on dispensing with debates at Duma plenary sittings looks very logical). As for the president's latest actions, for which he even won praise in some communist newspapers, it appears they merely facilitate the opposition's progress along this path, since they cause schism and confusion in the ranks of the democrats. But V. Isakov honestly and candidly gave to undertsand that if B. Yeltsin were to declare himself tomorrow to be the sternest statist and loyalest Leninist he would still be the opposition's "number one target."
