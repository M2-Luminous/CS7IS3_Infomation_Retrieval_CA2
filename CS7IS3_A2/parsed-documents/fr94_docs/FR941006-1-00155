FR941006-1-00155 FR941006-1-00016 21 CFR Part 310 Administrative practice and procedure, Drugs, Labeling, Medical devices, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, it is proposed that 21 CFR parts 101, 170, and 310 be amended as follows: PART 101_FOOD LABELING 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 101 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 4, 5, 6 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1453, 1454, 1455); secs. 201, 301, 402, 403, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 342, 343, 348, 371). 2. Section 101.17 is amended by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows: §101.17 Food labeling warning and notice statements. * * * * * (e) Dietary supplements containing iron or iron salts. (1) The labeling of any dietary supplement in solid oral dosage form (e.g., tablets or capsules) that contains iron or iron salts for use as an iron source shall bear the following statement: (i) If the product is packaged in unit-dose packaging as defined in §170.55 of this chapter: WARNING_Keep away from children. Keep in original package until each use. Contains iron, which can harm or cause death to a child. If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. (ii) If the product contains less than 30 milligrams of iron per dosage unit and is packaged by the manufacturer in other than unit-dose packaging as defined in §170.55 of this chapter, e.g., a container with a child-resistant closure, its label shall bear the following statement: WARNING_Close tightly and keep away from children. Contains iron, which can harm or cause death to a child. If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. (2) The statement required by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the immediate container labeling in such a way that the warning is intact until all of the dosage units to which it applies are used. The statement required by paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the immediate container labeling. In all cases where the immediate container is not the retail package, the warning statement shall also appear prominently and conspicuously on the principal display panel of the retail package. In addition, the warning statement shall appear on any labeling that contains warnings. PART 170_FOOD ADDITIVES 3. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 170 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 201, 401, 402, 408, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 341, 342, 346a, 348, 371). 4. New §170.55 is added to subpart C to read as follows: §170.55 Iron and iron salts in dietary supplements not in conventional food form. The use of iron and iron salts as iron sources in dietary supplements is safe, or generally recognized as safe, only when the package in which the supplements are sold is labeled in accordance with §101.17(e) of this chapter and, if the dietary supplements are offered in solid oral dosage form (e.g., tablets or capsules) and contain 30 milligrams or more of iron per dosage unit, when such supplements are packaged in unit-dose packaging. ``Unit-dose packaging'' means a method of packaging a product into a nonreusable container designed to hold a single dosage unit intended for administration directly from that container, irrespective of whether the recommended dose is one or more than one of these units. The term ``dosage unit'' means the individual physical unit of the product, e.g., tablets or capsules.
