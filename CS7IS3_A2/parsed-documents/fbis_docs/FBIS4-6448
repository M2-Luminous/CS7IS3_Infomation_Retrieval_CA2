Acting Defense Secretary Feliciano Gacis, who briefed the 29-member National Security Council (NSC) on the internal security and peace and order situation, said the radical Muslim extremist groups "pose and immediate threat" to the security and stability in southern Philippines. [sentence as published] These groups, like the Abu Sayaff group, are giving military and police authorities more problems than the Muslim secessionist guerrillas because of their propensity to violence, terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal activities in pursuit of their objectives." Several international Islamic organizations, particularly those based in Libya and Pakistan are suspected to be providing financial support to these groups which are attempting to establish an Islamic society in the country. Apart from these radical Muslim extremist groups, Gacis also pointed out the rising criminality in southern Philippines which is largely fueled by Muslim separatist guerrillas who are turning themselves into bandits. Commonly called "lost commands," Gacis said these groups are also classified as threat to the peace and order in predominantly Muslim areas in Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-tawi. These groups carry out various lawless activities, like piracy, hold-up, robberies, extortion, illegal logging, and kidnap-for-ransom. Apart from internal security threats, which Gacis claimed to be fast diminishing because of government's efforts to address the root causes of rebellion, crime and other lawlessness, members of the Ramos Cabinet also briefed the NSC about the status of the government's reform programs in both political and economic fields, the assessment of the impact of the oil price increase, and the country's security concerns in East Asia, particularly on the South China Sea area and the Korean peninsula. On the political and economic reforms, Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona claimed "the country is now poised for take-off" because most of the economic and political reforms have been put in place. The economic reforms, Guingona explained, are designed to level the playing field, promote global competitiveness and make opportunities available to everyone in a fair and equitable manner. Among the major measures the government has done to implement these economic reforms were liberalizing the financial sector, deregulating the transport and communications sector, and reforming fiscal management, power sector, investment and trade, agriculture, infrastructure, and environmental and natural resources. In the political field, Guingona enumerated the government's gains in the peace process, peace and order, devolution and implementation of the local government code and the redirection of the foreign policy toward economic diplomacy. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo, for his part, outlined the country's position on the growing tension in the Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons development.
