At the same time they called on the Federal Government to stay "lastingly and clearly" below the growth rate of 3 percent in the coming years, which was recently recommended by the Financial Planning Council. The laender are willing to stick to the limitation of 3 percent. As Brandenburg Finance Minister Kuehbacher (Social Democratic Party of Germany) said, when new laws that are linked with expenditures are adopted, the Federal Government must also consider where the money needed can be saved. Kuehbacher cited as an example the new insolvency law for the benefit of consumers, which entails considerable costs for the judiciary. The figure of 3 percent is also to be understood as a guideline for the wage negotiations. Despite the will for saving, the ministers estimate that the deficit of the old laender -- because of the new regulation for the redistribution of financial means and the predicted losses in tax revenues -- will amount to about 30 billion German marks [DM] in 1995, thus being higher than ever. Next year almost one out of five marks from tax revenues will be spent on paying interests. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the state's tasks, to reduce the number of personnel, and to conclude wage contracts, which are oriented toward the growth rates. The communities cannot expect any further help or easing of their burdens. Because of the recession, tax revenues will remain lower for years longer than it was expected last year. Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt said that this and next year the losses in tax revenues will amount to about DM10 billion. The ministers rejected a tax increase beyond what has already been decided. A decision about proposals for a profound tax reform in 1996 has been postponed to November. The ministers called on the Federal Government to make sure in the European Union [EU] "that the German net contribution is again reduced to a level appropriate in relationship with the net contributions by the other member states." Doubling the German net contribution between 1990 and 1992 to about DM22 billion is in gross contradiction to the reduced capacity of the united Germany and poses an additional burden on the public budgets. The Federal Government must urge strict budget discipline in the EU, reject the desires for loans by the EU Commission, which are aimed at "circumventing budget discipline," and channel more structural subsidy funds to Germany. The ministers advocated the view that a revision of the EU's system of contributions, "including the question of discounts on contributions," should be initiated "as soon as possible," if these efforts do not bring about a sufficient reduction of Germany's net contributions.
