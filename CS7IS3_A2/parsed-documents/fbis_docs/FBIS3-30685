The bill determines general rules for broadcasting and specific provisions for public service media and commercial media. Under the bill, parliament will set up public foundations to provide guarantees for the operation of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television as public service media. The assets of the foundations will be handled by boards of trustees. The presidents of both media will be appointed by the president of the republic, at the prime minister's proposal. Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television will be controlled by large supervisory committees, representing all strata of Hungarian society. The boards will operate independently from the public foundations. The bill specifies a general framework for the operation of local public service broadcasters, guarantees their independence from the local authorities, and creates the necessary social controls. Parliament held a vote on a former version of the media bill in late December 1992, at which time it was rejected.
