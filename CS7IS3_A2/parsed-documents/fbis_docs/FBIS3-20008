The visit by foreign delegations and the messages conveyed to Ankara by several leaders in the West constitute serious pressure on the coalition government. The messages criticized the TGNA decision and the subsequent detention of the DP deputies. It is appropriate to mention that the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs focused all its attention on the DP file every working day during the past week. According to a high-ranking official, the ministry is making a strenuous effort to "sell a faulty product to the outside world." As far as Turkey is concerned, the matter has assumed a dangerous proportion in the international arena. In fact, the detention of the DP deputies has created the conditions that are required to internationalize the "Kurdish problem." Meanwhile, an impression has been created that the DP deputies have been "oppressed." Of course, whether that is true is another matter. Nevertheless, the matter has created an opportunity for propaganda campaigns against Turkey. The problem is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not have any difficulty in explaining the reason for the TGNA move to lift the parliamentary immunity of the DP deputies. Meanwhile, several diplomats are convinced that the problem would have been easily resolved if the action against the deputies had been limited to the lifting of their immunity. However, the main causes of the problem are: 1. The use of forceful action against DP deputies. 2. Detention of the DP deputies by the police for a considerable length of time. Although a strong case may be made to lift their parliamentary immunity, it seems that developing an effective case to explain the forceful action against them and their detention will be difficult. Furthermore, considering western standards, no one should be expected to be satisfied with the arguments to support such actions. Another serious aspect of the matter is that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin have been worried by the mistakes made by officials and by the extended amount of time in which the deputies have been in custody. Ciller and Karayalcin agree that the detention of the deputies should be as short as possible and that they should be released before the religious festival. Of course, their effort to find a formula for the release has been confronted by the independent judicial organs. Unfortunately, the coalition government has given an opportunity to six DP deputies to place Turkey's relations with Western countries under their control. The success the coalition government has had in placing itself in a difficult position will probably be an important addition to the list of its inefficiencies.
