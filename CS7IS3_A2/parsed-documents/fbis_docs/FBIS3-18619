Cooperation between the armed forces of NATO and Russia will contribute to reciprocal transparency and trust. It is not in the interest of European security for Russia to position itself, or be kept, outside Europe. However, a statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is raising questions. Churkin saw "a great potential for partnership in the interest of peace" for NATO and Russia. This is reminiscent of the Russian proposal for a partnership between NATO and Russia to guarantee security in Central and East Europe. The reaction of the Central European countries, which would like to join NATO, was an unequivocal "No." What those countries want, and what they are striving hard to achieve, is to join forces with West Europe, not live under continued Russian tutelage, which produced little of positive value over the last 40 years. Moreover, Russia recently made some statements that were hardly reassuring. A kind of condominium between the United States and Russia, a subtle continuation of Yalta, and of the dividing line of the Cold War, cannot be the aim of the Partnership for Peace . The question as to whether Russia will play a constructive role in European security via that partnership depends not only on the Western understanding of Russian sensibilities, but also on Russia itself, and its determination of its legitimate interests. If Russia includes continued limited sovereignty over the countries in Central and East Europe among its legitimate interests, then it will be making a mistake. And there is no enmity or Cold War dogma behind pointing out that it is inconceivable in the new Europe that state sovereignty should stop at the eastern border of the unified Germany. Then again, the manner in which Russia effectively belongs to Europe also depends on Russia itself, on its choices regarding internal development, but, more importantly, on its attitude vis-a-vis the outside world. No one has a hold on internal Russian development, not even the United States. However, the United States and the member states of the European Union can certainly influence Russian foreign policy. They can make it clear that constructive, friendly cooperation, which accepts the new situation in Europe and the regained sovereignty of the countries of Central and East Europe, will elicit a better response than the language of threats, and claims to "traditional spheres of influence." One cannot celebrate the end of the Cold War while at the same time sticking to its borders. There need be no conflict between a constructive, active role for Russia in the area of European security and the legitimate demands of the countries of Central and East Europe. If this is the spirit in which Russia joins the Partnership for Peace, then there will be every reason to applaud such a step.
