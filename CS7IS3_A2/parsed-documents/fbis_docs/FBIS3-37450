"I am responsible for the peace-keeping forces of Russia and I have come here to see how they live and what problems they have to solve," Kondratyev said. He said he will meet with the army commanders and Dniester authorities to discuss the future of Russian peace-keepers in the region. "They cannot stay here forever," he added. He told ITAR-TASS that this is a routine inspection, but surely he would speak with army commander Aleksandr Lebed about his recent public statements. The army commanders had warned all sides against "the illusion that the (Moldovan-Dniester) conflict can be solved by force." They said though that the Army would not stand on the sidelines if new hostilities erupt and promised that "the organisers of armed provocations from either bank (of the Dniestr River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to unleash a new conflict." The Foreign Ministry of Moldova then accused the command of the 14th Army of "interference into the affairs of the republic" and said in a statement issued on Friday the Russian Army was "the main destabilising factor in the Dniester region." The Foreign Ministry said that such statements "undermine bilateral negotiations on the future of the 14th Army" and reiterated that the Moldovan leadership "insists on an unconditional pullout of the Army." Kondartyev told ITAR-TASS that the fate of the 14th Army is to be solved by politicians, not by the military and added that "we may withdraw it already tomorrow." During the three-day visit, Kondratyev will tour the bases of Russian peace-keeping forces numbering 1,700 in the region and meet with Dniester President Igor Smirnov. He may also hold talks with representatives of the Moldovan Defence Ministry.
