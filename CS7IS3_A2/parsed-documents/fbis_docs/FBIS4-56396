As in 1989, his vice presidential candidate will again be Jose Paulo Bisol, a senator for the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] from Rio Grande do Sul. His campaign jingle in electoral rallies and television programs will again be "Lula-la," although this time its backdrop will consist of rock and samba music and sheer fun. The alliance that is now proposing Lula's candidacy is the Brazilian Front of Citizens [Frente Brasil da Cidadania], which will be only slightly different from the 1989 coalition. This front will include the People's Socialist Party and the PSTU [United Social Workers Party] and will exclude the Vanguard Party. There will be just a slight change in the PT strategy: The 1989 slogan No Fear of Happiness will be replaced by a new one: It Was Worth the Wait. Lula has already picked his vice president, whose name will not be announced until May. Yesterday, Lula and Bisol had breakfast together and decided the ticket. Addressing Bisol, Lula said: "As far as the PT is concerned, you will be my vice president. It is now up to the PSB to decide. The PSB will formally nominate Bisol on 9 May as soon as it concludes consultations with the PSB grassroots. PSB branches of 17 states have already endorsed Bisol, except for the one in Minas Gerais, which would like to nominate Belo Horizonte Deputy Mayor Celio de Castro. [passage omitted]
