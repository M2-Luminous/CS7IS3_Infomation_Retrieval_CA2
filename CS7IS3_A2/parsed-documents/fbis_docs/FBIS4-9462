[no closing quotation mark as received] Minister Marek Pol confirmed Sunday that he had suspended his decision concerning transformations in the lignite industry until the time the way of transformations is worked out by representatives of the government, trade unions and employers. Under Minister Pol's decision the existing lignite mines and power engineering plants were to be transformed into three holding companies. Head of the National Commission of the Solidarity Trade Union Marian Krzaklewski said that the government was recognizing the strike as a "trial of strength." The striking miners are providing power generating plants with only enough fuel to keep the furnaces just operating. Officials at the Industry and Trade Ministry responsible for the power engineering sector were put on "alert" in connection with the strike, Grazyna Lewandowska, spokeswoman for Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol, said Sunday afternoon. She explained that talks with the striking miners can be started any time and added that Minister Marek Pol, who had been out of Warsaw for personal reasons, would come to the ministry on Sunday night. The strike in lignite mines proved to be profitable for hard coal power generating plants which say that due to limitations in lignite-generated power they are able to sell larger amounts of their product. "We are able to satisfy the country's demand for power for a certain period of time," Wladyslaw Wojcik from "Siersza" power generating plant in Trzebinia, Katowice Province, said. He added that due to the existing situation the plant can work "at full steam." The problem is that power generated from hard-coal is more expensive due to the costs of hard-coal extraction.
