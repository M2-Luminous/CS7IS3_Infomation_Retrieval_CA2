But if Europe is heading for a new split, as the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks for reform in Russia, and signs of a nationalistic Russian foreign policy seem to indicate, then EU membership coupled with a military alignment will become problematic for Finland. That is the conclusion reached by the Foreign Policy Institute in a study carried out by researcher Jukka Salovaara on the effects of EU membership on foreign policy and security. The study also emphasizes that the effects of EU membership will also depend on Finland's alignment in defense policy and on the way Europe develops. New Opportunities EU membership commits Finland to a common policy on foreign affairs and security, but only on such issues and areas of activity as have been agreed on jointly, Salovaara writes. This, in turn, opens up new foreign policy opportunities for Finland. Salovaara groups the opportunities of influencing the EU's common policy into three categories. First, there are areas where EU policy is already very well established and where Finland has more to learn in order to be influential. These are mainly policies regarding the Middle East, but also those regarding the CSCE and the United Nations. Salovaara does not see any significant differences between Finland and the EU countries in policies regarding the CSCE or the United Nations. But he points to the example of Denmark, which, despite being in the EU, has been able to align with the other Nordic countries over South Africa, espousing a policy that differs from that of the other EU countries. It is therefore conceivable that the Nordic countries could cooperate over the United Nations as well in the future. Second, there are areas where new accents will be added to EU policy, for example policies towards Russia and East Europe. EU membership would open up new activity areas for Finland within the framework of its policy toward Russia. Third, Salovaara believes that, as an EU member, Finland will add a new Nordic dimension to the Union's foreign policy. This could increase the EU's interest in neighboring regions to the east of Finland. Finland cannot solve all its regional problems on its own. If Finland stays outside the EU together with Norway and Sweden, Nordic cooperation can develop. If Sweden and Norway join the EU but Finland does not, its relations with Russia will gain greater emphasis. The difference, compared with the Cold War period, would be that West Europe's outer frontier would be drawn between Sweden and Finland. That would make Nordic cooperation difficult in its present form, the study maintains. Salovaara deals with four alternatives in discussing Finland's defense, depending on whether Finland joins the EU or not and depending on Finland's military alignment or nonalignment. If Finland does not join, neutrality is a likely alternative. One possible solution would be a defense alliance with Sweden if it, too, stays out of the EU. Salovaara does not see this as a likely eventuality in view of these countries' geopolitical situation and historical background. Relations with Russia would then become of major concern because of our region's increasing military and strategic importance to Russia. This is because part of the Russian Baltic fleet has been forced to withdraw to St. Petersburg and the Kola peninsula now plays a more prominent role in Russian strategy. As a member of the EU, Finland can stay militarily nonaligned and maintain an independent defense. The Maastricht treaty, however, points toward a common defense policy leading in future to a joint defense system. The Foreign Policy Institute study, however, gives no answer to the question regarding the significance of a common defense policy. According to Salovaara, it is highly unlikely that any far-reaching decisions will be made at the government conference in 1995. He does believe, however, that the EU will be watching Finland closely after accession, mainly due to the long border that the Union would share with Russia after that event. The foreign and security policy survey on the consequences of Finland's EU membership is one of the studies presented yesterday. There was another study on regional policy. [passage omitted]
