The puppets are now raving that this war was aimed at countering someone's infiltration and enhancing defense preparedness. However, this is nothing but a sophism to mislead the media at home and abroad and to conceal their bellicose nature. The entire world officially recognizes that there is no such threat of a southward invasion on the Korean peninsula. Even though the puppets are raising a clamor as though we would at once invade the South, many patriotic figures who have visited the Northern half of the Republic unanimously say that there was no such moves, and that they have not detected any of those moves, and that North Korean society is in peace. Not long ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself virtually denied the rumors on the threat of a southward invasion by saying that the rumors on the war crisis on the Korean peninsula stemmed from the U.S. media's irresponsible reports. This vividly proves the absurdity of the rumors on the threat of a southward invasion babbled by the puppets. There is no such southward invasion but a northward invasion on the Korean peninsula. This can be clearly seen in the content of operations and the massive number of personnel that were mobilized in staging the recent exercise. In the recent Hwarang exercise, the Kim Yong-sam clique mobilized the puppet army, navy, and air force and police, and reserve forces -- over 1.3 million in all -- and perpetrated a surprise mobilization exercise, a joint operation among Army, Navy, and Air force, an airborne-operation, and a land operation in an atmosphere of real warfare. What is more, they are bluffing of a war-winning posture in the event of the firm establishment of an emergency situation. Denial of rumors on the war crisis while staging the Hwarang war exercise and babbling about the firmness of war-winning posture, clearly show that such war an exercise is part of their maneuvers to provoke a war of aggression against the North. As a matter of fact, it is an established fact that the South Korean puppets are attempting to provoke a war of aggression against the North with the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists, on the pretext of stopping the North's nuclear development, have not withdrawn their naval armed forces concentrated on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Worse still, they say they are ready for war and are massively introducing combat equipment, including the latest-type Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets, along with the U.S. imperialists, have mapped out a northward invasion plan called the New Operation Plan 5027 and are playing with fire to carry it into practice. The U.S. imperialists have perpetrated aerial espionage on the northern half of Korea on 250 occasions in April alone. This clearly shows how desperately the rascals are running about in their maneuvers for a war of aggression against the North. Timed to coincide with this, the Kim Yong-sam clique staged the Hwarang exercise by mobilizing the puppet army, police, and reservists. It is obvious that the Hwarang war exercise is aimed at provoking a war of aggression against the North to drive not only the puppet army but also the para-military forces and inhabitants into it. The puppet clique cannot by any means conceal its bellicose nature, and only runs out to the road of confrontation and war. The Kim Yong-sam clique's criminal acts of rejecting the fellow countrymen's proposal on convening a great national meeting; turning the Korean peninsula into a war ground; becoming a vanguard of implementing the U.S. policies of invasion and war; and bringing in the fiery cloud of war on the Korean peninsula will never be tolerated. We (?want dialogue), but we are not in any sense afraid of war. If the puppets set the fire of war on this land, our people and our People's Army will rise as one to provide the rascals with ignominious defeat. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look squarely at the unshakable will of our people who do not say empty words, and should not act recklessly like a puppy with no fear of a tiger.
