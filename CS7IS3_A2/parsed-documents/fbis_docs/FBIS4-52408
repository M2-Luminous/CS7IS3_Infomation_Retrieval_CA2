Korea Denounced" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Chong Sin-hyok, vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, issued a statement to the press Saturday, in which he scathingly denounced the South Korean puppet clique's moves to develop nuclear arms as a heinous, anti-national crime intended to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the entire fellow countrymen and turn the 3,000-ri national territory into a barren land. He charged that the South Korean puppet clique have already acquired the capability to make nuclear weapons and produced and concealed several nukes in secret. The statement said: The International Atomic Energy Agency, reduced to a maid of the United States, has connived at the military nuclear facilities in South Korea, not announcing the result of investigation of them, while openly taking issue with the DPRK's experimental reactor for a peaceful use. This clearly shows that the agency is devoid of impartiality. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat have willingness to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and keep peace on the globe, they should, first of all, pay due attention to the South Korean puppets' nuclear development on an extremely dangerous stage and urgently take an appropriate step against it. The statement earnestly called upon the entire fellow countrymen in the North and the South of Korea and overseas to actively turn out in the just struggle to check and frustrate the South Korean puppet clique's dangerous development of nuclear weapons.
