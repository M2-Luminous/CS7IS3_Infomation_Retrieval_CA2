ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review SUMMARY: In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping finding on replacement parts for self-propelled bituminous paving equipment from Canada. The review period is September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise, the Allatt Paving Division of Ingersoll-Rand Canada Inc. (Allatt). We preliminarily determine the dumping margin for this period to be 11.04 percent. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gayle Longest or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 19, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (56 FR 47450) of the antidumping finding on replacement parts for self-propelled bituminous paving equipment from Canada for the period September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991. On September 23, 1991, the petitioner, Blaw Knox Construction Equipment Co., requested an administrative review of the antidumping finding. We initiated the review on October 18, 1991 (56 FR 52254). The Department has now conducted this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of replacement parts for self-propelled bituminous paving equipment, excluding attachments and parts for attachments. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 4016.93.10, 7315.11.00, 7315.89.50, 7315.90.00, 8336.50.00, 8479.99.00, 8481.20.00, 8482.10.10, 8483.90.90, 8539.29.20, 8544.20.00, 8544.41.00, 8544.51.80, 8544.60.20, and 9015.30.40. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review period is September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise, Allatt. United States Price In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) and exporter's sales price (ESP), as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act. For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States, we based the United States price on PP, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act. Where sales to the first unrelated purchaser occurred after importation into the United States, we based USP on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Tariff Act. PP and ESP were based on the packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made adjustments, where applicable, for brokerage charges, U.S. and foreign inland freight, U.S. duties, and discounts. For ESP sales, we also deducted commissions to unrelated parties, credit, and indirect selling expenses. We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in Silicon Manganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994. There were no other adjustments claimed or allowed. Foreign Market Value In calculating FMV, the Department used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, because sufficient quantities of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis for comparison. Home market price was based on the packed, f.o.b. company warehouse price in the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for discounts, inland freight, credit expenses, commissions, advertising expenses, packing expenses, and differences in merchandise. We adjusted FMV for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in Silicon Manganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, 59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994. In light of the CAFC's decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AD-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States, 13, F3d 398 (CAFC 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead will adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale (COS) provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the ESP offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate, in the manner described below.
