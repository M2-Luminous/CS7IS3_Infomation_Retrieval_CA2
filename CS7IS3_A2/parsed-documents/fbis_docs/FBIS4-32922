The Radicals yesterday ratified a declaration to this same effect. The next step is the official registration of this new party with the Electoral Service. The statutes were drafted by a mixed commission. The decision to merge the two parties was made due to the fact that they are both centrist parties and that the two member parties of the governing Coalition of Parties for Democracy obtained very few votes during the December 1993 presidential elections. It was announced that Radical Senator Anselmo Sule will be president of the PRSD and Ernesto Velasco, also a Radical, secretary general, while Social Democrats will occupy the vice presidencies. Senator Sule today said that the merging of the two parties is "a historical event" and will mark "a new phase" of the social democratic currents.
