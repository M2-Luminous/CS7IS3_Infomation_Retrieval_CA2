He said Argentina "is showing its potential to the world." Menem recalled that bilateral relations had run into "an infinite number" of problems, just as they do with other important nations, but stressed that beginning with his government, "an immediate decision was made to change course by implementing more realistic policies at both the national and international levels." Menem said this last night while opening American Week at the Pacifico Mall in Buenos Aires. U.S. Ambassador James Cheek participated in the ceremony. The chief of state reiterated that Argentina must be "among the top 10 countries in the world because it has the necessary natural and human resources." He emphasized, "We must not forget that after having been among the world's top 10 countries some 40 years ago, we slid to 100th position in 1989." He stated: "It has been difficult to overcome the innumerable obstacles that hampered Argentina's escape from stagnation, frustration, and involution." The president stressed that "an enormous apparatus that sought to frustrate had been mounted" in the country, "converting it into a nation of favor trading and privileges because the state dominated and did everything unsatisfactorily." Defending his state reform policy, Menem highlighted the fact that "after five years, Argentina has moved from 100th place to 16th place among the economic powers." He said, "Argentina must once again be among the top 10." Menem admitted that "not everything is right" in the country. He justified this saying that other stagnated nations "needed decades to revert the situation while we took just 5 years." Menem said, "No matter who governs, by the end of the century we will be much better off if we continue on this course." The chief of state indicated that enhancing the current policy "is the best proposal for the current stage and for advancing against the scourges that affect us and the rest of humanity." Menem defined these "scourges" as "poverty, drug trafficking, terrorism, and crime, which actively grow through new methods." He said: "The proposal for new laws and a more coherent relationship among all nations is the best answer to these scourges which undermine our best foundation: An organized society." More than 40 recognized U.S. enterprises are participating in the event. The opening ceremony took place in the center of the mall where a 12.5-meter model of the Statue of Liberty, which is located in New York harbor, has been erected.
