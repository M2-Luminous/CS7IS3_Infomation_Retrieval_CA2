Albert Szabo, a 39-year-old Australian-Hungarian citizen and Istvan Gyorkos, a 54-year-old Hungarian citizen were taken into custody and now face trial for anti-community incitement. As reported by MTI on Thursday, the Hungarist Movement (HM), which was founded recently by the leaders of the Federation of Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and the World National Popular Rule Party, held a news conference on Wednesday. Co-Presidents Gyorgy Ekrem Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert Szabo informed the journalists that they had applied for registration at the Budapest Metropolitan Court on April 25. They claimed partial identification with the arrow cross party's Hungarist movement, which rose to power in 1944 under the leadership of Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946). (Szalasi was sentenced to death as a war-criminal in 1946.) At a Thursday press conference, Prime Minister Peter Boross condemned the new movement on behalf of the government and of the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
