Many thought that is was just a joke. In order to have new ministers sworn in, first the old ones have to go. Until yesterday morning no one knew anything about any imminent government reshuffle. This is how yesterday at the Cotroceni they managed to set a new record of condensing into just a few minutes events that usually stretch over several days: The announcement of the government reshuffle, the announcing of the names of the new ministers, the oath-taking ceremony, and the sipping of the customary glass of champagne. Taking into consideration that all these historic moments took place at once, on Sunday at noon, when people are usually trying to cure their hangovers, we can safely say without fear of contradiction that this was a genuine original in the history of Romanian and even world politics. What made the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] leaders and Ion Iliescu adopt such a style of doing things -- that is, covering things in secrecy while gasping because of the sudden effort -- remains an enigma. In the next few days, when people will be less careful to keep their mouths shut, they will probably offer us the solution to this mystery. Until then all we can do is remark that such a style is far from being able to meet the requirements of democracy, which may be defined precisely by the long pondering that precedes decisionmaking, and that previously decisions were usually subject to debates or, at least, to the test of public opinion. Having secretly appointed Petre Salcudeanu as culture minister, the PDSR was subsequently surprised to find that the dignitary in question does not refrain from going to work with blurry eyes and with the zipper of his pants open [reference to photograph of minister in a compromising situation]. Let us hope that the PDSR will not be surprised in a similar way by any of the new ministers sworn in yesterday! It is very difficult to work out a formula explaining the latest moves of the government party. It froze the negotiations with its left-wing allies to set up the red pentagon government [coalition consisting of PDSR, the National Romanian Unity Party -- PUNR, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania -- PDAR, the Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM, and the Greater Romania Party -- PRM], and opened negotiations with opposition parties. Despite the fact that PDSR issued a firm declaration engaging in a controversy with the left-wing political parties, the government party was very careful not to severe all the links connecting it with the PUNR, the PRM, and the PSM. This ambiguous stance made many of the country's nationalists wonder toward which end of the political scale the PDSR is actually leaning: the right or the left? Does yesterday's reshuffle answer that question? In my opinion, it does not. A closer look at yesterday's changes shows that the PDSR headed by Iliescu continues to play a double game. Some of the replacements were intended to satisfy the left wing, such as Niculae Spiroiu's ousting from the leadership of the defense ministry. Other replacements were designed to please the right wing, such as the ousting of George Ioan Danescu. One can assume that all these changes made the object of previous discreet consultations with the parties both on the left and the right of our political spectrum. However, considering that friendship does not count much in politics, one can safely assume that what the PDSR actually wanted to achieve by this government reshuffle is to continue to play the ball alone. After all, it cannot be excluded that the new ministers were appointed merely because they pass as reliable members of the government party and supporters of Ion Iliescu. They need reliable people if early elections are to be held, as in such electoral processes the key ministries are those of the interior and justice. While in terms of the power struggle the reshuffle represents an important moment, in terms of the struggle to pull the country out of the current crisis it totally lacks significance. Trying to explain the replacements, the PDSR and Ion Iliescu claimed that they were necessary because more competence was required. However, it is quite clear that more competence was needed in areas other than those in which the reshuffle occurred. The latter, except for transportation, had been working quite well under the leadership of their former ministers. More competence would have been needed in the key ministries for the promotion of reform and privatization. But the reshuffle avoided precisely those sectors, while preferring those that are fundamental for the PDSR's survival. This gives us the right to assert that once more, the PDSR has placed party interests above the general interests of the country. The earth-shaking, epoch-making government reshuffle with which the PDSR has been threatening us over the past month does not solve anything.
