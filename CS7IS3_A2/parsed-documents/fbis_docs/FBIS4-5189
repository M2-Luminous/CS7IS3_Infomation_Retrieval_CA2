According to those watching the situation, this was a work failure. They have compared this session to the opening session of the constituent assembly on 2 July 1993. This is because nothing of importance happened at this session, except that assembly members -- some standing and some sitting -- listened to the message from His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and a report by the National Assembly Standing Committee. Sar Sa-at, a member of the Commission for Interior, National Defense, Investigation, and Suppression, admitted that this session was useless because one of the major items was withdrawn from the agenda. He believes, however, that there will be many major items at the next session relating to the debate and adoption of a number of bills the government is forwarding to the National Assembly. Sar Sa-at further said that because of differing views, this session seemed unimportant. It was legally correct, however, which is something necessary for the National Assembly. What was termed a failure was the disagreement during adoption of the agenda on examining the validity of new people's representatives. The mistake of using improper words in the third item created a problem that caused the last two items to be withdrawn without hesitation by a number of assembly members. On this occasion, 41 were in favor of the items being withdrawn and 15 against; 44 abstained. There were 100 members present with 20 absentees. A National Assembly official from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] said: The withdrawal took place because there was no compromise. If there was a compromise along with the legal factor, a way out could have been found... [ellipsis as printed] What this official said seemed reasonable, based on what the National Assembly did earlier. It is still remembered that during the election of the National Assembly's second vice chairman, voting had to be done in four rounds. His Excellency Son Soubert was a candidate three times after failing to get support twice. Taking democracy into consideration, this is unacceptable! Compromise, however, is an important factor in undoing a hidden knot. Be that as it may, the National Assembly was widely criticized by outsiders and by its own members for the loss of full democracy due to this compromise. The National Assembly was perhaps trying to answer this criticism at this session by not advocating compromise to solve the issue of the third item on the agenda. The National Assembly tried to adhere seriously to the law and democracy. It was noticed that the session was conducted solely on legal grounds. Some have criticized the National Assembly Standing Committee and the government for the adjournment and unimportance of the session. The Standing Committee did not do its work properly and clearly. The government was late in forwarding bills to the National Assembly, which in turn caused problems for the National Assembly Standing Committee in organizing the agenda. One obvious fact, though, is this: The two major political parties, which have about the same number of people's representatives, did not have any intention of examining and adopting the issue of the validity of the new people's representatives during this session. Some analysts hold that if the two parties were willing to find a way out on the issue of new people's representatives, it would not have been difficult. There could be some intrigues between the two political parties behind the shelving of this issue for a while, even for a short while. A FUNCINPEC official said that the validity issue is a complex one. He refused to elaborate to our correspondent on what this complexity is. We know that the validity issue concerns 18 people's representatives -- five from the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] and 13 from FUNCINPEC -- who are to replace 18 people's representatives who are taking up public functions, which is incompatible with the role of people's representative. There are hints that FUNCINPEC does not like two CPP people's representatives -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Sin Song -- because the two already renounced their people's representative status when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] was still in Cambodia. Furthermore, the case of Nguon Non, who is replacing Khin Yean, could also cause some problems. The same FUNCINPEC official also said that FUNCINPEC will support the inclusion of Nguon Non despite some difficulties. Some analysts think that the inclusion of the new people's representatives could be done if the two parties make mutual concessions. Another noteworthy point is that FUNCINPEC may not want its men who were elected in the first place to leave the National Assembly. Some clues have been uncovered that this is also connected with monetary benefit. It is known how big the salary of a people's representative is compared to that of ministers and provincial and municipal governors and deputy governors... [ellipsis as printed] Whatever the reasons, we hold that the Constitution should be respected and the National Assembly Standing Committee ought to be courageous in its decision on this issue based on the law. Now that the two political parties think of themselves as democratic, they ought to be genuinely so.
