At the same time B. Yeltsin addressed a letter to the Federal Assembly deputies in which he pointed out that the decision to sign had been difficult, since the law contains "obvious...contradictions with the Constitution." In the very near future the legislators are to be sent a list of the president's amendments, which the head of state proposes that the deputies should adopt without waiting for the Constitutional Court's decision. In all, it is expected that there will be four amendments. In particular, the right of deputies, recorded in the law, to freely visit all organs of state power without exception, to be received without delay by leaders of all ranks, and to receive answers to their questions within reduced times is to be disputed. The right, proposed in the law, to put a deputy's question, the inclusion of additional guarantees of a deputy's immunity in the text of the law, and also the possibility granted to servicemen-legislators not to be discharged but merely to suspend their service in the Armed Forces while carrying out their duties as a deputy have also been deemed not in accordance with the Constitution. It is hard to regard the president's step of signing a rather debatable document as anything but a continuation of the policy of achieving civil accord in the country. The demonstration of a desire to cooperate with parliament really makes an impression. From this aspect the only question is whether Yeltsin will succeed in breaking the well-known trend whereby all previous similar gestures were regarded by his opponents exclusively as a weakness. In the opinion of expert jurists, however, the president's signature on the law, which he himself has publicly described as running counter to the Constitution, could have by no means so clear consequences. The prehistory of the appearance of Yeltsin's signature on the document seems characteristic in this connection. According to available information, the Law on a Deputy's Status elicited a highly suspicious attitude in the President's Staff when it was still being discussed in parliament. In the opinion of jurists on the Presidential Staff, it essentially means the Sovietization of the Federal Assembly. They believe that the legislators have been unable to overcome the stereotyped idea of the people's deputy which took shape during the years of Soviet power -- the stereotype of someone clever with voters' affairs, a pusher for the interests of his own enterprises, and a regional lobbyist, although, as stated in Article 1 of that same law, the chief and only task of the deputy is to exercise legislative power. An analysis of deputies' letters received in the staff of the president and the government confirms this thesis -- an absolute majority of them represents lobbying for their own interests or narrow group interests. But the jurists were chiefly concerned at the fact that the legislators had shown a desire to correct the Constitution not by making amendments to the Fundamental Law but by adopting legislative acts. The leaders of the power structures also came out unexpectedly against the law. As a result, even S. Filatov, head of the President's Staff, started tending toward a presidential veto of the document. Of the president's immediate entourage, virtually only G. Satarov believed that the law should still be signed. A draft edict on a presidential veto had been prepared by the State Legal Administration. At the last moment, however, to all appearances, Satarov's opinion outweighed the opinion of the rest, and Yeltsin signed the law. A casualty of these contradictions was the State Legal Administration, debarred from further work on the law. A number of jurists believe that the president should not have recognized the unconstitutionality of the law. By signing it, he assumed responsibility for the constitutionality of the law and himself violated the Constitution. According to available information, the leadership of the State Legal Administration under the president sent Yeltsin a letter which states, in particular, that, by signing the law, the president publicly recognized his double violation of the Constitution and that his political opponents are most likely making use of this circumstance.
