This Is How Turkmenistan and Russia Are Resolving Questions of Dual Citizenship and Migration"] [Text] Turkmenistan -- When, during a one-day visit to Ashgabat on the eve of the December meeting of Commonwealth heads of state, Boris Yeltsin and Saparmurad Niyazov signed an agreement on dual citizenship and regulation of the process of migration, the majority of their CIS counterparts perceived this event as unexpected and partly sensational. After all, the attitude of the leaders of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, for instance, toward the institution of dual citizenship is well known. They consider it unsuitable for the countries and peoples they head, one citing a possible decline of patriotism, and the other classifying the... indigenous population as Russian-speakers. Let me say straight away that a couple of years ago even President S. Niyazov, to put it mildly, was not a particularly ardent supporter of concluding a treaty on dual citizenship with anybody. However, in making a decisive contribution to the preparation and conclusion of the agreements, creating for the first time in nearby foreign countries a civilized legal basis for the status of Russians permanently resident on Turkmenistan's territory, and having advocated the states' responsibility as regards the fate of migrants, the Turkmen leader has proved yet again that uppermost in his mind is not personal ambition, but the interests of actual people. After all, the life and status of Slavs in Turkmenistan were and remain perhaps by far the most propitious among the millions of their compatriots who overnight became foreigners in their own homes after the great power's collapse. One of the very first laws adopted by the parliament of the now independent state proclaimed that the incitement of interethnic strife and the infringement of citizens' rights on the grounds of their belonging to a different nation or religion is a crime of the utmost severity. But, of course, this is not just a matter of lawmaking: The main point is that, through the tangible actions of the leadership in this difficult transition period, public accord and calm were successfully preserved here, and the honoring of social guarantees for all categories of citizens without exception was ensured. The exceptionally good relations, which have developed on the new basis of sovereignty with greater Russia have played a far from insignificant role. "Good relations are a remarkable thing," V. Cherepov, the Russian Federation's ambassador in Turkmenistan, told me. "But in proclaiming the aspiration to occupy a worthy place in the ranks of civilized states, we must switch all problems to a lawful channel. I agree that Russians here are somewhat better off than even our compatriots in the majority of Russia's regions. But nevertheless, just look at how many problems emerge when a family breaks up. Here, a vast unified country has collapsed, customs posts have been erected, national currencies have been introduced, and today, at times, people do not even get the chance to bury close relatives who have died in another, now also independent, republic. Look at the burden of migrants. Let me point out that the process of the migration of Russians from Turkmenistan is not a new phenomenon -- it has been going on since the 1970's. But whereas at that time migration could be compared with a couple of small fires, nowadays it is more like a universal catastrophe, the reasons for which do not need to be spelled out to anybody, I think." Every day, from early morning, a small crowd of people gather by the gates of the Russian Embassy. Similar things, no doubt, can be seen at the Russian Federation missions in many other former fraternal republics. The difference is that, although Russians in the Baltic Region are asking for assistance to regain civil rights and those in Dushanbe and Tbilisi are begging for help to escape "to anywhere," here in Ashgabat people are coming to find out when they will be able to apply for dual citizenship, and which rights and opportunities it offers them.
