FR940817-1-00058 FR940817-1-00014 • Exempting the disposition of securities pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, whether or not the securities are held by a Rule 16b&hyph;3 employee benefit plan; • Revising the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include pro rata stock dividends in which securities of a different issuer are distributed. II. Employee Benefit Plans A. Expanded Exemptions for Broad-Based Plan Transactions and Intra-Plan Transactions The principal objection raised to the amended Section 16 rules has been that the treatment of thrift, stock purchase and other broad-based, tax-qualified plans is unduly cumbersome, presents significant record-keeping problems, and discourages insiders from participation in plan funds holding employer securities. These plans are subject to significant restrictions under both the Internal Revenue Code 10 and the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''), 11 which establish an objective framework for the treatment of compensatory transactions and impose extensive administrative requirements, thereby making plan transactions less vulnerable to the abuses that the short-swing recovery provision of Section 16(b) was designed to prevent. Accordingly, the proposed rules would streamline the conditions necessary to exempt transactions in such plans from short-swing profit recovery. Comment is solicited not only on the proposals set forth, but also on whether there is any other aspect of the treatment of employee benefit plans that should be modified, either in Rule 16b&hyph;3 or any other rule relating to employee transactions. 10 26 U.S.C. et seq. (1986) (``I.R.C.''). 11 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. (1986). As discussed below, the revised rule would exempt, without conditions as to timing, any purchase transaction arising under a broad-based nondiscriminatory tax-qualified plan, other than an intra-plan transfer to or from an employer securities fund. 12 The proposed exemption would have a broader scope than the current rule, since it would be available not only to participant-directed contributory plans, but also would apply specifically to related ``excess benefit'' or ``mirror'' plans and noncontributory plans such as many employee stock ownership plans (``ESOPs''). 13 The timing restrictions governing the exemption for transfers to or from an employer stock fund in any thrift, stock purchase or similar plan, whether or not broad-based, nondiscriminatory and tax-qualified, would be more flexible. 12 Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(d) would replace Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)] in its entirety. Other transactional exemptions currently available to participant-directed plans would continue to be available. Current Rules 16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii)] are proposed to be moved to Rules 16b&hyph;3(h) and (g), respectively. See Sections II.B. and II.H, below. 13 See I.R.C. Sections 401(a) and 409. 1. Purchases Under Employee Benefit Plans In adopting the current exemption for transactions in a thrift, stock purchase, or similar ongoing securities acquisition plan, 14 the Commission reasoned that ``wide participation and equal treatment of all participating employees limits insiders' opportunities to engage in short-swing speculation.'' 15 This reasoning may support a broader exemption. 14 Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(A) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(A)]. 15 Adopting Release at Section IV.D, text following n. 201. Under the proposal, 16 all purchase transactions in a thrift, stock purchase or similar securities acquisition plan would be exempt if the plan provides for broad-based employee participation, does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. 17 In light of the requirement for broad-based participation, the proposed rule would exempt one-time acquisitions, as well as ongoing acquisitions (such as regular purchases by payroll deduction pursuant to a thrift plan). 18 The exemption would apply whether the transaction results from an employer or an employee contribution. 16 Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i). 17 I.R.C. Section 401 establishes conditions for the tax qualification of pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus plans; and I.R.C. Section 423 establishes conditions for the tax qualification of employee stock purchase plans. 18 Conforming changes are proposed to Rule 16b&hyph;3(c)(2)(i)(B) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(c)(2)(i)(B)], transaction code B in Forms 4 and 5, and General Instruction 4(a)(ii) to Form 5 to reflect deletion of the requirement that the plan be ``ongoing.'' The proposal would eliminate the exemptive requirement that insider participants who withdraw from a fund holding equity securities of the employer (``employer securities fund'') 19 either cease further employer securities fund purchases for six months or hold the securities distributed for six months. 20 Similarly, insider participants who stop participating in an employer securities fund no longer would be required to refrain from further participation for six months. 21 The six-month holding period for securities offered without a fixed price under a stock purchase plan or similar plan also would be eliminated. 22 The tax law restrictions applicable to broad-based, tax-qualified plans, such as plan contribution limits, plan benefit limits and nondiscrimination rules, 23 should be sufficient to deter insiders from using such plans as vehicles for short-term speculation. 19 Such funds would include both funds composed entirely of equity securities of the employer and mixed equity funds (except for mixed equity funds where employer equity securities do not exceed 20 percent of fund assets as of the end of the plan's latest fiscal year; see American Bar Association (June 28, 1993)). 20 Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(B) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(B)]. 21 Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(C) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(C)]. 22 Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(D) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)(i)(D)]. 23 See I.R.C. Section 401(a) (contribution limits applicable to both mandatory and voluntary contributions); I.R.C. Section 415 (limitation on ``maximum annual benefits'' for defined benefit plans and ``maximum annual additions'' for defined contribution plans); I.R.C. Section 401(m) (non-discrimination tests comparing the contribution percentage for highly compensated employees to that of all other employees); I.R.C. Section 416 (``top heavy'' rules providing rank and file employees with minimum benefits and more rapid vesting if plan benefits inure disproportionately to key employees); and I.R.C. Section 423 (prohibiting a grant to any employee who would own five percent of the stock following such grant). Finally, the proposed rule would provide an explicit exemption for purchase transactions pursuant to an ``excess benefit'' or ``mirror'' plan, 24 defined as a plan, operated in conjunction with a tax-qualified plan, that provides only the benefits or contributions that would be provided under a tax-qualified plan but for the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. 25 Although such plans technically are outside the scope of the ERISA regulatory scheme, they are operated in a manner that replicates plans that are so regulated, and accordingly are unlikely to be vehicles for speculative abuse. 24 Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(ii). 25 See, e.g., I.R.C. Sections 401(a)(17) and 415.
