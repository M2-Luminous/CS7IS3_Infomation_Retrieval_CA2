Interturbine purchased this new procedure from Ukraine. The project could yield some 35 jobs in the short term. Over the next few years, 20 million guilders will be invested in the plant in an attempt to commercialize the ceramic-coating process. Interturbine already has three plants in Lomm which repair turbines and produce engine parts. The former Soviet Union Armed Forces had been applying the ceramic coating on the engines of MiG fighter aircraft for 15 years already. The coating protects engine parts against heat and corrosion. The United States has for years been trying to learn this secret formula to which the MiG's, among other things, owe their good reputation. Until now, the West has been using a metal coating for turbines. Airplane parts can be used for 4,000 hours longer after they have been treated. Turbines for use on the ground can be used for 15,000 hours longer, according to Interturbine.
