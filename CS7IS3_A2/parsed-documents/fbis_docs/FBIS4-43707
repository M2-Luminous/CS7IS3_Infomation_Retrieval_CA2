While Iraqi managers multiply visits to Paris, an official employers' delegation is planning to travel discreetly to Baghdad on 24 or 25 June, from Jordan, where the CNPF [National Confederation of French Employers] delegation will also be staying at the same time. After Israel, Iraq. Last month, a CNPF delegation, led by its chairman Francois Perigot, made an official visit to Tel Aviv, ending years of ostracism of the Jewish state. Now it is Iraq's turn to welcome France's employers. No doubt this will be a very discreet, almost clandestine visit. The 20 or so companies on the trip (including, according to our information, Citroen, Renault, Alcatel, EDF [French Electricity Company], Schneider, Babcock, and others) have planned to make only a detour to Iraq, under the pretext of an official visit to Jordan on 24 and 25 June. But this is one of those visits whose symbolic importance outweighs its brevity. Any one can be sure that the Baghdad regime will take advantage, if only toward its public opinion, of the discussions which the French delegation will have with Iraqi leaders (no doubt with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, or even with Saddam Husayn, who doubles as head of state and head of government). It is true that Baghdad is in an unpleasant position. On 18 July, the UN Security Council will examine, as it does every two months, whether it is appropriate to maintain or lift the embargo against Iraq decreed in 1990, immediately after the invasion of Kuwait. Barring last minute surprises, everything leads us to believe that once again, the "most hideous crime of history" (as the Iraqi press describes the embargo) will be left untouched, and that, from August onward, Baghdad will have to undergo a fifth year of embargo. This status quo is due to Washington's intransigence. For Washington and its British ally, Saddam Husayn's regime has still not conformed to the many UN resolutions and "sanctions must remain in place," at least until the end of the year. France would like to be more accommodating, in the name of "progress" made by Iraq on the path of disarmament. In the name also of commercial interests. With Iraq, these were previously substantial. In 1982, in the midst of the Iran-Iraq conflict, Baghdad absorbed more than 7 percent of France's non-OECD exports, making Paris Iraq's third largest supplier of non-military goods. Oil Contracts It is the threads of this privileged relationship which the French groups are discreetly trying to retie, pending the eventual lifting of the embargo. Thus, several French companies are negotiating agreement protocols with Baghdad for the repair of equipment previously sold by France. This is already the case in the water treatment area, and will no doubt be so soon in the telephone sector. A delegation of senior officials from the Iraqi Transport and Communications Ministry is currently negotiating with Alcatel [French telecommunications concern]. "Between Frenchmen and Iraqis, the welcoming back has been warm," we are assured by a businessman who frequently shuttles between Paris and Baghdad. All these deals which are being arranged have a strong smell of oil about them. Heavily in debt and lacking foreign currency, Baghdad is relying on its crude oil resources (10 percent of world reserves) to finance the reconstruction of the country. In this area, too, French companies are in the lead (footnote 1) (Dr. Fadel A. Othman [name as published], the director general of SOMO, the company in charge of selling Iraqi crude, will be in Paris on 27 June to take part in a symposium.) For more than two years, ELF has been negotiating for the exploitation of the giant Majnoun oil field in the south of Iraq. Total is similarly negotiating for the Nahr-Umr field, also in the south of the country, while Italy's AGIP is well placed to obtain the operator slot for Halfaya, a third "giant" field. (Footnote 2) (Exploitation of a fourth giant field, that of West Kurnah, is said to have been entrusted to the Russians, who already began exploiting it several years ago with the help of the French engineering company Technip.) On each of these fields, whose exploitation will require billions of dollars, the French and Italian companies will not remain alone. If negotiations are successful, they will have to integrate their participation and, with Baghdad's blessing, bring in foreign -- probably American and British -- partners. But will ELF and Total, who maintain difficult relationships in Iraq, end up carrying off the deal after years of laborious discussions? Will Baghdad not finally prefer foreign competitors? "Negotiations are well advanced. The items still open no longer constitute an obstacle," one of the negotiators affirmed. "The decision whether or not to sign the contracts lies now with Baghdad."
