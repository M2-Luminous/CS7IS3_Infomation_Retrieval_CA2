He agrees with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) that breach of the public peace must become an imperative reason for deportations in the future, Beckstein said in Nuremberg on Wednesday [23 March]. If they commit severe crimes, even asylum-seekers who have already been recognized as such must be deported. This is also possible without amending the law, because under the Geneva Convention these recognized asylum-seekers "impair the country's security and have forfeited the right to be admitted." Turkey has promised not to threaten those deported with death sentences, nor with "inappropriate treatment."
