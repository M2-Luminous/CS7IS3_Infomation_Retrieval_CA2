(Tatyana Samolis), Yevgeniy Primakov's spokeswoman, stressed that talks on cooperation between Russian and Slovak intelligence services were in no case aimed against third countries. She described the fight against international crime as forming the priority area of cooperation. At the same time, she denied that the talks had any connection with the present political situation in Slovakia, one of the reasons being that the visit was prepared some time ago. Later, our editor Ivan Samel interviewed Augustin Marian Huska about the content of the discussion: [Begin recording] [Huska] The main concern of the discussion was to ensure that such a delicate area as the area of mutual relations in the field of information, the provision of confidential information, and the like assumes a level corresponding to that existing in democratic countries. We talked about the geopolitical situation of Slovakia and Russia. We expressed our desire that we no longer support the polarity that existed in the world previously. [Samel] You talked about geopolitical interests. Did you also hear any negative comments concerning possible Slovakia's entry into NATO? [Huska] We made it on the whole quite clear that there was in the Slovak National Council a majority will to achieve integration in European economic and defense structures. Our guest did not voice any objections to it. [Samel] Did you talk only about cooperation between the intelligence services at a political level, or were consultations on the fight against drugs and similar matters also discussed? [Huska] One could say that topic formed the biggest part of the problem where cooperation is needed most. We both have recognized that we are not professional enough to conduct the fight against organized international crime. [Samel] Did you also talk about some questions concerning the internal political situation in this country, and did this visit have any connection with this situation? [Huska] We talked about these matters only marginally in the sense that stability is very fragile or, to put it better, that the political situation both in this country and in Russia is unstable and that what we are endeavoring to achieve in Slovakia is to create a consensus among political parties and movements so that the interest of the state becomes a category that is not subject to contention between individual political forces. [Samel] Do you not regard it as dangerous to a certain degree to establish certain contacts at this delicate level precisely in the situation of instability, and here I have in mind instability in Russia? [Huska] The problem lies simply in whether we should wait until various sections of Russian or Chechen mafias establish themselves in this country. [Samel] That is clear from our viewpoint, but what was the interest on the Russian side? [Huska] To check to what extent parliamentary bodies indentify themselves with the overall trend towards the elimination of polarization in Europe, with the overall trend towards Europe drawing closer together, and towards the protection of state interests. The notion about the inviolability of frontiers made by both sides was very important. [end recording]
