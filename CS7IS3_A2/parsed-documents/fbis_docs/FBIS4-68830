Delegations of the ANATOLIA, TIKA (Turkey), TAK (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus), KYRGYZKHABAR, and KAZTAG agencies took part. Representatives of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan were unable to make it to the capital of Kyrgyzstan for technical reasons. The conference showed once again the enormous possibilities of concerted activity in the accomplishment of the common professional, technical, and financial tasks of the agencies in the pursuit of the domestic and foreign policy of the sovereign fraternal states. The opinion that such activity should be shaped on the basis of the priorities of the official policy of each country, with regard to the documents and agreements adopted by their leaders, was expressed. It should be based on a desire to create an objective and multifaceted notion of the life of each country in order to counterpose its product to the alternative and frequently unscrupulous information structures. The main direction of the cooperation of the united agencies, however, the conferees believe, is a concerted information policy, the coordination of the development and use of their professional and technological communications resources, and the joint defense of national interests in international organizations of the press and television, which would afford new opportunities for unrestricted and multilateral information exchange. Decisions on financial and organizational questions of the subsequent activity of the joint agency of the Turkic-speaking countries (TKA), which was created last year at the first conference, which was held in Ankara, were adopted. The participants in the meeting agreed to institute the publication of a joint bulletin, which would publish news of an economic and cultural nature. It would subsequently be disseminated in the world information space in English, German, and Spanish. For the realization of this project it is contemplated establishing a computer network among the members of the TKA. The conferees were received by Askar Akayev, president of Kyrgyzstan. He supported the idea of the TKA being open for membership by the press agencies of other Turkic-speaking countries and emphasized that this was in keeping with the initiative of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, concerning the creation of a Eurasian Union. Permanent information exchange, Askar Akayev said, will serve not only the rapprochement of peoples with common historical roots and cultural traditions but also the building of a new economy based on market relations.
