FR940304-1-00157 FR940304-1-00014 The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of ovens. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for all classes of conventional cooking tops, standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $10 million, whereas there would be net present value savings for levels 2&hyph;5 of $3.01 billion, $1.57 billion, negative $1.62 billion, and negative $3.39 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. Microwave ovens . A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For microwave ovens, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 4 and level 5, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the five candidate standard levels, units meeting level 2 had the lowest consumer life-cycle cost for microwave ovens. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.8. However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the average affected consumer of $14.15 for microwave ovens; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $14.77 and standard level 3 by $14.12. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that standard levels 1 through 3 would not cause any economic burden on the average consumer. Standard levels 4 and 5 would increase average life-cycle costs by $.03 and $20.31, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.16. The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of microwave ovens. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that for microwave ovens, standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.74 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;5 are $0.78 billion, $0.70 billion, negative $0.67 billion, and negative $2.64 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. C. Energy savings . As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of energy consumption for conventional ovens, conventional cooking tops and microwave ovens. D. Lessening of utility or performance of products . As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of conventional ovens, conventional cooking tops, and microwave ovens. E. Impact of lessening of competition . The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need of the nation to save energy. Conventional ovens . Conventional ovens use electricity and gas directly. In 1987, 4.0 percent of residential sector source electricity (or 0.42 quad) and 4.4 percent of natural gas consumption (or 0.23 quad) were accounted for on a national basis by conventional ovens. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A. 41 Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO 2 ). For all classes of conventional ovens at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated SO 2 reduction would be over 51,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of SO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.03 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;5, the reductions are 92,000 tons; 202,000 tons; 239,000 tons; and 405,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.20 percent. 41 See footnote 37.
