He reported that in fact the Black Sea Fleet command does its best to ignore the Ukrainian side and is directly subordinated to the command of the Navy of the Russian Federation. The recent unannounced training exercises conducted by a large group of ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which were not approved by the appropriate structures, serve as further evidence of this. Temporary regulations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are being introduced in the formations [zyednannya] and units of the Fleet. An earnest effort is under way to educate Black Sea Fleet personnel exclusively in the traditions of the Russian Army and Navy, despite the fact that more than 50 percent of the men serving in the Fleet are conscripts from Ukraine. This is particularly evident in the case of the naval infantry brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. In violation of the existing agreement regarding manning the Fleet with equal numbers of conscripts from Ukraine and Russia, brigade personnel who have been discharged into the reserves are being replaced exclusively by conscripts from the Russian Federation. The men in this formation are being told that they are serving in a naval infantry brigade of the Armed Forces of Russia. This is eloquently confirmed by the fact that the members of the brigade wear Russian insignia on their uniforms, that the St. Andrew's flag flies over the staff headquarters, and by certain other facts. In addition, there has recently been a marked increase in office facilities and equipment [orhtekhnika] provided for the subunits of this formation, and the number of personnel in the brigade has more than doubled. It is Oleksiy Ryzhenko's view that in order to prevent a rise in tensions in the Crimean region, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet must do everything in his power to ensure that no actions are taken in violation of existing agreements and the principles of equality and brotherhood established in the relations between the people of Ukraine and Russia and the Armed Forces of our two states.
