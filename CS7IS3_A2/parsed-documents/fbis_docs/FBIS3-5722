The repair and readjustment of farm machines has been completed and the reservoirs are filled with water. Substantial preparations for sowing have been made, and carrying composts to paddy and non-paddy fields and carpeting fields with humus soil have entered the finishing stage. Unjong-ri is 30 kilometres away from the seat of Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province, in the central west of Korea. The village surrounded with high and low mountains looks like a picture. It has turned into a modern socialist village good to live and work in under the deep care of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. He visited it (then Tanghyon-ri, Sohung County) in winter 30 odd years ago and told by farmers there that they had eked out a hand-to-mouth existence with mountain-side tilling and charcoal-making before the liberation of the country, he unfolded a bright prospect for rural construction. He said the farmers in the mountain areas must turn the mountains to advantage, if they were to be well off and that they must create orchards on sunny hillside, raise silkworms, and actively tap mountain resources to improve their living standard. Saying they should rezone small plots into paddy fields and build many modern houses, he indicated a concrete orientation and ways. This place has changed beyond recognition since then. Two-and three-storied modern houses for hundreds of families, a nursery, a kindergarten, schools, a hospital and public welfare facilities are standing in rows along the scenic Tanghyon River. Thirty five hectares of paddy fields fit for tillage by machines have taken shape in the place where not a plot of paddy field could be seen before liberation. And nearly 200 hectares of orchards and more than 700 hectares of forests of economic value have been created. Tractors, rice-transplanting machines, rice plucking machines and other farm machines have relieved the agricultural working people from toil. Agricultural production has grown every year, the output of grain jumping 3.6 times, meat 4.6 times, fruits 7.6 times and vegetables 21 times as against 30 years ago. Tanghyon-ri was renamed Unjong (benevolence)-ri in October 1981 to hand down through generations the deep loving care shown by the dear leader for the farmers there. Such change as in Unjong-ri can be seen everywhere in Korea.
