Background On September 13, 1989, Dassault Aviation, B.P. 24, 33701 Mérignac Cédex, France, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model Falcon 2000 airplane. The Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 is a medium-sized transcontinental business jet powered by two General Electric/Garrett CFE 738 turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 5,600 lbs. thrust. The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers and eight passengers. Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.17 of the FAR, Dassault Aviation must show that the Falcon 2000 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;69. The certification basis may also include later amendments to part 25 that are not relevant to these special conditions. In addition, the certification basis for the Falcon 2000 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.17(a)(2). Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Novel or Unusual Design Features The Falcon 2000 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays and digital electronic engine controls. These systems may be vulnerable to high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane. Discussion There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are needed for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000, which require that new technology electrical and electronic systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of HIRF. High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics systems to HIRF must be established. It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe shielding. b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. ␣ 1Frequency 1Peak (V/M) 1Average (V/M) 10 KHz&hyph;100 KHz 50 50 100 KHz&hyph;500KHz 60 60 500 KHz&hyph;2 MHz 70 70 2 MHz&hyph;30 MHz 200 200 30 MHz&hyph;100 MHz 30 30 100 MHz&hyph;200 MHz 150 33 200 MHz&hyph;400 MHz 70 70 400 MHz&hyph;700 MHz 4,020 935 700 MHz&hyph;1 GHz 1,700 170 1 GHz&hyph;2 GHz 5,000 990 2 GHz&hyph;4 GHz 6,680 840 4 GHz&hyph;6 GHz 6,850 310 6 GHz&hyph;8 GHz 3,600 670 8 GHz&hyph;12 GHz 3,500 1,270 12 GHz&hyph;18 GHz 3,500 360 18 GHz&hyph;40 GHz 2,100 750 As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000. Should Dassault Aviation apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, these special conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1).
