The two ministers will discuss issues concerning mutual security, European defense, and the two countries' roles in the all-European integration process. Prior to his departure for Bulgaria, Minister Ruehe answered some questions especially for the readers of BULGARSKA ARMIYA. [Popova] Mr. Ruehe, for the first time in more than 50 years a German defense minister is to visit Bulgaria. How do you assess this fact and what does this new reality indicate? [Ruehe] I would first like to point out that I am very glad to be able to visit Bulgaria. As you know, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov was in Germany last fall. The new features in our countries' military-political relations that are reflected in the bilateral agreement on cooperation in defense policy create prerequisites for a new responsibility that our states have to bear in relation to European stability. [Popova] During your Bulgarian counterpart's visit to Germany last fall you reached agreement on closer cooperation between your two ministries, especially in staff education. What projects have been implemented and which ones will be put into effect in the future? [Ruehe] This year our two armies carried out a lively exchange of officers, through which your officers visited various Bundeswehr educational institutions. Many Bulgarian officers are in Germany at the moment attending various courses; some are attending Bundeswehr language schools and others are undergoing practical training in internal administration. We plan a further 30 such arrangements this year alone, including an exchange of lecturers between our staff colleges. [Popova] Last year you issued an assurance that Bulgaria can count on German support in its efforts to join NATO. The serious situation in the Balkans at the moment requires a new security policy. Will you also assist Bulgaria in this respect? [Ruehe] NATO's decision to open itself up to partners from throughout Europe should be regarded as one of the alliance's priority tasks. It gives countries like Bulgaria a good picture of future prospects. The Partnership For Peace program that Bulgaria joined last February enables us to cooperate with our partners from the east, deepen our relations with them, and at the same time to react flexibly to the needs of individual states. In this way the future members can be systematically prepared for joining these structures late. The Partnership For Peace is the first important step on the road to integration. It should under no circumstances be interpreted or understood as some kind of second league position. Accordingly, Bulgaria can rely on our full support in the future. [Popova] What do you think about Bulgarian policy on the Balkan crisis? [Ruehe] I believe that Bulgaria will stick with its previous policy and do everything necessary to promote the peace process in the Balkans. Precisely in connection with the embargo imposed on the Danube, we attach great importance to Bulgaria because of geographical position. According to my information, Bulgaria is a model in this respect, despite the great economic losses it is suffering. Sarajevo, the talks between Croatia and Bosnia, and the recent events in Tuzla have demonstrated that only firm determination and intensive political and diplomatic efforts can provide a chance for the peace process. It has also become clear that a peaceful solution in the Balkans needs Russia to become involved and exert its influence. Bulgaria has an important part to play here as well.
