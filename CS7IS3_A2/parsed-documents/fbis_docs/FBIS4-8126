FBIS4-8126 "dreeu069_c_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC UN, NATO Decision for Air Strike Supported UN, NATO Decision for Air Strike Supported LD1104130794 Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in Czech 1200 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104130794 Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network Czech BFN [Text] The Czech Foreign Ministry reacted to Sunday's [10 April] NATO air strike on Serbian positions near the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde. Czech Radio received the ministry's statement from ministry's press spokesman Vit Kurfuerst. The Czech Foreign ministry supports yesterday's decision by the UN and NATO on the air strike in the vicinity of Gorazde, which was done in full accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. The Foreign Ministry is concerned about the continuing escalation of fighting in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, which has been declared a security zone by Security Council Resolution 824. Of special concern are the intensifying artillery attacks against Gorazde, which lead not only to civilian suffering but also to the immediate threat on the UN military observers. The Foreign Ministry considers the NATO air strike coordinated by the United Nations as another warning signal to the initiators of this conflict and appeals to Bosnian Serb leaders not to reject a return to the negotiating table. The Foreign Ministry considers yesterday's action as further confirmation of the credibility of UN attempts to settle the situation in former Yugoslavia peacefully. Further extension of war acts could thwart the results of international attempts for the peaceful settlement achieved so far and bring the situation in the whole crisis area to a head.
