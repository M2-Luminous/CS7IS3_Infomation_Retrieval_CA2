FR940620-0-00130 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. The NPRM proposed that where parking is provided for visitors, two percent of the spaces, but not less than one, must be accessible. Very few comments were received regarding this provision. However, the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards and the New Mexico Governor's Committee on Concerns of the Handicapped recommended clarifying the provision so that two percent of all parking on a site in excess of one parking space per dwelling unit be accessible. Response. This provision is modified by dropping the term ``visitor'' parking and including a provision requiring two percent of parking in excess of one parking space per dwelling unit to be accessible. 13.3.2(5)␣Elevators This provision requires that, if provided, elevators shall comply with ADAAG 4.10. In addition, there are exceptions allowing the installation of an accessible private residence elevator or a platform lift complying with ADAAG 4.11 to connect levels within an individual dwelling unit. Comment. Commenters generally supported requiring elevators in public spaces to comply with ADAAG 4.10. However, with regard to a means of accessing different levels within a dwelling unit, a number of commenters noted that they find platform lifts undesirable. Most objected to their use in new construction. The California Department of Rehabilitation noted that lifts should not be allowed in new construction and that there are other alternatives such as elevators and ramps. In addition, EPVA objected to viewing platform lifts used in lieu of an elevator complying with ADAAG 4.10 as ``equivalent facilitation.'' They noted, however that ``. . . economic and space constraints suggest equivalent facilitation can be provided within individual dwelling units by private residence elevators *␣*␣*'' No commenters suggested that an elevator complying with ADAAG 4.10 should be required within a single dwelling unit. Response. The use of platform lifts in dwelling units is consistent with the limited circumstances in which they may be used in other types of facilities addressed in ADAAG 4.1.3(5) EXCEPTION 4. However, accessible private residence elevators are also a viable design alternative for dwelling units. Application of each of the exceptions must be considered carefully during the design of the dwelling unit. For example, inclined platform lifts may not reduce the width of an exit stair and their use may greatly increase the space consumed by a stair complying with State and local codes. Alternatively, private residence elevators may require less square footage. Generally, the initial costs of platform lifts are lower than those of accessible private residence elevators. Finally, applicable State and local codes should be considered when selecting a means of vertical access. With regard to commenters' concerns regarding the equivalent facilitation provision in the NPRM, ADAAG 2.2 does not invite elements to be used in lieu of other required elements unless they provide equal or greater access. For this reason, the provision allowing platform lifts has been revised and is included as an exception. The new text permitting accessible private residence elevators is also an exception to this provision because elevators complying with ADAAG 4.10 are designed for public, not residential, use. 13.3.2(6)␣Doors This provision requires doors provided for passage in and to accessible spaces to comply with ADAAG 4.13. In addition, where peepholes are provided in other dwelling units, entry doors to dwelling units are required to have a peephole for use by a seated person. Although comments were received regarding bathroom door swing, few comments were received on this provision. A commenter noted that persons with hearing impairments would benefit from a peephole for security purposes. This requirement has been added. Doors in bathrooms are addressed at ADAAG 13.3.3(1). 13.3.2(7)␣Entrances This provision requires at least one principal entrance to the dwelling unit to comply with ADAAG 4.14. Where provided, additional entrances should also be accessible. Comment. There were few comments on this provision. Of the comments received, the majority supported requiring all of the entrances to be accessible. An architect noted that the guidelines should specify that the accessible entrance be the ``primary'' entrance to the dwelling unit. Independent Housing Services of San Francisco, California supported requiring all entrances to be accessible, unless technically infeasible. One commenter indicated that a dwelling unit with only one means of egress is a fire hazard. Response. Entrances to dwelling units usually serve as means of egress. An appendix note at A13.3.2 indicates that a second means of egress from a dwelling unit is recommended for emergency evacuation purposes. In addition, language has been added to this provision indicating that additional entrances, where provided, should be accessible. This does not require these additional entrances to be accessible, but rather urges designers to consider both the safety and convenience of residents. A requirement that all entrances be accessible may be extremely costly. For example, the designer of a single-family dwelling unit may wish to access a basement from the exterior by a flight of stairs. In this example, the designer might have to forego an exterior entrance to the basement. A multifamily dwelling unit may have a secondary entrance or exit from the kitchen. If this secondary entrance is required to be accessible, a latch side clearance of eighteen inches is required adjacent to a door with a 32 inch clear width. In this example, a galley kitchen might have to be significantly wider than planned due to the added requirement for latch side clearance. As for technical infeasibility, this term applies only to alterations, not new construction. Technical infeasibility is very narrowly applied to existing structural or site constraints. 13.3.2(8)␣Storage This provision requires that at least one of each type of fixed or built-in storage facility in accessible spaces in dwelling units, including cabinets, shelves, closets, and drawers comply with ADAAG 4.25. No comments were received on this provision and no changes have been made. Comments regarding kitchen storage are addressed at ADAAG 13.3.4(10). 13.3.2(9)␣Controls
