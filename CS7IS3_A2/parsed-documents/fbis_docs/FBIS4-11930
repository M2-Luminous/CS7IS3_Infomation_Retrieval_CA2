It cannot guarantee the protection of Hebron's inhabitants from settlers or occupation troops. An international protection force that does not have a deterrent weapon, even to defend itself, cannot protect Palestinian citizens from settler terrorism and occupation troop bullets. The alleged Israeli withdrawal will be nothing more than a redeployment of Israeli forces. They will still be able to interfere and kill Arab citizens at any moment. It is inconceivable that the international protection force will be confined to only one of many occupied Palestinian cities and that its inhabitants will be left subject to continued Israeli attacks that are escalating in a flagrant brutal manner. Wide popular and official Palestinian and Arab circles have criticized the recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement. They regarded it as a result of tough Israeli and U.S. pressure on the Palestinian side. What draws our attention is the fact that the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian leadership has not affected the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in any way whatsoever, nor has it reduced escalating Israeli campaigns of terrorism, repression, and killing of Arab citizens. It has not limited mass arrest campaigns among the sons of Palestine. Numerous Palestinian martyrs and wounded Palestinians fall every day at the hands of Israeli occupation authorities. The Palestinian police will deploy in Gaza and Jericho this week, according to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. This police force will be linked to the occupation authorities and under their supervision and orders. It is feared that this force will become a tool of repression against the inhabitants of Gaza and Jericho and strike at the glorious intifadah there. If this occurs, the Palestinian people will have lost a strong bargaining chip. The Palestinian leadership's involvement in signing the recent agreement with Israel only gave vent to a wave of Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic wrath triggered by the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. No doubt, Israel's isolation of the Palestinian leadership in the absence of Arab coordination has led to such tragic results.
