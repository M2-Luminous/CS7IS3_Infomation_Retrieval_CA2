On the Global Forum program, which according to reports was viewed by more than 200 million people in different parts of the world, including the United States of course, Clinton backed the Torricelli Law and said that Cuba should assume the model of democracy that is pleasing to Washington, so that the United States can modify its policy toward our country. Up to a certain point his desire to secure the electoral votes of the State of Florida for his aspirations to be reelected as president weighs on White House decisions regarding Cuba. Despite the previous points, which are a variation of the same issue, certain tones were observed in Clinton's answer to reporter Taladrid, of Cuban television. I believe that, despite all the boring anti-Cuba rhetoric that in fact violates principles of international rights, the UN Charter, and the reformed agreements of the General Accord on Tariffs and Trade, the anti-Cuba policy of the current U.S. Administration is not identical to that of the Republican decade. Maybe, during his second and last term, Clinton will listen to the demands of important sectors from political, industrial, trade, and intellectual circles within the United States and decide to modify the conservative and outdated aspects of his predecessors' anti-Cuba policy. But the fact remains that today, taking into account the aforementioned tones, that the policy of imperial hegemony remains in force.
