Entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women", the white paper says that China's people's congresses at all levels are responsible for drafting and revising laws and statutes to protect women's rights and interests. They supervise the implementation of relevant laws and governmental work to safeguard the position of women and children. Committees at all echelons of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), it says, carry out democratic supervision and provide political consultation on legislations concerning women's rights and interests and their implementation. The white paper says that people's governments at each level and their departments are responsible for drafting and revising women-related administrative regulations, issuing relevant decisions and orders, linking women's advance with social development, and adopting administrative measures to oversee the protection of women's rights and interests. Judicial bodies at all levels, in accordance with legal procedures, hear and judge cases and punish criminals who infringe on women's rights and interests and see to it that laws are upheld, it says. The white paper notes that to coordinate and propel governmental departments in their work of guaranteeing the rights of women, the State Council has established a work committee for women and children. Similar local government bodies have also been set up in all the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, with the exception of Taiwan. It says that more than 5,800 mass women's organizations in China are an important force in safeguarding the status of women. The biggest of these is the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), which aims to represent and defend the interests of women and devotes itself to promoting sexual equality and raising women's position in society. The country's mass media, including the press, radio and television, publicize state laws and regulations upholding women's rights and interests and civilized and progressive views on women. This has greatly promoted public awareness of women's rights and contributions to society, the white paper says. It lists some of the laws and statutes on the protection of women's rights and interests promulgated in recent years, such as the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, the notice on reprisals against trafficking in women and children, the decision on the strict prohibition against prostitution and whoring and the decision regarding the severe punishment of the criminals who abduct and traffic in or kidnap women or children. Female self-improvement is a strategic task fundamental to the protection of women's rights and interests, the white paper says, adding "the slogan of 'four selfs' (self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening) was first raised at the sixth national congress of women. Then, the seventh national congress of women adopted a 10-point goal for the advancement of Chinese women in the 1990s. The 'four selfs' slogan and the 10-point goal produced a widespread impact upon women and society. Inspired by them, millions of Chinese women are realizing their own betterment and progress in the course of propelling society forward."
