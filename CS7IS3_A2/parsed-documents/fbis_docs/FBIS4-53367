A senior South Korean Government official said that the number of North Korean loggers in Siberia, which has been as high as 20,000, is currently estimated at only 7,000 to 8,000. "The withdrawal operation became active from the beginning of this year and it is continuing as the Seoul government has decided to allow fleeing North Korean loggers to settle in South Korea," the official said, requesting anonymity. The withdrawal could also be attributed to either a decline in seasonal demand or to a delay in the renewal of the North Korean-Russian logging agreement, he said. The official said he could not say whether Pyongyang's action had anything to do with the Seoul government's decision to resettle all willing loggers in the South and Moscow's agreement to support the South Korean move.
