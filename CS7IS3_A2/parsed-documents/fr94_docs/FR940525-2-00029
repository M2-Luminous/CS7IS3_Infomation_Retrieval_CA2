SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's ``Statement of Policy; Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act'' of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), dated April 6, 1994, has been received from the Department of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1630 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706-1598. The purpose of the proposed testing is to evaluate the efficacy of a genetically modified strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae in reducing the incidence of bacterial brown spot of beans. The genetically modified strain was derived from a wild type strain through the introduction of Tn5 transposon using a recombinant transposon delivery plasmid. The proposed field tests would be conducted in the State of Wisconsin on a total area of less than 10 acres. Dated: May 12, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12700 Filed 5&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
