They regard the recreation of a parliamentary TV service as an attempt to make it impossible for the electorate to form an objective opinion of deputies' activities. The same tendency can be observed in the attempts by other authorities to bend the media to their will and make them a mouthpiece of their time-serving interests. It is inadmissible that the broadcasting time belonging to the whole society should be split into departmental domains, or even worse, be monopolized, the statement of the journalists' unions stresses.
