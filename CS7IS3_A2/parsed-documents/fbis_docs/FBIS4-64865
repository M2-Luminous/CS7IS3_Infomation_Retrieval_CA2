A spokesman for the ministry thereby reacted to a BILD AM SONNTAG report, according to which foreign and German firms demand payments from the government totaling 440 million German marks, because the Defense Ministry failed to carry out arms deliveries from National People's Army stocks that it had promised during the time of the GDR. The deliveries were agreed upon with the GDR government under former Disarmament and Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann. The Defense Ministry spokesman said that with Germany's unification in 1990, all contracts with private arms dealers were canceled. Only contracts that did not violate the War Weapons Control Law were accepted. Following that delivery halt, the ministry had in fact been sued repeatedly for noncompliance with its contractual obligations, but it had not lost a single case. He added that one lawsuit was still pending, but here, too, the prospects of success were good.
