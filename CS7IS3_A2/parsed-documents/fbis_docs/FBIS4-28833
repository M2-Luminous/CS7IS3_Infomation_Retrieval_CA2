After North Korea suddenly reported its withdrawal from the IAEA yesterday [13 June], government officials at the National Unification Board and the Foreign Ministry stayed in their offices late at night to grasp the real intention of North Korea by communicating with friendly nations, such as the United States and Japan. They also came to their offices earlier than usual this morning and are trying to seek measures, anticipating North Korea's countermeasure against possible sanctions by the UN Security Council. Regarding North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from the IAEA, a government official said: North Korea's action is analyzed to have double purpose, to express its dissatisfaction at the recent adoption of the IAEA resolution on sanctions against it and to convey its strong message against the future sanctions by the UN Security Council. He continued: The government will strongly cope with North Korea's threatening offensive, acting in concert with the international community's effort to guarantee North Korea's nuclear transparency. Another government official said: Even after it declared that it was withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea did not mention that it would not allow nuclear inspections at all, but said that it would not allow inspections for a limited time until it decides whether to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. This hints at North Korea's will to completely withdraw from the NPT system if the UN Security Council makes a decision to impose sanctions against it. He then anticipated that such an action by North Korea, however, would not block the international community's process to push for sanctions by the UN Security Council.
