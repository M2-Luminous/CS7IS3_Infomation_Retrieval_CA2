On Monday afternoon, the defense minister did not rule out that "a few dozen men" who are part of a medical unit would be sent in a few days to western Rwanda. The minister had said in the morning that Paris had asked Belgium to give it logistical aid -- more specifically, a medical unit -- for its Operation Turquoise in Rwanda. Another government source, however, indicated to BELGA that it was unlikely that a single Belgian soldier would be sent to Africa. In this case, Belgian aid will be limited to providing medical aid, but without any human presence whatsoever.
