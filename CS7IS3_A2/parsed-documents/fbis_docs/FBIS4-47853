We hear of millions of ballot papers disappearing and we have just heard about a computer program being tampered with. Was there sabotage? [Kriegler] Concerning the distribution aspect I would rather keep an open mind. The case is being investigated and there are signs indicating sabotage, but at this stage, in my opinion, these allegations are not strong enough to base a decision on. Concerning the computer -- that was undoubtedly sabotage. It was not accidental, the fact that early yesterday morning during a specified period, certain false data was fed into the computer.
