FR940825-2-00120 FR940825-2-00077 Mine Safety and Health Administration Petitions for Modification The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 1. Genwal Coal Company (Amendment) [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;116&hyph;C] Genwal Coal Company, P.O. Box 1420, Huntington, Utah 84528 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its Crandall Canyon Mine (I.D. No. 42&hyph;01715) located in Emery County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to use belt air to ventilate the face area; to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals as an early warning device in belt entries used as intake air courses; and to provide two separate and distinct intake air escapeways to the miners working in the development sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. Three Way Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;117&hyph;C] Three Way Coal Company, P.O. Box 17, Brachdale, Pennsylvania 17923 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its Little Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08332) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because of the steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternative, when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device. 3. Red Oak Mining Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;118&hyph;C] Red Oak Mining Company, P.O. Box 210, Westover, Pennsylvania 16692 has filed to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1103&hyph;4(a)(3) (automatic fire sensor and warning device systems) to its South Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07810) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in all belt entries where a monitoring system identifies a sensor location instead of having a detection system in each belt flight. The petitioner states that the carbon monoxide monitoring system would be capable of providing both a visual and audible alarm signal that would be activated when the carbon monoxide level at any sensor reaches 10 ppm above the ambient level of the mine, and that all miners would be withdrawn to a safe location unless the cause for the alarm is determined not be hazardous to the miners. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4. Red Oak Mining Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;119&hyph;C] Red Oak Mining Company, P.O. Box 210, Westover, Pennsylvania 16692 has filed to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its South Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07810) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in conveyor belt entries used as intake air courses that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals when the carbon monoxide level at any sensor is 10 ppm above the ambient level for the mine, when an audible alarm signal is different from the alert signal, and when the carbon monoxide level reaches 15 ppm above the ambient level for the mine. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
