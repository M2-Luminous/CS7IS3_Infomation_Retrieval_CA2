The main thing for us is for Pyongyang to meet its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. If the UN Security Council considers a resolution requiring North Korea to admit International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to its nuclear installations, Russia's representative will vote in favor," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov, who is responsible for the Far East region at the Foreign Ministry, said during an interview with IZVESTIYA. It was Panov's statement to journalists early this week that caused a slight shock around the world. News agencies carried flashes that Moscow intends to observe the 1961 treaty between the Soviet Union and the DPRK and offer Pyongyang assistance "in the event of unprovoked aggression." "My words were taken out of context," Panov explained. "When answering the journalist's questions I only reiterated our position, which contains nothing new; it was formulated a year ago. Russia as the legal successor to the USSR will fulfill its commitments under the 1961 treaty. However, mindful of the fact that the world situation is totally different now, we will act on the basis of our own analysis, act in Russia's interests, and take into consideration not only the treaty with North Korea, but also our country's other international commitments, including on nuclear nonproliferation." You could see from what the deputy minister said that he wanted to place the emphasis on the latter part of his answer but journalists focused their attention on the first sentence. As a result a distorted notion of Russia's approach developed. Nevertheless, Panov asserts that both Seoul and Washington have correctly appraised the situation. Moscow quite possibly had to provide additional explanations to ensure that. Be that as it may, U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Wednesday that his country does not feel worried by what the Russian diplomat said. And South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, acknowledging Russia's role in settling the crisis, has decided to send Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to Moscow. According to reports from Smolenskaya Square [Russian Foreign Ministry], the visit, the dates of which have not yet been agreed, will presumably go ahead in the second half of April. While trying to exploit the situation on the Korean Peninsula to strengthen its positions in Asia, Russia is at the same time by no means keen to fall out with Washington and Seoul over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Significantly, Moscow, unlike Beijing, is willing to back a UN Security Council resolution designed to step up international pressure on the "great leader." Russia has no wish to gain a reputation as the patron of a loathsome Communist regime. And however much people in Pyongyang may recall a treaty dating back 33 years, its significance should hardly be overestimated. In conversation with IZVESTIYA Aleksandr Panov admitted that "unprovoked aggression" by any state against the DPRK is virtually impossible at the moment. Consequently there are no grounds for talking, even hypothetically, about military aid for Kim Il-song from Moscow.
