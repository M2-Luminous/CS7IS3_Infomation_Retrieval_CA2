Any result from such an investigation would be to its favor. If the death were natural, caused by asthma, there would be no problem. If it were natural, caused by other reasons, death is something inevitable and there would be no case. If there were an injury that resulted in death and the Interior Ministry brought the one responsible to trial, this could serve as a model of justice. In the past the Interior Ministry has brought more than one officer to trial on charges of attacking citizens. This improves the image of the police and is considered a sign of respect for the feelings of people. The government could gain a great deal as a result of this. [passage omitted] Resorting to the prosecution and the courts does not tarnish the image of the police. It would show that the government respects human rights and wants justice to be done. It also would end the complaints that some people have against the government. It is true that terrorists must be dealt with firmly if they try to resist or attempt to resist. Our disagreement with the government is on its measures for detaining people and the need to respect human rights during questioning. It is better for the government to capture people alive, because they can provide information. The Egyptian Human Rights Association issued a statement about the incident which did not make any specific charges, but expressed doubts. Nothing can remove these doubts except a neutral judicial- medical investigation. [passage omitted]
