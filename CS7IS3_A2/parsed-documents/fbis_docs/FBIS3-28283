FBIS3-28283 "dreas024__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-024-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Poll on Political Reform, Hosokawa Popularity OW0302140194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302140194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide telephone poll on 30 and 31 January on the public's attitude toward the enactment of the political reform bills and future directions of party regrouping. As a result, 57 percent said the political reform package is "no good" on the point that it failed in ruling out the business sector's political donations to individual politicians while 66 percent welcomed the enactment of the reform package as a whole. Nevertheless, only 23 percent said "the Japanese politics will be made better by the package," and 63 percent said "no change will happen." The majority said the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] "had better break up," and 59 percent think moves toward further regrouping of political circles "will be accelerated." The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was 74 percent. The telephone survey was conducted immediately after the enactment of the political bills at the last moment of the extraordinary Diet session which closed on 29 January. ASAHI SHIMBUN interviewed 2,000 eligible voters all over the country, and obtained responses from 56 percent of them. On the fact that the reform bills did not prohibit the business sector's donations to individual politicians, only 25 percent showed positive responses to that. Even among the pro-LDP group, 49 percent were against such donations, compared with 39-percent support for the practice. Regarding the new election system for the lower house, 39 percent said the system which gives 300 seats to single-seat constituencies and 200 to proportional representation constituencies is "favorable," and 23 percent said it is "unfavorable." It appeared many voters cannot judge whether the new election system is good or bad, as 38 percent gave no answer or said they do not know. Differing opinions were also seen in a question asking if the respondent thinks politics would become less expensive under the new election system. In response to the question, 36 percent said "politics would become less expensive," 36 percent said "politics would become more expensive," and 30 percent were in the "other answers or no answer" category. When asked if the political reform package is valuable as a whole, 5 percent said "very valuable," 61 percent said "valuable," 21 percent said "not very valuable," and 4 percent said "valueless." As a result, 66 percent showed positive responses toward the package, while 25 percent were against it. Nevertheless, only 23 percent said Japanese politics would "become better" under the new political system. It appears the public is showing favorable responses to the Diet decision on political reform, but is coolly watching future development. In connection with the LDP's and the SDPJ's internal struggles over the political reform issue, 51 percent said "the LDP had better break up," and 56 percent said "the SDPJ had better break up." While only 25 percent of the pro-LDP group called for the LDP breakup, 41 percent of the SDPJ supporters called for a breakup of the party. The degree of expectations for future regrouping of political parties varies depending on the respondents' political stances. The percentage of those who answered party regrouping would be "further accelerated" was around 50 percent among the LDP and SDPJ supporters, but the number exceeded 70 percent among Komeito and Shinsento [Japan Renewal Party] supporters. To conduct general elections under the new election system, the Diet has to work out some frameworks, such as redesigning of election constituencies. But 61 percent of the respondents showed cautious stances toward an early dissolution of the lower house and general elections. The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was 74 percent, and the non-support rate was 12 percent. In our telephone poll in September, the support and non-support rates were 73 and 11 percent, respectively. The latest survey showed the support rate remains high. In our interview surveys (of 3,000 eligible voters), the support rates for the Hosokawa cabinet were 71 percent in September, 70 percent in November, and 60 percent in December. Although the data from different surveys cannot be compared with our latest survey result, the support rate is probably picking up after the decline in December.
