He also invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba through mixed enterprises or joint ventures. The proposal was made to Industry, Commerce, and Integration Minister Liliana Canale during a working meeting in her office. Robaina, who carried a list, proposed that some 200 products be placed on the list of products that benefit from the partial agreement that allows the importation of products with a zero import tax. Currently only about a dozen products do not pay import taxes. This greatly restricts trade between Peru and Cuba. Cuba thus would export medicine, rum, citrus fruit, and sugar cane, while Peru would export fish meal and minerals, among other goods. Robaina also proposed that a commercial mission visit Cuba in June. Peru has yet to answer the invitation. The commercial mission would be headed by Minister Canale, who would be accompanied by private businessmen who have expressed interest in investing in Cuba, in the tourism field especially. After the meeting, Minister Canale said she is carefully assessing the Cuban proposals in order to give an answer as soon as possible. She said contact will be made with the business sector to reach a consensus regarding the products that could be imported. She explained that the mechanism is similar to the one upheld by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], through which the continent's countries have reached similar agreements in the region. Canale said the purpose of the commercial mission's trip would be to identify trade prospects between the two countries, although she added that the trip's date has not been established yet. She then added that the Cuban foreign minister's visit has awakened interest in investing in that country and that there are businessmen who want to step up the exchange of experiences. Canale said her ministry is willing to support every effort designed to step up commercial relations with that Caribbean island and added that the Cuban authorities' proposal is being studied. Regarding her possible trip, Minister Canale said she is reviewing her agenda to determine whether or not she will be able to travel to Cuba in the near future because she is very willing to visit Fidel Castro's country. Contact between the two countries will be maintained through the respective foreign ministries, which will be kept informed of the decisions made in the coming months. When asked about the Cuban proposal, Confiep [National Confederation of Private Business] President Arturo Woodman answered immediately, saying he is in favor of tax exemptions. He said it is up to the government to make a decision in this regard, but said he was in favor of the immediate implementation of tax exemptions in order to step up trade between the two countries. He said it would be a good thing to increase trade between the two countries because it would allow Peru to export fish meal, proteins, and other products to that island. Woodman said the issue is now in the government's hands, which has to see about the legal aspects of eliminating import taxes for some 200 products. Foreign Minister Robaina voiced his satisfaction with the results of his meeting with Minister Canale and said the results will be noticed soon. He said the upcoming visit of a Peruvian commercial delegation to his country will help strengthen commercial ties between the two countries. After the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a series of meetings with Peruvian political and social figures. In the evening he attended a cultural event at the National Museum, during which beautiful Cuban music was played. The event also was attended by political and cultural representatives. After the event Robaina left the country to continue his tour of the continent in an attempt to tighten cooperation ties.
