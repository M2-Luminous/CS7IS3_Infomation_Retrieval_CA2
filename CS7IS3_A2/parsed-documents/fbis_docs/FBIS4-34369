Hector Polino, the U.S. deputy for the federal capital, sponsored the resolution. He explained that the petition is based "on the liberal use of emergency decrees" by the executive branch "and a wide variety of anticonstitutional decrees with which Congress is being overwhelmed." Concerning the latter point, the socialist legislator emphasized "the liberal use of illegal legislative delegate powers and the practice of partial promulgations of bills that have been approved by Congress and then partially or totally vetoed by the executive branch." Polino stressed: "Decree No. 660, eliminating a dollar guarantee established by the retirement law for those joining the National Bank's AFJP [Retirement and Pension Fund Managing Companies], is among the 310 emergency decrees that President Menem has issued since July 1989."
