However, there are two deficiencies that current government's Tax Commission should overcome. In August 1993, 38 years of monopolistic one-party rule ended and the Hosokawa cabinet, which is based on coalition of parties, was born. Corresponding to this great change in the political world, the policy determination process was also changed fundamentally. The debate over reform of the tax system is no exception. The LDP's Tax Commission, which had exercised strong decisionmaking authority, backed by the activities of Diet members connected to the tax issue, has also retreated from front stage. Taking as its slogan, "correct the direct and indirect taxe rates," deliberations on reform of the tax system are vying for center stage. Prime Minister Hosokawa has entrusted everything to the government's Tax Commission, but I would like to examine how the discussion should proceed in the future on this issue of change. Currently, in our personal lives, interest in reform of the tax system is greatly rising centered on lowering income tax rates and on increasing consumption tax rates. Along with political reform, this issue is an important problem to be faced by the Hosokawa cabinet. The issue of which body takes what measures with regard to tax system reform is an extremely important question with respect to the formation of the country's economic policy. Examining how other developed nations are dealing with this problem, I would like to examine how deliberation on the reform of the tax system should take place. Japan's Unique Deliberation Method Generally, there are two different ways in which tax reform is carried out; the so-called Japanese method and the Western method. These two methods are shown in the chart below [not translated]. In both of these methods, once the need for tax reform is recognized, the prime minister or president first submits an inquiry to the appropriate body. Normally, Europe and the United States do not use this system of submission of inquiries for policy matters in other areas, such as foreign relations, national defense, or industrial policy. Why do they use this inquiry system for only tax reform? Two reasons come to mind. First, the tax problem is closely tied to the people's standard of living, and second, it is a problem which requires professional study. Japan, which has established consultative bodies to study inquiries for all policy matters, not just tax reform, is an exception to the rule. After the submission of an inquiry, there are two routes that deliberations on tax system reform can take. The particular characteristic of the Japanese system is that the prime minister submits an inquiry to the permanently established consultative body, in other words, the government's Tax Commission, and once this body receives an inquiry, the deliberation over tax system reform begins. Under this system, instead of preparing a comprehensive tax report which is based on detailed analysis, the commission issues a report, compiling the views of the majority of the commission members. The foundation for any reform of the tax system is based on this report. In the Western system, however, a task force, which is generally composed of experts, is assembled. Usually after two to five years of study and repeated discussions, the task force, which is led by a well-known researcher, will formulate and publish a tax report. Contained in this report, along with a statement of the ideals of and goals for tax system reform as well as supporting documentation, is a recommendation for proposed reform. This document becomes the plan for a revision of the tax system which will represent the country in question. This is the method that the Western countries use with tax system reform. The tax report plays a very important role in this process. In fact, there have been many well-known tax reports prepared, such as Canada's "Carter Report" (1966), Sweden's "Rodin [as transliterated] Report" (1976), and the U.S. "Treasury Department Report" (1984), all of which have been highly praised by academia. The Reagan tax system reform of the 1980's was another such reform that was carried out in this manner. It is interesting to note that the "Shoup Recommendation" (1949), which established Japan's tax system following the war, was also carried out in this western manner. This is very easy to understand if one considers the situation that existed back then. Therefore, we call the Japanese system the "deliberative body system," and the Western system the "tax report system." Although these tax reports are extremely important documents because they cast light on the basic nature of tax system reform, they are mere materials on which to start deliberation of tax system reform in the national assembly. The Government Tax Commission Versus the LDP Tax Commission Currently, in Japan, discussions on the tax system are carried out by the government's Tax Commission. This Tax Commission was formally established in 1962 as an advisory body to the prime minister. Since that time, this commission has been given the most authority among the numerous other deliberative bodies. In addition to 30 formal members drawn from various sectors of society, this commission is comprised of some 10 odd specialists and about 20 experts (group of scholars). We can say that, during the nearly 20 years since its inception, Japan's tax deliberation mechanism, which is centered on the government's Tax Commission, has functioned well. The government's Tax Commission proceeds with its discussions by making adjustments to proposed tax system reform while hearing the opinions of officials from organizations which would benefit or be damaged because of changes to that system. For that reason, the Tax Commission is comprised of representatives from various industrial groups, labor unions, consumer organizations, etc. As a result of compromise, unlike the Western tax reports, the reports proffered by the Tax Commission tend to become theoretically ambiguous. However, when one considers the final step in the tax deliberation process, namely the step from deliberation in the legislature to execution of reform, Japan's deliberative body system has performed well, resulting in a clearly higher number of proposals being implemented than are adopted under the Western tax report system. This means that, during the process of preparing their report, the work of making adjustments to the plan, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of all of the groups affected, including the various ministries and agencies, has already been completed. On the other hand, in the Western system, things can become confused in the legislature, and often, tax reform proposals have a tendency to become politically buried without achieving any political results. However, the Japanese practice of giving high esteem to the reports from the government's Tax Commission and implementing their recommendations within the tax system started to change in the 1980's. Of course this is not unrelated to the rise in power of the LDP Tax Commission. The situation developed where the actual power to create change in the tax system was shifted from the government Tax Commission to the LDP Tax Commission. Because of the LDP's long run in power, Diet members often formed connections with industry and became tied to the creation and/or expansion of special tax measures. One famous example of these connection is the existence of the "telephone book," a list of petitions submitted asking for tax reductions. The specific content of tax system reform, in other words the determining of the tax rate and the final numerical value of the deduction levels, fell under the scope of authority of the LDP's Tax Commission. The tax system is surely politics itself. Instead of following a logical course based on taxation theory, gradually, tax system reform was politicized by the LDP Tax Commission, and tied to the advantages and disadvantages of special interest groups. The venue for important tax deliberations was shifted from the government's Tax Commission to the LDP's Tax Commission. The government's Tax Commission's basic philosophy toward the tax system was to keep its implementation fair, neutral, and simple. Subsequently, it generally had the tendency not to support measures that would give special treatment under the tax system to special sectors. Therefore, the government's Tax Commission was often opposed to the expansion or extension of special tax measures, and therefore, special interest groups would bypass the government's Tax Commission and would take their proposed items directly to the LDP's Tax Commission. This route was used not only by private groups, but was also actively used by various agencies and ministries that were trying to use the tax system to attain specific objectives (such as increasing savings or social welfare). Indeed, in the world of the tax system, adhesion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and the private sector" was gradually beginning to develop. Thus, the hollowing out of the government's Tax Commission had begun. What promoted this trend was that Japan entered a period of restricted finance in the 1980's, which was aimed at financial reconstruction, out of a policy of lowered tax rates during the high-growth years. The benefits from the expenditures side disappeared, but there was an upswing in the demands for "hidden subsidies" (special tax measures) on the taxation side. Therefore, the LDP's Tax Commission clearly had more understanding of this process than did the logical government's Tax Commission. It was an era in which officials seeking sweet benefits under the tax system turned to the LDP's Tax Commission. Originally, when the proposal for the coming year's tax system reform was drawn up at the end of each year, both tax commissions frequently made public the reports which contained differing views on specific measures. The government's Tax Commission would issue a report, and a few days after that, the LDP's Tax Commission would issue its report with a differing point of view. Under the system of party politics in Japan, it is the party in power that pushes bills through the Diet. Therefore, it was the LDP's Tax Commission proposals that were adopted. However, in the latter half of the 1980's, a kind of division of effort was established between the two tax commissions. The government's Tax Commission would issue reports proposing changes to the basic foundations of the tax system, without any detailed information such as tax rates, and the LDP's Tax Commission would fill out the specifics of the tax policy based on the government's Tax Commission report. It can be said that the era of "conflict" was replaced by an era of "coordination." It was indeed humiliating for the government's Tax Commission, which is a prime minister's advisory organ, to be under the policy formulating organ of a single political party even though the party in question is the party in power. The consumption tax and land price tax were adopted under this division of effort. Tax System Deliberations; Where Do We Go From Here? As mentioned at the beginning of this text, in the midst of the political change which is sweeping the nation, the competitive relationship between the government's Tax Commission and the LDP's Tax Commission has ended. It would be difficult for the current coalition government to establish a body such as the LDP's Tax Commission. Tax Commission like the LDP's Tax Commission cannot be built overnight because the nucleus of human resources in that commission is composed of many tax system experts who were nurtured by the party in power for many years and Diet members who were former officials of Ministry of Finance. Prime Minister Hosokawa has said on many occasions that, "I want to wait for the deliberation of the government's Tax Commission," and "I will honor their report" to the letter. The deliberation on tax system reform has again moved to the government's Tax Commission. I am hearing from Diet members who used to belong to the LDP's Tax Commission with whom I am personally close, that it had become truly distasteful for them to work for the establishment of special exceptions because of the prodding of specific industries. Ostensibly, the retreat of the LDP's Tax Commission was brought about by political confusion; however, it was perhaps a matter of inevitable consequences. The problem is, "Where do we go from here?" In the future, should Japan maintain its unique "deliberative body system" and continue to use the government's Tax Commission as the venue for discussions on this issue? The following two deficiencies exist in the "deliberative body system." First, it has been difficult to clearly hammer out a basic philosophy and vision for reform of the tax system. Furthermore, it has also been difficult to formulate a specific reform proposal based on this foundation. Because the Tax Commission prepares its report while adjusting advantages and disadvantages to various groups, reform proposals tend to become a patchwork document that can exist only within that environment of compromise. It is nealy impossible for the government's Tax Commission to design a comprehensive tax system reform proposal that would look across the entire tax system. In fact, since the inception of the Shoup tax system, it has been difficult to explain on what basic posture subsequent reforms to the tax system had been based. Second, the evil practice of back-room decisionmaking is inexorably tied to the deliberative body system. Often, not only is the amount of information provided to the average citizen insufficient because only the results of the discussions are included in the published report, but no pipeline exists through which the public can press their requests for further information. There are no channels available other than petition and protest. In the future, it seems that the deliberations of the Tax Commission, which will take up issues such as "revision of direct and indirect tax rates," will become an issue of great interest to the public. Given these developments, is it enough to just continue along with the deliberative body system that we have had under the government's Tax Commission? However, in a society like ours which differs so much from Western nations in the area of consensus-building, there would probably be little effect if we adopted a tax report system like that of the countries of Europe and the United States. It is also inconceivable that our politicians would authorize a group of experts to formulate a tax report because the politicians would not like it if an authorized tax report were published that called for reform of the tax system that would be disadvantageous for the politicians, or that would contain a reform proposal that would be difficult to implement. To promote future tax system reform, however, we should incorporate as many elements of the tax report system as possible. Specifically, the final report of the government's Tax Commission should have the same level of weight and substance as those reports had in the 1960's. I think that what is wanted are reports such as those prepared during the term in office of the first head of the government's Tax Commission, Ichiro Tanaka. These reports contained the results of the analysis of all of the extended discussions within the Tax Commission, as well as all of the data used. This type of document could become the tax report for our country. In order to do this, it would be desirable that we increase the number of researchers on the commission who can view the the tax system as a whole instead of representing various interest groups as members. In order to make tax system reform truly a more democratic issue, we must make the dissemination and gathering of information more open, and we must pursue it more positively. One way to do this would be for the Tax Commission to discuss all of the tax system reform proposals drawn up and published by the various sectors. One result of this would be that the proposals raised by various groups could be effectively utilized. This would also aid in making the discussions on tax system reform within the Tax Commission more constructive. Chairman Hiroshi Kato has repeatedly emphasized that he wants to open the deliberations of the Tax Commission as much as possible to the public. We should also consider ways to make materials submitted to the Tax Commission more readily available to those who want to utilize them. We should also open "one-day Tax Commission meetings" throughout the various regions of the country, and positively adopt ways so that we can directly hear the views of the taxpayer, the average citizen.
