Kamal told MENA that the aim of the meeting is to coordinate positions and give the five concerned Arab parties an opportunity to consult over future actions. This will be especially useful after the issue of resuming the peace talks is settled in light of the UN Security Council resolution adopted today. The resolution condemns the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and backs the protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories. Kamal said next Saturday's meeting will also discuss the serious negative repercussions of the massacre on the peace process and likely criminal plans that Israeli settlers might be drawing up in response to the Security Council resolution.
