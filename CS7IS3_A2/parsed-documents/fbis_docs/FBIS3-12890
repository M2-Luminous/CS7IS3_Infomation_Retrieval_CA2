The U.S. attitude toward the atrocity, which has claimed 400 casualties, once more exposes America's open and consistent bias toward the usurper Zionist entity, as well as underscoring its abiding willingness to extend political protection to that entity at the United Nations, not to mention the apologies and alibis afforded the Zionist entity by U.S. media Typical of its approach to the savageries the Zionist entity has committed against the Palestinian Arab people, the United States has, for the past three days, been bending over backwards not only to contain and deflect the angry reactions to the crime and its perpetrators and to underplay the bloodbath and its consequences, but also to shield the Zionist entity from any international measures. The Clinton administration has not limited itself to throwing its full weight behind Tel Aviv; it stands ready to keep the UN Security Council from passing a resolution decreeing protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and demanding that the Zionist entity take immediate measures to curb the illegal practices of the Zionist settlers. It was entirely predictable that the draft resolution submitted by the nonaligned group at the United Nations should come up against U.S. opposition. Particularly objectionable to the United States is the paragraph stipulating international protection for the Palestinian people. Washington argues that such a resolution would set back the ongoing peace process. Another disagreeable paragraph to the Americans is the one calling on Israel to curb the settlers' scandalous actions against the Palestinian population. Beyond that, the United States has come out against disarming these settlers! At the end of the day, what the Clinton administration really wants is for the negotiations to resume. As for stemming the flow of Palestinian blood, it could not be bothered. Seen against this backdrop, Clinton's call for the Palestinian-Israeli talks to resume in Washington is a wretched and transparent attempt to whitewash the Zionist crime and shift the attention of the Palestinian, Arab, and world opinion away from the atrocity. From a U.S. perspective, the progress of the talks seems to count for more than Palestinian blood. In any event, this is not the first time that the United States has acted disgracefully, nor will it be the last. The U.S. attitude now fits in with a pattern of open U.S. partiality to the Zionist enemy. Still fresh in our memory is the crime perpetrated by the Zionists at al-Aqsa Mosque in October, 1990 and how the Bush administration manipulated the Security Council into passing a weak resolution condemning violence in general terms. Will the Clinton administration get the Council to issue a similarly weak resolution with empty expressions of condemnation that have no value in the face of this state-sponsored Zionist terror?! There is an elementary truth that the imperialists and their allies and agents will not recognize, and that is that the Palestinian people, who have been engaged in a bloody and ceaseless struggle for the past 40-odd years and who have offered huge sacrifices as they stood up to Zionist coercion and occupation, are not about to relent in the battle against terror and repression. The Palestinians will carry on with their heroic fight and make further sacrifices until their right to an independent state on their national soil is recognized.
