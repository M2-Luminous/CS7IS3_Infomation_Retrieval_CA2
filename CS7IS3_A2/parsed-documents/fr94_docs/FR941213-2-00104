Management improvements are an eligible cost under MROP activities to the extent that such improvements are necessary for the viability of the project (i.e., to maintain the physical improvements resulting from the proposed redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment MROP activities). E. Restrictions 1. If partial demolition/disposition is required: a. A demolition/disposition application must have been approved before the MROP activities application may be approved; or b. The application must have been submitted along with evidence of approval by the unit of general local government in which the project is located. This approval may be obtained from the Chief Executive Officer. 2. Conversion of units (by combining small units to make larger units or vice versa) must either be approved before an MROP activities application involving conversion may be approved, or an application for said conversion must have been submitted, and the cost of any conversion must be considered in the MROP activities application. 3. Funding provided for MROP activities at a project may not be used for total demolition/disposition of that project, but may be used for partial demolition/disposition if required to meet long-term viability; however, 75 percent of the units in the project or portion of the project which comprises the MROP application must be reconstructed.2 II. Application Process Overview A. PHA Application A PHA applying for development funds for MROP activities shall prepare a CIAP application, as modified by this NOFA. The initial review process shall follow the CIAP procedures; however, once selected, the application shall be processed under public housing development procedures. B. Application Processing The Field Office will screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA with a 14 calendar-day opportunity to furnish any missing technical information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will then be subjected to a ``pass/fail'' threshold examination by the Field Office. Each passing application will be rated as to the Technical Review Factors listed in Section IV.E. of this NOFA by a panel(s). C. Application Approval Panels comprised of representatives from various Field Offices will prepare rankings based on the panels' ratings and Headquarters will select applications for approval to the extent funds are available. D. Disclosure of Information The Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) prohibits advance disclosure of funding decisions. (See 24 CFR part 4.) Civil penalties related to advance disclosure are set out in 24 CFR part 30. Application approval/non-approval notifications shall not occur until the Congressional notification process is completed. (See Section VIII.F of this NOFA for more detailed information.) E. Records Retention Applications and materials related to applications (e.g., application scoring sheets, and notifications of selection/non-selection) will be retained in the appropriate Field Office for five years, and be available for public inspection in accordance with 24 CFR part 12. (See Section VIII.G of this NOFA for more detailed information.) III. Application Requirements A. All Applicants No more than one project (or portion of a project) may be proposed for MROP activities per application, although more than one application may be submitted by a PHA. Each application shall consist of an original and two copies, and must include the following: 1. Cover letter. The cover letter must identify the project proposed for MROP activities by its original project number (e.g., WY 22&hyph;2), and its total number of units (and buildings, if applicable). If fewer than the total number of units are being proposed, the cover letter shall summarize the PHA's plans for the remaining units. If more than one application is submitted, the cover letter must state the PHA's priorities for funding. The PHA must include a statement of whether the PHA will accept funding for the reconstruction of fewer units. 2. CIAP Application and Budget_Forms HUD 52822 and 52825. The application and budget forms must each be signed and dated and include the information as specified in the forms. No more than one original project number shall be included in each application submission. 3. Narrative Statement. The narrative statement must address each of the technical review factors under Section IV.E. of this NOFA, each of the eligibility criteria under Section I.D. of this NOFA and each of the restriction criteria under Section I.E. of this NOFA. 4. Demolition/Disposition or Conversion of Units. If, as part of the MROP activities, the PHA intends to demolish/dispose (demo/dispo) of some of the units or to convert units (combine small units to make larger ones, or vice versa), the PHA shall provide the date the demo/dispo or conversion was approved by HUD or the date the demo/dispo or conversion application was submitted. If the demo/dispo application has not yet been approved, the application for MROP activities that involves the demo/dispo of units must be accompanied by evidence of approval by the unit of general local government in which the project is located (it can be provided by the Chief Executive Officer). Development funds for MROP activities may not be used for total demo/dispo (see Section I.E.3. of this NOFA). 5. PHA Resolution In Support of the Application (Form HUD&hyph;52471).
