FR940610-2-00075 FR940610-2-00053 Health Resources and Services Administration [PN 2243] RIN 0905&hyph;ZA 63 Special Projects of National Significance AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration. ACTION: Notice of availability of funds. SUMMARY: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the availability of up to $10.5 million in fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds to be awarded as cooperative agreements under the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) program. The SPNS program, authorized by section 2618(a) of the Public Health Service Act, receives its appropriation of funds through Public Law 103&hyph;112. Project periods can be from three to five years, subject to Congressional reauthorization in FY 1996 of the Ryan White CARE Act. This announcement solicits two types of applications: (1) HIV service delivery model demonstration projects, or (2) HIV service delivery model demonstration projects in conjunction with an evaluation and dissemination center. The SPNS program, in collaboration with the evaluation and dissemination center(s), will sponsor multi-site program evaluation studies. All HIV service delivery model demonstration projects agree, as a condition of grant award, to participate in these studies. Awards will be made to achieve population and geographic diversity. The SPNS program is designed to demonstrate and evaluate innovative and potentially replicable HIV service delivery models. The authorizing legislation specifies three SPNS program objectives: (1) To support the development of innovative models of HIV care; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of innovative program designs; and (3) to promote replication of effective models. Therefore, crucial factors in appraising proposals for the HIV service delivery model demonstration projects will include the applicant's plan for conducting an evaluation of the model, the program's potential to improve access to, coordination of, and quality of, HIV service delivery, and a plan for disseminating findings about the model's effectiveness. Because of the complexity of this program, a cooperative agreement mechanism is being utilized to allow for substantial Federal programmatic participation in the conduct of the program, and to facilitate communication and coordination in the overall implementation and evaluation of the program. A steering committee will be established to facilitate coordination and cooperation among the service demonstration projects and the evaluation and dissemination center(s), and to oversee the cooperative agreements. DATES: Applications for these announced cooperative agreements must be received in the Grants Management Office by the close of business July 20, 1994, to be considered for competition. An advance notice of the application deadline date for the Special Projects of National Significance for FY 1994 was published in the Federal Register on April 26, 1994 at 59 FR 21769. Applications will meet the deadline if they are either (1) Received on or before the deadline date or (2) postmarked on or before the deadline date, and received in time for submission to the objective review panel. A legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier or U.S. Postal Service will be accepted in lieu of a postmark. Private metered postmarks shall not be accepted as proof of timely mailing. Applications received after the deadline will be returned.
