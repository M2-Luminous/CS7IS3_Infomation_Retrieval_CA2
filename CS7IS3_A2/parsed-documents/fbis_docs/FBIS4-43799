The CVP has always said that it would consider it a great honor for a Flemish Christian Democrat to be asked to head the EC. It is said in CVP circles that if the CVP had done badly in the elections, it would have asked Dehaene to continue to serve as Belgian prime minister. When it became clear that the result was much better than hoped, the need to keep Dehaene in place was no longer felt. But how do the other Flemish parties react to Dehaene's candidacy? Flemish-speaking Socialist Party: Continue "The Flemish-speaking Socialist Party (SP) considers it an honor for the country," SP Chairman Frank Vandenbroucke says, "that Dehaene has been asked to head the EC." This is no doubt due to the successful Belgian presidency of the EC during which Dehaene and Willy Claes jointly managed to settle a number of thorny issues. On the other hand, the SP believes that the government must continue as it considers that the present team still has a great deal to do. The government must be able to reap the rewards of the difficult work it has undertaken in the last two years. One remaining problem is law and order. [Interior] Minister Tobback has given great encouragement in this area, partly through the additional 2,500 policemen to be recruited this year. Flemish Liberal Party Backs Dehaene "The Flemish Liberal Party (VLD) has always said that it backed Dehaene's EC candidacy," says Patrick Dewael, VLD leader in the Chamber. He admits that this support has included a "slight oppositional undertone." "But if Belgium has a chance of winning Europe's top job, then we in the opposition are certainly going to back it," Dewael says. "We therefore fully support Dehaene's candidacy, without any ulterior political motives." The VLD does take issue, however, with the undemocratic manner in which the EC president is appointed. It is in fact all down to lobbying activity, the individual citizen being totally excluded from the process. But it is accepted that Dehaene does not personally bear any blame for this, as the president is appointed by an established procedure. "If under this procedure it seems that Dehaene has the best chances then the government majority and the coalition must support it," Dewael says. Live Differently: No Support Live Differently is unable to support Dehaene's candidacy as EC president. Dehaene's vision of Europe is not at all to Live Differently's liking. The most that can be expected of Dehaene is that he will try to make Europe somewhat less undemocratic and asocial. Live Differently suspects that the other possible presidents would offer even fewer guarantees of the kind of developments the Greens would like to see. "But," Johan Malcorps states, "Live Differently refuses to accept this fundamental absence of any real alternative." Flemish Bloc: Elections The fact that a governing prime minister is ready to move to the EU at a difficult time for the coalition parties, leads us to conclude that he no longer sees his task as the leader of a government that is barely holding together. Such is the opinion of Roeland Raes, Flemish Bloc's (VB) vice chairman. Raes says that "the VB does not begrudge Dehaene his European post, but believes that Prime Minister Dehaene and his government team should draw the necessary conclusions from this departure, namely that this government has outlived its usefulness and should consult the voters, as soon as possible and no later than the year end, so that they can give their verdict on the government record to date." The People's Union: Program The People's Union (VU) says that it is not the candidate president as an individual which is important but the program he will put forward. In the policy program, Dehaene must draw attention to, among other things, the equality of all languages and cultures, and respect for the identity of each community of peoples. The position of the Dutch language must be protected. The VU hopes that Dehaene will display more Flemish determination in this than in the matter of the European Trade Marks Office. Also important are the social dimension, democratization, and advocating the right to exist of communities and regions.
