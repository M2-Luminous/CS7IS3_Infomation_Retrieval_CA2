[passage omitted] Government ministers discussed the question of French troops being sent to Rwanda. The Burundi Government stated that it would not get involved in the internal affairs of other countries, but it asked the Rwandan warring parties to stop fighting and to continue peace talks. The government expressed its concern over the continuing killing of innocents. That is exactly the point which the interim president emphasized at the Tunis OAU summit, although according to some rumors in Bujumbura the interim president allowed France to use Burundi as a transit point for its troops to enter Rwanda. The interim president informed the Council of Ministers that this was surprising, since he had never discussed the question with the French authorities at the OAU summit. However, you should remember that some people recently staged demonstrations in Bujumbura against the dispatch of French troops to Rwanda. The Council of Ministers confirmed that, under a democratic system, every citizen is free to stage demonstrations, but should at the same time respect the relevant laws. The Council of Ministers took the opportunity to call on security services to ensure that laws are respected.
