The India visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary for State, Strobe Talbott, and U.S. visit by Prime Minister Narsimha Rao had begun the process of normalizing relations. The job of any envoy is to further the interests of his nation, but it is also his job to try his utmost to strengthen bilateral relations. Wisner has not yet arrived in India, but he has already started showing his fangs. India is a sovereign nation and prudent enough to know what is good for it and what is bad. Wisner is trying to threaten India in a roundabout way regarding the Prithvi short-range missiles deployed by the Army. He is saying that deployment of these missiles would worsen the arms race. In a way, Wisner is representing the U.S. point of view about missiles, but it is also clear that he has highly prejudiced views about India. Only a few days ago, he expressed negative views about India becoming a permanent member of the Security Council. If he wanted, he could have supported India's nomination to the Security Council, arguing that India was the largest democratic country in the world. After all, India had supported China's permanent membership in the Seurity Council. It is not that U.S. diplomacy is always practiced on principles. Obviously, Wisner has orchestrated this anti-India refrain intentionally. There is tremendous contradiction in Wisner's views. He admits that there is danger to India from China. If that danger is from China's atom bomb, then the same danger would threaten from its carrier missiles. Prithvi is also a short-range missile. India also should develop and deploy the Agni missile. It is unfortunate that launching the Prithvi, which was postponed in view of the U.S. tour by Rao, has been postponed again. India have no fear of the Wisners. Wisner is overlooking the fact that Pakistan not only has Chinese-made M-11 missiles, but F-16 U.S. fighter planes. Wisher favors supplying F-16's to Pakistan. Atom bombs could be dropped by these planes. Hence, is there no danger to India from Pakistan? On what logic is he recommending supply of F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan? It is obvious that Wisner is anti-India. The Indian Government shoudl object to his appontment. What would such an envoy with a poisoned tongue do in India? His arrogant statements would put daily dents in the relations which have normalized with great difficulty.
