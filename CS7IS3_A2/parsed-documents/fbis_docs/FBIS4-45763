Sarmiento Jr.] [Text] President Ramos yesterday, lifted the ban on the entry of industrial wastes into the country, aggravating fears among environmentalists that this would open the floodgates to the dumping of toxic wastes here. Mr. Ramos has ordered the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Bureau of Customs to lift the ban on the importation of used plastics and paper wastes as well as scrap iron and steel. He also authorized the release of similar shipments which have been held by customs authorities. Mr. Ramos said exempting waste materials from the import ban would help save dollars for the country and provide local industries with cheaper raw materials. "Such exemption is based on the economic impact such as potential stoppage of the...industry operations due to unavailability of process(ed) materials as well as potential loss of foreign exchange," Mr. Ramos said in a memorandum to Environment Secretary Angel Alcala and Customs Commissioner Guillermo Parayno Jr. [sentence as published] Alcala said plastic scraps are four times cheaper than the plastic raw materials and that paper waste would reduce dependence on virgin pulp taken from trees. As for the iron and steel industry, Alcala said the local supply cannot meet domestic demand of 500,000 metric tons a year. The construction industry is the main user of iron and steel. Aided by the government's weak monitoring capability, traders have been shipping toxic wastes to the Philippines. In March, a Greenpeace patrol blocked a Russian-registered container ship, Gamzat Tsdasa, delivering 42 tons of toxic computer scraps from Australia to Manila. Greenpeace said computer scraps are often contaminated with asbestos and other toxic materials. Two months ago, another shipment of 45 containers of "PVC scrap," a hazardous waste, from Germany was reported on its way to the country. Trade of hazardous waste is banned by the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes. Maximo Kalaw Jr., president of Green Forum Philippines, said the importation of hazardous wastes is also prohibited under Republic Act 6969, also known as "The Toxic Substances and Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990." But Greenpeace said the, Philippines has been unable to detect and intercept incoming shipments of thousands of tons of hazardous wastes, including scrap metal, plastic waste, old computers and lead scrap. Greenpeace statistics showed that from 1990 to 1993, a total of 64,385 tons waste were shipped to the Philippines from the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. Greenpeace described the Philippines as a "major dumping ground of plastic waste" when it allowed entry to shipments of 18,000 tons of U.S. plastic scrap from 1991 to 1993. The United States shipped 27,226 tons of scrap metal to the Philippines in 1990 alone. The United States has admitted dumping toxic battery waste to the Philippines and other countries.
