North Korean President Kim Il-song proposed summit talks to former President No Tae-u in April 1992 through Yun Ki-pok, WPK secretary in charge of southward operations, who visited Seoul secretly. Former President No dispatched Yi Sang-yon, then director of the Agency for National Security Planning, to Pyongyang as his emissary around 15 April that year, and the emissary delivered his message congratulating President Kim Il-song on his birthday and expressing his willingness to hold summit talks. This was confirmed as Pak Yong-su, the North's senior delegate to the inter-Korean working delegates' contact, mentioned it at the sixth round of contact and confirmed by those who had been involved in the preparation for summit talks at that time. The former highest-level person in authority who was actively involved in the inter-Korean issues at that time said: I know that presidential emissaries made trips several times to each other's capital, apart from the then-ongoing North-South high-level talks, in an attempt to hold summit talks. Another former high-ranking person in authority who had been involved in the inter-Korean dialogue at that time also confirmed this and said: I understand that emissaries who made trips between the North and the South were the director of the Agency for National Security Planning from the South side and Yun Ki-pok, WPK secretary in charge of southward operations, from the North side.
