It will ease all tariff and non-tariff barriers, making the world a border-less market for globally competitive companies. It will simultaneously mean a losing game for less competitive companies even in their home markets. "The world will be exposed to the law of the jungle in which the lion has the largest share," one economist said, noting "We can no longer provide visible or invisible shelters for our industry." The process of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which brought a victory to the United States and the European Union and a negative impact, if not a defeat, to most other economies, was a "fierce war itself" as the Federation of Korean Industries [FKI], the lobbying group of large companies, put it. Public officials and private analysts cite sharp tariff cuts for manufactured goods, abolition of non-tariff discriminations and clarified and justified procedures for the settlement of trade disputes as some of the potential bonuses to the exports of Korea's manufacturing sector. Reinforced regulations on anti-dumping ruling will particularly save Korean companies from threats and actions by advanced countries including the U.S., EU and Australia. Korean products have been slapped with anti-dumping charges from time to time. Improved conditions for overseas investment will also draw foreign capital into the nation, while encouraging local businessmen to invest abroad. All in all, manufacturing industries are expected to get more than they lose under the Uruguay Round agreement. Major advanced countries, which have not lowed tariffs since the start of the multilateral talks in 1986, are obliged to slash the rates gradually, thus enhancing the competitiveness of products exported by developing countries and thereby giving them higher chances of access. Imports are not likely to jump drastically, officials said, on the ground that its concessional tariffs are set at 8.1 percent for the 2001, the final year of implementation of the new round, which is higher than the currently actual rate of 7.9 percent. The Korean Institute for International Economic Policy recently estimated exports growth, to be caused by the freer world trade order, at 2,250 billion dollars on the annual average. Imports will grow a meager 720 million dollars, according to the brain trust for the Economic Planning Board [EPB], the top economic agency. The state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade gave a conservative forecast--a 620-710 million dollar jump in exports and a 60 million dollar rise in imports. "The Uruguay Round will be a plus for our economy from the macroscopic and long-term perspectives," said a high-ranking EPB official who is campaigning to calm down controversy over what many Koreans just call "UR." "Korea, over half whose gross national product comes from trade, has to pursue prosperity through international economic ties." The free trade regime will be a great disservice to some light industries like footwear, textiles and garments, which are being dogged by products from newcomers including China, Malaysia and Thailand, needless to say agriculture. In the agricultural field along, UR damages will amount to an estimated 7.7 trillion won (approximately 9.6 billion dollars) over the next seven years, resulting in the exodus of half of the rural population to urban areas, according to the Korea Rural Economic Institute. The influence of the UR on Korea's economy will be commensurate with its countersteps. Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Sok-hwan stressed the need for the "decisive role" of private enterprises in stepping up their competitiveness and image worldwide. "The settlement of the new trade regulations forces the administration to trim its intervention in the private sector in the course of its technical development, trade and other overall business activities. The government will remain as a supporter and the private sector will take the initiative in this regard." Business organizations appeared passive as if they were little concerned about the drastically new system which dismissed two agriculture, forestry and fisheries ministries as scapegoats to appease angry farmers and fishermen, backed by opposition lawmakers and students in Korea. The FKI commented, "It is necessary to nurture competitiveness of some industries that have comparative edge in the world market. A new economic climate should also be created in which business activities are subject to market mechanisms." The Korea Foreign Trade Association called for technological innovation and management reform, while the Korea Federation of Small Business regretted the administration's unpreparedness for the order.
