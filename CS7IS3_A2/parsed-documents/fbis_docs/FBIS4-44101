Central bankers are vigilant and have always proved that they are there and are able to maintain the necessary framework for stability." Invited by the Europe No. 1 radio station to talk about the collapse of the dollar against the yen, the Bank of France governor added that the G-7, the group of the seven most industrialized countries (which is to meet in Naples at the beginning of July) is "the place where we can verify whether the framework for stability is suitable." After noting that the dollar "is potentially stronger than it appears," Mr. Trichet expressed the opinion that the current difficulties have "nothing to do with" the 1987 stock market crash but are due to an economic recovery that has been "badly interpreted by some people (...). What counts are the basic and objective figures for the economies," he stressed, "and these figures are good." The previous day, Hans Tietmayer, president of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, had expressed his satisfaction with how the European Monetary System [EMS] was operating. Thanks to the widening of its fluctuation bands after the monetary crisis of August 1993, the EMS has become "flexible." Mr. Tietmayer told members of Atlantikbruecke, the U.S.-German friendship society: "Previously, fluctuations in the dollar would certainly have caused tensions within the system."
