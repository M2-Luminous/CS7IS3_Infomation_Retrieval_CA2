Over the years, Tibet has always been a region of great public interest, and its deputies have always been the focus of the news media during NPC sessions. At the request of Chinese and foreign correspondents, Tibetan deputies to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC were collectively interviewed by the news media for the first time today. Deputies, some in Western business suits and some in traditional Tibetan costumes, answered each and every question with ease and confidence in front of flashing cameras. Raidi, a serf who became a senior leading cadre as deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee and chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing Committee, first told the correspondents joyously: "Tibet currently enjoys political stability, economic development, social progress, national unity, and higher living standards. Its situation is heartening and its prospects are bright." Relations among various nationalities in Tibet were an issue of general concern to the Chinese and foreign correspondents. Deputy Raidi said: Tibet is an inalienable part of the sacred motherland. The Tibetan nationality is a member of the Chinese nation. In the 40-plus years since its peaceful liberation in 1951, Tibet has followed a glorious course along with other nationalities in all parts of the country. In recent years, splittist elements within and outside the national boundaries, with the support and tacit encouragement of anti-Chinese forces in the international community, have waged many activities aimed at splitting the motherland, including those aimed at creating disturbances and troubles in Lhasa. Nevertheless, people of all nationalities across the country, including Tibetan compatriots, have firmly opposed these splittist activities. "Order leads to a country's ascendancy, whereas chaos leads to its downfall." People of all nationalities in Tibet have drawn this conclusion from the past and the present. Deputy Raidi said: "Over the past several decades, the central authorities have always shown great concern for Tibet's construction and social development. Other localities have also lent full support and assistance to Tibet. The central authorities have implemented an array of preferential policies and provided full financial and material support, thereby rapidly developing the productive forces in chronically underdeveloped Tibet. Compared to the pre-liberation period, Tibet's entire social outlook has undergone tremendous historic changes." Raidi cited the follow statistics to substantiate his statement: In 1993, Tibet's gross regional product amounted to 3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1 percent from the previous year; agriculture registered a bumper harvest for the sixth year, with the total grain output reaching 620,000 tonnes; per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen was 521 yuan, an increase of 180 percent over 10 years ago; ..... [ellipses as received] In recent years, some people of the international community have shown an interest in the so-called state of human rights in Tibet. When a foreign correspondent raised this question, Losang -- a neighborhood committee chairman of Chengguan District of Lhasa City who was a serf along with his father and grandfather -- said promptly: "Whoever wants to discuss the state of human rights in Tibet is ignorant of history. I am most qualified to answer this question since I used to be a serf." "Old Tibet was a society of serfdom combining religion and politics," said Losang with deep emotion while taking off his black Tibetan cap. He said loudly in Tibetan: "In old Tibet, the vast number of people were bullied and oppressed as serfs and had no rights whatsoever of which to speak. We had no political rights, no economic equality, not even freedom of marriage. We suffered beatings and hardships. At the slightest displeasure of the owners, serfs were sent to prisons, or had their heads and legs chopped off. Our right of survival was not guaranteed, not to mention our rights as human beings." Losong said: It was only after the democratic reform in Tibet in 1959 that the vast number of Tibetans began to enjoy true human rights and to feel the warmth of the big family of nationalities. Especially since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy, life is improving with each new day; and the people are fully enjoying their rights as human beings and citizens. Their lives today as compared to pre-liberation days are as far apart as heaven and earth. Speaking forcefully, Losong said: "Without knowing well the historical background, it is hard to understand things now. We people who experienced serfdom in old Tibet understand best what human rights are. Any attempt to use the so-called human rights issue to realize ulterior motives is doomed to fail, and is ludicrous." Answering a question on whether Han people have been emigrating to Tibet in large numbers, Losang Toinzhub, vice chairman of the Tibetan Regional People's Government and mayor of Lhasa, said that assertion is a sheer nonsense. He said: Among a population of 400,000 in Lhasa, Tibetans account for 87 percent and Han less than 12 percent. In recent years, many people from inland areas have come to Tibet to do business. They have helped enliven the market and contributed to economic development. This is a result of the policy of reform and opening up. They have, together with local people of all nationalities, made great contributions to Tibet's economic development. Speaking of religious beliefs, Losang Gyaincain, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Regional People's Congress and president of the Tibetan Buddhist Association, said: Tibet is home to more than 1,400 temples and over 30,000 monks and nuns. Thanks to the implementation of the party's policy on religion, people of all nationalities are enjoying the right of freedom of religious belief. There are people who believe in religion and those who do not in Tibet. This facts represents an aspect of the freedom of religious belief in Tibet. Asked about whether there is any change in the Central Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama, Deputy Raidi said: Dalai has been living in exile since 1959, when he took part in a rebellion and fled. He has since engaged in activities aimed at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear all along: He is welcome to return home to contribute to the country's construction if he abandons his stance on splitting the motherland and sabotaging national unity. Deputy Raidi told the Chinese and foreign correspondents present: "Under the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the First Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, people of all nationalities in Tibet -- amid the tidal waves of reform, opening up, and developing a socialist market economy -- are determined to seize the favorable opportunity, work hard to build a socialist market economic system, deepen reform, and concentrate their energies to develop the economy." He said that he is confident that Tibet will become more united, prosperous, democratic, and civilized.
