The president adopts an edict, and the interested top officials at once spread their hands: We did not know about this, nobody told us anything. Or: Did he consult with anyone at all?... Back in the times of the USSR Boris Yeltsin, not yet president, was approached by two people -- Igor Vasilyevich Nit and Pavel Alekseyevich Medvedev, professors at Moscow State University -- who proposed setting up a group of expert economists. It was then that they reached agreement on the rules: They would always tell Yeltsin the truth, and he would always be ready to listen to them. Some staffers, postgraduates of the Department of Mathematical Methods of Analyzing the Economy at Moscow State University, and scientists from the Academy of Sciences came along with Nit and Medvedev. At first they worked on a purely voluntary basis. But now the group of experts is accommodated in the Kremlin. Last year Igor Nit, its founder, passed away, and Viktor Krivov acts as the group's leader. We put our first question to him. [Stremidlovskiy] You are an expert. Please assess how Boris Nikolayevich adopts decisions. [Krivov] Although the president is frequently accused of adopting decisions hurriedly, in actual fact the overwhelming majority of them are carefully worked out. How competent the advisers and specialists to whom the president turns are is another matter. I will point out that Yeltsin endeavors to obtain at least two viewpoints on each question. [Stremidlovskiy] How capable is Boris Yeltsin of taking on board information which is unpleasant to him? [Krivov] A difficult question. Of course, the president is a man of character, and he knows how to get angry. And yet he is a man with a very strong will, and so he is able to suppress emotions. [Stremidlovskiy] Has it ever happened that your opinion and Boris Nikolayevich's opinion on some questions have differed? [Krivov] Yes. For example, with regard to the "500 Days" program. We were categorically against it in our conclusion and emphasized that this plan did not correspond at all to the country for which it was being written. [Stremidlovskiy] At what percentage do you estimate your influence over Yeltsin? [Krivov] There is still a very serious problem here. It was one thing that Igor Nit, our late leader, exerted real influence. We have not yet attained such weight.... [Stremidlovskiy] How frequently does the president consult with your group? [Krivov] This happens most frequently now through the president's aides -- Ilyushin, Korabelshchikov, Sukhanov. Or through political consultants. [Stremidlovskiy] Many people today believe that the president is dealing less with the government now.... [Krivov] He is doing this deliberately. When Yeltsin headed the government, he dealt with it. Now there is a prime minister whom the president trusts. But control over the course of the reforms is still retained. Every Tuesday there are one-to-two hour meetings between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, at which fundamental aspects of the government's work are discussed. [Stremidlovskiy] Viktor Dmitriyevich, why, in your view, did the president accept the resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov? [Krivov] In our country the concept "reformer" is like a label. But essentially.... It is important at some stage resolutely to break what is old, while at another time it is time to engage in building. Whereas in 1990 Yeltsin's victory was linked with the fact that he had geared himself to the enterprise directors, today entrepreneurs have appeared. Therefore it is obvious that the next government must be a government of entrepreneurs. The only entrepreneur whom I know is Chernomyrdin. His presence in the Cabinet of Ministers serves to guarantee the transformations' continuation. But the actions of members of the previous government frequently resembled the actions of people dropped by parachute into a foreign country. [Stremidlovskiy] But Chernomyrdin's present cabinet is called a government of "red directors...." [Krivov] I believe that the directors are no longer the same now. Essentially, each of them has become an entrepreneur. They have large accounts in Western banks, and they seek contracts. But, believe me, more serious problems exist in the economy than "red directors." [Stremidlovskiy] Which ones? [Krivov] Owing to the inefficiency of our economy, our prices, particularly those for raw materials, exceed world prices. The saddest thing is that just a few people understand the significance of this problem -- only Chernomyrdin. We will have nothing with which to buy imported consumer goods, which we import now. We still have six months in which we can use administrative methods to make the railroad carry freight more cheaply, at a loss to itself. To make energy workers also trade at a loss to themselves. But during this time we will prepare the foundations for the structural restructuring of the Russian economy. [Stremidlovskiy] It turns out that additional loads will be imposed on the sinking budget -- from here it is one step to hyperinflation.... [Krivov] Inflation is, of course, a serious matter. But the fact that enterprises are now coming to a halt is no less a problem. Closing our eyes to this trend means getting a seething, mutinous country in a few months' time....
