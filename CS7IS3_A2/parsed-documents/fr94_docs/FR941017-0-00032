FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background II. Organization III. Final Rules and Disposition of Comments IV. Procedural Matters 1. Background A. Summary of the Act of August 31, 1954 Congress recognized that outcrop and underground fires in coal formations waste the fuel resources of the nation and are a menace to the health and safety of the public and surface property. Congress therefore passed the Act of August 31, 1954 (30 U.S.C. 551&hyph;558), to provide for the control and extinguishment of outcrop and underground coal fires. The Secretary of the Interior was authorized: (a) to conduct surveys, investigations, and research related to the causes and extent of outcrop and underground fires in coal formations and the methods for control or extinguishment of such fires; to publish the results of any such surveys, investigations, and research; and to disseminate information concerning such methods; and (b) to plan and execute projects for control or extinguishment of fires in coal formations. These projects could be performed on lands owned or controlled by the United States or any of its agencies, with the cooperation of the agency having jurisdiction thereof, and on other lands upon obtaining proper consent or the necessary rights or interests in such lands. Federal funds could not be used to control or extinguish fires in any privately owned operating coal mine. The United States Bureau of Mines was initially responsible for carrying out the provisions of this law, the only Federal program providing funding for the control of coal fires. With the passage of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), Pub. L. 95&hyph;87, 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq., on August 3, 1977, federal funds became available through the Abandoned Mine Land (AML) program to extinguish or control coal fires at eligible AML sites. In 1983, the responsibility for implementing the Act of August 31, 1954, was transferred to OSM. B. Summary of Section 2504(d), ``Coal Formations'' of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 provided additional authority for States or Indian tribes regarding projects for the control of outcrop or underground fires in coal formations under the authority of the Act of August 31, 1954 (30 U.S.C. 551&hyph;558), and pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of section 205 of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;4, 79 Stat. 5). The 1992 amendments authorize the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office of Surface Mining, to enter into cooperative agreements with States or Indian tribes having approved abandoned mine land programs to plan and execute projects for the control or extinguishment of fires in coal formations. The amendments provide further that for States or Indian tribes with approved AML programs, any matching share contributions are waived. In addition, the $500,000 annual limit on the total amount of funds that can be appropriated to carry out the provisions and purposes of the Act of August 31, 1954, was eliminated. Further, any such cooperative agreement that is entered into under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 with an AML State eligible to receive funds from the Appalachian Regional Development Commission is not subject to review by that Commission. Congress did not provide a source of funding for these cooperative agreements to extinguish or control coal formation fires in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Congress may appropriate funding in the future. C. Relationship of the Coal Formation Fire Control Program to the OSM AML Program
