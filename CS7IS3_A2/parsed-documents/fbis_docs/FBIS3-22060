[passage omitted] Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question, Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and 1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements. Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700 personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders), and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say: We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain unchanged in the days to come.
