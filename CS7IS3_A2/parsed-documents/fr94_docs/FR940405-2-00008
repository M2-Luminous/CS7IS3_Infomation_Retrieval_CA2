SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 23, 1987, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a countervailing duty order on certain fresh cut flowers from Peru (52 FR 13491). The Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review of this countervailing duty order for at least four consecutive annual anniversary months. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Accordingly, as required by ยง355.25(d)(4) of the Department's regulations, we are notifying the public of our intent to revoke this order. Opportunity To Object Not later than 30 days after the publication date of this notice, domestic interested parties, as defined in ยง355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, may object to the Department's intent to revoke this countervailing duty order. Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. If no interested parties request an administrative review (pursuant to the Department's notice of opportunity to request administrative review), or if no domestic interested parties object to the Department's intent to revoke pursuant to this notice, we shall conclude that the order is no longer of interest to interested parties and shall proceed with the revocation. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(i). Dated: March 30, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
