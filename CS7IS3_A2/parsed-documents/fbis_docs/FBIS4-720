FBIS4-720 "drafr073_a_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Calls For Public Support Against `Killers' RPF Calls For Public Support Against `Killers' EA1404220294 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1855 GMT 14 Apr 94 EA1404220294 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Statement by RPF Chairman Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe on 14 April; place not given] [Excerpts] Ladies and gentlemen, in an earlier statement issued on 10th April 1994, we informed you that since the death of the president many innocent people have been killed by Presidential Guards, some elements of the Army and MRND-CDR [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth wingers, who have been trained and armed with military equipment. [passage omitted] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] took an irreversible step to fight this group of people, and the RPF calls upon government and the entire Rwandese population who are not in the clique to join hands so as to accomplish this task. Ladies and gentlemen: Since the RPF decided on 8th April 1994 to take up arms and stop these acts of murder and terror, the Rwandese people welcomed the act and have been cooperative in places where our soldiers passed on their way to Kigali. Peace-loving government soldiers who were against shedding blood of innocent people have also disassociated themselves from the killers. These killers are the ones who have denied the democratic process our country has been prepared to take based on the Arusha peace agreement. I am pleased to inform you that at this particular moment, the Rwandese Patriotic Army soldiers are already in Kigali fighting with the clique of government soldiers who are continuing to kill innocent people. Countrymen and peace-loving soldiers: Let us come together and pursue those murderers and we shall defeat them within a short time. Let me take this opportunity to request the youth who are involved in these acts, be they in government forces or MRND-CDR youth wingers, (Inyeuhamwe) and (Imhuzamugambi), [as heard] to stop killing innocent people. Let me also remind you that the people who deplored you to do such acts are already running out of the country and the so-called government Sindikubgwabo and Kambanda [as heard] is in a state of confusion with no direction of where to go. We request the military commanders, leaders in prefectures and communes, religious leaders to disassociate themselves with this clique of murderers. [passage omitted] Ladies and gentlemen: I request you not to listen to bad elements who scare that the RPF is your enemy. I cannot repeat the lies broadcast by radio (RTLM) and Radio Rwanda, together with MRND and CDR cohorts. The days for such lies meant for a resumption of hostilities are numbered. Our objective is to defend the Rwandese people by stopping such wanton killings in our country. We request for your cooperation so that we can achieve our objective within the shortest time possible. I once again thank all those who are assisting the RPF in this war we are fighting so as to completely eliminate dictatorship from our country. I request all of us to be together in sorrow in these bad days we are (?existing). Victory is certain. Thank you. Signed by the RPF chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.
