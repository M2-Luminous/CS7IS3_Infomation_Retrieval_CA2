Because of the stubborn resolve that Macedonia ought to observe the interests of other countries as well, Gligorov has often been accused by certain circles in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] of subservience and of having an insufficiently patriotic policy. His Balkan neighbors also dislike many things about him. Several days ago Athens officially accused him of living outside reality, other neighbors claim that nothing has been definite and certain about Macedonia, certain areas of Macedonian territory are being more or less openly claimed, whereas certain scientific symposiums are being announced at which the Macedonian issue is supposed to be definitely solved. Quite logically, our conversation started with President Gligorov commenting on U.S. recognition of Macedonia. [Gligorov] This recognition is undoubtedly very important for us, because the United States is the only superpower in the world today, and the dominant member of the UN Security Council and other international organizations -- both civil and military. Until now, all recognitions by the European Union, the United Nations, and China were subject to speculation that they carry no real weight until the United States recognizes Macedonia, that is, that the events in the Balkans might possibly evolve in a different direction. This recognition is a precondition for us to take part in all future negotiations as a subject, given the international recognition of the Macedonian entity. You will understand what this means if you look back in history, starting from the Balkan wars to the two world wars, and see that in all those events the Macedonians were too impotent to influence negotiations about the status of Macedonia. Now that practice of others making decisions about our destiny has ceased. [Correspondent] Does this mean that what follows is only a technical part of the recognition of the new position of Macedonia? [Gligorov] Now, the admission of Macedonia into the CSCE is a very important step. There are no obstacles to this in terms of our meeting the conditions for membership. All the reports by the relevant bodies, including the CSCE itself, are quite positive that Macedonia fulfills all the conditions, and that it should be admitted as a full member. Albania opposed the proposal for a while, but now it is only Greece that opposes it. The essential meaning of admission into the CSCE is entry into the system of collective security, whose character is predominantly political. CSCE membership would create the possibility for us to join the the "Partnership for Peace" project. [Correspondent] What does the presence of foreign troops in Macedonia mean, not only for Macedonia, but also for the entire region? For instance, Milovan Djilas [Serbian dissident] recently said in an interview that Macedonia has remained Macedonian thanks solely to the arrival of foreign troops. [Gligorov] The history of this issue is as follows: First, the arrival of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force]in Macedonia was a result of our own initiative. We considered that it would be good, with regard to the entire situation in the southern Balkans, if preventive, rather than classical, peacekeeping forces were deployed in Macedonia. Until they came to Macedonia, peacekeeping troops had never prevented armed clashes, or contributed to the prevention of such clashes. Moreover, until then, the United States had not taken part in such actions at all. The UN secretary general became interested in that idea, and later on deployed a small contingent of 1,000 soldiers, without U.S. troops. Troops from the Scandinavian countries came first, which we welcomed as a good choice. U.S. troops were only deployed later, which means that their presence here is not an arbitrary act on the part of the U.S. Government, but rather the result of the mandate that was given to them by the United Nations. Still, I have to repeat, the novelty is only that, until now, the United States has never taken part in peacekeeping actions in the region, nor put their troops under another command, as in the Macedonian case. In the U.S. Congress the issue was seriously discussed and there were many arguments, but eventually it was agreed that 300 soldiers in Macedonia should be put under the command of the officers appointed by the United Nations, serving within UNPROFOR. [Gligorov] I am saying all this just because there are frequent remarks and claims that the U.S. forces in Macedonia are quite independent and have been deployed in compliance with a special agreement. The deeper and more profound reason for their presence here, even if it involves only a symbolic 300 troops, is undoubtedly an expression of the U.S. desire to prevent the spreading of the Balkan conflict further south. From their point of view, the involvement of Macedonia in the conflict would mean a war on the borders of a NATO member country, namely Greece. That would entail the danger of involving all Macedonia's neighbors in the conflict, that is, other NATO member countries. That would have far-reaching consequences for the United States, even for its strategic interests. It would be far more dangerous than the war in Bosnia, which is still a confined war, although it has shaken Europe and influenced many events in the world. At least for the time being, provided that the war does not spread south, the war in Bosnia has not yet brought about the consequences that a conflict on the southern wing of the NATO Alliance might cause. The second reason for such a dedicated U.S. engagement lies, I think, in the fact that Macedonia shows by its own example that it is possible to solve inter-ethnic problems without arms. I am not idealizing anything, but we are living proof that inter-ethnic tolerance and cooperation is possible. To cut a long story short, I think that, although the number of troops stationed here is relatively small, their presence carries a clear message to anybody that it may concern should the conflict spread to Macedonia. It is much more a political than a military warning. [Correspondent] At the beginning, the demilitarization of Macedonia was quite frequently considered. Why was it abandoned? [Gligorov] Yes, this idea was present, but in the meantime we had to do what is necessary, that is, to place our army on the borders. After that, it was logical that we demanded assistance from the international community, particularly since at the time Macedonia was not internationally recognized to the extent that it is now. [Correspondent] International observers have been deployed along Macedonia's northern and western borders. Recently you have stated that one should base one's judgment about Belgrade's intentions toward Macedonia on whether Macedonia is recognized or not. In that context, how do you view various scenarios for the future of Macedonia? [Gligorov] The fact is that war is being waged to the north of Macedonia, and that the danger of it spreading exists. There is also the problem of Kosovo. Still, regardless of all that, I do not think that Macedonia is directly endangered by Serbia. However, as long as the war goes on, and as long as the problem of Kosovo is unsettled, potential danger will always exist. Precisely because of all this, I am convinced that such dangers would be diminished, or removed, by the mutual recognition of the FRY and Macedonia. [Correspondent] Has there been any initiative in that respect on your part? [Gligorov] I encouraged that idea in an interview, and I particularly discussed it with President Milosevic during our meeting in Ohrid last year. I pointed out that mutual recognition is necessary for many reasons, and since there is no conflict between Macedonia and Serbia or any territorial claims on either side -- at least none has ever been officially stated -- there are no major obstacles for our two countries to recognize each other, while it is a completely different matter what ideas and forces exist. Finally, the fact is that the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] agreed to withdraw, and there were no incidents while it was withdrawing. In view of all this, and in view of the general mood in Macedonia, and I believe in Serbia as well, I think that mutual recognition would be welcomed. I underlined even earlier that two things are very important for relations between Macedonia and Serbia: Serbia's recognition of Macedonia and the Macedonian people in 1944, and the agreed withdrawal of the JNA from Macedonia. Both imply mutual recognition as a logical consequence, and the beginning of the development of mutual relations in all fields. On the other hand, I think that recognizing Macedonia would be very advantageous for the FRY, because it would eliminate any suspicion that the conflict might spread to the south, that is, that the FRY has some hidden interests, which are now mentioned only in certain speculation about the future course of events in the Balkans. Then the problem of Kosovo would show itself in a completely different light, as a problem that is an affair of the FRY in the first place. Because, as long as there are fears that the war might spread to the south, speculations about some pan-Albanian settlement for the region will exist. In fact, that settlement sustains the forces in other former Yugoslav republics that support the establishment of greater nation states. In that respect, Macedonia has been an exception, because since the very beginning we have publicly maintained that the Macedonian state is possible only within its current borders. Everything else is an adventure and a disaster. [Correspondent] The reaction of Greek Prime Minister Papandreou to the news of U.S. recognition of Macedonia was to accuse you of living out of reality, or rather, of being unable to comprehend all the possible consequences. How do you see your future relations with Greece? [Gligorov] I view them only in terms of negotiations, regardless of whether those negotiations deal with our relations in general, or with what has been happening these days, while it is precisely such daily platforms that we have been witnessing that reveal where a different attitude on our part would lead. We have plenty of good will, we are ready to discuss any subject, and I think that the initial mistake was made precisely because we failed to follow this course. Our attitude will prove that many things that appear to be complex are, in fact, easy to solve. For instance, it is ridiculous to maintain that Macedonia has any pretensions to any Greek territory. The Greeks are constantly demanding guarantees from us on the unchangeability of the borders, while we are constantly repeating, parrot fashion, to them that the borders are definite. We have proposed a bilateral agreement on this, and if necessary we are even ready to sign it at any time, even with guarantees by the European Community [EC], or the United Nations. The Greek path to Europe leads through Macedonia, while our path to the rest of the world leads through Greece, not to mention other mutual interests. Why should we disregard our mutual interests, and keep up the current conflicts that are in many ways imaginary, emotional, and encumbered with certain interpretations of the historical heritage on both sides? In our approach I see the reality of Macedonian policy. Besides, I think that the character of that policy can also be seen in the fact that the Macedonian people have never instigated hatred toward any people. Since the very beginning we have emphasized that we want good relations with all our neighbors, and also an improvement rather than a breakup of those relations in all fields. As for Greece, just remember that it is not the Macedonians who introduced the embargo or closed the borders. [Correspondent] Macedonia was an underdeveloped country, the least viable of all the former Yugoslav republics, but still you have paid off all your debts to the international creditors, which has opened the door to your full membership of the IMF and to new loans. What is the current policy here, and what is the strategic policy of Macedonia? [Gligorov] I am convinced that Macedonia must base its position on a final orientation to the market economy. All small countries, of which we are one, as well as all the Balkan states, must opt for open national economies if they want to prosper. It is difficult to stick to that course without foreign financial aid, and therefore all our forces have been concentrated on how to eliminate the obstacles that had resulted from the unsettled international status of Macedonia. We managed to bring missions from international financial institutions to Macedonia even before we settled our status in those institutions. Thanks to this, a whole series of preparatory measures were completed, while certain projects were not taken into full consideration for formal reasons. Finally, we were not able to pay off the debts that we inherited from former Yugoslavia, as the regular method of indemnification would have delayed some other economic steps that we were planning, so we asked the creditors for understanding, and we did meet with understanding in terms of how to pay off our $100 million debt: The governments of certain countries first helped us, then the International Development Agency helped us with a loan under very favorable conditions, while the remaining $25 million was indemnified by the Soros Foundation, which also gave us a short-term loan under favorable conditions. [Correspondent] We presume that you held the same attitude even at the time of the talks between the six presidents of the republics of former Yugoslavia. What was the reason for your failure to bring the other participants to their senses? [Gligorov] That depended also on the will of all the participants, and no solution could possibly have been imposed. I think that a very important opportunity was missed at that time, one that some people underestimated, while others saw it as a trap. I am referring to the offer by the EC that Yugoslavia would be admitted to the EC as an associate member, if a peaceful solution to the crisis was found. The offer also anticipated $4.5 billion for a positive answer. However, there was either no readiness to accept the offer, or there was a lack of trust in it, or the choice had already been made in favor of the solutions that later brought about clashes. I still believe that a great opportunity was missed, one that would have enabled all of us to avoid everything that followed thereafter in the region. [Correspondent] A Russian political delegation and a U.S. military delegation were in Skopje yesterday. Do you feel that you have been under pressure by both sides? [Gligorov] Neither of those visits was intended to exert pressure on me. We talked with President Yeltsin's envoy Churkin primarily about future diplomatic and other relations, and particularly about economic cooperation between our two countries, something in which we are very interested. Second, Moscow is very much involved in finding a solution to the Bosnian crisis, and that was an opportunity to brief us on everything that has to do with the direct Russian involvement. We also wanted to learn more about some broader elements of Russian policy, its main principles, and what we can expect from it. Which is to say, it was a meeting of the representatives of two friendly countries, and it was a good opportunity for both delegations to become better informed and to make agreements on more dynamic cooperation, particularly in the field of economics. The arrival of the U.S. Army delegation had to do primarily with a visit to the U.S. contingent. There were absolutely no pressures or demands to increase the number of their soldiers here, which is the subject of a lot of public speculation. It is always forgotten that the U.S. troops are part of UNPROFOR, while neither earlier nor now have there been bilateral demands that their troops be stationed in Macedonia. The story about Macedonia being a U.S. aircraft carrier on the ground is not realistic for serious reasons and also for banal ones, since our airport is hardly able to respond to the needs of civilian air traffic. Still, in view of the times that we are living in, I can understand all sorts of exaggerations and combinations, although they have nothing to do with reality; I understand all those who are constantly discovering what lies behind this or that. [Correspondent] The reason for such calculations is that the retailoring of the political map of the Balkans is in progress. [Gligorov] Macedonia has undoubtedly chosen the European option, but at the same time the presence of Russia is quite legitimate in the region. That is the reality, but in my opinion, the reality is also the ever greater interest of Russia in cooperation with Europe, the United States, and the entire world. There is no reason for such a partnership not to be present in the Balkans. There is no justification for sticking to the old formula that it is either Russia or the United States that dominates the region. All countries are interested in their own presence in the Balkans, and you can see that Japan is also setting its foot here -- not only because it wants to confirm its economic power in global diplomacy as well, but also because there are increasingly fewer regions in the world that are attractive for international capital. In that respect the Balkans is attractive for anybody. I think that the time of looking at the Balkans through the prism of the Cold War and the division of the world into two superpowers is definitely over. Obviously, this is not particularly clear to everybody these days, but the sooner one understands that, the fewer traumas there will be and the more easily eliminated. [Box, page 12] [Correspondent] Because of the war and the international blockade of the FRY, the traffic on Morava and Vardar Rivers has almost died out. In the meantime, you have taken part in the opening of the road and railroad link Sofia-Skopje-Tirana-Drac. How far has the project gone, and what impact will it have on the old route? [Gligorov] This West-East route neither replaces nor is supposed to diminish the importance of the old North-South route. For Macedonia and Greece that is the shortest way to Europe, as well as for Serbia to the south, and its value will be fully restored when the war ends. Still, why should we not make such a East-West link? Albania was isolated for a long time, whereas connections with Albania are an objective economic necessity for Macedonia. The current connections are almost vitally important. In addition, the exchange and communications with Bulgaria were quite limited. Macedonia is situated in the middle of the southern Balkans, has no direct access to the sea, while those two routes intersect in Macedonia. Hence the chance for a more rapid development of Macedonia. You see that the international community, in particular the European Union, is interested in developing the possibilities of those two connections. [Box, page 13] [Correspondent] The fears that the deadline given to the Bosnian Serbs by NATO might entangle Macedonia in some troubles are quite widespread. What do you think? [Gligorov] These are certainly overreactions, but I think that the rapid deterioration of the conflict has raised the temperature not only in Macedonia, but also throughout the Balkans. Just look at the reactions from Albania, Bulgaria, and other countries. One has to take these into consideration, but let us hope that in the meantime reason will prevail, and that the negotiations on heavy weapons will start.
