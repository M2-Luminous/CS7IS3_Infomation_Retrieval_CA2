If substantially all of a significant equity financing is invested by an investor whose objectives are in large part strategic, or if the financing is led by such an investor, it is generally presumed that no more than 50% of the increase in investment price compared to the prior significant equity financing is attributable to an increased valuation of the company. 6. Where a company has been self-financing and has had positive cash flow from operations for at least the past two fiscal years, Asset Value may be increased based on a very conservative financial measure regarding P/E ratios or cash flow multiples, or other appropriate financial measures of similar publicly-traded companies, discounted for illiquidity. Should the chosen valuation cease to be meaningful, the valuation may be restored to a cost basis, or in the event of significant deterioration in performance or potential, to a valuation below cost to reflect impairment. 7. With respect to portfolio companies that are likely to face bankruptcy or discontinue operations for some other reason, liquidating value may be employed. This value may be determined by estimating the realizable value (often through professional appraisals or firm offers to purchase) of all assets and then subtracting all liabilities and all associated liquidation costs. 8. Warrants should be valued at the excess of the value of the underlying security over the exercise price. D. Equity Securities_Public Companies 1. Public securities should be valued as follows: (a) For over-the-counter stocks, take the average of the bid price at the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days, and (b) for listed stocks, take the average of the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days. 2. The valuation of public securities that are restricted should be discounted appropriately until the securities may be freely traded. Such discounts typically range from 10% to 40%, but the discounts can be more or less, depending upon the resale restrictions under securities laws or contractual agreements. 3. When the number of shares held is substantial in relation to the average daily trading volume, the valuation should be discounted by at least 10%, and generally by more. IV. Valuation Policy With Supplementary Information A. General 1. The [Board of Directors] [General Partners] have sole responsibility for determining the Asset Value of each of the Loans and Investments and of the portfolio in the aggregate. 2. Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate [at least semi-annually_as of the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year and as of the end of the fiscal year.] [at least annually_as of the end of the fiscal year.] Fiscal year-end valuations are audited as set forth in 13 CFR Part 107, Appendix III, Section II, paragraph D. 3. This Valuation Policy is intended to provide a consistent, conservative basis for establishing the Asset Value of the portfolio. The Policy presumes that Loans and Investments are acquired with the intent that they are to be held until maturity or disposed of in the ordinary course of business. B. Interest-Bearing Securities 1. Loans shall be valued in an amount not greater than cost, with Unrealized Depreciation being recognized when value is impaired. The valuation of loans and associated interest receivables on interest-bearing securities should reflect the portfolio concern's current and projected financial condition and operating results, its payment history and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments when due. 2. When a valuation relies more heavily on asset versus earnings approaches, additional criteria should include the seniority of the debt, the nature of any pledged collateral, the extent to which the security interest is perfected, the net liquidation value of tangible business assets, and the personal integrity and overall financial standing of the owners of the business. In those instances where a loan valuation is based on an analysis of certain collateralized assets of a business or assets outside the business, the valuation should, at a minimum, consider the net liquidation value of the collateral after reasonable selling expenses. Under no circumstances, however, shall a valuation based on the underlying collateral be considered as justification for any type of loan appreciation. 3. Appropriate unrealized depreciation on past due interest which is converted into a security (or added to an existing security) should be recognized when collection is doubtful. Collection is presumed to be in doubt when one or both of the following conditions occur: (i) Interest payments are more than 120 days past due; or (ii) the small concern is in bankruptcy, insolvent, or there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. a. Licensees may rebut this presumption by providing evidence of collectibility satisfactory to SBA. Such evidence may include the existence of collateral, the value of which has been verified through an appraisal by an independent professional appraiser acceptable to SBA. Such an appraisal shall be at liquidation value (net of liquidation costs) and shall have been performed within the 12 months immediately preceding the valuation date. In considering whether collateral provides an appropriate basis for valuations, SBA will review the Licensee's operating history for evidence concerning its willingness and ability to pursue available remedies (including foreclosure) in default situations. b. For those Licensees primarily involved in making loans, the use of a loan classification system is strongly encouraged to help manage portfolios and determine Asset Values, with loans that warrant extra attention being flagged by the Licensee's management. Such a ``watch list'' can also be used to report to the Board of Directors or General Partner(s). For each loan placed on the watch list, a reason or statement should describe the particular situation. Danger signals that should alert the Licensee to potential problems include delinquency, a lack of profitability, weak or decreasing equity, increasing debt load, a deteriorating cash position, an abnormal increase in accounts payable, inaccurate financial information, insurance cancellation, judgments and tax liens, family problems, loss of employees, collateral problems, slowdown in inventory turnover, poor maintenance of plant and equipment, and heavy reliance on short term debt. c. Upon careful consideration of all the relevant factors, the Board of Directors or General Partners shall determine which loans require recognition of Unrealized Depreciation. It is a good rule of operation for a Licensee to perform downward valuations earlier rather than later. When the quality of a loan recovers, a higher Asset Value may subsequently be assigned. 4. The carrying value of interest-bearing securities shall not be adjusted for changes in interest rates. 5. The valuation of convertible debt may be adjusted to reflect the value of the underlying equity security net of the conversion price. a. Accepted methods for valuing convertible debentures generally involve one of two approaches. The first approach views the debenture as a debt obligation. Under this approach, the Licensee should utilize the loan valuation techniques described in this section above. The second approach considers the conversion of all convertible securities of the same class into their common stock equivalent, taking into account dilution, and a subsequent valuation of the Licensee's proportionate equity interest. Valuation of this equity interest should follow the equity valuation techniques described in Paragraph C. of this section. b. Normally, the reported value is the higher of these two alternatives. However, Licensees should disregard higher equity values and retain lower debt-based valuations if there are circumstances which make conversion undesirable. When equity considerations govern the Asset Value assigned, all underlying factors should be disclosed. C. Equity Securities_Private Companies
