Tian and Xi were sentenced to 15 and 12 years, respectively, in jail. The judicial organs took facts as the basis and the law as their criterion in reaching the judgment. The sentencing standards used are proper and the two offenders received their due punishment. Xi Yang is a reporter of MING PAO based in Hong Kong who was assigned by the newspaper to cover news in the inland [nei di 0355 0966]. He is welcome if he does the things a reporter is supposed to do -- gathering news and writing news stories. He is, however, not a law-abiding person, and he chose to engage in illegal acts of stealing and spying on financial and economic state secrets, which caused catastrophic consequences. These kinds of illegal acts, if not punished according to the law, will severely sabotage reform, opening up, and economic construction and do great harm to the interest of the state. Xi Yang's is a criminal case, pure and simple. The punishment of criminals guilty of stealing secrets and the protection of correspondents' freedom to gather news in accordance with the law are two totally different things. There is a clear distinction between legitimate news gathering and illegal spying. Our government protects the freedom of news coverage but not the freedom of stealing state secrets. Whoever steals state secrets in violation of the law will be punished according to the law. As everybody knows, in the past decade or so, China, which is implementing the policy of reform and opening to the outside world, has opened its door to and warmly welcomed correspondents from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan as well as from foreign countries to cover news in China, and offered, to the extent possible, services to make things easier for them in their legitimate reporting. This is the way we received the over 1,000 Hong Kong correspondents who came to the inland for news coverage since last year. Most correspondents from overseas abide by Chinese law, and only one case, Xi Yang's case, of stealing state secrets and spying was discovered last year. The law is sacred and no one is allowed to break it. No sovereign country or responsible government will tolerate illegal acts of spying on secrets in the name of news coverage. As for Tian Ye, he is "a thief in the family" who wormed his way into an important state department. As a deputy chief of the General Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the People's Bank of China, his acts of stealing, spying on, and illegally supplying state secrets to others -- acts that have caused great damage to the country and people -- are even more intolerable under the law. The end he has come to is educational to the people: under the new historical period, reform and opening up indeed pose a severe test to the loyalty of every cadre of the state. In the future, we must step up ideological education among the cadres. We must also strictly enforce law and discipline and implement effective measures to prevent similar violations from happening again. This case of stealing secrets and spying has set off the alarm bell again. It reminds us to be alert in safeguarding state secrets and also serves as a warning to those who divulge or steal secrets. May the alarm bell ring forever!
