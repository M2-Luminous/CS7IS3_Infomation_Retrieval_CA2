The agreement, proposed by Venezuela, will allow approximately 1,500 Colombian inmates to return to their country and finish serving there the sentences ordered by Venezuelan courts. Eighteen months after the agreement to allow prisoners to go to Colombia was presented, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich and Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio today signed the final document. The agreement calls for the transfer of prisoners, provided they have been sentenced by the courts. Of the 2,800 Colombian prisoners in Venezuelan jails, only 1,500 qualify under the agreement. Nonetheless, the agreement is voluntary, which means that both Venezuelans and Colombians will be able to choose if they want to be repatriated or not to their country of origin.
