Meanwhile, the party of many millions that was successful in the elections for the State Duma has its own elite and its own "politburo," in a manner of speaking. True, this is almost unnoticeable in the shadow of the loquacious leader. What kind of people are they? Who is behind them? What do they want and do they fully share the views of Vladimir Volfovich? In part one can obtain answers to these questions from the conversation of the reviewer of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, Leonard Nikishin, with Aleksandr Vengerosvksiy, one of the leaders of the LDPR and deputy chairman of the State Duma. A regular officer and colonel in the Soviet Army, until recently he worked in one of the analytical centers of the Ministry of Defense. They also knew him in the GRU and in the Military-Industrial Commission. This predetermined the basic theme of the conversation: The fate of the domestic military-industrial complex and questions with respect to conversion of the defense industry. And although the conversation seemingly touched only on economic and production themes, one could not fail to notice that the statements of Mr. Vengerovskiy involved quite definite political approaches showing that the economy always serves politics. [Nikishin] In the past, you dealt with defense.... [Vengerovskiy] At present as well. As long as there is something to defend. [Nikishin] You probably have your own approach to the problems in the conversion of defense branches. Do your views coincide with Zhirinovskiy's approach? After all, he declares that it is not necessary to carry out any conversion, that our military-industrial complex must work at full capacity. And where, if you please, will its output go? [Vengerovskiy] We presently have about 5 million people employed in the military-industrial sphere. If you take them along with their families and the infrastructures that in one way or another are working for the military-industrial complex, then it is 15 million people. On the other hand, if you look at Russia's export sphere, then 1 kilogram of a military aircraft is worth $3,000, whereas for a civilian aircraft it is worth $1,000. And raw materials now being exported are worth about 20 cents per kilogram. It is worthwhile to think about these 15 million people: Will they be full-value citizens and live normally or will they form an explosive social medium? The process that we call conversion was originally incorrect, because it was based on the illusion that Russia is surrounded only by allies and friends and that they are waiting for her with open arms as a beloved member of the world community. [Nikishin] But there are calculations and forecasts on how much military output can be absorbed by the external market. We will simply be choked by exports of this kind and we will not ensure any prosperity for the people. [Vengerovskiy] I want to remind you that just six years ago the USSR was second in the world in the export of arms. [Nikishin] Of which a large share was given to various friends of ours on credit. [Vengerovskiy] It seems that your information is not very correct. To meet the state budget, it was necessary to have not only petrodollars, which by that time were already drying up, but also other sources of revenue. And I, who worked for many years in state structures, know that the revenue came from the sale of arms. I know to which markets it went--it was the same ones that are prepared even now to take our arms if the state will assume a protectionistic position instead of pursuing false economic, military, and other doctrines, to which I also include "Partnership for Peace." [Nikishin] And do you think that we should do this permanently? This is an abnormal structure of the economy. [Vengerovskiy] Then I will come back with this question to you: Can the United States permanently produce arms? Despite the conversion carried out in the USSR and in Russia, it not only has not reduced its own military production but has even increased it. They are investing in new military technologies. Russia must have a geopolitical task that also includes the concept of the production and sale of arms. It must answer the question of what comes after this. [Nikishin] Why is the United States not carrying out conversion? What, in your opinion, is the closing of the nuclear test range in Nevada all about? The weapons that have been stockpiled in the world led to just one thing: At some time they began to be used. [Vengerovskiy] Yes, I also read Chekhov attentively. The gun that was hanging in the first act will certainly be fired in the last act. But the present local wars began not because of the accumulation of arms but because of the disruption of polarity in the world, when the second pole--the USSR--was liquidated. You see that the new world order is being established by no means with the laurels and doves of peace. Force is always used to resolve political questions. Are you trying to say that Russia should disarm? And as for Nevada, this is not serious. The Americans have already performed all the tests that they need. [Nikishin] I am not talking about disarmament at all. But why should we return to the days of the Cold War, of blocs armed to the teeth? Do you see this as a guarantee of our future happy life? [Vengerovskiy] No one intends to produce as much armament as there was before. We must, in the first place, produce enough military-industrial output for today's needs. Secondly, we must make weapons that correspond to contemporary warfare. Thirdly, we must supply absolutely new army structures with these arms. [Nikishin] At the same time, just as before, other structures are just as sickly.... [Vengerovskiy] Nothing of the sort. Over the last 30 years, the military-industrial complex also produced what we call consumer goods. Everything decent that we now have in the area of household equipment was, as a rule, a development and product of the enterprises of the military-industrial complex. We do not have anything better. [Nikishin] One might think that the military-industrial complex has inundated us with first-class household appliances. Somehow I do not recall seeing such an abundance in our stores. But let us return to the basic output of the military-industrial complex--weapons. How do you propose that we drive our competitors from the arms market? [Vengerovskiy] This requires a policy of state protectionism. As you know, Japan and America are savage enemies when it comes to trade and markets. One has to search for another state like ours that freely admits foreign competitors into internal markets and abandons its niches in foreign markets. The corruption that first completely ate away the structures of the Soviet Union and now of Russia led to our departure from the traditional arms markets. All of this must now be put back on a normal course. In general, if we now take the so-called psychology of "new thinking," then it is more advantageous to import all industrial products from abroad, drive American cars, and use French perfume. And what remains as Russia's share if we are not even supposed to build missiles? We consider what happened in Russia to be a mistake. We will definitely give back to our state the majesty of being a world power and its scientific-technical level. [Nikishin] But if this scientific-technical level does not lead to an increase in the well-being of the people.... [Vengerovskiy] And you think that the standard of living of the people has improved in recent years? [Nikishin] No, but was it really high during the Breshnev years, when everything was subjected exclusively to the interests of the military-industrial complex? [Vengerovskiy] Can you now afford to buy an apartment, an automobile, or even a refrigerator? [Nikishin] No. But this, with the possible exception of the refrigerator, is something that I could never afford. [Vengerovskiy] I am very grateful to my country for the fact that I received a free education, that I have the chance to live in the apartment that they gave me at that time, and that I also made all the main purchases in my life at that time. At the present time, with my salary of 350,000 rubles as deputy chairman of the Duma, I cannot afford such purchases. This is possible for people who in the years of perestroyka were able to rob the state by destroying it, establish their own private capital, and go abroad. It is quite clear who lives well in Russia now. But let us return to the problem of the military-industrial complex. It is above all the defensive possibility of the state to hold back the onslaught of external enemies. As soon as we were deprived of it, "the enemies burned down our own hut." And you and I are standing on the burned-out site. Gigantic investments are required to convert military production. No one will ever provide them. If the state becomes delirious and thinks that we are surrounded by nothing but friends, then what happens is what happened with the USSR and now with Russia. There are no conversion programs in America. I have information to support this assertion. On account of my activities in the party, I head an intelligence service. With the help of plenty of Russian patriots abroad, we have complete information about what it happening and where. [Nikishin] You spoke of the new technological level of the military-industrial complex. How do you see this? [Vengerovskiy] It is not just the production of arms. Above all we must preserve basic science. Brains are always expensive. But there will not be any conversion until there is money for it. Otherwise this is debauchery. The state order does not exist in its previous volume but the state has not insured defense enterprises and has not provided any money for their reorientation. Give me capital investments for the renewal of equipment and machinery and I will be pleased to produce tape recorders like Sony does, to make refrigerators like those of General Motors, and to build cars better than those of Mercedes. But without working capital the plants began to simplify their production programs and to make titanium shovels and stoves, etc. In the past, we were essentially able to compete with the West in all areas of scientific-technical progress. But the CPSU, which became completely rotten from the top, let someone like Gorbachev come to power who destroyed everything as a consequence of his incompetence, to put it mildly. After him came an obkom secretary with his thinking. What else can we say? Our country deserves intelligent leaders. Professionals came to the Liberal-Democratic Party, not theoreticians in playing the accordion and not political scientists, who yesterday were asserting that communism was not far off. We are practical self-made people. And there is no reason to chuckle over Zhirinovskiy's book "Last Push to the South." [Nikishin] No, we were not able to stand up to competition with the West. The second scientific-technical revolution by-passed us. And it did not happen in Gorbachev's time at all but much earlier. I do not want to chuckle over "Last Push," for this book evokes other feelings. For me there is a great deal there that is unacceptable. [Vengerovskiy] Overall I am also not very pleased with it as an example of literary creativity. I was educated with other literature. But there has not been any fascism in our party, there is none, and there will be none. Fascism will appear in the country when the petty storekeepers, the so-called merchants, who have become accustomed to having a good standard of living through speculation, begin to fall into ruin. And this will certainly happen. Then they will demand the restoration of the status-quo. It is clear what idea is best for this. But this time they will not point to the Jews. They have all left. P.S. After the conversation, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy--an absolute pragmatist and, in his own words, a practical person--gave to the correspondent of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA several brochures that apparently are among the favorite reading material of the leaders of the LDPR and their flock. One work made up of several sections is entitled "Mertvaya voda" [Dead Water]. Its authorship belongs to some center or group of persons called the "internal predictor." The first part is called "Depressurization" and the second part "Inscription." I am not going to assess this "catechism" but I will just quote a few revelations in it that evoked a sense of dark humor in me. "Reasoning according to AUTHORITY--INTELLECTUAL PARASITISM--is the primary quality of the crowd; in it one can see the striving of the crowd to live according to prepared formulas that are provided by the authorities to which it is subject.... The destruction of the AUTHORITY TRADITION prevailing in the crowd turns the crowd into rabble.... The crowd or rabble may be organized into structures: parliamentary, trade-union, party, etc." "Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: `Until heaven and earth pass not one jot or one tittle will in any way pass from the law (of Moses) until all shall be fulfilled.' As is clear from the quote from the `Old Testament,' this `all' means the global Zionist-Nazi dictatorship, which in terms of Christianity is called the `kingdom of God on earth.'" "The revolution was a manifestation of the depletion of the reserve of stability in terms of the depth of identity of goal vectors as a result of an unstructured closed state through the Masonry of the post-Peter `elite' on the supra-Jewish global predictor." "I.V. Stalin is the only one of the party `chiefs' about whom it can be said that his education allowed him to develop his own conceptual activity." "I.V. Stalin and some part of the group supporting him that came from the people rose in their world view above the broad popular masses and the `elite' and attained the quality of priesthood [zhRECHEstvo] (life expression [zhizneRECHEniye)." "The leaders of the Third Reich were originally under the control of the highest suprastate Zionist Masonry." "It is illegitimate to transfer the parliamentary experience of the West to Russia, because parliamentarianism is simply a screen over the directive-address system of Masonic mafia control." "It is useful to reissue the work of I.V. Stalin, `Ekonomischeskiye problemy sotsialisma v SSSR' [Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR] and those who have the opportunity should read it and think about it now."
