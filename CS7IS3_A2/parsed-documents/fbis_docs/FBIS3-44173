The press agency disclosed that security forces were positioned around the Labor Exchange and prevented thousands of people from going to the meeting point. According to ABP, the organizers of the demonstration subsequently called off the strike, accusing the government of not "respecting union freedom." They stated: "We will fight to the end," adding that they would "consult the grass roots" before deciding what to do. On 20 January, the unions called for a 120-percent salary increase and an over 300-percent increase in the statutory minimum wage to offset the increase in prices brought on by the devaluation. The CFA franc has been devalued by 50 percent in relation to the French franc, which was its currency of reference and convertibility. The exchange rate is now 1Fr to 100 CFA francs instead of the previous rate of 1Fr to 50 CFA francs. On 23 January, President Nicephore Soglo reiterated that a price freeze on basic commodities and a series of fiscal relief measures had been decided upon. He agreed to the "principle" of a salary adjustment but urged workers to accept a reasonable salary increase to avoid a damaging and illusory competition between salary and prices. [Paris AFP in French at 1506 GMT on 25 January in a similar, Cotonou-datelined item adds: "It has been observed in Cotonou that several thousands of people who tried to meet at the Cotonou Labor Exchange on 25 January in response to a call by six unions dispersed in the early afternoon without incident after security forces had prevented them from gathering there. At 1400 GMT, police were still patrolling the city center, banning all meetings. ["The union leaders, who had called for the strike in protest against the social repercussions of the 11 January CFA franc devaluation, have denounced the government's "antidemocratic attitude" and decided not to attend the working session they were supposed to have held in the afternoon with President Nicephore Soglo. ["In a communique issued on 24 January, the interior minister justified the banning of the demonstration by saying that he was informed of the organizers' intention to round off the meeting with a march through the city only at the last minute. ["Minister Antoine Alabi Gbegan told AFP on 25 January: `This march was not included in their initial request for permission to hold the meeting. I, therefore, preferred to ban the demonstration to avoid any incidents.'"]
