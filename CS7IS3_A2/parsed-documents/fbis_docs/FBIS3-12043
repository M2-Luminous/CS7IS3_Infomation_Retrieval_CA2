Here is what their letter says: We, deputies of the 45th Legislature and signers of this letter, acknowledge receiving your invitation asking us to join you at your residence on 29 March to commemorate the anniversary of the Haitian Constitution, under which we were democratically elected on 16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 [date as heard] and which we swore to respect and to enforce. These deputies add: We formally acknowledge this initiative. Unfortunately, we are sorry, but we are obliged to decline your invitation for the following reasons: First, the tragic conditions under which our people are struggling (?because of) the daily violation of this Constitution and its basic rights do not encourage us to party. In addition to this, we would like to be in our respective districts, with our voters on the occasion of 29 March. The authors of the bloody 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, however, block any and all steps in this direction with impunity and leave the population no choice other than headlong flight by thousands of boat people, turned back mercilessly regardless of any international treaties; the wandering of hundreds of thousands of refugees in desperate straits from the interior; and the most complete lack of security, highlighted every day by the bodies thrown to the animals, especially in the shantytowns and working-class neighborhoods of our cities, write these deputies. On the other hand, we make it a point to assure you, Mr. Ambassador, that any invitations that could result in a worthwhile solution to the current crisis that has caused so many disasters and so much mourning will be received eagerly and with gratitude. While waiting for such a greatly desired occasion to arise, we remain, yours truly, [signatures]. Such was the content of a letter written by Deputies Fignole Jean-Louis of the Mirebalais district; Duckens Marc Desrosiers, of Hinche; and Guerrier Compere, of Limonade, and sent to U.S. Ambassador William Lacy Swing. These are three National Front for Change and Democracy parliamentarians who have declined the U.S. ambassador's invitation to attend the anniversary of the Haitian Constitution commemoration by the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. It must also be said that Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators have also declined Ambassador Swing's invitation in Port-au-Prince.
