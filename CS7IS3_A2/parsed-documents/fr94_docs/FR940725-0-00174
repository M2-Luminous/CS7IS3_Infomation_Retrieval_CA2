FR940725-0-00174 FR940725-0-00019 Confined and enclosed space and other dangerous atmosphere work in shipyards is unique: it is routine; hazardous atmospheres are common; and the work activity itself frequently introduces or creates hazards. The confined spaces of each ship are different. A ship's interior structure may consist of a series of nested confined spaces, one within the other, each of which may be irregular and accessible through small hatches. Safety procedures based on attendants or quick rescue are not a safe or a practical solution. Evidence in the record from the industry attests to the success of the shipyard industry in protecting employees during work in confined spaces (Docket S&hyph;050: 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;12, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;17, 11&hyph;30). However, fatalities and injuries do occur: OSHA recorded 20 deaths between 1983&hyph;1992 in its Fatality Investigation Reports for the shipyard and boat-building industries combined. In every case, OSHA's evaluation indicated that the fatality was caused by a failure to follow the requirements of the previous Subpart B. Although accidents are relatively few given the large number of confined space entries and the hazards involved, the continuing number of fatalities and injuries indicates that a regulation is necessary to maintain safe work practices. H. International Trade In accordance with Executive Order 12866, OSHA assessed the effects of the final standard on international trade. The shipyard industry actively competes with foreign shipyards for ship repair and shipbuilding orders. If this OSHA regulation significantly increased the price of products and services of domestic shipyards, foreign shipyards could benefit. OSHA believes, however, that there will be no significant effect on products or services as a result of this regulation. I. Environmental Impact The confined spaces standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Part 1500), and DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR Part 11). This rule will not result in a significant incremental increase release of hazardous substances into the ambient air. Releases of substances regulated under EPA's SARA Title III or EPA NESHAP standards are subject to reporting and control requirements in those rules. J. References 1. U.S. Department of Commerce.
