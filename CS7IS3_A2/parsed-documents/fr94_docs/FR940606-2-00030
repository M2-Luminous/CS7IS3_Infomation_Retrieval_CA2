FR940606-2-00030 FR940606-2-00022 III. Refund Procedures A. Eligibility for Refund As indicated above, the Consent Order resolved all civil and administrative claims between DOE and Ginther. Accordingly, to the extent that is possible, the Ginther Consent Order amount of $144,864.85, plus accrued interest, will be distributed to purchasers of covered Ginther NGL products who can show that they were injured by Ginther's pricing practices during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977. B. Calculation of Refund Amount We are adopting a volumetric method to apportion the Ginther escrow account. Under this volumetric refund approach, a claimant's allocable share of the refined products pool is equal to the number of gallons of covered products purchased during the Consent Order period times a per gallon refund amount. We will derive the volumetric figure (per gallon refund amount) by dividing the $144,864.85 received from Ginther by the total volume of NGL products sold by the firm during the regulatory period, 25,312,920 gallons. This yields a volumetric refund amount of $.0057 per gallon, exclusive of interest. This method is based upon the presumption that the alleged overcharges were spread equally over all gallons of NGL products sold by Ginther during the regulatory period. E.g. , American Pac. Int'l, Inc. , 14 DOE ¶ 85,158, at 88,293 (1986). 2 2 Nevertheless, we realize that the impact on an individual claimant may have been greater than the volumetric amount. Therefore, the volumetric presumption will be rebuttable, and we will allow a claimant to submit evidence detailing the specific overcharges that it incurred in order to be eligible for a larger refund. E.g. , Standard Oil Co./Army and Air Force Exchange Serv. , 12 DOE ¶ 85,015 (1984). Such an application will be granted only if an applicant makes a persuasive showing that: (1) it was ``overcharged'' by a specific amount, (2) it sustained a disproportionate share of Ginther's alleged overcharges, and (3) it was injured by those overcharges. See MCO Holdings, Inc., MGPC, Inc./Little America Refining Co. , 19 DOE ¶ 85,560 (1989); Marathon Petroleum Co./Red Diamond Oil Co. , 19 DOE ¶ 85,543 (1989); Getty Oil Co./Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad Co. , 18 DOE ¶ 85,107 (1988). To the extent that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive a refund above the volumetric refund level. In computing the appropriate refunds of this type, we will prorate the refund amount by the ratio of the Ginther Consent order amount as compared to the aggregate overcharge amount alleged by the ERA. Amtel, Inc./Whitco, Inc. , 19 DOE ¶ 85,319 (1989) ( Amtel/Whitco ). Under the volumetric approach, an eligible claimant will receive a refund equal to the number of gallons of covered products that it purchased from Ginther during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977, multiplied by the per gallon volumetric amount for this proceeding. Accordingly, each claimant will be required to establish, by documentation or reasonable estimation, the volume of products that it purchased during this period. In addition, each successful claimant will receive a pro rata portion of the interest that has accrued on the Ginther funds since the date of remittance. As in previous cases, we will establish a minimum amount of $15 for refund claims. E.g. , Uban Oil Co. , 9 DOE ¶ 82,541, at 85,225 (1982). Accordingly, an applicant must have purchased at least 2,544 gallons of NGL products from Ginther in order for its claim to be considered. C. Showing of Injury Each claimant will be required to document its purchases of covered products from Ginther during the Consent Order period. In addition, in order to receive a refund, an applicant generally must demonstrate through the submission of detailed evidence that it did not pass on the alleged overcharges to its customers. See, e.g. , Office of Enforcement , 8 DOE ¶ 82,597, at 85,396&hyph;97 (1981) ( Vickers ).
