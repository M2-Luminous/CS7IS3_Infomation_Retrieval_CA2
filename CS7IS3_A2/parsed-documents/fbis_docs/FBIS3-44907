Yeltsin has formally invited Kravchuk to participate in his talks with Clinton, the press service said, adding that this has been made possible after the three countries reached an understanding on some major issues, including nuclear disarmament in Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian president's foreign policy adviser Anton Butekyo said earlier on Monday that Kravchuk had not decided whether to attend the Moscow summit. Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with some 1,600 of nuclear war-heads inherited from the former Soviet Union. Russia and the United States have been concerned over the safety of the nuclear arsenal on the Ukrainian territory. Two days before the trilateral Moscow summit, chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich will come for a one-on- one meeting with Yeltsin. The talk will focus on the nuclear weapons in Belarus, INTERFAX reported. Nuclear issue will also be high on the agenda when President Clinton makes a stop-over in Minsk on January 15-16 after the NATO summit and his visit to Moscow.
