In an interview with XINHUA reporters, the director of the All-China Office of the Shopping Basket Project Tang Yong said that thanks to the efforts of the project, citizens' consumption of non-staple foods has greatly increased. The project began seven years ago with the aim to ensure supplies of vegetables, meat, eggs and other non-staple foods for large and medium-sized cities. Since 1987, per capita consumption of meat in China has increased from 18.4 kg to 32.1 kg, of eggs from 5.5 kg to 9.3 kg, of aquatic products from 8.8 kg to 15.2 kg, and of vegetables from 135.3 kg to 186.7 kg. Tang said that China's citizens now consume more diversified kinds of non-staple food with higher nutritional quality. New varieties introduced from abroad in recent years can be seen in today's vegetable stalls. Out-of-season vegetables now enrich household meals. He said that the farmers now pay greater attention to adjusting their production structure to meet the demands of the market. To ensure the smooth carrying out of the project, many large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Wuhan have taken effective measures. Construction funds and risk funds for vegetable growing have been set up to protect farmers. Measures such as keeping reserves of important non-staple foods have also been adopted. The Shanghai government will allocate 266 million yuan in opening up 3,000 more hectares of vegetable fields this year. The Beijing government plans to invest 67 million yuan in opening up 10,000 hectares of new vegetable fields and introducing mass production of vegetables in its suburbs. He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade in charge of supplies of non-staple foods, said the state will spare no efforts to protect vegetable fields in city suburbs. He suggested that vegetable fields should be included in comprehensive city construction plans.
