The President also said during a press conference at Government House that "nothing could be decided" about Raul Matera, the number two candidate on the ruling Justicialist Party's Federal Capital slate of potential delegates to the Constituent Assembly, until a complete diagnosis was made. Matera was admitted to the Otamendi Clinic on Wednesday with pneumonia. Menem added he had tried to visit Matera, who is also science and technology secretary and serves as the head of the city Peronist Party. At the same time the President said he supported the concept of a separation of powers but did not directly respond to the Episcopal Conference of bishops' assertion that the executive branch had experienced "uncontrolled growth" during his term. However, he said, any final decision "depends fundamentally on what the people say through the reform process under way." He added that Church-state relations were "normal." In their statement the bishops left open the possibility that future presidents might be of different religions -- currently the head of state is required under the Constitution to be a practicing Catholic -- but rejected the possibility of an atheist leading the country. Reacting to that last statement Lomas de Zamora Suffragan Bishop Juan Carlos Maccarone yesterday [10 March] stated that the Church had in fact "left open" the issue of the head of state's religion because it was not a priority and did not have a mandate from the Episcopal Conference. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf meanwhile declined to comment on the Church statement, saying that was the duty of the Foreign Ministry's religion department. Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos Corach, the leading candidate on the ruling Justicialist Party's slate of potential delegates to the Constituent Assembly, took issue with the bishop's statement on the separation of powers. "The executive branch has not increased its powers," he said. Among the opposition the Radical National Committee, in a statement signed by party Chairman Raul Alfonsin, said the bishops' declaration "contributes to the general consensus" required for reform. Alfonsin added that the Church's concern for the growth in the executive branch's powers "without a doubt coincides" with his own party's worries. Differing with the Church was the Argentine Society for Gay-Lesbian Integration [SIGLA], which warned that the Catholic Church's stance "puts the civil rights and the rights of minorities at risk." SIGLA noted in a statement issued yesterday that "the Catholic Church is endowed with privileges that the other religions lack." In other political news: -- Dario Cipollini, the former secretary for ex-Radical Deputy Luis Medina Allende, was summoned to testify yesterday in court on charges he bribed Peronist legislators during Cordoba's 1986 Constituent Assembly. -- The Trotskyist Left Socialist Front (FIS) yesterday presented its list of candidates for the April 10 Constituent Assembly election. The coalition, which opposes constitutional reform, will be led by Movement Toward Socialism's Nora Ciappone and former Socialist Workers Movement Deputy Luis Zamora.
