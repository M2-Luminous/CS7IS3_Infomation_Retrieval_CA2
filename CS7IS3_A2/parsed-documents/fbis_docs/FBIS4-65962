Kenth Pettersson, chairman of the Commercial Employees' Union, is firmly opposed to Swedish membership in the EU. "I have not decided to take part in the campaign work. But it may be necessary to counteract the affirmative union figures who travel around the country on propaganda tours," he told SD [SVENSKA DAGBLADET]. Concerned About Statements Anders Lindstrom, chairman of the Seamen's Union, and Sune Ekbage, chairman of the Papermill Workers' Union, have been on the side of the proponents for some time, and the day before yesterday they were joined by Goran Johnsson, chairman of the Metalworkers' Union. "It concerns me that Bertil Jonsson, the chairman of the LO [Federation of Trade Unions], is also so outspoken in advocating Swedish membership. There has been no decision within the LO on what stand the federation will take, but in spite of this our chairman is working hard for a yes vote in the popular referendum," Pettersson criticized. Therefore when the LO executive committee met on Monday [11 April], Pettersson requested a discussion of the chairman's conduct with regard to the referendum before the organization had reached any decision. "I think Jonsson should act as Stig Malm did when he was chairman. He did not become involved on either the yes or the no side," Pettersson said. Commercial Union Neutral However the executive committee of the Commercial Employees' Union did not decide to oppose membership in spite of having 11 opponents and only two proponents on the committee. It decided that the union should remain neutral on the referendum and leave members free to make up their minds individually. "The question of membership is so complex and complicated that the union aspects represent only part of membership," Pettersson said and went on: "The direction of economic policy, foreign policy and military cooperation, and a monetary union are all questions that everyone must take a stand on. And the leaders of the Commercial Employees' Union are no better qualified than anyone else to analyze and evaluate these questions." For LO the message is that the split on the EU issue within the federation, which was already great, has widened even more. Therefore everything currently points to an LO decision to remain neutral on the referendum. Hotel Workers' Union Opposed On the yes side today are the Metalworkers' Union and the Papermill Workers' Union. Within a short time they will probably be joined by some more union organizations with industrial ties. The Industrial Workers' Union and the Woodworkers' Union are the ones closest to the yes line. But they are more than outweighed by the no side. The Hotel and Restaurant Workers' Union and the Insurance Employees' Unions are already there. An extensive deliberation is taking place within the Transport Workers' Union, but the final result is expected to be opposition to Swedish EU membership. The Construction Workers' Union will respond after they hold their congress in August, and the Public Employees' Union will take a stand in the late fall after a deliberation. LO's biggest union, Municipal Employees, is currently leaning toward following the example of the Commercial Employees' Union and not taking a stand at all but leaving it up to the members without making a central recommendation. Rejection Demanded Motions to be considered at the union congress in June call for the union to reject Swedish EU membership. The union's executive committee has not yet responded to the motions. The Graphic Arts Employees' Union has already decided not to take a central stand. The union contains both high-profile advocates and opponents of EU membership. Thus it is virtually impossible for the LO leadership, which publicly applauded the negotiating results between Sweden and the EU, especially the future status of collective agreements, to bring the widely separated opinions together to form a consensus opinion. But the LO is not the only organization that will probably keep quiet in the EU referendum. TCO [Central Organization of Salaried Employees] and SACO [Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations] also have no plans to reach a decision or issue recommendations on how their members should vote on the membership question. Thus the central union organizations will not advocate Swedish EU membership prior to the referendum. Individual unions can play that role. But judging from the Metalworkers' Union's affirmation of EU membership, the campaign will be low-key and defensive. Discussion Urged The decision by the executive committee of the Metalworkers' Union does not mean a recommendation to its members to vote yes, despite the committee's approval. Instead the members are urged to discuss the issue in depth and study the union leadership's opinions and the reasons behind them. The industrial workers' labor colleague, SIF [Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry], has already decided not to issue any central recommendations on how its members should vote.
