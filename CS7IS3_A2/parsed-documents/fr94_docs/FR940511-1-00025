FR940511-1-00025 FR940511-1-00005 12 CFR Part 230 [Regulation DD; Docket No. R&hyph;0836] Truth in Savings; Proposed Regulatory Amendment AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) which clarify that once interest is credited to an account, it becomes part of the principal. By defining terms such as ``crediting,'' and ``compounding,'' the amendments will provide certainty to institutions, better fulfill the purposes of the act, and eliminate anomalies that currently occur in the APY calculation. The amendments provide that for institutions that pay interest (that is, credit interest) to the consumer by check or transfer or permit interest to remain in the account, an institution must pay interest on funds that remain in the account at the same frequency as the institution credits interest by check or transfer. Accounts that credit interest solely by posting to the account would not be required to send out interest checks or to transfer the interest to other accounts. Similarly, institutions offering accounts that ``credit'' interest solely by paying it out to the consumer by check or transfer would not be required to permit credited interest to remain in the account for compounding. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0836, and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20551. Comments also may be delivered to room B&hyph;2222 of the Eccles Building between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. weekdays, or to the guard station in the Eccles Building courtyard on 20th Street NW (between Constitution Avenue and C Street) at any time. Comments may be inspected in Room MP&hyph;500 of the Martin Building between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays, except as provided in 12 CFR 261.8 of the Board's rules regarding the availability of information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane Ahrens, Senior Attorney, Kyung Cho, or Kurt Schumacher, Staff Attorneys, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at (202) 452&hyph;3667 or 452&hyph;2412; for questions associated with the regulatory flexibility analysis, Gregory Elliehausen, Economist, Office of the Secretary, at (202) 452&hyph;2504; for the hearing impaired only, Dorothea Thompson, Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, at (202) 452&hyph;3544. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: (1) Background The Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq. ) requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to consumers about their deposit accounts, including an annual percentage yield (APY) on interest-bearing accounts. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993 (See 57 FR 43337 and 58 FR 15077). Because the current formula for calculating the APY assumes that interest remains on deposit until maturity, the resulting APY may_but does not always_reflect the time value of money. On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal that would have factored into the APY calculation the specific time intervals for interest paid on the account_that is, the time value of money (58 FR 64190). It called for adding an additional APY formula. Based on the comments received and upon further analysis, the Board has withdrawn the proposed amendments. (See Docket R&hyph;0812 elsewhere in today's Federal Register .) Compounding and crediting issues. In the context of deliberations about the APY proposal, the Board has considered two related issues regarding depository institutions' compounding and crediting practices. This relationship between crediting and compounding has not previously been addressed in the regulation or in supplementary information. (The resolution of these issues, as discussed below, could provide an alternative basis for eliminating the anomaly produced by the current formula while requiring few changes to the current APY formula.) 1 1 If an institution offers a multi-year noncompounding CD, the APY produced by the current formula is less than the interest rate, even if the institution pays out interest annually or more often. The act requires institutions to pay interest on the full amount of the principal in the account each day, and provides that this requirement shall not be construed as prohibiting or requiring the use of any particular method of compounding or crediting interest. Regulation DD states that the requirement to pay interest on the full amount of principal does not require institutions to compound or credit interest at any particular frequency. Neither the act nor the regulation defines ``compounding,'' ``crediting,'' or ``principal.'' One issue that has arisen is whether interest can be posted to a consumer's account and not be treated as part of the principal. Another is whether institutions that offer to credit interest to the consumer by check or transfer and permit interest to remain in the account must credit and compound interest on the same or a more frequent basis for those consumers that leave interest in the account. For example, if an institution offers a two-year certificate of deposit (CD) and permits consumers to receive accrued interest in monthly interest checks, does the institution that also permits interest to remain in the account have to credit and compound interest in the account on the same or more frequent basis (monthly or more often). The Board recognizes that institutions may have read the act and regulation as permitting practices which compound and credit at different intervals. The Board is proposing to amend the regulation to clarify that interest cannot be credited to a consumer's account without becoming part of the principal. For example, assume a consumer earns $5 in interest on a $1,000 balance for the month of January. If an institution chooses to credit interest to the account monthly, then the institution must accrue interest on that sum. For example, if $5 is credited in January to an account with a balance of $1,000, the institution must accrue interest on $1,005 for the month of February. Simply put, if consumers are given access to earned interest in an account, the Board believes the act requires that consumers earn interest on those funds at that time. The Board also proposes an amendment clarifying that although institutions may choose any compounding or crediting frequency for an account, institutions that provide for crediting interest either by check (or transfer of accrued interest to another account) or by posting interest to the account must do so on the same periodic basis. That is, if interest can be ``credited'' by check or transfer, an institution must credit interest to all such accounts at least as often a frequency. For example, an institution offering a one-year CD with the option to receive monthly or quarterly interest checks would have to credit interest to the account for compounding on at least a monthly frequency.
