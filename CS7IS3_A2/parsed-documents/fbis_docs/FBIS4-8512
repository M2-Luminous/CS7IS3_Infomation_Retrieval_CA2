Churkin described the newly created situation around Gorazde as "slightly better," but, as he said, it is still very dangerous. "Now is the moment to make decisions on which course the Bosnian peace process should follow -- toward peace or war," he said. Speaking about his talks in Pale, Churkin said that the Bosnian Serbs do not pose a threat to the international community. The Russian envoy told journalists that he presented to Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic and then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic some ideas and initiatives about the possible continuation of peace talks on Bosnia. Churkin did not specify which initiatives this referred to, but said that he would wait in Belgrade for Karadzic's and Milosevic's reply.
