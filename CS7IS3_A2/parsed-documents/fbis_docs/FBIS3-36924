The argument over the property between the joint-stock company PRAVDA International Steelight Holdings Limited and the PRAVDA staff members looks like a detective story. On April 23, 1991, Gennadiy Seleznev, then PRAVDA editor-in-chief, signed an agreement with the Cyprus firm Steelight Holdings Limited, under which all rights to the publication of the newspaper were passed over to the joint-stock company, in which the Cyprus firm has the controlling block of stocks (55 per cent). According to PRAVDA workers, they learned about the terms of the deal some time later. The board of the PRAVDA journalists' organisation regards the court ruling as illegal. PRAVDA staff members intend to defend their rights, using all legal means. Despite legal complications, they are going to continue the publication of the newspaper. Aside from it, they intend to bring a couter-charge, questioning the validity of the agreements signed by Seleznev and the Cyprus firm.
