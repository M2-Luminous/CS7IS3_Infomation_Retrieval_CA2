This led to a slow down in contacts to complete deals for Israeli military hardware and to second thoughts by representatives of foreign governments about going ahead with visits to Israel. French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who completed a visit to Israel 10 days ago, dispatched a special envoy to Israel several days prior to his arrival to study the situation in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Sources close to the French Defense Ministry reported that the French Government -- which maintains close political and defense ties with the Arab states -- found itself in an uncomfortable position due to the timing of the visit so soon after the massacre. The political situation following the massacre also influences ties with Muslim Turkey, which recently enhanced its defense ties with Israel. Following President 'Ezer Weizman's visit to Turkey in January, Israeli military firms are participating in tenders to refurbish Phantom and F-15 aircraft for the Turkish Air Force. Since the visit, which helped to formalize the defense ties between the two countries, the contacts have continued at various working levels but no large deals have yet been finalized. The Turks nevertheless agreed to Israel deploying a military attache at its embassy in Turkey and he will arrive there in several weeks. Defense sources, however, believe the move is inadvisable. Turkey is on the eve of municipal elections, which will indicate the strength of the ruling parties. According to public opinion polls, the present government will not gain significant support in these elections. If that is the case, this government might be forced to resign and be replaced by a new government with which Israel will have to start new negotiations. Germany is another country which recently asked to moderate its overt defense ties with Israel for political and diplomatic reasons. The Germans recently cut their defense budget significantly in the wake of the union with the East and diverted financial resources for internal needs, a move which harmed military purchases from Israel, mainly of ammunition from the Israel Military Industries. According to evaluations by defense sources, Germany will complete its reunification process next year when its internal situation will start to improve. If that happens, the sources believe, new procurement budgets will be presented and an improvement in trade ties with Israel will be felt.
