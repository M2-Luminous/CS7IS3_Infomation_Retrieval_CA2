I am not going to discount the contention that the ``risk levels of operating nuclear stations is very low.'' This calls for a separate and serious discussion. This time, I brought up the issue of radioactive waste. Everyone knows where it comes from. However, the question is how and where to bury it. I asked Aleksandr Grebenkov, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Energy Problems at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, to share his opinion on this issue. Grebenkov: Indeed, the problem of radioactive waste remains one of the most difficult and expensive issues. It first arose during the development and creation of the first atomic bomb. In the United States, all wastes, chemicals, and even clothes were mixed with concrete in a special laboratory, loaded in containers and dumped in the Massachusetts Bay near Boston. In the Soviet Union, the attitude was just as neglectful. Radioactive wastes were often discarded at unequipped and unguarded dump sites. However, as far as I know, there were no such sites in our Republic before the Chernobyl catastrophe. Rostikov: And what about the burial ground in Minsk? Grebenkov: That's a different matter. The burial place in Sosny, established specifically for this purpose, is a sophisticated engineering facility equipped with several protective barriers. It has been operating for several decades now without any problems. The problem is, however, that it is no longer large enough. The situation became especially difficult after the Chernobyl accident. At first, we shipped all Chernobyl-related waste to the scientific and industrial amalgamation ``Prypyat'' in Ukraine. Now that our republics have become independent states, Ukraine refuses to accept ``foreign'' radioactive waste. This is why we found ourselves confronted with a need to set up our own dump sites -- because you cannot consider as dump sites the dustheaps scattered all over Homel and Mohylev Oblasts, where bulldozers dig radioactive litter into holes covered at best with polyethylene. After some time, those holes sag and accumulate water, which can easily penetrate into the ground waters. Over the past two years, the State Chernobyl Committee has conducted inventories of those sites to determine how dangerous they are. Rostikov: But it was the Committee that once sanctioned those burial sites. Grebenkov: This was all we could do at that time. Some villages needed to be buried. The fires last year showed how dangerous the secondary transfer of radiation is. Add to this marauding... Also the problem of burying ashes from burning radioactive wood and peat, where the concentration of radioactive substances is 50 times of that in wood, is acute. Silt is another source of radioactivity. No one knows so far what to do with it. Water is evaporating, increasing the risk of secondary transfer of radiation. Rostikov: Where do you plan to locate stationary burial sites? Grebenkov: In several places. One of them is in Homel Oblast, near Khatki. They would comply with all international standards. Rostikov: What do you know about the construction of the burial site at the ``Marlinskiye Hamlets'' military firing ground near Stolin? Local residents claim that this will be where not only local waste will be buried but also waste from atomic stations and CIS and Western nuclear submarines. Grebenkov: This area was heavily contaminated in the Chernobyl accident. Since intensive clean-up measures are being conducted there at this time, one has to do something with the collected radioactive dirt. This burial site will efficiently block the spread of radiation throughout the Republic. However, this site will, so to say, serve local needs -- there could be no talk about any waste from other regions, let alone from other countries.
