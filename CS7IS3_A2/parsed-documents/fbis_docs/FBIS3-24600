The goal of this research was to develop a sensitive immunoenzyme test system, based on high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (monoAB), for quantitative determination of human thyrotropin. One monoAB was immobilized on polystyrene microtitration plates; another was conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The analysis was technologically effective, it was conducted in one step, and it took 2.5 hours to complete. The detection limit of TT was 0.1 �IU/ml. A highly sensitive three-step test system, utilizing a streptavidin-biotin complex, was proposed that made it possible to detect 0.01 �IU/ml TT. Figures 4; references 14: 2 Russian, 12 Western.
