A delegation of five British specialists led by Prof. Nicholas Day, head of the Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, will deliver lectures on the social aspects of the disease to 50 Bulgarian specialists. There are four major topics to be addressed: Registering the HIV-positive and those who have developed the full symptoms of the disease, exerting control over AIDS patients, the way society treats them, and statistical modelling. The seminar has been organized within the Tempus Programme. Its coordinator for Bulgaria, Prof. Ivan Chernozemski, told a BTA reporter that they are seeking to modernize Bulgarian education and the operation of social medicine departments and to improve prophylaxis. According to the National Preventive Medicine Centre, to date 121 individuals have tested HIV-positive in Bulgaria. 24 of them have developed the symptoms of the disease and 18 have died. However, the No AIDS Foundation believes that the number of those infected with the virus is much greater, reaching between 800 and 1600. About 4 million of Bulgaria's 8.5-million population have taken the test so far. Bulgaria ranks 8th in Europe by the number of HIV- infected. Eleven infants were born by HIV-infected mothers. One of them tested positive, four are healthy, the others are kept under observation. The virus has spread most widely in Burgas and Gabrovo, but Sofia and the Black Sea resorts should not be ignored, either, said Associate Professor Zdravka Argirova, head of the Central AIDS Laboratory. Unlike other European countries, in most of the cases in Bulgaria the virus has been transmitted sexually. Of the HIV-positive 45 percent are between 19 and 25 years of age and got the virus from their sexual partners. Ever since the obligatory monitoring of blood and blood products for HIV was introduced in 1987, the blood transfusion path for transmitting the virus has been cut. Only 10 patients were infected in that way before 1987. The homosexuals are also ten, the others got infected in heterosexual contacts. According to Ms. Argirova, young people are the ones who fall into the high-risk group. Their lacking in sexual education is the main reason for the spread of the disease, doctors say.
