Nedzad Leko reports: [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks with Dr. Ganic, Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas stated to the journalists: [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] I am very glad to be here because of the changes that have taken place in Sarajevo and because of the end of terrorist attacks on the town. I am also satisfied with the talks that are currently under way between the Bosnian and the Croatian Governments. Sweden supports the Washington agreement. We believe that there are numerous constructive elements in this agreement and I am pleased that Mr. Ganic sees it as a very positive matter. I would like to say that the international engagement on Bosnia's behalf will continue. Once peace is restored, perhaps we will no longer need the Nordic battalion. However, Sweden will be here as a partner in the reconstruction of the country. I have also told Mr. Ganic that Sweden would like very much to help Sarajevo, which is alive and not a ghost town. [Leko] The journalists were then addressed by Dr. Ejup Ganic: [Ganic, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] [passage indistinct] blockade of Sarajevo. Since there is no more shelling, we wish to secure the return of citizens to their homes in all suburbs of Sarajevo. This is our next step. We also informed the guest about our desire to continue negotiations. We will call upon the Serbs to join the talks to find a solution for Bosnia, as there is enough space for everybody in the federation while the entire world wishes to make use of this advantageous moment. It is very encouraging to hear that our friends will stand by us in the future. [Leko] Answering a journalist's question about the impressions after yesterday's visit to Tuzla, Baroness Margaretha Af Ugglas said: [Ugglas, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] My impression is that there is still plenty of work to be done. There is a blockade and the industry around Tuzla cannot work because of it. However, I am encouraged with public works that are being carried out in the town itself, for example, the cleaning of the town. I believe that this is important. I was also satisfied with the work of the Nordic battalion. The situation in Tuzla is now more peaceful, however, there are still unpleasant incidents which is definitely something that we should combat, because I believe that our battalion should carry out its work in peaceful conditions. What is very encouraging is that the airport has now been taken over by the Nordic battalion and that it will soon be opened for delivery of humanitarian aid. [end recording]
