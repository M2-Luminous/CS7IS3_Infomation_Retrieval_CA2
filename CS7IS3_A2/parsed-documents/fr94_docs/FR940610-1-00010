FR940610-1-00010 FR940610-1-00002 Example 5_Multiple transfers of deposits; transferor ceases to exist. The circumstances presented in Example 4 remain constant for this example, except that the deposits acquired by Institutions B and C are $50 million and $60 million, respectively. In this situation, the total deposits transferred exceed the deposits reported in Institution A's September 30 report of condition. In this case, each institution's pro rata share will be determined by dividing the acquiring institution's acquired deposits by the total deposits transferred in bulk from the disappearing institution in that quarter. Thus, the September 30 assessment base of Institution B would be increased by $41 million ($50 million deposits acquired divided by $110 million total deposits transferred by Institution A during that quarter multiplied by the $90 million of Institution A's assessment base) and Institution C's September 30 assessment base will be increased by $49 million ($60 million deposits acquired divided by $110 million total deposits transferred during that quarter multiplied by the $90 million assessment base of Institution A). Example 6_Resolution of a failed institution. Institution A reported $100 million worth of deposits in its September 30 report of condition. Institution A fails and is placed into receivership effective October 1. The resolution of Institution A on October 1 includes the transfer of all deposits to Institution B. The resolution of Institution A has presumptively taken into account the assessment amount that would have been invoiced by the FDIC on November 30 and collected on December 30. Institution B does not owe any additional assessment for the deposits acquired from Institution A. The FDIC believes that the final resolution of the assets and liabilities of the failed Institution A included and satisfied the assessment amount to be invoiced and paid on the assessment base determined from the September 30 report of condition. C. Reports The existing rule requires the seller to file a final certified statement and gives the buyer the option_but does not impose the duty_of making the filing on behalf of the seller. The proposed rule would do away with final certified statements in the case of transfers, on the ground that final certified statements would not be needed in the new assessment plan. As a collateral but incidental matter, the proposed rule would formally eliminate Form 6420/11. Under the proposed rule, in order to determine the buyer's first-quarter assessment base for use in computing its second-quarter assessment payment, the FDIC would need to know the amount of deposits that the buyer has assumed. The FDIC does not believe, however, that it is necessary to set forth a formal reporting requirement in the proposed regulation. The FDIC expects that the existing reports that buyers must make to their primary supervisors would serve this purpose. An institution's second-quarter payment would be due_in full, and computed with reference to the institution's assessment base as determined pursuant to proposed ยง327.6(a)(2)_on the regularly-scheduled payment date. An institution that underpaid this assessment would have to pay interest on the shortfall at the rate prescribed by proposed ยง327.7 (``Payment of interest on assessment underpayments and overpayments''). Accordingly, a buyer might well find it convenient to estimate the deposits it planned to assume, and to relay the estimate to the FDIC. If the payment exceeded the amount properly due, the buyer would be entitled to an adjustment on its next payment for the excess amount so paid (plus interest). If the FDIC were to receive the estimates early enough, it could use the information when preparing the invoice for the buyer's second-quarter payment. If not, the FDIC could either send out a supplemental invoice as soon as practicable reflecting the amendments to the buyer's assessment base, or could make an appropriate adjustment to the buyer's next assessment payment.
