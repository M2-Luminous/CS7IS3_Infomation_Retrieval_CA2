Each and every major success we made during the war period and the large-scale economic construction period was the result of hard work. At present, reform, opening up, and modernization have entered a new stage. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the overall tasks of the whole party during these periods. Based on this topic, we successively held the second plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee, the provincial economic work conference, and the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress around the Spring Festival period to clearly define the tasks for the province's reform, development, and stability during 1994. To fulfill these tasks, we have to overcome many difficulties and to resolve many new contradictions and new problems. This requires leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in working hard and to strive to form a situation of working hard to become pioneers in great undertakings in the whole province. To promote the hardworking spirit during the new stage of reform, opening up, and modernization, we must unswervingly implement the party's basic line, pay simultaneous attention to hard work and creative work, and strive to seek realistic work achievements; concentrate energy on economic construction, try by all possible means to overcome difficult problems in the course of development, and strive to gain a fairly rapid development rate; uphold the mass line, share the comforts and hardships of the masses, do more practical things for them, and maintain flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of people; and persist in resisting the corrosive influence of the bourgeois ideology, perform official work honestly and diligently, stress frugality, and promote the formation of a healthy, progressive, civilized, and open social atmosphere. A. Our province has very complicated economic tasks and many difficulties which require our leading cadres at all levels to enhance spirit and immerse themselves in hard work. Through 10-odd years of effort in reform and opening up, our province has made considerable progress and noticeably enhanced its comprehensive economic strength and the people's living standards. However, owing to the various kinds of contradictions and problems accumulated under the traditional systems over a long time, there are some prominent difficulties at present: The long shortage of investment, the lack of major projects to stimulate economic development, and the outdated equipment in key enterprises have mingled together to make industries lack ability to make progress and to make the number of unmarketable products increase; the resources of petroleum and timber have declined, the mining and excavation industry which accounts for one-third of the entire industry has continued to decline, thus increasing the number of "unleavened dough" in economic development and financial revenue; restricted by natural conditions, the per-unit construction cost of capital construction projects and the comprehensive energy consumption for producing every 10,000 yuan worth of products are higher than the national average, and the production cost has restricted the competitive ability of products on the market; the precision and intensive processing industry is undeveloped, the proportion of the processed coal, timber, oil, and grain is much lower than the national average which has resulted in a disconnection in various industries and a short processing chain; the development of the nonstate sector of the economy is not developed, and the township enterprises, and foreign-funded, individual, and private sectors of the economy have failed to give an impetus to promoting economic growth; while greatly increasing the total supply of grain and sideline products, the comparative returns of agriculture is low, and the more we have produced and stored grain, the heavier the burdens have become, making the progress of rural industrialization very slow. To overcome these difficulties in economic development, we must make progress actively and strive for greater state support. The most important is to rely on our own efforts to improve ourselves and work hard. First, we must enhance spirit. While facing many difficulties in the economy, Heilongjiang Province also has many favorable conditions. For example, the central authorities have decided to comprehensively establish the socialist market economic structure which will help us solve contradictions caused by inappropriate systems and difficulties in economic development and create an unprecedented opportunity; through many years of practice and explorations, we have formed a development idea that conforms to the state industrial policy and the basic provincial conditions, which will effect a better turn for the better in the whole province's economy if we uphold it; the development of new economic growing points, such as township enterprises, has been accelerated, and the preferential policies we have implemented will surely play a role in promoting economic growth in the whole province. Therefore, we must correctly grasp the economic situation, and in addition to recognizing and facing difficulties squarely, we must boost our courage to overcome difficulties. Only by urging leading bodies and leading cadres at all levels to first overcome the passive and pessimistic ideology of attempting nothing and accomplishing nothing, can we enhance the spirit of the higher and the lower levels across the province, fully mobilize the hidden enthusiasm of the masses of cadres, make concerted efforts to overcome difficulties, and accelerate the pace of economic development. Second, we should immerse ourselves in hard work. All difficult things on earth can be handled easily if we try it, and all easy things may seem difficult to handle if we do not try it. In face of the issues in economic development, leading cadres at all levels must cultivate a practical and hardworking spirit. With this spirit, we can solve overall difficulties and seek development. For example, with the similar natural and economic conditions, some places can maintain a healthy and vigorous development trend, and some are in a poverty-stricken state; likewise, some state-owned enterprises have gained vigor and vitality through reform and transformation and some have witnessed an increase in their difficulties. The crucial issue involved here is whether we can emancipate ideology and make earnest efforts to do practical things. Therefore, to strengthen the leading bodies, we must establish the mechanism of encouraging more practical work and paying attention to actual results, and resolutely overcome the problem of striving for undeserved reputation and practicing formalism; cultivate the habit of performing one's duty faithfully, working without complaints, and daring to undertake heavy tasks and to resolutely overcome the work style of paying lip service without doing anything or taking any responsibility, seeking comforts, and dodging contradictions. Third, we should work hard to make progress. The more difficulties we face, the easier the mental state of doing sloppy work will occur. At present, the ideology and feeling of being content with the present situation, seeking stability and fearing chaos, willing to stay in the middling state, and regarding backwardness reasonable have existed among some leading cadres in varying degrees. This is not the ambition and pursuit which our communist party people should have. The party and the people have entrusted us with the undertakings of one place or one department, we should cultivate a sense of political responsibility of "bringing benefits to a place when one is in office there," and exert utmost efforts and wisdom to manage well the work of that place and that department; have boldness and vigor to seize the opportunity, boldly carry out things which we think right, and resolutely do well things we should do; and cultivate the will of doing first-grade work and creating top-grade achievements, make vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, and try by all possible means to make greater achievements. B. Establishing the socialist market economic new structure is a brand-new and arduous task that requires leading cadres at all levels to blaze new trials and to make progress with a pioneering spirit. The implementation of the planned economic system over scores of years has left us many long-standing big and difficult problems. At present, our province's proportion of state-owned industrial units is as high as 80.2 percent (the national proportion is 48.1 percent), that of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, 60.87 percent (national proportion is 36.4 percent, that of mandatory plans, 23 percent (the national proportion is less that 5 percent), and that of enterprises directly under the central government, 42 percent, (national proportion is 20 percent), and these four proportions all rank first in the country. It is rarely seen in China that the factors of having enterprises of larger size and having a high degree of public ownership and the system of centralized and decentralized management are concentrated in one province. Therefore, it is not an easy task to establish the socialist market economic structure in Heilongjiang Province. We must exert painstaking efforts to achieve this. At present, we have entered the stage of tackling difficult problems and carrying out package reform with breakthrough thoughts in key areas. We should give priority to reforming the property right of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the establishment of the modern enterprise system; regard cultivating markets of the essential production factors as the emphasis and accelerate the establishment of an integrated, open, competitive, and orderly market system; give priority to changing government functions, and establish and improve the economic regulation and control system; regard the unemployment and old-age insurance of enterprise workers as the priorities, and establish and improve the social security system; regard the shareholding cooperative system as the emphasis, further improve the rural operational system, and give priority to deepening foreign trade system to promote the escalation of the strategy of opening to the outside world; and attach importance to commercializing and industrializing the scientific and technological findings, and accelerate the process of integrating science with technology, education, and economy. To fulfill these reform tasks, we must have courage to blaze new trials and always regard emancipating the mind and deepening reform as the primary task. We must uphold the three essential criteria and never mechanically copy and follow plans from the higher levels, but work creatively in line with reality; never adopt the attitude of avoiding knotty problems or shifting the responsibility on to other people, but promote the spirit of daring to blaze new trials, to try, and to take risks advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; never stick to old ways or manage things with old experience while dealing with the new situation and new problems in reform, but think of new ideas, and be good at opening up a new working sphere and creating new achievements in work. We must advance despite difficulty, and take active and reliable steps to handle the difficult problems in reform. In deepening enterprise reform, we must withstand the strains of the employment problem of workers in enterprises which are ordered to shut down, suspend operation, amalgamate with other enterprises or switch to the manufacture of other products, and the arrangements for their living; in deepening reform of the price system, we must see whether the masses of people can stand the strain. In the face of the coexistence of these advantages and disadvantages, we must not adopt a hesitative and wait-and-see attitude because this cannot help us solve problems. Stagnation in reform will make us lose the future development opportunity. We must choose advantages, eliminate disadvantages, and advance in a pioneering spirit. Of course, while unswervingly promoting reform of the economic structure, we must properly handle the relations of reform, development, and stability, use our brain and think of a way to make breakthroughs in tackling difficult points in reform, persist in giving consideration to the overall situation, handle things in the order of priority, carry out reform in a coordinated manner, and ensure that reform of the socialist market economic structure will be carried out in a sound and orderly manner. C. In the practice of reform and development, the number of social contradictions caused by readjustment of the relations of interests and destablishing factors will increase, and this requires leading cadres at all levels to show greater concerns for the people's living and do more practical things for them. Reform cannot be separated from the people's understanding, support, and participation. In the course of deepening reform, leading cadres at all levels should pay particular attention to the people's difficulties of one sort or another caused by the readjustment of the pattern of interests. At present, some cadres have enjoyed a certain power vested by the people but have failed to hold responsibility to the people and to perform their obligation. They have paid no attention to the hardships or the voice of the people, made suppositions subjectively while considering or resolving issues, and deviated themselves from reality and the masses. Some people have even sought personal "achievements in their career" at the cost of sacrificing the interests of the people. We must conscientiously resolve these problems. It is necessary to educate cadres at all levels to cultivate a viewpoint of giving first thought to the people and regard seeking benefits for the masses of people as the starting and resting points. We should take the lead in working hard and use this to cement the hearts of the masses, maintain close ties between the party and the masses by realistically resolving the problems which people have complained about strongly, and win the people's trust and support with our actual deeds of working our official work diligently. In policymaking, we must consider people's opinions and voice as the first signal. In formulating a policy or a decision, we must deeply conduct investigation and study, extensively listen to the people's opinions, and while formulating major reform measures, in particular, we must uphold and pay attention to the principle of letting all the people enjoy benefits and making all people withstand the strains, and enable policymaking and the implementation of policy decisions to become more in line with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people. In work, we should regard doing practical and good things for the masses as the first duty of the leading bodies. We should go deeply to the grass roots regularly, help the masses eliminate misgivings and solve problems, realistically solve the issue of enabling workers of difficult enterprises to have work to do and food to eat and the issue on production and living of poverty-stricken households in the rural areas. It is necessary to do public welfare undertakings that may bring common benefits to the masses within our ability. In promoting the development of all undertakings, we should regard the masses of people as the first force on which we can rely. The mass line of "doing all things for the sake of the people, relying on the masses while doing every thing, getting the opinions of the masses and referring them back to the masses" must be upheld at any time, the pioneering spirit of the masses must be fully respected, and their enthusiasm must be protected and mobilized. We should urge the masses of people to work with us with one heart and one mind, to overcome difficult in the course of advance, and to make concerted efforts to successfully carry out reform and modernization by mobilizing them ideologically, showing them typical examples, and attracting them with policies. D. With the enhancement of the degree of opening to the outside world, the task of resisting the corrosive influence of decadent ideology has become more urgent. This requires the leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in performing their official work honestly and paying attention to frugality. With the unceasing deepening of reform and opening up, the people's ideology and concept, and the social habits are being actively changed to meet the demand of social progress. However, we must recognize that some passive and backward phenomena running counter to the essence of socialism and the traditional virtue of the Chinese nation have really existed and grown. Particularly, money worshipping, out-and-out egotism, and the trend of extravagance have run rampant. What merits our attention is that these phenomena have also existed among some leading cadres. Some people have abused the powers in their hands as a means to seek personal gain, traded power for money, and sought benefits for the individuals and their family members and friends; some have sought personal comforts, dined and wined luxuriously, worn expensive clothes, sought inordinate consumption in living, and even compared their wealth with "rich people" in society. If we let such a situation to spread unchecked, the prestige of the party and the government will be seriously harmed and the achievements in reform, opening up, and construction will be buried. We must adopt resolute measures to correct this. The advanced nature of the communist party is to wholeheartedly serve the people and not to seek personal gain. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said: "Why did our party have great power in the past? During the war, we always said that if 30 percent of the soldiers in the company are communist members, this company must be good and have strong fighting capacity. Why? This is because communist party members are always the first to fight on the frontline and the last to retreat and the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts." Today, when we conduct reform, opening up, and modernization, we should also demand leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses of communist party members to show the broad mind of being "the first to worry about what the people have worried and the last to enjoy comforts," pay more attention to the success and failure of their work and less attention to their own gain or loss, and have courage to sacrifice their personal interests for the party's cause and the people's undertakings. Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in performing official duties honestly, enhance the training of party spirit, cultivate a correct concept of value, power, hardships, and happiness, and strengthen ability to oppose corruption and guard against evolution; leading bodies at all levels should regard party style and administrative honesty as the important aspect of building leading bodies, persist in unswervingly conducting anticorruption struggle, and form a strong political atmosphere of opposing corruption and promoting honesty. We should also actively promote the trend of practicing economy. "Looking back at the prominent personages of the past, those who worked diligently became successful persons and those who spent extravagantly suffered failure." This old saying is still a famous dictum to date. During the new period in which Heilongjiang is taking steps to change the system and to blaze new trials in industry, and, in particular, under the situation in which some enterprises have difficulties in production and management and the living standards of some people have remained low, we should all the more uphold the principle of working hard, practicing economy, and building the country through hard work. All localities and departments should cultivate the idea of leading an austere life, appropriately conduct etiquette activities, improve working conditions, practice economy, and use the limited amount of money and material resources to effectively develop production. Party committees at all levels and discipline inspection commissions at all levels should strengthen supervision over leading cadres, promptly reorganize and reshuffle cadres who go in for ostentation and extravagance and spend public funds lavishly, and give party and administrative sanctions to those whose cases are serious in an effort to safeguard the advanced nature and purity of the party, to successfully build our leading bodies at all levels, and to provide a solid organizational basis and an effective leadership guarantee for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization.
