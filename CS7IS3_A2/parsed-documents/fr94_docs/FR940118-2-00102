FR940118-2-00102 FR940118-2-00060 The Amex propose to rescind the current Rule 111, Commentary .03 and adopt a new Commentary .03 (a) through (d). 20 Such new commentary will permit members, while on the trading floor, to enter orders for their own accounts provided that such orders are entered through an on-floor communications facility and sent to an off-floor clearing firm's order room where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained before the order is retransmitted to the trading floor. 20 The Amex proposed new Commentary .03 Sections (a) through (c) in the original proposal and added Section (d) in a May 4, 1993, amendment to the proposal. Proposed Commentary .03(a) generally provides that a member using a communication facility on the floor of the Exchange to enter an order for his own account shall be deemed to be initiating an off-floor order if such order is routed through a clearing firm's order room, where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained, before such order is re-transmitted to the floor for execution. Proposed Commentary .03(b) generally provides that any order entered by a member for any account in which it (or its officer, allied member or employee) is directly or indirectly interested, or for any discretionary account serviced by the member organization, following a conversation with the member or employee in that organization who is on the floor, shall be deemed to be an off-floor order, provided that such order is transmitted to the floor through an order room or other facility regularly used for the transmission of public orders to the floor; where a time-stamped record of the order is maintained; or an exception is available in Rule 111 (f), (g), or (h). The Commission believes that proposed Commentary .03 (a) and (b) to Rule 111 (Restrictions on Registered Traders) are substantially similar to those made to NYSE Rule 112.10 (Orders Initiated ``Off the Floor'') and those made to NYSE Rule 112.20 (``On the Floor'' and ``Off the Floor''); therefore the rationale for approval of both sets of rules is substantially the same. The Commission finds that the rules dealing with on-floor orders provide a practical means for a member on the floor to enter an order for his own account without having to physically leave the floor, as is currently necessary. The Commission further finds that the amendments to Rule 111, Commentary .03 (a) and (b) more accurately reflect the status of on and off-floor orders. The Commission believes that the requirement of routing on-floor orders upstairs and then back down to the floor will continue to prevent any undue advantage of floor immediacy from accruing to orders designated as off-floor. 21 21 The interpretation of ``off-floor'' contained in the amendments to Rule 111, Commentary .03 only applies to Rule 111 and does not govern or control the meaning of ``off the floor'' for purposes of Exchange Act Rule 11a2&hyph;2(T) (the ``effect versus execute'' rule). Proposed Commentary .03(c) generally provides that no member shall execute or cause to be executed, on the Exchange, any order for any account in which such member, member organization, or any member, allied member, or approved person in such organization or officer or employee thereof, is interested or for any discretionary account serviced by the member, in contravention of any Exchange policy against frontrunning of transactions that the Exchange may from time to time adopt and make known to its members. The Commission believes that, like the similar NYSE Rule (112.20(d)), proposed Commentary .03(c) to Rule 111 promotes conduct consistent with just and equitable principles of trade, in accordance with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, by explicitly incorporating the frontrunning policy into rules governing competitive trader conduct. Proposed Commentary .03(d) generally provides that members who are not regular members (as described in Article IV of the Exchange Constitution) may enter orders in accordance with the Commentary .03 only in securities which members of their class are otherwise entitled to trade while on the floor of the Exchange. The Commission believes that Commentary .03(d) (along with Rule 950(c)) is appropriate in order to ensure that members other than registered traders, such as limited trading option permit holders, may enter orders for their accounts while on the floor.
