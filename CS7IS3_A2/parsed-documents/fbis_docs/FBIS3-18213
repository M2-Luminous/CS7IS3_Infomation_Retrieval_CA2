U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday [28 February] that NATO jets issued two warnings before shooting down four Serb warplanes over Bosnia and said every attempt was made to "avoid this encounter." Ataman told the ANATOLIA Agency that Turkey has taken initiatives to provide a peaceful, just and lasting solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said Turkey supported all NATO resolutions made toward this end and believes that these resolutions should be enforced.
