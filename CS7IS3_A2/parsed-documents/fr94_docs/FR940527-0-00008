When the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where the use is not clear from the request itself, it will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category. If still in doubt, the Corporation will make the determination based on the factual circumstances surrounding the request, including the identity of the requester.
