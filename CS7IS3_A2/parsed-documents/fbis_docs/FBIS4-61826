Nelson Mandela Will Become RSA's First Black President 10 May"] [Excerpts] Work is being completed on a dais enclosed by three layers of bulletproof glass in front of the massive government building in Pretoria. The official inauguration of the Republic of South Africa's new president, Nelson Mandela, will take place here Tuesday 10 May. [passage omitted] Russia will not be represented even by the premier. Admittedly, Russia's Foreign Ministry has issued a statement expressing a "sense of profound satisfaction" at the restoration of racial and social justice in the RSA and voicing hope for the further development of the good relations that have taken shape between our countries. It is, however, appropriate to note that these relations have taken shape only over the last two and a half years, while previously the USSR and the RSA were separated by a thick curtain of mutual hostility and enmity. However, there were long-standing friendly ties between the CPSU Central Committee and the ANC and in particular with the Communist Party, which was considered one of the most dogmatic and obedient to Moscow in the world communist movement. Money and weapons passed down secret channels at Soviet taxpayers' expense for the "liberation struggle" in South Africa. Groups of gunmen were trained on USSR territory. Perestroyka put an end to all that. And when reforms began in the RSA as well, links with the "friends" were put on ice. At the start of the breakup of the USSR the then Soviet leadership just did not care about the RSA. The Kremlin forgot to telephone Mandela when he came out of jail. U.S. President George Bush's telephone call of congratulations was virtually the first. The ANC leader's trip to Moscow failed to take place five times. The invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev was either awkwardly sent at a time when it was known that Mandela was leaving on another foreign trip or Moscow refused to host the South African visitor owing to internal disarray. It is to Mandela's credit that he never made digs at the former "luminary of socialism." He only remarked when he was given the Nobel Peace Prize last year that the only country that has always helped the ANC is Norway. On the other hand South Africa's Communists abused Gorbachev roundly, in August 1991 they congratulated the putschists, and they blatantly expressed solidarity with the Supreme Soviet in its opposition to Russia's president. The ANC and the Communist Party in unison with Russia's Communists protested the establishment of diplomatic relations with the RSA and President De Klerk's visit [to Russia]. Now that the ANC has come to power Moscow has to organize relations from scratch. I do not think that South African Communists, influential within the ANC leadership, will change their views of the democratic transformations within Russia. But one can hope for pragmatism from the new RSA president. [passage omitted]
