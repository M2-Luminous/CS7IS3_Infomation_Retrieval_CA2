Thus, Krasnoyarsk- 26 will become Zheleznogorsk; Krasnoyarsk-45, Zelenogorsk; Shkotovo-17 in Maritime Kray has received the name of Fokino; Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast, where in place of a strategic missile force division a space center is being set up, has been called Uglegorsk. Kapustin Yar-1 has become Znamenskiy; Arzamas-16 has been named Kremlev; Penza-19, Zarechnyy; Perm-76, Zvezdnyy; Sverdlovsk-44, Norouralsk; and Tomsk-7, Seversk. Overall, 38 hitherto secret cities figure in the government document, On the Official Geographic Names of Populated Areas Located in Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations. The secret installations and associated technology in these cities have of course remained but geographic names have nothing to do with this. It is another question to what extent the new names correspond to toponomy: If anything, there are plenty of "ugle-zhelezhno-zeleno-" derivatives in the names of Russian cities already. As Yakov Topchiyan, Kartographiya's chief editor, told SEGODNYA's correspondent, the formerly secret cities will be shown primarily on maps of scale 1:100,000 and 1:200,000. So far maps of this scale are marked "for official use only." They will also appear on generally available maps, for instance, maps of federation components in particular, Amur Oblast and Maritime and Khabarovsk Kray. Some of the 38 cities will also be indicated in the soon to be published Atlas of Russia's Automobile Roads.
