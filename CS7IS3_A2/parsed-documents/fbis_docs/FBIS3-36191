This is stated in a telegram sent by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to the chairman of the Sevastopol City Council, Viktor Semyonov, reports the newspaper "Slava Sevastopolya." The telegram says that the Russian delegation at the talks on the Black Sea Fleet is prepared to discuss with the Ukrainian delegation, within the shortest possible period, the problems associated with the drafting of an understanding, according to which the Fleet with its entire infrastructure in Crimea is to be used by Russia and fly Russian flags. For its part, the Russian delegation will pay for the part of the Fleet, including the infrastructure, which in line with previous agreements should be part of Ukraine, says the telegram. On Tuesday, in an interview with Interfax, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister favored the idea of the Fleet's problem being solved on the basis of the Yalta agreements, not the Massandra ones. In the summer of 1992, the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin, signed near Yalta the agreement according to which Russia and Ukraine would create their Naval forces on the basis of the Black Sea Fleet. During their creation, the Fleet would be subordinate to both presidents. On September 3, 1993, in Massandra (Black Sea southern coast), the two presidents signed agreements according to which Ukraine was to hand over to Russia its part of the Fleet as repayment of the debt for earlier supplies of Russian energy.
