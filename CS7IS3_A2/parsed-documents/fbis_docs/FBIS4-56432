As we reported this morning, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas reported yesterday that Camacho Solis was scheduled to arrive today because of a possible reply from the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] on what could be new conditions or new efforts in the second phase of the peace talks. Until now, the only thing we have been told at the archdiocese is that Manuel Camacho Solis' arrival has been postponed one or two days. His date of arrival has not yet been confirmed. Nevertheless, we have been told he will be here in the near future. We are now waiting for the fulfillment of what Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, said would be the [word indistinct] reply by the EZLN. This is important because, with this reply, one might be able to get an idea about what the second phase of the dialogue will be like. Indeed, this dialogue is near at hand. In another turn of events, in San Cristobal de las Casas, the nomination of Robledo Rincon as candidate for governor for the State of Chiapas has been accepted nonchalantly. This appointment is being seen here in a good light because Rincon is already a legislator who, as has been pointed out, has worked a great deal for the region. Little by little, he has toured the entire state and is familiar with its problems. [Announcer Jose Cardenas from the Radio ACIR studios in Mexico City] Do you remember that it was none other than Senator Robledo Rincon, along with Heraclio Zepeda and -- if I am not mistaken -- anthropologist Andres Fabrega, who formed part of the first commission created following President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's instructions on [16-second break in reception] conflict with EZLN. By the way, Robledo Rincon was one of the people closest to Luis Donaldo Colosio. This commission was to find a solution to this problem. This was the initiation of the dialogue [25-second break in reception] [Santoyo, in progress] ...remember this because I was a witness during this very interesting stage. [26-second break in reception] here in Chiapas in favor of the peasants and Indians, but that respect for their traditions and customs also had to be taken into account. Nevertheless, Senator Rincon indicated that the task was going to be very difficult. They were able to do this because, during the first days of January when this special commission was created, many meetings were held in the conflict zone, as well as in most tranquil municipalities. They toured the area thoroughly, listening to and trying to understand concerns. I believe Robledo Rincon will base his political platform on the information he collected from the Indians and peasants during these tours. This will be very important in this state, where some politicians and some media have rightly pointed out that whoever becomes governor will not necessarily be hitting the jackpot. [passage omitted]
