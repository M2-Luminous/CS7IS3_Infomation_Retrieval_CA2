FBIS3-30847 "dreeu027__a94008" FBIS-EEU-94-027-A Document Type:Daily Report 9 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Party Leaders Discuss No-Confidence Vote AU0802173694 Sofia BTA in English 1621 GMT 8 Feb 94 AU0802173694 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sofia, February 8 (BTA) -- At regular meetings today, the two major political forces, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), discussed their stances on the motion of no confidence in the government and the debates on the 1994 draft national budget. "The government will not fall before passing this year's national budget," Socialist MP Rosen Khubenov told a scheduled news briefing. In the course of the discussion on the forthcoming vote of no confidence, the Socialists expressed different views, but democratically arrived at the common view in support of the government. "Constructive criticism" -- in this way the Socialists describe their attitude to the 1994 draft national budget. They have serious remarks and suggestions to amend the text as well as fears the budget is unrealistic, and will urge the Council of Ministers to table a bill on a Chamber of Accounts and take firm measures to collect budgeted revenues. SDS leaders would not tell the press what the coalition would do, if the SDS-sponsored motion of no confidence in the government of non-partisan economist Lyuben Berov passes. SDS-affiliated parties want SDS MP's to leave parliament, but the leaders of the coalition have not yet taken a formal stand. "You can't expect us to announce in public our cherished plans," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, who today at noon came back from the United States, told the press. According to the SDS, this country is seeing a growing recommunization. SDS officials quoted the personnel changes in the Ministry of Industry, the changes in preparation at the Committee of Tourism and changes in liquidation councils (implementing the land reform). "What is happening at the Committee on Tourism has been inspired by narrow mafia interests. This government is subordinate to mafia groups and the Communist Party," said Dimitrov. He thinks mafia groupings are struggling with each other in Bulgaria and the government is made to serve them all. The personnel problem is national, according to the BSP. According to Socialist MP Krasimir Premyanov, many of the people appointed by SDS are incompetent and use power to gain personal benefits, while skilled socialist party public servants have been fired for political reasons and forced to earn a living by taking low-skilled jobs.
