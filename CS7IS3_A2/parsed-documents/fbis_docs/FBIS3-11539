This time this group's electoral popularity dropped considerably; it even lost in districts, which until recently were considered undefeatable bastions of this PLRA faction. The "Lainists" by last night had obtained 60 percent of the national votes, while in last year's elections it received more than 80 percent. The general trend showed that the appearance of independent lists (not aligned to national movements), in addition of becoming the third force, were the main element draining power from the Change for Liberation Movement headed by Domingo Laino. The "Saguierists," [supporters of Deputy Hermes Rafael Saguier and Senator Miguel Saguier] which at the closure of the vote count were in second place (with more than 10 percent of the votes), increased their power in the capital where they have taken over committees previously run by "Lainists." The cities of Villarrica and Coronel Oviedo provided some surprises for Laino supporters. These two cities were considered bastions of the Change for Liberation Movement, but the voters preferred the lists not tied to the official leadership. The "Change for Change" Movement headed by Senator Alfredo Luis Jaegli is in third place (regarding national movements). This movement mostly comprises dissidents of the Laino movement, independents, and small regional movements. It obtained results considered "excellent" by the movement's main leaders. The elections were held in a relatively calm environment even though conflicts almost developed over problems related to the registered voters issue. As it is known charges were made over the voters registry -- and the way it was distributed -- which did not include many party members who were not able to vote because their names "disappeared" from the lists.
