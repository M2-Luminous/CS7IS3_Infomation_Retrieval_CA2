Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, made the remarks at a gathering of more than 400 Chinese scientific and technological workers. He attributed this to the correct leadship of Deng Xiaoping, who determined the guideline of making economic construction the center of the party's work and voiced the thesis that "intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and technology are the primary productive forces". Li noted that the situation in the intellectual, scientific and technological circles is generally good, though there are some problems. He encouraged scientific and technological workers to combine science and technology more closely with the development of production, with reference to foreign experience. State Councillor Song Jian greeted the Chinese scientific and technological workers on behalf of the State Council. Song Jian said that more investment should be put into the development of science and technology and governments at all levels should further improve the working and living conditions for the scientific and technological workers.
