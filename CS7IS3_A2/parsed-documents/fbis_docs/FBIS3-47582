Current chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, who completed his third year in the post last month, has expressed a strong wish to step down, the sources said. The change of leadership will be proposed at a top officials' meeting of the federation on February 7, and will be formally approved at its regular general meeting on May 27, they said. Toyoda, 68, was selected to be the eighth chairman of the most powerful lobby of Japanese business leaders because he is the head of the nation's top automaker and is well known internationally. Also, Hiraiwa felt that Toyoda, who is 11 years his junior, would be able to rejuvenate the organization and eventually the entire business community of Japan, the sources said. Toyoda, a member of the founder family of Toyota Motor, joined the automaker in 1952. He assumed the company's presidency in 1982 and became chairman in 1992. He has served as Keidanren's vice chairman since 1990. Hiraiwa originally expected Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita, who was a vice chairman of the federation, to be his successor, according to the officials. Morita, 72, announced his retirement from all business activities in early December, however, after suffering a stroke.
