Rumessen said that Russia was deliberately dragging on the inter-state negotiations to gain time. He said that Riigikogu [parliament] foreign committee should initiate a bill in connection with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's threat to bring more troops to Estonia, in which Riigikogu should present a categorical demand to withdraw Russian troops from Estonia by 31 August 1994. Rumessen, a representative of Estonian National Independence Party, also called for all people who cared about the future of their homeland to organise protest actions against the continued presence of Russian troops in Estonia.
