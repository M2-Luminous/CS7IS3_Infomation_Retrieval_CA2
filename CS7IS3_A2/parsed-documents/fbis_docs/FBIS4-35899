These channels, especially BBC radio, cannot not hide their anxiety about those incidents. The anxiety expressed by the BBC is on behalf of the Western governments that are protecting the "security zone" and are frustrated by the subversive behavior, as the radio says. In its comments and roundtable discussions, the BBC attributes Western anxiety to the fact that the agent groups are more concerned about their own rivalry than about what the West thinks about what is taking place. So, the West suddenly wakes up to the reality of what is taking place in the northern part of the homeland and expresses its sense of frustration, not out of affection for the citizens in northern Iraq but due to the exposure of its claims about the "security zone," which has turned into an open arena for crimes of murder, plunder, and fighting between the leaders of agent groups over plots of land and commissions, as the BBC says. The radio clearly admits that thousands of Kurds have come out in the streets of Irbil protesting against these crimes. No doubt, our Kurdish people's rejection of the agent groups has strengthened the sense of frustration among Western governments, which are now convinced that the land has begun to move under the feet of the agents and traitors in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region -- hence the overlords' sense of frustration about the fate that awaits their agents and followers.
