Weekly price change indices for consumer goods and services in November of this year are characterized by the following data: 2 Nov 9 Nov 16 Nov 23 Nov 30 Nov Rate of price 103.2 103.1 103.4 102.9 102.2 growth for basic goods and services including: food products 103.0 102.8 103.4 103.1 102.0 nonfood 102.2 103.7 103.3 102.5 102.5 products paid services 108.9 102.7 103.7 103.6 102.5 for the populace Price increases over the month for 70 main food products amounted to 15.1 percent. By the end of the month, prices for meat and meat products, sugar, flour, bread, and bakery products had stabilized. At the same time, price increases during the last week of the month for eggs, cereals, macaroni products, and vegetables were maintained at the 4-6 percent level. Potatoes, vegetables, and fruits increased in price by 5-8 percent in city markets the final week of November. Prices for meat output remained virtually unchanged. The increase in prices of nonfood products in November amounted to 15 percent. The cost of fuel for the populace and knitted wear increased by 2.5-2.8 percent, of footwear and cultural and domestic commodities--by 1.5-1.8 percent. Most noticeable at the end of the month was the increase in garment prices--by 3.3 percent. The increase in prices of paid services for the populace this past month significantly surpassed the overall dynamics of consumer prices, amounting to 23.2 percent. Rates for dry cleaning and bathhouse services increased by 6-8 percent over the week. Rates for the remainder of services subject to regular monitoring remained virtually unchanged the past week. Consumer Market Conditions According to selective sampling data in the stores of capitals of republics within the Russian Federation and okrug, kray, and oblast centers, the saturation observed in stores in November with respect to beef, sugar, butter, and sunflower oil increased by 3-11 percent. With respect to milk, this index decreased by 3 percent, eggs--by 10 percent. As compared with the end of October of this year, the saturation level at food stores increased in 39 cities (of 83 under observation), including by 3-17 percent in 36 cities and 25-30 percent in four (Vologda, Ryazan, Yaroslavl). The level decreased in 32 cities, including by 3-8 percent in 20 cities, and by 12-31 percent in 12. Stores in 12 cities remained at their previous level of saturation with respect to food products. Data (in percentages) characterizing the market situation with respect to basic food items as of 29 November of this year are as follows: Proportion of the total number of cities under observation where the product could be could be was not was not purchased purchased after available available for freely standing in for sale sale as of 1 without line or upon November (for standing in presentation of reference) line coupons Beef 30 5 65 67 Cooked 83 - 17 13 sausage Milk 66 5 29 26 Butter 78 3 19 8 Eggs 65 2 33 25 Sunflower 43 5 52 63 oil Sugar 71 5 24 31 The situation in the market of nonfood products in everyday demand is as follows: washing machine detergent was unavailable in the stores of 57 percent of cities, toilet soap in 47 percent, toothpaste in 40 percent. Sales of toilet soap and toothpaste over the past week diminished by 5 and 15 percent, respectively. Sales of washing machine detergent rose by 17 percent. In Bryansk, Kaluga, Elista, Groznyy, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Abakan, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the saturation coefficient with respect to these items was 1.3-1.7, as opposed to 2.4 across Russia on the average. In Kyzyl, Magadan, Aginsk (Aginsk Autonomous Oblast), and Ust-Ordynsk (Ust-Ordynsk Autonomous Oblast), these products were entirely unavailable for sale. Agriculture Formation of seed stocks is under way at agricultural enterprises. By the beginning of November, 10.0 million tonnes of spring grains and leguminous crops were on hand (96 percent of requirement). As was the case last year, the great shortage of soy seeds (63,000 tonnes, 50 percent) is making itself felt. Some 2.2 million tonnes of seed potatoes were laid in store--82 percent of the necessary quantity. Seed on hand as of 1 November 1993 Reference data tonnes percentage of the seed on hand as of requirement of 1 November 1992, farms percentage of requirement spring grains 10 million 96 97 (not including corn) including: wheat 2.95 million 98 100.4 buckwheat 111,000 81 94 millet 48,000 92 90 rice 52,000 77 81 legumes 825,000 84 80 Soy 63,000 50 75 potatoes 2.2 million 82 91 A grouping of agricultural enterprises by degree of provision with seed shows that the proportion of farms experiencing shortages of seed for spring grains and leguminous crops increased from 26 percent last year to 33 percent this year, for seed potatoes--from 55 to 60 percent. One out of eight farms was supplied with spring grain seed at the level of 60 percent of requirement or less. Almost half the agricultural enterprises of the Russian Federation were at this level with respect to potatoes.

A significant shortage of seed potatoes is being felt at farms of Russia's non-Chernozem Zone, where the level is 407,000 tonnes (16 percent) short of the full requirement. Only one-fourth of the farms are fully provided with seed potatoes in Smolensk and Sverdlovsk Oblasts and in Bashkortostan; one-third in Pskov, Vladimir, and Moscow Oblasts, and in the republics of Mordvinia and Udmurtia; about 40 percent in Kaluga, Tula, and Nizhniy Novgorod Oblasts; 20 percent in Vologda and Perm Oblasts. Preparedness of the National Economy for Operation Over the Winter Period This year the preparedness of the Russian Federation economy for operating under winter conditions, as has been the case the past two or three years, is observed against the background of diminished fuel production, reduced volumes of fuel deliveries, and a lag in the commissioning of energy facilities and housing and municipal services facilities. At storehouses of mines and coalfields, 18.4 million tonnes of coal (8.1 million tonnes more than the norm) were stored as of 1 November. This is 36 percent greater than was the case 1 November of last year. Some 433,000 tonnes of furnace fuel oil were on hand (48 percent less). Coal supplies on hand with consumers amounted to 44 million tonnes, furnace fuel oil--9.6 million tonnes. These levels are 14 and 7 percent less, respectively, than as of 1 November 1992. Judging from the experience of prior years, these fuel levels are sufficient to operate enterprises and organizations for one and a half months. Coal reserves at enterprises of the energy sector, metallurgy enterprises, storehouses of rayon (city) fuel sales centers, and housing and municipal services boiler facilities as of 22 November this year are characterized by the following data: Coal Furnace fuel oil tonnes consumption percentage tonnes consumption percentage days of 15 Nov days of 15 Nov 93 level 93 level Total 26,727,000 34 94 3,481,000 29 84 reserves including: at energy 21,850,000 42 93 2,849,000 25 82 sector enterprises at 1,804,000 15 105 414,000 32 92 metallurgy enterprises including 813,000 9 104 for coking at housing 678,000 58 94 218,000 31 99.2 and municipal services boiler facilities at 2,395,000 22 93 storehouses of rayon (city) fuel sales centers At the same time, coal at energy sector enterprises of the republics of Khakassia and Sakha (Yakutia) remained at the two-day operational level. Less than the one-week operational level was in store at housing and municipal services boiler facilities of Volgograd Oblast and the republics of Bashkortostan and Altay. About 40 percent of Russian Federation territories had sufficient coal to supply the populace and the social sphere for a period of less than 15 days, including a two-seven day level in Orel, Tula, Astrakhan, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts, the Republic of Mordvinia, and Altay Kray. Wages The average wage of workers in October of this year amounted to R93,000 [rubles], a 10.5-fold increase over October of last year and a 15-percent increase over the level of September of this year. Consumer prices for goods and services increased 12-fold and by 20 percent, respectively. January-October October January-October October 1993 1993 1993 increase as 1993 as alone compared with compared January-October with 1992 September 1993, percent Average wage of 46,900 93,000 10.2-fold 115 workers, rubles including: industry 51,300 101,200 9.5-fold 116 agriculture 27,600 52,700 10.1-fold 104 construction 65,700 131,800 10.6-fold 113 transportation 69,500 138,800 10.5-fold 114 public health, 35,300 65,500 11.4-fold 104 physical training, and social security public 32,500 59,200 11.5-fold 104 education art and culture 27,800 50,700 11.4-fold 109 science and 29,900 57,700 10.9-fold 115 scientific services credit and 96,900 201,600 12.6-fold 126 insurance apparatus of 55,500 105,400 12.4-fold 122 governmental organs The wages of workers in the gas industry came to R291,400 in October of this year, oil production workers--R264,200, coal industry workers--R213,100, and machine-building workers--R74,800. For most regions in October, the increase in prices over September levels outpaced the increase in wages. A significant gap (10-19 percentage points) was observed in Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Ryazan, Lipetsk, Volgograd, Penza, Saratov, Ulyanovsk, Orenburg, Kemerovo, Omsk, Tyumen, Irkutsk, Chita, Amur, and Kamchatka Oblasts, in the republics of Mordvinia, Kalmykia, Dagestan, Udmurtia, and Chuvashia, and in Altay Kray. Preliminary estimates indicate that the average wage in the Russian Federation economy in November of this year will have constituted R105,000, an increase of 13 percent over October of this year, while prices for consumer goods and services rose 15 percent. Enterprise Indebtedness Credit indebtedness on the part of industrial and agricultural enterprises and construction and transportation organizations under observation as of 1 October amounted to R32 trillion. Of this amount, R8.7 trillion, or 27 percent, constitutes delinquent indebtedness. The greatest proportion of delinquent indebtedness was seen in enterprises of the forestry, woodworking, and pulp and paper production industry (39 percent), chemical and petrochemical industry (41 percent), microbiology (43 percent), coal (44 percent), and gas (52 percent) industries. The greatest portion (72 percent) of delinquent credit indebtedness comprises indebtedness to suppliers. The volume dynamics of delinquent indebtedness to suppliers by sector of industry and construction are characterized as follows (in rubles): As of 1 Aug 93 As of 1 Sep 93 As of 1 Oct 93 Total Including Total Including Total Including delinquent delinquent delinquent indebtedness indebtedness indebtedness Total in 8.527 3.368 10.184 4.066 14.092 5.209 industry trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion Including: electric power 519 152 billion 612 201 billion 1.092 264 billion billion billion trillion fuel industry 2.380 943 billion 2.966 1.293 4.028 1.587 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion ferrous 789 334 billion 1.014 439 billion 1.447 657 billion metallurgy billion trillion trillion nonferrous 679 255 billion 770 270 billion 955 297 billion metallurgy billion billion billion chemical and 890 442 billion 1.098 569 billion 1.370 686 billion petrochemical billion trillion trillion industry machine 1.298 504 billion 1.594 601 billion 2.150 805 billion building and trillion trillion trillion metalworking forestry, 419 242 billion 356 165 billion 479 222 billion woodworking, billion billion billion and pulp and paper industry building 185 90 billion 245 115 billion 338 130 billion materials billion billion billion industry light industry 195 69 billion 225 84 billion 305 90 billion billion billion billion food industry 706 207 billion 739 175 billion 1.086 249 billion billion billion trillion construction 987 334 billion 1.125 429 billion 1.680 509 billion billion trillion trillion The greatest increase in delinquent indebtedness to suppliers in October of this year was observed at enterprises of the glass, porcelain, ceramics, and pottery industry--by a factor of 2.1; in ferrous metallurgy, the flour-grinding, cereals, and mixed fodders industry--by a factor of 1.5; in the food industry--by a factor of 1.4. At the same time, the growth rate did not exceed 12 percent for ferrous metallurgy, the building materials industry, and light industry. The proportion of industrial enterprises with delinquent indebtedness to suppliers as of 1 October of this year comprised 40.5 percent, as opposed to 45.9 percent as of 1 September of this year. The significant volumes of delinquent credit indebtedness are related to the presence of debit indebtedness. As of 1 October of this year, the entire amount of debit indebtedness amounted to R28.0 trillion, of which R10.1 trillion, or 36 percent, was delinquent indebtedness. The greatest share of delinquent indebtedness is attributable to the indebtedness of purchasers--R8.9 trillion, or 88 percent. The greatest proportion of delinquent debit indebtedness was observed in the oil refining, microbiology, forestry, woodworking, and pulp and paper industries (47 percent), in ferrous metallurgy (48 percent), and in the gas (52 percent) and coal (55 percent) industries. Due to a lack of their own financial resources, enterprises are resorting to credits. The total volume of indebtedness with respect to bank credits for sectors under observation as of 1 October of this year amounted to R6.5 trillion, including R3.0 trillion, or 47 percent, attributable to nonstate enterprises. The absence of regulation with respect to mutual accounts settlements between enterprises and with the budget exerts an influence on their financial stability. The solvency of observed enterprises and organizations of industry and construction is characterized by the following data: Monetary assets, percentage of delinquent indebtedness to suppliers As of 1 As of 1 As of 1 As of 1 As of 1 January April August September October 1993 1993 1993 1993 1993 Total 78.2 102.1 91.5 79.8 79.3 including: industry 79.3 107.1 95.5 83.9 81.7 construction 67.2 52.9 50.6 40.9 55.4 Credit investments in the Russian economy (not including credits of the Russian Federation Savings Bank) as of 1 November of this year, according to current operating data of the Central Bank of Russia, amounted to R19.6 trillion, an increase of 17 percent over October (15 percent over September). Of the total volume of credit deposits, short-term loans comprise 96 percent. This represents a one-point percentage increase in their share as compared with the beginning of the year. The average term of offered credits is two to three months. Trading in "super-short-term" credits (from a few days to one month) in the credit and stock markets is becoming more prevalent. The main source of resources for commercial banks has traditionally been attracted resources (over 90 percent), of which more than one-fourth are attributable to funds of enterprises and organizations (in settlement accounts, current accounts, other accounts), deposits, and investments; one-fifth are attributable to interbank credits. Centralized credits of the Bank of Russia comprise 84 percent of the latter. The remainder of the indebtedness of commercial banks to the Central Bank of Russia with respect to centralized credits extended to enterprises and organizations in accordance with federal programs comprised R7.9 trillion as of 1 November of this year, an increase of 6 percent over October (2 percent over September). Their share of the total volume of credit deposits decreased from 44 percent as of 1 October of this year to 40 percent as of 1 November. Since 15 October of this year, the interest rate of the Bank of Russia for centralized loans was raised from 180 percent to 210 percent. With an increase in the prime rate, interest rates for loans afforded by commercial banks to their clients have also increased.
