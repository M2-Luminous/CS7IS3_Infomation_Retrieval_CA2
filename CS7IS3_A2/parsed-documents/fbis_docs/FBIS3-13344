Four prison warders were killed in Thursday's jail-break at Tazoult some 400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of the capital. The prisoners escaped when an unknown number of assailants stormed the prison during the Ramadan meal break at 1800 GMT when security was lax, the sources added. One hundred common-law prisoners returned to the prison after the jail break -- the most spectacular since the start of fundamentalist violence in Algeria two years ago. No official confirmation was immediately available. Tazoult prison accommodates 3,000 detainees, many of them considered particularly dangerous. Of the Islamic fundamentalists who escaped, several had been sentenced to death. Last November three armed fundamentalists attacked Sidi Ghiles prison, near Cherchell, seriously wounding the governor but no detainees escaped. In July 60 Islamic guerrillas escaped from Mers-el-Kebir military prison, near Oran. Five fugitives were later killed by security forces. In early 1991, 103 detainees escaped from Blida prison, near here, after an attack by an armed Islamic group. In mid-1992 another 20 Islamic extremists escaped from a police van during their transfer from Algiers' Serkadji prison to Tazoult. The Algerian authorities have rounded up thousands in a crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists who launched a bloody guerrilla war against the secular administration following the January 1992 cancellation of a general election the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.
