Do you think the security guarantees received from the United States and Russia in return are sufficient for Ukraine? [Zlenko] The trilateral Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian declaration, signed in Moscow on 14 January, defines quite unequivocally the principles on which our national security is to be based. I am thinking of such factors as territorial integrity, the inviolability of borders, and recognition of the sovereignty and independence of our country, as well as the assurance that no economic pressure will be exerted on us. I believe that this can be fully satisfactory for us. We are currently holding concrete talks with many states to prepare a multilateral document that will confirm these principles. [Koscinski] It is generally believed that the West (especially the United States), in its relations with the states of Central and East Europe, is concerned only with Russia and that only Russia is of any real importance. What is your evaluation of the West's attitude toward Ukraine? [Zlenko] I believe that the contacts between the Ukrainian president and his U.S., the results of the recent visit by President Leonid Kravchuk to Washington, and the signature of the aforementioned trilateral agreement favorably affect Western states, which are changing their attitude toward Ukraine. At any rate, our country is no longer perceived as a nuclear monster that may threaten others. For example, an agreement on partnership with the European Union [EU] is expected to be signed (today--editor's note); this proves that the atmosphere around Ukraine is favorable. We are the first country in CIS to sign such an agreement. A positive decision by the EU represents a positive decision by its 12 member states. There are also other examples that show that the political atmosphere is changing to the advantage of Ukraine. [Koscinski] Ukraine proposes establishing a regional security zone in Central and East Europe. In the meantime, Belarus, which is expected to sign an agreement on monetary union with Russia, will enter the sphere of even greater political influence from Moscow. How, then, do you envision the future of the proposed zone? [Zlenko] Belarus will decide for itself whether or not to join that zone. I can speak only about Ukraine. We are very interested in creating a zone of stability and security in Central and East Europe. Fundamental for us are the proposals presented by President Kravchuk. We believe that Poland and Ukraine, large countries located in the same region, should very soon discuss the principles of both sides' security. We should do this bearing in mind the Pact on Stability, proposed by the EU, to lead to the establishment of an all-European security system.
