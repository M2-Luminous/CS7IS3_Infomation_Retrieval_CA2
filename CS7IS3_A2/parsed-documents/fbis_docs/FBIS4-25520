The export sector witnessed a relatively big increase in efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, the sector has been confronted with serious difficulties, such as funding shortages, high domestic prices, and a drop in overseas prices, which hampered foreign exchange earnings from exports and improved efficiency. To implement the plan for the entire year to earn foreign exchange through exports and achieve better efficiency, leaders of the provincial party committee and government have repeatedly handled business on the spot in foreign trade companies to solve practical problems. The provincial economic relations and trade commission has also repeatedly held special meeting to analyze economic activities and to strive for unity in thinking and solutions to improving economic efficiency, gave specific guidance to companies according to their own concrete conditions, encouraged enterprises with relatively good efficiency in exporting goods to expand their scale and strive for better efficiency, guided companies which had problems with exports and efficiency to make more effort to improve efficiency, and helped solve practical problems to boost enthusiasm for earning more foreign exchange by exporting more goods and striving for better efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of the province's foreign trade is not balanced. Provincial-level companies have strengthened management and have persisted in not engaging in loss-making deals, thus gaining better economic efficiency, however, prefecture and city-level companies, with the exception of those in Changsha City, all suffered losses in operations. In particular, the 29 industrial export enterprises, which have been approved by the state over the last two years, and four prefecture and county-level companies had yet to export goods to earn foreign exchange by the end of May.
