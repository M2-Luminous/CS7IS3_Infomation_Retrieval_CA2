Postage is for mailing the reregistration application and the registration certificate. 3Management/Supervisory time is that time spent by management and supervisory personnel in the overall development and maintenance of the registration program including establishment of program priorities and policy, resource allocation, and administrative direction. The following positions are involved: Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Director of the Office of Diversion Control_.05 work year each_$14,619. Chief and Deputy Chief Chemical Operations Section_.1 work year each_$27,651. Chief, Liaison and Policy Section_.1 work year_$11,853 Chief, Policy Unit_.1 work year_$10,045. Total Costs_$64,168. Because the Management/Supervisory costs are related to the general operation of the registration program, they must be averaged across the entire reregistration applicant population. For the initial renewal year, DEA anticipates receiving 3,500 retail and non-retail reregistration applications. The average cost per applicant would be $18.33. 4Regulatory and policy development time consists of .25 work year of a program analyst time for drafting new/amended regulations and Federal Register notices, issuance of policy statements and directives related to the registration program and responding to registrant queries regarding registration matters. This time is for general chemical registration program purposes and must be spread equally across the reregistration applicant population. The cost of that time, $22,202, divided by 3,500 reregistration applicants, 3,500, equals $6.34. 5DEA will conduct follow-up investigations of approximately 75 non-retail registrants to ensure that registrants are complying with the chemical control requirements and that chemicals are not being distributed to persons which wishing to divert them. The investigations will consist of a comprehensive review of each registrant's records, reporting systems and security provisions. Each investigation will require comprehensive on-site review of the registrant's records; verification of transactions and purchasers, including record checks of and visits to purchasers; travel; and report preparation. Based on current estimates, DEA anticipates that all such follow-up investigations combined will require 8 workyears of Diversion Investigator time. The total cost for 8 workyears of Diversion Investigator time is $666,464, divided by 1,500 non-retail reregistration applicants equals $444.31.
