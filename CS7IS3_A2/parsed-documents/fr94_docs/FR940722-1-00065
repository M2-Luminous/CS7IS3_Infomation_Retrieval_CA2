FR940722-1-00065 FR940722-1-00012 (b) The electronic display indicators, including their systems and installations, and considering other airplane systems, must be designed so that one display of information essential for continued safe flight and landing will remain available to the crew, without need for immediate action by any pilot for continued safe operation, after any single failure or probable combination of failures. (c) As used in this section, ``instrument'' includes devices that are physically contained in one unit, and devices that are composed of two or more physically separate units or components connected together (such as a remote indicating gyroscopic direction indicator that includes a magnetic sensing element, a gyroscopic unit, an amplifier, and an indicator connected together). As used in this section, ``primary'' display refers to the display of a parameter that is located in the instrument panel such that the pilot looks at it first when wanting to view that parameter. §23.1321 [Amended] 25.

A new §23.1326 is added to read as follows: §23.1326 Pitot heat indication systems. If a flight instrument pitot heating system is installed to meet the requirements specified in §23.1323(d), an indication system must be provided to indicate to the flight crew when that pitot heating system is not operating. The indication system must comply with the following requirements: (a) The indication provided must incorporate an amber light that is in clear view of a flightcrew member. (b) The indication provided must be designed to alert the flight crew if either of the following conditions exist: (1) The pitot heating system is switched ``off''. (2) The pitot heating system is switched ``on'' and any pitot tube heating element is inoperative. §23.1329 [Amended] 29. Section 23.1329(b) is amended by adding the parenthetical phrase ``(both stick controls, if the airplane can be operated from either pilot seat)'' between the words, ``or on the stick control,'' and the word ``such''. 30.
