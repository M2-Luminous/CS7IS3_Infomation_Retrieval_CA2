SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an international treaty designed to control international trade in certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the treaty. Currently, 123 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat (in Switzerland) to carry out its functions, consider amending the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. This is part of a series of notices which, together with public meetings, provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the development of the U.S. positions for the ninth regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (COP9) to CITES, which the U.S. will be hosting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from November 7 to 18, 1994.
