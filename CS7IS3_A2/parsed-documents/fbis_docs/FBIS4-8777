Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the encirclement around Gorazde is becoming increasingly tighter and stronger. Gorazde is literally drowning its own blood, suffering, and pain. Crushing everything before them, the chetniks are mercilessly advancing on the town. The situation in the town is so bad that it cannot get worse. A river of surviving refugees from the surrounding villages this morning continued to flow into the almost destroyed and overcrowded Gorazde." Musovic also says that the "chetniks are at the very gates of the town. On their way to the town so far, in only 18 days of this unprecedented offensive they have killed 208 and wounded 840 residents of Gorazde. The survivors of Gorazde are warning U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to take new energetic measures and urgently stop the chetnik hordes, which are at the very gates of Gorazde, at the last minute. If they do not take urgent measures, it will be too late for the residents of this town." According to Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nijaz Salihovic, "on the fifth consecutive day of their attacks, the enemy is using all available weapons: snipers, machine guns, and 122-mm and 155-mm howitzers. The aggressor has fired hundreds of artillery and tank shells at the positions of the 108th Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brcko Brigades. Vranovaca and the central part of Odora are being subjected to particularly heavy shelling. The situation in Boderiste is the worst. The aggressor has been carrying out combined artillery, tank, and infantry attacks there since about 0700." Reporting that the army had not suffered any casualties, the correspondents report that "at 0850 this morning, the Malutka operators of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a chetnik tank at [words indistinct], in front of the positions of the 108th Infantry Brigade. This is the third tank that the aggressor has lost, together with its crew, on the Brcko front in the last 24 hours." According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic, "Karadzic's terrorists have not stopped attacking Buzim and the surrounding area today. They are shelling civilian houses and the defenders. The chetniks have been attacking them since 9 April. This (?region) has also been attacked from the other side, from behind, by Abdic's betraying falangists, who are fiercely attacking Todorovo, [word indistinct], Pecingrad, Krivaja, and Liskovac." From Sarajevo a correspondent reports that the "chetniks today continued their attacks with small arms in the Sarajevo area, which began last night. Provocations took place in several locations, where the defense lines of the town came under attack. Shots were fired at the very center, Marijin Dvor, where an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] vehicle was parked, from direction of Sljivik. This resulted in the wounding of two civilians at about noon. The passage of the street cars was blocked, too." The correspondent concludes his report by saying that the "chetniks are preparing to renew artillery attacks on the town. They have been seen bringing up heavy weapons, ammunition, and troops to almost all the artillery positions around Sarajevo for hours. The observers and UNPROFOR appear to be powerless to stop this behavior by the aggressor and we therefore warn the citizens to take the warnings seriously about precautionary measures and self-protection." Gracanica correspondent Ezudin Durakovic reports that the "chetniks have been using all their artillery since early this morning to attack mainly civilian targets in Lukavica, Malesici, Rijeka, and Miricina from the well-known chetnik strongholds of Paleznica, (Besanj), Sjemina, Kojica, and Porecina. The enemy fired over 200 shells of various calibers within a very short period of time. One woman and one child were killed. Six others were wounded and the material damage is substantial."
