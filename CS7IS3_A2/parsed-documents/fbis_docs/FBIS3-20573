Therefore, in the process of carrying out reforms whereby the market regulates the buying and selling of grain, corresponding changes must be made in the macroeconomic price system. Reforms must be made to straighten out the overall price system and grain production, transportation and marketing, and relations among microeconomic consumption systems, as well as to reduce frictions between the macroeconomic system and microeconomic systems, and to stimulate smooth market reform of the grain system. Grain Prices Grain prices hold a key position in the overall price system. They are the most important tool that the government can use to guide the national economy toward intended development goals. Once grain markets are deregulated, prices are determined by market supply and demand; hence, overall prices, including exchange rates, profit rates, wage rates, and tax rates should be decided by the market supply and demand mechanism. Using the market mechanism as the orientation, the following two things must be done to straighten out the relationship between the grain system and overall prices. 1) Raise the Relative Price Level of Grain It is the relative price level of grain that determines the rate of return from peasant grain farming. This is to say that given a set grain price, if the prices of things need for grain production are low, returns from the growing of grain are large. Conversely, they are small. Before the deregulation of grain markets, the relative prices of grain and products other than grain were government regulated and controlled. Despite the low price that the government paid for grain, prices of products other than grain were also relatively low, so the difference in the price ratio was still not too large. Following deregulation of the grain markets, the relative price level of grain will be determined by the market mechanism. Then, the price of grain may decline relative to the price of products other than grain. The reasons for this are, first, grain supply and demand elasticity is less than the elasticity of supply and demand for products other than grain. When market supply and demand determines the price of grain and products other than grain, the relative price of grain may steadily decline. Second, the production cycle for grain is longer than for industrial goods, funds turn over more slowly, the fixed assets utilization rate is lower, and prices change much more slowly. Grain production is prone to disastrous weather conditions, diseases, and insect pest infestations. Sometimes a devastating natural disaster occurs that results in no output from all the inputs. Grain production technology also advances much more slowly than for industrial production. All these factors cause an increase in grain production costs. Third, grain prices rise more slowly than prices of industrial goods. This is mostly because of the numerous industrial production links in which products go through multiple processing by industrial concerns, each processing increasing the price. This causes a steady rise in prices. Grain, however, is purchased from the peasants for shipment to grain shops. Its original state is not changed. Even if it is processed, the number of processing steps is relatively small. Consequently, the price changes slowly, the relative price of grain steadily falling. The drop in the relative price of grain will lead to a steady worsening of trading conditions between industry and agriculture, and a steady decrease in peasant earnings. This will have an extremely adverse effect on the macroeconomy. Therefore, following grain market deregulation, decline in the relative price of grain must be prevented to increase the peasants' income. 2) Straighten Out Relationships in the Overall Price System The relative price of grain is the key element in the overall price system. Once the relative price of grain is increased, a portion of government fiscal and consumers income will be transferred to the grain producers. This will necessitate a rise in consumer wage rates for otherwise the standard of living of urban staff members and workers will fall. Hidden taxes must be made open. If the peasants' unreasonable burdens can be halted, the grain tax rate may be correspondingly increased. Raise Interest Rates Once grain markets have been deregulated and a market mechanism has been largely established throughout the country, interest rates will have to be increased for the following reasons: 1) The need for capital will increase tremendously. Take grain production, for example. Ministry of Finance plans show expenditures for agriculture of 250 billion yuan by 2000. Such expenditures are needed to attain the goal of increasing grain output from 300 million tons to 520 million tons by 2000. They include an anticipated expenditure of 26.7 billion yuan renminbi for investment each year. This plan calls for 60 percent of this money to come from peasants savings, only 10 percent being provided by the state. Realization of this magnificent goal will require raising interest rates in order to induce the peasants to increase savings. 2) Low interest rates lead to banks diverting to other purposes credit that should be used for grain procurement. Loans are provided to urban industries or township and town enterprises in order to earn better interest. This leads, in turn, to grain enterprises diverting credit to operate tertiary industries, to build dwellings, and to buy bonds.
