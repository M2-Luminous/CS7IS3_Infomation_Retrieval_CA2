According to mining company officials, from January to October of this year, Falconbridge brought in foreign revenue amounting to $8,990,720, compared with a total of $34,797,705 for the same period of 1992. They reported that firm executives plan to produce 70 million pounds of nickel contained in ferronickel next year. During the first 10 months of 1993, they said, nickel exports amounted to 43,579,4124 [as published] pounds, which production was sold at an average per-pound price of $2.02. In contrast, 49,591,422 pounds were exported during the same period of last year at an average price of $3.20 per pound. From March to October of this year, Falconbridge Dominicana produced 40,916,441 pounds. It will be recalled that due to the drop in price and demand on the international market, executives decided to suspend operations on 26 December 1992, then resumed them on 8 March. During the first 10 months of 1992, Falconbridge produced 47,933,842 pounds. The estimated monthly average was 5.6 million pounds. From March to December of this year, the company planned to produce 55 million pounds at a much lower cost than that achieved during the final quarter of last year. In 1992, production totaled 60.7 million pounds and 60.5 million pounds were sold abroad at an average per-pound price of $3.14. A total of 70 million pounds was obtained during the entire period and the government took in $46,641,773 for the year. Experts estimated that it is impossible to produce at a cost of under $2.00 per pound, meaning that it will be necessary to change policies if world prices drop below that price this coming year. Falconbridge maintains its policy of reducing costs in order to continue operating, increase profits, and meet the region's development programs, the experts said. It will be recalled that in 1991, Falconbridge produced 64.1 million pounds of nickel and exported 61 million pounds. For the first time, the mining company reduced its operations by 50 percent on 7 October 1991, a situation that continued until late February 1992 due to the drop in prices and demand. By that time, prices ranged between $3.23 and $3.29. Meanwhile, production remained halted throughout almost all of August as the result of an effort to reduce the supply on hand. Company experts attribute the drop in prices and demand on the international market to the current overproduction since the former Soviet bloc countries have become exporters.
