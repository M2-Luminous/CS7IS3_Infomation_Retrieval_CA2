Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Defense has already instructed U.S. reserve troops on its mainland to prepare for participation in the Team Spirit exercise. The paper reported on 7 February that the time for negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue have likely run out, and that the U.S. Government's attitude indicates there are some changes in its position, which has so far expected the nuclear issue to be resolved by diplomatic efforts. The paper reported that the U.S. Department of Defense had ordered an additional 1,000 U.S. reserve troops to report to U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK if the North Korean nuclear issue is not resolved before 21 February, when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting is scheduled. The paper reported: IAEA authorities in Vienna have said that they are getting tired of holding negotiations with North Korea regarding inspection conditions and that they expect the IAEA Board of Governors to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. The paper also reported that the White House would soon determine and announce the deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces in the ROK. The Team Spirit joint military exercise, which has been conducted by the ROK and the United States since 1976, is prepared for in early January every year. In early March, field mobile exercises of the Team Spirit exercise are usually conducted. Up to the present time, however, the ROK and the United States have not prepared for the exercise as a result of nuclear negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea.
