This remark was made today by Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli when he submitted his report on the implementation of the state budget for 1993 and on the draft state budget for 1994 to the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. When analyzing the state financial situation, Liu said, market demand will remain huge this year. While continued reforms and economic development have created favorable conditions for state finances, two years of high economic growth have resulted in serious "bottlenecks," inflationary pressures, and an acute shortage of funds, he said. Under these circumstances, he said, China will continue to strengthen and improve macro-controls, strive to improve the economic performance of enterprises and make revenue increases commensurate with economic development. In expenditures, the country will act according to its capacity, ensure investment in key state projects and exercise strict control over investment in general fixed assets and expenditures for consumption. The finance minister said, in the implementation of the state budget for 1993, both revenues and expenditures exceeded budgeted figures by a big margin. While revenue and expenditures in local finances increased considerably in 1993, those in the central finances failed to reach budgeted figures. Moreover, although revenues in local finances increased substantially, turnover tax revenues in central finances were much less than the budgeted figure, thereby aggravating the difficulties of central finances. Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan and total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan. The deficit was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Local budgets were balanced. The Ministry of Finance has adopted a different method for calculating the deficit starting this year. Income from debts will no longer be included in total revenues, and debt service will no longer be included in total expenditures. Domestic and foreign debts due for repayment will be serviced by issuing treasury bonds. Such an adjustment only changes the way of calculating the debt and will not affect the actual size of the deficit. The budget for 1994 shows that state revenue totals 475.995 billion yuan and expenditures amount to 542.914 billion yuan, representing 7.7 percent and 15 percent increases over the 1993 figures respectively. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan, which reflects the real deficit. If the deficit is added with 48.081 billion yuan for servicing domestic and foreign debts and 14.245 billion yuan of foreign loans to be invested in key state construction projects this year, total debts for 1994 will come to 129.245 billion yuan. Liu explained that though China has appropriately reduced investment in fixed assets, the high expenditures base for 1993 made it necessary to increase essential expenditures on agriculture, education, science and technology and other key areas. Total expenditures are also affected by wage increases for employees of administrative departments and public institutions, increased subsidies following the introduction of a single exchange rate system and other policy related factors. These factors altogether contributed more than 50 billion yuan to total expenditures. In addition, because of price rises, army wage reform and higher living expenses, this year's national defence expenditures have been appropriately increased. Liu noted that since the reform of finance and the taxation system were put into force at the beginning of this year, the experience of the past two months and more has shown that the reform plan is correct, that it has been implemented smoothly by and large and that no major problems have arisen. However, we must remain sober-minded and be on our guard. The key to the success of this reform lies in achieving a consensus of views and in concerted action. Any problems can be reported to the higher authorities. Financial and taxation departments at all levels must take the interests of the whole into consideration, and they should not go their own way, overstep their authority, formulate their own rules and regulations, distort the reform plan or lead the reform astray in implementation.
