[Al-Majali] Happy Ramadan to you and to all our Arab brothers, especially in fraternal Egypt. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us what you discussed with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe during his recent visit to Jordan? [Al-Majali] The visit was very successful. It was meant for talks to promote bilateral relations, which have always been good in all areas, especially as far as France's economic support is concerned. France has always adopted a good and commendable position toward Jordan. We owe France a lot of money, and the minister promised that the French Government would reschedule this debt. The French minister inquired about the progress in the peace process and about our expectations in this year. Our views were identical; we are both optimistic about the peace process, and we hope that in 1994 the peace moves will intensify and blossom, if not bear fruit. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Were there any new French proposals or views concerning the peace process? [Al-Majali] There was nothing new, in fact. But they stressed that they support the peace process and expressed readiness to provide economic aid to the region. They are party to the multilateral talks, and many meetings have been held in Paris for this purpose. They also support the bilateral negotiations. They stressed their desire to play a bigger role. So far, France's role has been limited. We asked them, as an European country, to make further efforts to support the peace process. Relations between our countries and Europe are old and strong; we have links, and they have experience in this region. Undoubtedly, they can help in advancing the peace process. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and Damascus, what are Jordan's next Arab and international moves? [Al-Majali] Jordan always believes in common action and coordination with all Arab brothers. We believe that a comprehensive peace is [word indistinct] for all concerned parties. It is essential for the solution to be comprehensive, not partial. Much pressure has been put on Jordan to go it alone, but Jordan is firm, and does not agree to work individually. This position comes not from fanaticism or fear, but from belief that a general and comprehensive peace, not separate deals, is in the interest of all states of the region. Therefore, we always believe in coordination, especially with the United States, concerning bilateral and peace issues. I believe the United States clearly understood this. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated that you believe in inter-Arab coordination and collective Arab action. What about the reports that say Jordan has actually reached a peace agreement with Israel that only needs to be made public? [Al-Majali] This is untrue, a rumor. Of course, we are hoping to reach an agreement but so far it has not happened. Apart from signing an agenda of the talks, nothing has occurred. However, some issues are being discussed in depth, including the reopening of Jordanian banks in the West Bank. This is finished and done with. No peace agreement, in the true sense of the word, has been reached, although some issues are clarified and accepted by both sides. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, one last question. According to some reports, foreign countries are trying to destabilize Jordan, to undermine its security. What is Jordan's position on these reports? How true are they? [Al-Majali] We deeply regret the fact that there are some extremists who oppose the peace process. We believe in a constructive opposition but not an opposition that resorts to violence, assassinations, bombings, and the murder of innocent people. This is not opposition. These are acts that the Arab world is disgusted with and cannot accept, particularly as there is room for dialogue and discussion. Some people believe in violence but our people's steadfastness can effectively and manfully face whatever happens. We will not submit to any party that seeks to intimidate and terrorize us. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, we wish you a good Ramadan. Thank you very much. [Al-Majali] A good Ramadan to you in Egypt and to the whole Arab and Islamic world. We thank the Voice of the Arabs.
