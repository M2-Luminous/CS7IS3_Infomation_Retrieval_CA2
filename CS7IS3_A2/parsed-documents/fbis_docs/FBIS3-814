The decision to boycott the poll had been re-affirmed by the AVF's highest body at its latest meeting, Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement. In an apparent reference to Gen Constand Viljoen's resignation from the directorate of AVF generals, Dr Hartzenberg said the AVF's power base was "virtually uninjured". The AVF would continue to pursue its ideal of attaining freedom and self-determination for the Afrikaner/Boerevolk [Boer people], he said. "Participation in the elections is viewed as a fatal choice for the existence of our people and I as leader of the AVF can never commit myself to that. "The necessary internal organisational measures have been arranged so that the AVF can continue with its task with the least possible disruption. "The power base of the AVF is virtually intact and we continue with the implementation of our planning for the next weeks," said Dr Hartzenberg, who is also "president" of the right-wing transitional assembly.
