Saud al-Faysal, Saudi Arabian foreign minister and rotating chairman of the meeting, said in his speech: Iraq remains a threat to the security and stability of GCC countries. Therefore, the council's member states should take a unified stance toward it. According to political observers, this statement is not only a reiteration of the previous position of this council on Iraq, it also points to the relations between Qatar and Oman, which have in the past year expanded considerably. Three years ago, during the oil Gulf war, in opposition to a GCC decision, Oman did not sever its relations with Iraq. Recently, with mutual visits by officials of these two countries, their relations have expanded. Qatar, unlike Oman, severed its relations with Iraq during the oil war and took part militarily in the liberation of Kuwait. However, since then -- and, more precisely, since the border clash with Saudi Arabia -- Qatar has restored its relations with Iraq and is currently expanding them. Another issue on the agenda of the GCC foreign ministers, which was also pointed out in the final communique of this session, was the stance of this council regarding Israel's participation in regional multilateral meetings, which are due to take place in the future in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. Multilateral sessions are basically derived from the so-called Middle East peace negotiations. Unlike bilateral negotiations, in which only the two opposing sides take part, the Zionist regime participates in the major multilateral sessions of Arab countries [as heard] and some European, American, and Asian countries. It is worth noting that Syria and Lebanon, which are themselves two major partners in the negotiating process with the Zionist regime, have boycotted multilateral negotiations. They believe that regional cooperation with the participation of the Zionist regime cannot be possible until tangible progress is made in resolving the crisis in the Middle East and until the aggressive policies of Israel are reversed. A multilateral meeting on water resource cooperation is due to take place in Oman in two weeks' time. A similar session is to take place in Qatar a month later on arms control in the Middle East. Next fall, another session on the environment is due to take place in Bahrain. The Zionist regime is to take part officially in these meetings, which are being held in Arab countries of the Persian Gulf. According to political experts, this issue was brought up in the recent GCC session because the host countries of the multilateral meetings intend to act collectively [sentence as heard]. Of course, opening the door of the region to the usurper Zionist regime will not have fortunate results. The negative impacts of such uncalculated measures will definitely engulf those countries that engage in political adventurism without taking into account public opinion. Another issue that was mentioned in the final communique of the recent GCC foreign ministers meeting was support for the position of the United Arab Emirates on the Iranian island of Abu Musa. It is obvious that the GCC is a regional organization which could clearly help to resolve any misunderstanding between the countries of the region. However, repeating the mistaken policy of this council on the Iranian island of Abu Musa destroys the cooperation of this council in finding a solution to this matter. According to political experts, the GCC cannot take part in any political effort to solve differences until it exhibits a neutral stance on regional problems.
