Umar Hassan, chief of the team for prevention of AIDS in Lampung, stated to newsmen in Bandar Lampung on 9 April that the three persons were found to be positively affected with AIDS through a joint survey conducted with the District Health Department in March 1994. Umar Hassan, who is also the third assistant of district social welfare office said, "We are still looking for the two prostitutes who are infected with AIDS. We will officially detain them when we find them." Governor Pujono hoped that Lampung's team for the prevention of AIDS, which was established several months ago, would work to suppress the spread of the dangerous virus. Pujono said, "Lampung is a transit point with a potential for the transmission of AIDS. Due to this, it is important that we undertake early preventive measures." According to the data of the Regional Health Department, the two prostitutes Od (20) and Yn (28), who are affected with AIDS, were occupants of the service complexes at "Pemandangan" and "Pantai Harapan" in Panjang, Bandar Lampung, while Ys (28) was residing at Kalianda Welfare Board in south Lampung. According to several colleagues of Od and Yn, the two had returned to their respective villages. They said," They had left for Java several days before the 1994 Id 'al-Fitr holidays began." They also said,"Od and Yn had been staying in the Panjang service complexes for the last two years. They came from Java together with S and R." Officials of the Lampung provincial authority have directed that the two AIDS affected prostitutes be sought and be detained as an effort to prevent the spread of the disease. The exposure of the HIV cases in Lampung was due to the survey and tests conducted from 1,119 blood samples taken jointly by the Regional Health Department in Lampung and Lampung's team for the prevention of AIDS. Blood samples were taken from 142 prostitutes in "Pemandangan", 134 others at "Pantai Harapan", 75 persons from Pantai Pijat, 59 SMEA YPP students, 509 persons from Napi Tanjungkarang, 103 persons from Napi Kalianda, 90 SMAN Kalianda students and seven tourist guides, including pimps, lesbians and homosexuals. The blood samples were taken from the high-risk and HIV prone groups and tests were conducted. The outcome of the result was that three persons were tested positive for HIV. In compliance with the Regional Health Department's report to the governor on 17 March 1994, blood tests were conducted to detect the spread of the HIV virus, social diseases and syphilis. According to the head of the Lampung team for the prevention of AIDS, Drs. Umar Hassan, the AIDS problem needs to be perpetually pursued. He said," We truly hope that Lampung will be free of prostitutes."
