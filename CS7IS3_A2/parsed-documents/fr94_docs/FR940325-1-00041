ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would amend the regulations that govern how the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management, administers livestock grazing. This proposed rule would apply to all lands on which the Bureau of Land Management administers livestock grazing. This proposed rule would also amend the Department of the Interior's appeals regulations pertaining to livestock grazing to provide consistency with administrative remedies provided for in the grazing regulations, and would amend the regulations on cooperative relations to reflect changes in the organization of certain advisory committees. The proposed changes are a part of an overall effort to improve the management of the Nation's public rangeland resources. Public review and comment on this proposal is invited. An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on August 13, 1993 (58 FR 43208). Comments received on the advance notice have been considered in identifying and refining key components of the rangeland reform effort and in preparing this proposed rule. Due to the great volume of comments anticipated on this proposed rule, the Department requests that reviewers identify the specific section and paragraph label for the regulatory text on which they are commenting. Specific statements of what regulatory text the reviewer feels should be modified, and the reasons for the recommended changes, are encouraged. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted in writing by July 28, 1994. Comments postmarked after this date will not be considered in the preparation of the final rule. ADDRESSES: Send comments on this proposed rule to Rangeland Reform '94, P.O. Box 66300, Washington, D.C. 20035&hyph;6300.
