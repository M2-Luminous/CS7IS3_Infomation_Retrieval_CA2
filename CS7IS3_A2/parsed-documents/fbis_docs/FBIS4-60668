The land belongs to the Israel Lands Administration, and half of it is located in urban areas. The defense establishment believes that the relocation will cost over 500 million shekels and it wants the Treasury to fund the move. At this stage, the defense establishment is focusing on the evacuation of nine bases inside urban areas or close to them in order to permit the Construction and Housing Ministry to build apartments there. These bases are in 'Atlit, Nesher, Jerusalem, Yoqne'am, and Haifa. The relocation of the antiaircraft school from Herzliyya to the Negev was completed several weeks ago and the Defense Ministry was paid 18 million shekels for the move. The ministry also received 16 million shekels to fund the transfer of warehouses from Yafo to Petah Tiqva. The camps will be relocated by private firms. Planning work will start soon on the evacuation of Army's headquarters at Haqirya in Tel Aviv after it was agreed that the Treasury would transfer some $1.5 million for the planning stage. Defense Ministry sources believe that the cost of evacuating the southern part of Haqirya, which is spread over some 70 dunams, as well as the new construction work, will cost some $100 million, and the process will last seven years. The new construction will be on the land freed by the relocation of the women's hospital at the Haqirya site.
