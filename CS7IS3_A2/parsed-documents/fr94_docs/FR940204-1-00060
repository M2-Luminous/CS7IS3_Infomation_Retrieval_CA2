ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking action to propose approval of Title 120&hyph;01 of the Commonwealth of Virginia's Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution, Part IV, Rule 4&hyph;37 (Petroleum Liquid Storage and Transfer Operations), §§120&hyph;04&hyph;3701 to 120&hyph;04&hyph;3715 and Appendices P and S, as a revision to the Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The effective date for Virginia's State regulation is January 1, 1993. On November 5, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a SIP revision request to EPA to satisfy the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act), which requires all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse to require owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities to install and operate Stage II vapor recovery equipment. This revision applies to the Virginia portion of the Washington, DC ozone nonattainment area and the Richmond ozone nonattainment area. This revision also contains several other minor amendments to Virginia's Rule 4&hyph;37. Although these changes do not necessarily pertain to the Stage II program, they will affect the non-Stage II requirements previously established by this proposed rule. DATES: Comments must be received by March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 10089, Richmond Virginia, 23240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian K. Rehn, at (215) 597&hyph;4554. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 182(b)(3) of the Act, EPA was required to issue guidance as to the effectiveness of Stage II systems. In November 1991, EPA issued technical and enforcement guidance to meet this requirement. 1 In addition, on April 16, 1992, EPA published the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (General Preamble) (57 FR 13498). The guidance documents and the General Preamble interpret the Stage II statutory requirement and indicate what EPA believes a State submittal needs to include to meet that requirement. 1 These two documents are entitled ``Technical Guidance-Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Control of Vehicle Refueling Emissions at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities'' (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;91&hyph;022) and ``Enforcement Guidance for Stage II Vehicle Refueling Control Programs.'' The Virginia portion of the Washington, DC metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as serious. The Richmond MSA is also designated nonattainment for ozone, and is classified as moderate. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. Under section 182(b)(3) of the Act, Virginia was required to submit Stage II vapor recovery rules for these areas by November 15, 1992. On November 5, 1992, the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control, now known as the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), submitted to EPA Stage II vapor recovery rules for the Northern Virginia and Richmond areas that were adopted by the Commonwealth on October 5, 1992. By today's action, EPA is proposing to approve this submittal as meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. EPA has reviewed the Commonwealth's submittal against the statutory requirements and for consistency with EPA guidance. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below; in addition, a more detailed analysis of the State submittal is contained in a technical support document for this action, dated September 15, 1993, which is available from the Region III Office, at the address listed in the ADDRESSES section above. Regulatory Evaluation I. Applicability Under section 182(b)(3) of the Act, states were required by November 15, 1992 to adopt regulations requiring owners or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities. Virginia has adopted Stage II measures for the Northern Virginia (Virginia portion of the Washington DC MSA) and the Richmond areas, as required by the Act. Section 182(b)(3)(A) of the Act specifies that Stage II controls must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer (ISBM), any facility that dispenses more than 50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. The Commonwealth has adopted a general applicability requirement for those gasoline dispensing facilities having an average monthly throughput (as described below) of over 10,000 gallons per month and those independent small business marketers dispensing over 50,000 gallons per month.
