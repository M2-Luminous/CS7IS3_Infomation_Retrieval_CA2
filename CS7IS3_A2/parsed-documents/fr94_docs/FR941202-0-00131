FR941202-0-00131 FR941202-0-00012 Regulatory Flexibility Act Based on the current positive testing rate data, the aviation and rail industries will qualify for a reduction to a 25% testing rate in 1995. Although this change will result in substantial cost savings, there will be little economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in those industries. It is difficult to project which other transportation industries are likely to qualify for a reduction in the testing rate. The remaining transportation industries (motor carriers, pipelines, maritime, and transit) include many small companies. If the random testing rate were reduced in any of those industries, there might be a significant cost savings, as discussed in the accompanying regulatory evaluation. In addition, to the extent that the rate is lowered it might have a negative economic impact on those who provide services to employers covered under the rules, some of whom are small entities. Under the best circumstances, however, motor carriers, transit and pipeline industries could not reduce their testing rates until 1998. We therefore certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for at least the next several years. Paperwork Reduction Act There are a number of reporting or recordkeeping requirements associated with DOT-mandated drug testing. Some of the requirements are currently part of the OAs' drug testing rules and some have been incorporated as a result of the final rules setting up the management information systems that were published in the Federal Register on December 23, 1993. To the extent that fewer random tests are required in a given transportation industry, there will be a proportionate reduction in recordkeeping, but no change in the reporting requirement.
