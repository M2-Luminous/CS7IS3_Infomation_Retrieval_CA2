The announcement was made at the end of a meeting attended by Gen. Ortega; Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta; Sergio Caramagna, coordinator of the International Support and Vertification Commission of the OAS (CIAV-OAS); and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, representative of the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. The decision to temporarily suspend the military offensive is designed to allow the peace commission, comprised of representatives of the Catholic Church and the CIAV-OAS, to contact the rebel leaders so that disarmament can begin quickly, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta explained. The truce "only covers the operational area" of the 3-80 Northern Front led by former contra Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," Ortega said, after noting that the order took effect at 0001 (0501 GMT) Wednesday [9 February]. He added that in the rest of the country, where some rearmed groups and common criminals are active, military operations will continue to preserve the "security" of the citizens. "If the negotiations (for disarmament) fail, the offensive will continue," Ortega said. The "recontras" had announced a unilateral cease-fire effective tomorrow, Thursday, as a "goodwill gesture" to seek peace and a negotiated solution to the armed conflict in northern Nicaragua. Gen. Ortega, who did not indicate exactly what territory will be covered by the military truce, said this will allow the evacuation of "recontras" wounded in the recent fighting who have not yet received medical attention and have been caught in the crossfire. The armed group led by "Chacal" operates principally in the mountains of Quilali Municipality in Nueva Segovia Department on the Honduran border. "This truce sets a reasonable term in which the date for disarmament (of the `recontras') can be established, which we hope will be done as quickly as possible," Mendieta added, after noting that the government will guarantee the lives and security of rebels who lay down their weapons and rejoin civilian life. Mendieta insisted "there will be no political-type negotiations" with leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front for the disarmament and demobilization of the recontras and that the government "is ready to start responding to their social demands." "I believe this is the best chance we have of solving the armed conflict and of peacefully resolving problems," Minister Mendieta said. For his part, Sergio Caramagna, the CIAV-OAS coordinator in Nicaragua, said that in the coming hours they will attempt to contact "recontra" leaders to convey the government's proposal in an effort to end the armed conflict in the north. Caramanga also announced that he is taking a letter from Gen. Ortega to the "recontras" in which the military chief explains the facilities that will be extended for their disarmament in order that the "tragedy" being experienced by people in that part of the country may end soon. According to the Army, the 3-80 Northern Front led by "Chacal," one of the most belligerent armed groups, is made up of 400 recontras, although a similar number of armed groups and common criminals operate within the country. The phenomenon of the "recontras" began in 1991, after the government failed to provide several thousands of the 22,000 demobilized "contras" with the means for rejoining civilian life.
