In contrast to Plesetsk, from the new cosmodrome it will be possible to launch boosters of the heavy Proton class, but they will be ecologically clean variants. This was stated in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Russian military space forces. The end of the "cold war" and the disarmament which is now taking place has brought to the brink of extinction the once most powerful type of armed forces, the Strategic Rocket Forces, which this year marks its 35th anniversary. Under the conditions of the agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons (START II) signed by the presidents of Russia and the United States at Sochi on 3 January 1993, the two great powers are continuing the disarmament process, thereby reducing the confrontation to a lower level. Under the agreement, before the year 2003 all surface intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Russia will be liquidated, including the heavy RS-20 (SS-18), in the United States also called the Satan, which beyond the ocean had caused the greatest anxiety. As a result of implementation of these agreements among the seven types of ICBMs only one type will remain in Russia -- the RS-12M (SS-25), both mobile and stationary. The first missiles to be destroyed will be those developed and constructed at an earlier time -- the RS-16 (SS-11), RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-16 (SS-17). In order not to leave the impression that there is a unilateral disarmament of Russia, it also must be noted that American ICBMs also will be destroyed or reoutfitted. By the beginning of 21st century some of the 20 Russian regions of deployment of the offensive missile complexes of the Strategic Rocket Forces now in existence will cease to be. These will include first of all the Vershet (Perm Oblast), Drovyanaya and Yasnaya (Chita Oblast), Kostroma, Krasnoyarsk and Svobodnyy (Amur Oblast) regions. Until recently Svobodnyy remained the most eastern region of deployment. The armament there consisted of the RS-10 ICBM, aimed at the United States. This single-warhead 17-m missile with a launching weight of more than 50 tons carried a nuclear charge of 1.1 megaton, which is 50 times greater than the power of the bomb dropped at Hiroshima by the United States in 1945. So it happened that a wise government decision to reoutfit a defense facility at Plesetsk into a space facility was made almost 30 years ago -- in 1964. Now, after all the years have passed, a similar decision has been made with respect to reductions of the rocket division at Svobodnyy, which was going under the knife. As a result, the Svobodnyy facility will be retained, but it will play a different role -- as the Main Center for Testing and Use of Space Equipment (TsIPKS). A little more than two weeks remain to the meeting of the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, planned for the end of March, which in many respects can and must be important. Because the documents signed as a result of this meeting -- especially with respect to the Baykonur cosmodrome (contract and agreement), as well as with respect to military-technical cooperation, should determine the future relations of the two countries in these fields up to the beginning of the 21st century. The interests of the defense capability and safety of Russia cannot and must not in any way be made dependent on the policy of another state, even if it is a friendly state which is part of the CIS. Precisely this has dictated the striving of Russia to have its own cosmodrome; Svobodnyy was selected as the final location (initially three possible variants were examined). A well-built residential city of rocket forces, a hospital and other infrastructure facilities costing several hundreds of millions of rubles, which now, it seems, is to receive a "second wind," are already here and the rocket forces, performing their military duties, will launch boosters and spacecraft into space. It is proposed that two launch facilities for heavy boosters of the Proton type, but new, ecologically clean variants, will be constructed in the neighborhood of Svobodnyy. Unfortunately, the short-sighted position of the Russian Space Agency (RSA), not fully taking the interests of Russia into account, precluded the participation of Plesetsk in implementing the project for constructing the Alpha international orbital station. This position scarcely can be justified by the "youth" of the RSA, recently marking its second anniversary. After all, the governmental males standing at the "space helm" have gone through the real "Momovskaya school" (Ministry of General Machine Building [MOM]). Nevertheless, the Alpha project approved by them is completely oriented on Baykonur. But under the conditions of nonfinalization of the negotiations with Kazakhstan with respect to Baykonur, complicated by the on-again off-again approach of that independent state, the international project will be considerably more difficult to implement from the purely political point of view. Therefore, in order for Russia to carry out an independent space policy and to ensure guaranteed access to space Russia has been forced, using the existing infrastructure, to proceed to the reoutfitting and construction of a new cosmodrome in the Far East where more than three thousand rocket troops now serve.
