It is equally likely that this initiative will promote an integrationist idea capable of shaping a new greater Europe which is both stable and democratic. But this idea could amount to no more than good intentions which, as we all know, pave the road to hell. [passage omitted] Uncertainties We have tried objectively not only to study the concept of the Partnership but also to understand the spirit it embodies. It is this in particular which has given rise to the first uncertainties and the following essential questions: 1. What is the initiative's objective? 2. What is the aim of the progressive enlargement of NATO? 3. What is "real partnership" and how much does it cost? 4. How do the NATO leaders see the borders of the "Euro-Atlantic region," the security of which they are saying must be consolidated? 5. What exactly are the "new security relations between the alliance and its partners for peace?" NATO documents give no or incomplete answers to these questions. However, we believe that the essential thinking behind the Partnership for Peace and the political conditions which determined the birth of the concept can be summarized as follows: - the capability of the United Nations is insufficient; - NATO, while remaining the most powerful military organization, has lost the very reason for its existence; - Russia is at present so weakened that it can no longer control its former Warsaw Pact allies or the former Soviet republics; - the political leaders of Central Europe have chosen "a national flight from Russia to NATO;" - European diplomacy in Yugoslavia has reached the deadlock of a crisis at the European level which is burdened with spilled blood. The Choice of Mechanism The conclusion is clear. Given the above conditions, the only possible remedy lies in a unification of the efforts of the whole of Europe with the precise aim of guaranteeing its security on the basis of partnership. The problem thus lies in the mechanism to be used in order to achieve this goal. NATO has chosen the type of mechanism in proposing the Partnership for Peace plan, which is not bad in principle as it is only the Atlantic alliance which has real force and structures in Europe. However, this would create the danger of "progressively" pushing Russia out of this European process and of seeking European security without her. This brings us to the first illogical points which have served to over-simplify the model proposed. All that NATO has seen in the Partnership for Peace is a mechanism for self-preservation and the creation of its new image. It is in this way that the idea of a Partnership for Peace has been transformed into that of a partnership for NATO. The euphoria was so great that it prevented NATO from noticing that the Russian bull was on the doorstep of the European china shop. This is the only way we can explain the later decisions of NATO which have harmed the idea of the Partnership for Peace. The Revelation of Bosnia This lies in NATO's ultimatum to Serbia with the threat of air strikes against Serb positions in the region of Sarajevo. This decision, reached without taking into account Russia's opinion, suggests that NATO is anxious to establish its own importance, already inflated by an obstinate inflexibility. Moreover, the experts in Moscow were surprised by the rigid stance of France which, after having restricted itself for so many years to the confines of its "national trench," has suddenly decided to make a big show for all to see. The general impression is that Partnership slogans are replacing any real partnership, that NATO has little interest in a partnership with a strong and active Russia, and that the mentality of the Atlantic alliance is, and let us pray to God that this does not last, every bit as resistant to change as communist ideology. However, Russia's Serbian initiative proved both a cold shower for NATO and also something of a salvation as any bombing of Serbian positions would have inevitably posed the question: What now? The fact that Russia made its position known firmly and in time and that this position has been accepted by NATO is, of course, very positive. We now have a good chance of achieving a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. It is therefore important for NATO to refrain in the future from decisions likely to divide Europe and to discredit the ideas of the Partnership for Peace. The above reasoning may be summarized under two key themes: - it is impossible to ignore the evidence that Russia is a major Euro-Asian power which has its own national interests. No one is in a position to "push it out" of either Europe or Asia as it covers large areas of both these continents; - the United Nations must see NATO not as a cure for all but as just one security instrument among others. The UN peacemaking efforts must be based on the determination of the international community to make, over a very long period, substantial material contributions to, if not sacrifices for, the cause of peace. This means that politicians from all countries concerned must understand that sporadic and cheap military actions such as air strikes have no chance of solving peacemaking problems which require a systematic approach.
