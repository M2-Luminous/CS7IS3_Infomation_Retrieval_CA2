The mass action is organized by the republic's striking committee, whose headquarters told BELINFORM that the most serious events are expected in the capital, as well as in Orsha, a major railway junction, and Soligorsk, the republic's mining center. It appears that the call to strike has not met with support in most work collectives. The official trade unions have said in a statement that the action was premature, and many major industrial enterprises have declaimed to join. The call for mass action was condemned by the leaders of the parliament and government. As of this hour, the action concentrates on independence square in Minsk, where tens of thousands of strikers from across the republic first met in April 1991. Now no more than 2-3 thousand people have converged on the square.
