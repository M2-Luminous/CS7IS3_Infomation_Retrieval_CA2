We welcome him to Voice of the Arabs. [Basindwah] I thank you for phoning me. I wish you and Egypt--its president, government, and people--prosperity, success, stability, and peace in this blessed month of Ramadan, the month of fasting and virtue. [Al-Jundi] Hours after the signing of the pledge and accord document, news agency reports spoke of clashes between northern and southern Yemeni forces. What is your full assessment of these clashes? [Basindwah] I want to be true with the listeners of the Voice of the Arabs because the Voice of the Arabs has accustomed us to the truth. Undoubtedly, there are elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] who want to consecrate secession as a fait accompli. Within this context, some forces--the Unity Brigade--moved from Hadramut to the Abyan Province contrary to the agreement banning any military movements. These forces, which fall under the YSP command, moved to Abyan Province to provoke the 'Amaliqah forces. A clash occurred, in which innocent Yemenis died. We do not consider the dead from the south as non-Yemenis and we do not consider the dead from the north as non-Yemenis. In our view, they are all Yemenis and they are the sons of our one people. We must save their blood. We do not want a Yemeni to be killed by another Yemeni. We want to stop the bloodshed. The clash was part of a plan to prevent the signing of the document. We had hoped that 20 February of this year would be the day Yemen overcame its crisis. [Al-Jundi] While we share with you this hope, it is a fact that both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid want to contain any crisis that might arise. There are direct orders by both men that these events should be contained. [Basindwah] Yemen is dear to us. We must safeguard the security and peace of its people. We want stability to prevail throughout our homeland. We do not want any part of the homeland to be exposed to dangers. Yemen's unity does not concern one particular person or party but concerns all Yemenis. In my opinion, any attempt to break up this unity is treason. [Al-Jundi] Allow me to submit a clearer question. How effective is the pledge and accord document at this particular time? [Basindwah] I believe all our people have rallied around this document and there is a national consensus on it. However, there are elements who are trying to spoil the good and encouraging atmosphere created by the signing of the pledge and accord document. We must implement this document because it no longer belongs to its signatories but to all the Yemeni people. [Al-Jundi] The pledge and accord document was signed in the presence of the Arab League secretary general and a representative of Omani Sultan Qabus and under the sponsorship of King Husayn of Jordan. Did the participation of these figures in the reconciliation of the Yemeni factions represent an Arab desire to contain this crisis? [Basindwah] Undoubtedly, the presence of the Arab League secretary general and the Omani minister of state for foreign affairs as a representative of Sultan Qabus indicates a collective Arab desire for Yemeni unity. We had hoped that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gulf states, and other Arab states would have attended the signing of this document. We know that all these states are concerned about Yemen's unity. Regardless of attempts by some people to cast doubt on our relations with fraternal and dear states, we will remain loyal to these states and retain for them amity, respect, appreciation, and gratitude. [Al-Jundi] How do you envisage future events in Yemen? [Basindwah] I believe our Yemeni people will rally around those who are eager for Yemen's unity. They will stand against all those who try to dismember Yemen. Those who are defending Yemen's unity and the march of democracy will triumph. I am confident of this because it is a historic inevitability.
