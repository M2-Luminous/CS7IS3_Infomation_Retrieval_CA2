Participants in the Communist Party's two-day national conference, which was completed on Sunday, said the party regarded itself as "component part of the union of Communist parties -- CPSU aimed at gradual consolidation of Soviet Communists." Delegates to the conference passed a total of seven documents, including theses to the Communist Party's programme "from crisis to steady development," a resolution "on patriotism and attitude towards the ruling regime," a document "the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way to accord for Russia," as well as a reolution on the results of the recent meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet republics. The conference was held not exactly in the way the Communist Party's leader Gennadiy Zyuganov expected to. Although his moderate patriotic line was not subjected to open criticism, the documents adopted by the conference contradict in certain respects the course pursued by the current party leadership. First, some amendments were introduced into the draft theses to the party's programme, which shifted the "state-patriotic" accent towards a greater "international" character of the programme. Second (which was to a considerable degree due to member of the editing commission Anatoliy Lukyanov, one of the August 1991 coup plotters), excluded from the draft document "the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the way towards accord for Russia" was a provision saying early elections may become unnecessary if effective agreement on civic peace is reached at the negotiating table. The resolution on the results of the recent meeting of communist leaders from former Soviet republics was passed also on Lukyanov's proposal. The meeting was held in Zvenigorod, outside Moscow, on April 22. The resolution says the Communist Party "regards itself component part of the Union of Communist Parties, but retains organizational autonomy and its own programme and charter." According to Lukyanov, this is "essential advance as compared with associate membership." Zyuganov did not seem very enthusiastic about the prospect of the Communist Party's joining the Orthodox Union of Communist Parties headed by Oleg Shenin. Instead, he backed the idea of setting up a new association to unite communist parties of the former Soviet Union, which is to be called a "Union of Internationalists." This issue is most likely to be raised at the coordinating meeting of communist leaders of former Soviet republics this coming May. However, all this by no means proves to any split in the party: All documents were approved nearly unanimously. But the general impression was that the Communist Party obviously lacks unity, and its leader finds it rather difficult to combine the party's new parliamentary image with feelings of grass roots members and certain leaders.
