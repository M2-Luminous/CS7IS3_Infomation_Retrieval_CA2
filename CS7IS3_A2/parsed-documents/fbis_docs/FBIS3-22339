Along with other committees of a similar rank, it is a part of the GKChS [State Committee of the Russian Federation on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural Disasters]. Quite understandably, this disturbs the workers, although not all of them, of course. Not the workers but interested individuals, of whom there are many times more, are disturbed by one extremely significant aspect of this departmental cataclysm. The GKChS does not intend to take the administration of social protection under its "mantle." Thus the main function of Goskomchernobyl will atrophy to a significant degree--it will have to be performed by the Ministry of Social Protection, which has enough problems of its own without orphan children and the elderly. Plenty has been said about the "Chernobyl" benefits and payment increments. It is clear that they are very costly and will continue to be costly. Experts of the Ministry of Finance think that in 1994 alone payments will exceed 1 trillion rubles [R]. Many are eager to raise a dispute over this material and financial aspect. Many fewer are willing to discuss the social, not to mention the psychological aspects. But workers of the Department for Studying the Medical and Psychological Consequences of the Disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant of the State Scientific Center for Social and Judicial Psychiatry imeni Serbskiy think that as of the present moment these aspects are the main ones. The newspaper SEGODNYA has already written about the higher level of neurotic symptoms discovered by these researchers among the population of the contaminated areas, caused primarily by the extremely contradictory information about the scale of the danger. The masters Freud and Bekhterev back in their day noted that increased receptivity to suggestion and the preference of rumors over official information are typical of mass psychology. Under Soviet conditions it was quite predictable that these features would be hypertrophied and become a way of directing perception. Another thing was surprising: Despite expectations, in time the consequences of stress did not disappear, although none of the people residing in the affected territories could experience any apparent results from the action of small doses of radiation. Actually, it was the latter circumstance that contributed to a situation where stress became chronic. In this case the "Soviet consciousness" does not come into play. The same thing happened with Americans after the disaster at the Three Mile Island (TMI) power plant in 1979. One can understand why it was that six years later when a reactor in good repair was started up at Three Mile Island the indicators of alarm and depressive disorders there increased. It is not so obvious but nonetheless a fact that the most diverse stress loads which have nothing to do with the radiation danger can just as successfully aggravate nervous disorders and all the quite physical ailments that go with them. In the opinion of the leader of the Department for Studying the Medical and Psychological Consequences, Galina Rumyantseva, social and economic factors are undoubtedly included among these "starters." It goes without saying, of course, that macroeconomics does not rank high among them. For example, it was discovered that mass deterioration of the psychological and, correspondingly, physical condition was brought about by delays in payment of wages, which are now commonplace. But one need be neither a medical expert nor a psychic to imagine the dynamic evoked by the abolition of compensatory payments. Incidentally, this has already begun. Benefits for people living on areas with background indicators of radioactivity of from 1 to 5 curies per square kilometer have been eliminated. The rest, whose future became uncertain, immediately started to feel worse. There would hardly be any point to thinking about all that was said above outside the environment of psychologists and psychiatrists. Unfortunately, the consequences can (and this is precisely what happens most of the time) be outside their professional competence. There are 2.6 million Russians living in zones of radioactive contamination from the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant alone, and 2.2 million of them are receiving benefits and additional payments. Incidentally, the average level of wages in these regions was deliberately lowered since it was assumed that the additional payments, which now come to about four times the minimum wage, would serve as an additional source of income. And the level of health of the population cannot even be compared with that in the so-called "clean areas": Control studies showed that the incidence of vegeto-vascular dystonia and functional disorders are 10 times greater in Novozybkovskiy Rayon than in Tver, where out of every 10,000 studied, only three were affected. And so medical experts warn that abolishing the benefits will lead to a clear negative reaction. When it follows from this that millions of people will actually be "excluded" from life and more than 10 oblasts along with them, there is something to think about. Actually, there will be nothing unexpected in their behavior--almost from the very beginning of the Chernobyl saga these people were bearers of so-called rent psychology which, to be truthful, was imposed upon them. Its main feature is social passivity and a desire to place responsibility for their well-being on others. There is no need to go into detail about the possible consequences of such a world view: Practically every post-Soveticus manifests it to one degree or another or else has been fortunate enough to rid himself of it only in the recent past. Among the sufferers, access to benefits was a measure of success in life even irrespective of their actual value. For example, it would never occur to anyone that to send children to vacation in Australia--at the expense of their hosts, of course--would mean to give them at least another annual dose which they would receive during the flight. Incidentally, it would be naive to think that transoceanic voyages and foreign diagnosis are available to all residents of the contaminated territories. Near the rayon center of Novozybkovo there is a village called Zlynka. It is a rayon center too, although, according to testimony from people who have visited there, one gets the impression that the distance between it and Novozybkovo, which is visited by foreigners, is not 20 km but at least a half century. And our achievements if not at cleaning up then, as the physicians express it, in coping with the consequences of the disaster suffer from such contrasts as well. On the one hand there is our fairly successful policy of resettlement which, in the opinion of specialists in any case, surpasses similar actions taken in Belarus and Ukraine in terms of many parameters, and on the other--there is the absence for seven years in a row of reliable information on the doses received by the population. We still have not conducted an individual study of the residents. Of course, this is difficult work, but the majority of medical experts have no doubt about the need for it: It has repeatedly happened that on fairly clean territories there have been random people who have received a considerable dose of radiation. The prospects look fairly grim. It seems that only psychiatrists and psychologists have clearly formulated their ideas about them and, being specialists, in spite of the well-known Prutkov aphorism, they do not want to be one-sided like a gumboil and are hoping for cooperation from their colleagues. For example, endocrinologists, since increased pathology in this area is inevitable. It is too soon to close the question of the effects of small doses of radiation as well--thus for a long time allopathists have closed their eyes to the homeopathy but it still has not ceased to exist. So far medical experts have been engaged in organizing a kind of assistance for which there was an obvious need. Some 70 percent of the residents of the contaminated territories were in favor of organizing a sociopsychological service there. The first and, from all appearances, last center will begin to operate in the next three months. Funds have been allotted by Goskomchernobyl for a year--the center's subsequent destiny is unknown. But it is known that the network of such institutions for children has remained, as it were, in the planning stage. Incidentally, they, along with their mothers, are in the risk group. Also included are educators and local medical personnel. The latter, true, might be, as they like to put it, "compensated." But this can hardly be said about the majority of residents of "contaminated" rayons, who have perceived the disappearance of Goskomchernobyl as a loss of a protector. It seems that this time the supporters of shock therapy have allowed an overload.
