FR940407-2-00071 FR940407-2-00038 The principles of the SEDS approach discussed above assume these definitions of important terms linked to the SEDS process: • ``Governmental infrastructure'' includes the constitutional, legal, and administrative development requisite for independent governance. • ``Economic infrastructure'' includes the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components necessary for a functioning local economy which supports the life-style embraced by the Native American community. • ``Social infrastructure'' includes those components through which health of the people and the environment and economic well-being are maintained within the community and that support governance and economic goals. These definitions should be kept in mind as a local strategy is developed as part of the application for project funding. Without a careful balance between governmental, economic and social development infrastructures, a community's development efforts could be jeopardized. The recently added emphasis on environmental concerns (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139 and Pub. L. 101&hyph;408) does not in any way negate the SEDS approach but requires the enrichment of each dimension of SEDS. For example, expansion of social services, without providing opportunities for employment, economic development and environmental protection, could lead to dependency on social services. Conversely, inadequate social support services and training could seriously impede productivity and local economic development and environmental protection. Additionally, infrastructures must be developed or expanded at the tribal or village level to support social and economic development and growth with proper consideration of their impacts on the environment. B. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 1. General Considerations The Administration for Native Americans assists eligible applicants (see section C below) in undertaking one-to-three year development projects that are a part of long-range comprehensive plans to move toward environmental regulatory enhancement and be interrelated with a community's social and economic development plans. Applicants must also propose a concrete, locally determined strategy to carry out the project's goals, objectives, and work plans. Local long-range planning must consider the maximum use of all available resources, how these resources will be directed toward planning and development opportunities, and present a strategy for overcoming the local issues that hinder environmental regulatory enhancement. The Administration for Native Americans encourages applicants to design project strategies to achieve their specific environmental regulatory enhancement goals and to use available human, natural, financial, and physical resources to which the applicant has access. Non-ANA resources should be leveraged to strengthen and broaden the impact of the proposed project in the community. Project designs should explain how those parts of projects which ANA does not fund will be financed through other sources. For example, ANA does not fund construction. Applicants must show the relationship of non-ANA funded activities to those objectives and activities that are funded with ANA grant funds. All projects funded by ANA must be completed, or self-sustaining or supported with other than ANA funds at the end of the project period. ``Completed'' means that the project ANA funded is finished, and the desired result(s) have been attained. ``Self-sustaining'' means that a project will continue without outside resources. ``Supported by other than ANA funds'' means that the project will continue beyond the ANA project period, but will be supported by funds other than ANA's. 2. Activities That Cannot Be Funded by ANA The Administration for Native Americans does not fund programs which operate indefinitely or require ANA funding on a recurring basis. The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an organization. ``Core administration'' is defined as funding for staff salaries for those functions which support the organization as a whole, or for purposes unrelated to the actual management or implementation of work conducted under an ANA approved project. However, functions and activities that are clearly project related are eligible for grant funding. For example, the management and administrative functions necessary to carry out an ANA approved project are not considered ``core administration'' and are therefore grant eligible costs. Additionally, ANA will fund the salaries of approved staff for time actually and reasonably spent to implement a funded ANA project.
