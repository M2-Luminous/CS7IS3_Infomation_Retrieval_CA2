In this context, they are also planning to operate on German soil. According to Arab intelligence services, a close collaborator of the legendary terrorist Carlos has left his hideout in Iran and arrived in Beirut to prepare some operations. In the Lebanese capital, the Carlos aide discussed with the chief coordinator for operations abroad of the Iranian Hizballah the setting up of terrorist cells that will also be active in the Federal Republic. The members of such cells will above all be recruited from the Islamistic movement in Tunisia. The ill-famed terrorist organization of Abu Nidal has channeled four combatants with forged travel documents from Beirut via Cyprus to Germany. The planned terrorist operations are intended as revenge for the kidnapping of Islamic activist Mustafa al-Dirani. [passage omitted on al-Dirani kidnapping]
