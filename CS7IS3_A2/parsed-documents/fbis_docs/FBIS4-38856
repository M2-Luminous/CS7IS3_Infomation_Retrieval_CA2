It is well known that last November such opportunities were substantially restricted by a presidential edict. A kind of veto was imposed not only on the registration of new branches of foreign credit institutions, but also on certain transactions by banks already existing in Russia. It is no secret that this decision was adopted in response to demands by our own bankers, who were afraid of an unequal competitive struggle. But for every action, as is well known, there is a reaction. According to V. Gerashchenko, foreign states promptly made access to their own financial markets tougher. For Russian banks it became an insoluble problem not only to open branches abroad, but even offices. In addition, the prohibitive measures on our side were assessed negatively by international financial organizations, and at the moment, in view of our need not only for new credits but also for the deferral of debt repayments, it is quite inappropriate to quarrel with them. However, the forthcoming simplification of access to our financial market does not mean that the registration of foreign banks will now take place more or less automatically. Last year the Central Bank imposed a so-called "limit on participation by foreign capital in the country's banking system," namely 12 percent. This means that the total capital of branches of foreign banks as a proportion of the gross capital of all banks on Russia's territory must not be more than that level. As of today this quota is virtually exhausted, so the registration of new branches of foreign banks is highly problematical. But this restrictive measure appears more intelligent than a simple ban, and it is not causing a negative response among international organizations. V. Gerashchenko confirmed that the "limit on participation by foreign capital in the country's banking system" will be maintained, although the level could be adjusted. That is, the process of foreign banks' penetration will be controlled. Incidentally, V. Gerashchenko, making all these statements at a specially arranged press conference, did not omit to reproach "certain journalists" for trying recently to represent him as in some way opposed to the president's much-publicized edicts in the sphere of economic policy. According to him, the documents were prepared with the Central Bank's participation, and he simply could not be opposed to them. V. Gerashchenko not only confirmed his commitment to the radical economic edicts, but make equally radical subsequent statements. For instance, he noted that this very week the Central Bank board of directors may adopt a decision on a future lowering of the interest rate on centralized credits, which will certainly have a beneficial effect on investment processes. On the other hand, he came out categorically against using coercion on commercial banks in the setting of their interest rates, since "nothing useful can come of that" -- cheap credits are simply squandered. Finally, V. Gerashchenko promised that the practice of auction sales of centralized credit resources will be extended and in the near future such auctions will be held every two weeks. Regular, open dealings in credit resources will help people to form a clearer idea of how much money costs in our country. And aother important question was raised at the press conference. Many people wanted to know how to interpret the section of the president's edict on the normalization of accounts which states that "legal entities may obtain monetary resources from the bank for pressing needs to the tune of...up to five times the minimum monthly wage, depending on the total average listed number of workers." V. Gerashchenko explained that enterprises can reserve this sum even before the payment of funds into the budget, so as to offer at least some support to their workers. And those who fulfill their commitments to the state can take out money for wages in the necessary quantities.
