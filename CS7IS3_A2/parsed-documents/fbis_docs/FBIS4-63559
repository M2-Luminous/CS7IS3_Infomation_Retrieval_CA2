They accused almost all Tiraspol leaders holding Russian passports of abusing their status as Russian citizens. The appeal follows compromising evidence against Tiraspol officials that the commanders have at their disposal. Military commander of Tiraspol Mikhail Bergman in an interview with INTERFAX accused regional leaders not only of financial irregularities and corruption, but also of uncontrolled distribution of weapons to dubious individuals and former criminals. "I am in possession of evidence indicating that a total of 908 units of firearms were handed over to different people under orders from President Igor Smirnov himself", he said. Bergman hopes that this and the local militants' involvement in last year's parliamentary revolt in Moscow will bring an immediate response from Moscow. Bergman also said that the Transdniestrian officials took advantage of their Russian citizenship to travel freely to the West where they keep secret accounts for money laundering. Smirnov himself has a total of 3.5 million dollars on his bank deposit in Austria withdrawing a further 1.5 million dollars from that account at the end of last year, according to Bergman. He said other Tiraspol leaders were no better.
