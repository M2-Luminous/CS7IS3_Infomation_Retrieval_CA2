The accord was signed at the Union Buildings by Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen, African National Congress National Chairman Thabo Mbeki and government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. Under the accord, constitutional provision is made for any community sharing a common cultural and language heritage, "whether in a territorial entity or in any other recognised way". The final constitution may now give expression to any form of self- determination provided there is substantial proven support within the community for self-determination. The accord constitutionally establishes a volkstaat council, which will gather and make available information regarding possible boundaries of the volkstaat, its powers and functions, and the constitutional relationship with government at national and regional level. The volkstaat council will be elected by members of parliament who support the establishment of a volkstaat. The Freedom Front will invite the public to nominate candidates to the council. A short list of possible appointees will be drawn up by a panel. After formal hearings and interviews, 20 "experts in their fields" will be appointed as councillors. The accord states the procedures in the constitution regarding the finalisation of present provincial boundaries should not be construed as precluding the establishment of the volkstaat. A national advisory body attached to the volkstaat council could be established, consisting of 25 representatives elected by local communities supporting the ideal. If a volkstaat is realised, this body will represent the communities in a volksraad [national council] of the volkstaat. Citizenship for people residing in a volkstaat will not be racially-based and shall be compatible with internationally-accepted norms. The accord also provides for further negotiations on Afrikaner self-determination after the election. The possibility of local, regional and other forms of self-determination will be considered. Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat will be indicated by the support gained in the election of parties with a mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat. Electoral support should not only be measured nationally, but also by counting votes at provincial level.
