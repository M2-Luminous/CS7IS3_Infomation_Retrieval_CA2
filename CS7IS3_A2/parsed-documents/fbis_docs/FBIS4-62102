This conclusion is contained in a report by experts of the State Ecological Commission of Russia's Ministry for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. The experts say that, even if the most pessimistic forecasts prove correct, the dose which could be received by man if the plutonium escapes into the environment is significantly less than the annual permissible maximum which the human body can absorb. The conclusions of the expert commission were released by the press center of Russia's Ministry for Natural Resources.
