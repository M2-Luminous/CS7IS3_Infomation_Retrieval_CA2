This view was expressed to journalists by the former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who is a member of the State Duma. He said it would be best if one of his deputies were to be appointed acting minister. Fedorov believes that such a person would be able, within certain limits, to keep the ship on course. At the same time he disclosed that two or three of his deputies and several departmental heads intend to leave the Finance Ministry in the near future.
