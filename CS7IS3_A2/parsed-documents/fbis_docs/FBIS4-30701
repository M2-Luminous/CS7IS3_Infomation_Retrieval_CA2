The increase rate, starting with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) which was 8 percent, was 6 percent for both low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), and 3 percent for polypropylene (PP). The four resins all have exceeded the same month of the previous year since November 1991. Production increased "because previously sluggish domestic demand recovered" (Petrochemical Industry Association). Viewing domestic shipment amounts, LDPE and HDPE each were the same as the same month of the previous year; PP increased 2 percent and PS increased 1 percent. That for electrical machinery, VTR's [video tape recorders], and others slumped, but that for television and air conditioners increased. In addition, that for wrapping material and sundries also increased. In exports, on the other hand, PS for Southeast Asia was favorable, but overall it leveled off, affected by the high yen. As a result, the total amount of shipments was at about the same level as the previous year for the four resins. Inventory is piling, up with regularly scheduled repairs to production facilities drawing close. Production of ethylene, which is the basic raw material of petrochemicals, was 519,700 tons, an increase of 6 percent compared to the same month of the previous year.
