FR941128-0-00012 FR941128-0-00005 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 12 CFR Part 346 RIN 3064&hyph;AA78 Foreign Banks AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC or Corporation). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The FDIC is amending its regulations concerning the permissible activities of state-licensed insured branches of foreign banks. Section 202 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (Improvement Act) provides that after December 19, 1992, a state-licensed insured branch of a foreign bank may not engage in any activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank unless the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) has determined that the activity is consistent with sound banking practice, and the FDIC has determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF). The amendments cover application procedures and divestiture or cessation plans. Foreign banks are required to seek both the FDIC's and the Board's approval for an insured state branch to engage in or continue to engage in an activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank. In the event such an application is denied or the foreign bank elects not to continue the activity, a plan of divestiture or cessation must be submitted and such divestiture or cessation must be completed within one year, or sooner if the FDIC so directs. EFFECTIVE DATE: The final regulation is effective January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles V. Collier, Assistant Director, Division of Supervision, (202) 898&hyph;6850; Jeffrey M. Kopchik, Counsel, Legal Division, (202) 898&hyph;3872; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20429. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this final rule has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control no. 3064&hyph;0114 pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Comments on the accuracy of the burden estimate, and suggestions for reducing the burden, should be directed to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3064&hyph;0114), Washington, D.C., 20503, with copies of such comments to Steven F. Hanft, Office of the Executive Secretary, Room F&hyph;453, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20429. The collections of information in this regulation are found in §§346.101(a), (d), (e) and (f) and take the form of a requirement that foreign banks (1) file an application with the FDIC requesting permission for an insured state branch to engage in or to continue engaging in any activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank and (2) submit a plan of divestiture or cessation in the event that the application is not approved, the foreign bank elects not to apply to the FDIC for permission to continue the activity, or a permissible activity becomes impermissible due to a subsequent change in statute, regulation or formal order or interpretation. The information contained in the application will allow the FDIC to properly discharge its responsibilities under section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101 et seq. ) (IBA), as amended by section 202 of the Improvement Act. The information in the application will be used by the FDIC as part of the process of determining whether conduct of the activity in question by the applicant will pose a significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund. The information in the divestiture or cessation plan will be used by the FDIC to make judgments concerning the reasonableness of the institution's actions to discontinue activities deemed to pose significant risk to the insurance fund.
