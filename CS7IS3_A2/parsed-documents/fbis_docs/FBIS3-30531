Following yesterday's two-hour warning strike in the partnership's six mines, a Protest Committee sponsored by "Solidarity," "Solidarity 80," and "Kontra" is sticking to its demands for a 15-percent salary increase. On the other hand, management says that the partnership cannot afford such an increase when you take into account, for instance, the fact that its financial obligations exceed claims it is entitled to by 2.2 trillion zlotys. To prove the argument is true, the management ordered that an expert economic analysis be conducted by the end of the week. The partnership's president proposes that in the meantime, both sides come up with mediators to provide assistance in salary negotiations which started at the beginning of the month. The Protest Committee informed the partnership's management that, if the talks fail, the committee will avail itself of Article 15 of the Trade Union Law--that would mean initiating a continuous strike. The headquarters of the Gliwice Coal Partnership [Gliwicka Spolka Weglowa] is also under occupation now, but this time it is by several dozen activists from "Solidarity 80." "Solidarity" has been supporting the strike since Tuesday [1 February]. The activists are demanding salary increases without, however, defining the limits of increases; they also demand an increase in the value of coal allowances (8 tons) from 850,000 zlotys to 1.35 million zlotys, which is the market price for coal. But the occupying trade unionists categorically reject one-time payments of 1.8 million zlotys to the partnership's miners. That increase is the result of a recent strike by activists of "August 80," which competes with "Solidarity 80." Talks with the partnership's management are under way. For its part, "Solidarity" organized two-hour warning strikes in the mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership [Bytomska Spolka Weglowa] on Wednesday. The strikes went on from 0600 to 0700 in six mines; there were strikes until 0800 in two mines, and there were no strikes at all in three other mines. An open demonstration was announced in "Jowisz" mine before the second shift. About 600 employees of the Bytom Mining Enterprise are on strike. They are occupying the management's building. The strike is sponsored by "Solidarity" and by the Miners Trade Union. The trade unionists are demanding salary increases.
