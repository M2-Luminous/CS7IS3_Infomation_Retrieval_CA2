In a news conference at the Interior Ministry today, the interior minister added that the allegations that prisons are full of detainees are baseless. Only those who committed criminal actions are in prison, and no prisoner is detained without a decision by the general prosecutor. He said public liberties in Jordan are preserved in a democratic atmosphere that is unique in the region. Hammad said that detention measures, including those who committed the crimes of explosions in public places, have been carried out in accordance with the law and within the framework of legal procedures.
