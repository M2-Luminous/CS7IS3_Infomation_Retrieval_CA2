FR940106-2-00066 FR940106-2-00035 As noted above, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 but before October 1, 1995, a SNF's cost limit will be its latest routine cost limit for the period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 and before October 1, 1993, as calculated under the October 7, 1992 notice and without regard to any subsequent adjustments, such as an exception to the limit. Thus, if the SNF in the above example received an exception to its cost limit for its cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1993, its cost limit for the cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1994 would not include the exception amount for the previous period. To receive an exception or other adjustment to its cost limit, the SNF would need to submit a request to its fiscal intermediary in accordance with the procedures set forth in ยง413.30 of the regulations. B. Periods Other Than 12 Months The above methodology applies to providers with cost reporting periods of 12 months in duration. If a facility's cost reporting period is not 12 months in duration, a special adjustment factor is calculated. This is necessary because inflation projections are computed to the midpoint of a cost reporting period, and the adjustment factors in Table IV are based on 12-month reporting periods. For cost reporting periods of other than 12 months, the calculation must be made based on the midpoint of the specific cost reporting period. The SNF's intermediary obtains this adjustment factor from HCFA central office. This methodology results in a different cost limit than if a 12-month adjustment factor were used. However, since the provisions of OBRA '93 require no changes in the cost limit on or after October 1, 1993, the limit calculated with the special adjustment factor will remain in place for subsequent cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1995. C. Providers Entering the Medicare Program For providers entering the Medicare program on or after October 1, 1993 and before October 1, 1995, the applicable cost limit will be the cost limit for the identical period beginning on or after October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1993. For example, if a provider enters the Medicare program on September 1, 1994, with a 12-month cost reporting period, its cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September 1, 1993 and ending August 30, 1994. If the provider's cost reporting period is a short period beginning September 1, 1994 and ending December 31, 1994, the provider's cost limit will be determined in the same manner as a cost limit for a period beginning September 1, 1993 and ending December 31, 1993. In addition, whether the first period is a full 12-month period or a period other than 12 months, the cost limit determined for the first period will remain in effect until the provider's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1995. D. Next Update of Limits As discussed above, before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(a) of the Act required that the SNF routine cost limits be updated on October 1, 1992 and every 2 years thereafter. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 amended this section to delay the next update until October 1, 1995, and every 2 years thereafter. Accordingly, there will be no changes to the routine cost limits published in the October 7, 1992 notice for inflation, changes in the wage index, geographic designation, or for a more recent data base until October 1, 1995. E. Add-On for Hospital-Based SNFs Before the enactment of OBRA '93, section 1888(b) of the Act provided for an add-on to recognize the cost differences between hospital-based and freestanding SNFs attributable to excess overhead allocations, that is, an add-on for the administrative and general costs (A&G) of hospital-based SNFs. Section 13503(a)(3) of OBRA '93 amended this section of the Act to repeal the requirement that we recognize cost differences attributable to excess overhead allocations. Therefore, this notice implements that provision by eliminating the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs. In addition, while section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 requires that there be no changes in the cost limits, as explained above, it also states that the provision does not apply to the elimination of the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs. Therefore, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, we will no longer apply the administrative and general add-on for hospital-based SNFs as shown in Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of limits. The intermediary will continue to determine the cost limits for hospital-based SNFs using the relevant instructions and Table I SNF Group Limits, as described in the October 7, 1992 notice. However, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, these limits will be calculated without using the A&G add-on. The example below uses information from Table I of the October 7, 1992 schedule of limits to calculate a cost limit for a hospital-based SNF located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The cost limit is for a cost reporting period beginning October 1, 1993. However, as discussed above, the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs is no longer applied, and the cost limit effective October 1, 1992 remains in effect for the cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1993.
