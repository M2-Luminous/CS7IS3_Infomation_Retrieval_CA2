During the meeting attempts will be made to find solutions to the public order problems that have occurred during the past weeks in the border region. These problems include the death of several Ecuadoran soldiers, which are believed to have been caused by the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNGSB]. Colombian Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman pointed out that during this meeting, which will be held behind closed doors, they will attempt to establish the accuracy of reports circulating in Colombia. These reports are related to Ecuadoran Army units arresting several Colombian peasants on Colombian territory and accusing them of being guerrilla members. Likewise, the meeting is intended to "formulate plans against guerrilla and criminal activities in the border region between both countries," Gen. Guzman emphasized. The officer also pointed out that the meeting constitutes part of the agreements signed several weeks ago by both countries' defense ministers.
