Through this image, one certainly understands not only opinions about Romania of today but also about the Romanians as a nation. Therefore, the left-wing coalition, sprinkled with nationalism, has protested against Romania being presented abroad either as a bloodthirsty nation or a nation of profiteers. From this point of view, the criticism of certain exaggerated adventures of some of our fellow citizens abroad was more than justified. On the basis of the fact that in who knows what capital city of the world, a Romanian has been caught stealing something, the conclusion often drawn is that the Romanians are a nation of petty thieves. Less justified were the explanations given by the government coalition for the bad image of Romanians in the world. The domestic and foreign press were accused of practicing falsifications and exaggeration. The pro-government and pro- presidential correspondents have carried out quite a few attacks against the so-called defamation of the Romanian realities by the domestic press, which is sold to the enemies of the country. It is not excluded that the international press has also played a certain role in establishing our image as a nation. In the search for a sensation, it sometimes chooses something that is shocking in the life of a nation or a country. However, the major responsibility for the negative image, with which the name of Romania is associated in the world, should be sought elsewhere, namely some of the current actions of the ruling coalition -- that is, precisely the force that is complaining everywhere about the distortion of our image abroad. A ominous example in this respect is the stand of the Romanian officials regarding the fulfillment of conditions that were set to us when we were admitted to the Council of Europe. When the famous amendments to the admittance documents were formulated, we stood at attention and shouted more than the gentle soldier Svejk: Yes, sir! We pledge to fulfill them and overfulfill them! Since they are serious people who know what a pledge means, the Council of Europe admitted us. However, they pointed it out, in a polite but firm manner, that the amendments must be implemented in Romania's social and political life. At that time, they could not imagine that anything else might happen except that after our admittance to the Council of Europe, we would immediately and enthusiastically start implementing the solemnly made commitments. At that time, I was among the analysts who issued a warning -- namely, that we should not play with fire. Some of the amendments -- we said then -- were absurd. They expressed the aberrant tendency of West Europe to impose rigidly its own living standards on the specific realities prevailing in East Europe. Thus, I was saying that it would have been much better if we had stated that we would not be able to fulfill all the conditions. Maybe we would not have been admitted to the Council of Europe, but we would have been much more honest, more correct, and, mainly, much closer to the national interest. All this, because it would be much more serious if the West had created an image about us as a nation that does not know how to keep its word than not admit us into the Council of Europe. Since we have been accepted, considering that we gave our solemn word, we should by all means start fulfilling the conditions set by the Council of Europe. My warning was based on a suspicion -- that the Romanian officials do not intend to do anything toward the implementation of those amendments. When we were admitted to the Council of Europe, we acted in accordance with our old Dimbovita [river crossing Bucharest] style -- that is, "We say as they say, but we do as we want." Unfortunately, my suspicion has been justified. After we had been accepted to the Council of Europe -- that is, after we crossed the bridge -- we did nothing to fulfill our promise. In Strasbourg recently, our parliamentary delegation was placed in an uncomfortable situation. When asked about the stage of implementation of the respective amendments, the delegation had to hum and how, stammer in embarrassment, and even lie. Considering that the people at the Council of Europe are very polite, they did not tell us what they thought about our attitude. However, I am sure that, among themselves, they thought immediately about the accusations voiced against us -- that we are a nation of cunning and boasting people who promise a lot and do nothing. Then, is it not natural to ask who is contributing to the negative image that is circulating in the world about the Romanian people?
