Fekete; place and date not given: "Banana, Orange, and Tie -- Viktor Orban on the Fidesz's Chances"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] In spite of the cooperation agreement between the parties of the liberal bloc, serious tensions are straining relations between these parties. Some people believe to know that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has given up on the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] as an ally and it is opening toward the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] that appears to have more chance at the elections. According to some politicians, the two biggest liberal parties are now only trying to find an excuse to terminate the liberal bloc's agreement. [Orban] We will never have perfect tranquillity in the liberal bloc, after all, we are also rivals of each other at the elections. The question is whether the parties' chairmen will have enough wisdom and strength to convince their membership about the significance and importance of the cooperation. If the parties' chairmen do not find the right proportion between competition and cooperation then the liberal bloc might fall apart. In my view, similar debates and tensions exist between the conservative parties, and they will probably also happen in the left-wing bloc. As for the other half of the question, namely that the SZDSZ has "given up" the Fidesz and is seeking cooperation with the Socialists, I do not believe this. For the SZDSZ, a break with the SZDSZ and cooperation with the MSZP at the same time would result in a party split. Considering the SZDSZ's membership in the provinces, this would lead to the party's disintegration. This is not in the interest of either the Fidesz or the SZDSZ. [Fekete] Although the party leaders do not like to enter into coalition speculations, the voters are interested in which parties would be willing to govern together. At the same time, your statements indicate that, apart from the parties of the liberal bloc, namely the SZDSZ, the Agrarian Federation, and the Entrepreneurs Party, the Fidesz does not have any other possible coalition partners. [Orban] A strange situation has arisen because almost all parties -- including the MSZP and the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] -- claim that the Fidesz is a possible coalition partner for them while we emphasize our distance from both these parties. With the approach of the elections, it is unwise to enter into coalition speculations, but I believe that we can and must talk about moral dilemmas. It is obvious that a significant number of the electors want to replace the current coalition. In view of this, the thought that we would still have to work together with one or other party of the current coalition after the elections can expect to meet with serious resistance within our party and among the electors, too. On the other hand, our membership would resist it just as much if we had to cooperate and work together with those who are the legal successors of the party that is responsible for the economic destruction of the country. When we know the final results of the elections, if this question is still valid then, we will convene the Fidesz's appropriate decision-making bodies, the national committee or the congress, and we will discuss the future. One thing is certain: The Fidesz cannot participate in a coalition in which it cannot implement the most important elements of its program. On the other hand, all politicians have delicate points. On 16 June 1989, at the burial of Imre Nagy, I made a speech and I cannot deviate from the spirit of this, whether I am thinking about the Fidesz's coalition possibilities or my own role. [Fekete] Does this mean that you exclude the possibility of a Fidesz-MSZP coalition or that you personally would not participate in this government? [Orban] I have formulated principles. The consequences of these in a given situation will be made public when we are facing this given situation. [Fekete] Do you have similar commitments as regards cooperation with the MDF? During the blockade of the taxi drivers, you publicly called the government a liar. [Orban] The speech I have mentioned before was about the future, rather than on relations with the MDF, the MSZP, or any other party. [Fekete] Earlier, the Fidesz indicated that, from the Fidesz's point of view, the assessment of the MSZP partly depends on whether Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary] or Laszlo Bekesi [economic expert] is higher up on their national list. However, according to economic observers, the Fidesz's economic policy, the half turn, is closer to Sandor Nagy's views than to Bekesi's.... [Orban] The Fidesz's program lays the main emphasis on economic growth, therefore, it is a program that creates workplaces. On this point, Nagy's goals certainly coincide with those of the Fidesz. Therefore, we would have a good chance to coordinate our goals with the trade unions. However, we have significant differences on how this goal can be achieved. As early as 1990, the Fidesz suggested that the parliamentary parties and the interest groups of the employers and employees should sit down at a negotiating table and agree on the rules to be followed during the period of economic transition. We have not given up this idea and, if we are given the opportunity to govern after the elections, we intend to make a Hungarian Moncloa pact. Without this, and without cooperation with the trade unions, it would be much more difficult to put the Hungarian economy on a growth course.
