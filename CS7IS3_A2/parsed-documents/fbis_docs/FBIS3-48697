Takemura and Prime Minister Hosokawa have worked closely since they served as governors and can now be considered as being on a honeymoon. Takemura is an indispensable member of the Hosokawa administration. However, it is said that his relations have soured with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ozawa, a key backstage player in the coalition government. As the political world approaches a second restructuring, Mr. Takemura must be watched closely. New Nagata-cho Triangle Consisting of Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Takemura Some quarters equate the non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] coalition government as the "eight-headed reptile of Japan." They must be referring to the eight leaders of the seven parties and one group comprising the coalition. However, the eight-headed reptile itself is aware that it possesses only one torso and that if the eight completely differing leaders opt to act in accordance with their own ideas, the torso of the reptile will split into eight separate pieces. That is the very reason why every effort is made to avoid such a situation. The only reason why the Hosokawa government has survived for three months despite it being called fragile as glass is that the respective parties making up the coalition government earnestly restrain themselves against over-asserting their positions in the execution of the coalition government's policies. However, notwithstanding such a stance, no progress whatsoever can be made unless someone serves as the policy administrator and power center for the government. The individuals who have assumed that role comprise the "trio" of Morihiro Hosokawa and Masayoshi Takemura, presidents of the Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake, respectively, and Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, all of whom were former members of the LDP. It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura are now on a honeymoon. According to a Sakigake official, the two were on intimate terms during their days as governors and are "close to being eternal friends." In terms of the composition of the government, Takemura has assumed the role of right-hand man and chief cabinet secretary, but understands that he is basically a sworn friend of Hosokawa. Thus, there are occasions when Takemura makes a decision for the government and Hosokawa follows up on the situation with his approval. However, cracks have begun to appear in the honeymoon relationship between Hosokawa-Takemura and Ozawa, who plays a backstage role. One feels that the vulnerability of the coalition government in the absence of a true leader or commander-in-chief, in a benign sense, is beginning to gradually expose itself at this point. As an example, Takemura and Ozawa clashed head-on in their assertions during the compilation of the government's draft of the political reform law which constitutes the Hosokawa government's leading critical issue. Concerning the balloting method for the combined proportional representation electoral district system, Takemura and his Sakigake, which favors a moderate multiparty system, advocate a two-vote coded system and during a public television program, Takemura spontaneously expressed his true feelings by saying, "If I were to have a choice, I would prefer a two-vote system." However, that statement upset Ozawa in that he is of the feeling that, "We have no choice but to adopt the one-vote system if we are going to realize a two-major-party system." Ozawa promptly summoned Takemura to a meeting of the leaders of the various political parties which the former veritably controls and admonished the latter severely by stating, "It was truly imprudent of you as the chief cabinet secretary to publicly speak in favor of a two-vote system when we haven't even decided on a government position!" Secretary Ichikawa of Komeito, who is a sworn ally of Ozawa and who was attending the meeting, fired an endorsing volley by adding, "Mr. Takemura should gracefully apologize." At that moment, it seemed as if Takemura had been completely crushed by the Shinseito-Komeito alliance. However, when Takemura returned to the Prime Minister's Residence, he displayed his anger by saying, "It is only natural that a variety of views are expressed during the development of important policies. My statements on television were expressions of views made as head of Sakigake." And, he is said to have mumbled, "If this sort of situation persists, Ozawa and I just might part ways eventually." That episode marks the beginning of the Takemura-Ozawa war. This just might be a case where the seniority system concept of the LDP era reared its ugly head in Ozawa's mind, wherein he feels, "I may be junior in age to Takemura but I am now a veteran Diet man reelected for a ninth term in the House of Representatives. As a three-term Diet man, Takemura has no right to speak that way." However, even if Takemura were classified as a three-term Diet man, he is nonetheless undeniably one of the "eight heads of the Japanese reptile," and we should interpret this situation not as an emotional confrontation between two individuals, but a confrontation of political concepts of Shinseito and Sakigake. Takemura Outmaneuvered by Ozawa on the "Prime Minister Hosokawa" Concept It is said that Takemura did not favor a coalition government as it exists today. It is said that Takemura had favored a "nationwide unified coalition cabinet," excluding the Communist Party, lead by former Minister of Justice Masaharu Gotoda who had served as examining officer when Takemura was hired by the Ministry of Home Affairs, if a coalition was to be formed, and that Hosokawa had also concurred in such an approach. Reputedly, the horizontal ties of bureaucrats who previously served with the Ministry of Home Affairs are very strong. There was one more factor that influenced Takemura's ideas. When he was a member of the LDP, he served as chief of the administrative bureau of the Political Reform Headquarters when Gotoda served as its acting chief, and he also embraces political ideas in common with those of Gotoda. Takemura mobilized the assistance of Hiroshi Mitsuzuka who once led his own faction and currently serves as LDP Political Reform Headquarters chief and junior members of that former faction and attempted to "talk Gotoda into the idea of becoming the coalition leader," but Gotoda would not agree for fear of his unstable health. As soon as an overwhelming victory by the non-LDP camp became evident after the general election of 18 July, a movement gained momentum and it appeared a consensus had been formed among the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United Social Democratic Party to support President Tsutomu Hata (currently deputy prime minister and foreign minister) of Shinseito to lead the new government. However, unexpectedly stubborn reaction arose against Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa on the part of the Japan New Party and Sakigake, and it created a situation in which it would be impossible to unify the non-LDP forces under a "Hata government." At that time, this writer spoke with several officials of the two parties and found that sentiment against Ozawa was unexpectedly stubborn and one of them even said, "We should not become a part of the government even if it is born as either an LDP or non-LDP government." Takemura himself once made his cautious stance toward Mr. Ozawa obvious when during a television interview, he said, "I like Mr. Hata, but Mr. Ozawa... I don't dislike." Ozawa, who sensed a crisis, met secretly deep into the night with Hosokawa in a Tokyo hotel four days after the election on the 22d and strongly urged the latter to accept nomination as leader of the coalition. Ozawa is quoted as saying, "Our idea is to make you prime minister. If you would accept the nomination, a non-LDP government will be created for the first time in 38 years. Among members of the SDPJ and DSP are some who oppose a Hosokawa leadership, but this is an issue that I will resolve responsibly." Hosokawa sharply intensified his non-LDP stance following this discussion. An official of the Japan New Party commented, "The JNP president, who had seemed to be preoccupied by something, suddenly came alive, making me promptly feel that something exciting took place." We cannot deny the fact that the general public was very skeptical about the irresolute attitude taken by the Japan New Party and Sakigake which preferred venturing over a third course, just when "non-LDP" was developing into a key word following the general election. It may have been only logical that Hosokawa gave Ozawa an affirmative reply in view of the needs posed by the times, but according to an official of Sakigake, Takemura must have felt extremely chagrined at the fact that he was "brilliantly outmaneuvered by Ozawa." However, Takemura proved he was quick at altering his stance, proving his mettle as a former bureaucrat. As soon as a policy consensus was formed among the seven non-LDP parties and one group, he wasted no time solidifying his position by leaking to the mass media that, "I have been asked by Mr. Hosokawa to be his chief cabinet secretary. It is said that Ozawa wanted to make Takemura minister of home affairs or minister in charge of political reform and nominate his confidants Hiroshi Kumagai or Hajime Funada as chief cabinet secretary, but in this respect Takemura revenged himself with brilliance. Further, Takemura embarked on a project to staff the Prime Minister's Residence with members of "Sakigake." He Was Quick To Change Political Positions Even When He Was Governor First, the candidate for deputy chief cabinet secretary was changed from a nominee belonging to Shinseito to Yukio Hatoyama. According to a JNP official, "It had been agreed that Shusei Tanaka who is intimate with the prime minister would be appointed to a deputy chief cabinet secretary position," but it appears Tanaka had declined the appointment. That's when the opportunity arose for Hatoyama. Several days after completing work on cabinet appointments, Hosokawa decided on a plan to adopt the U.S. special assistant system and appoint Tanaka to such a post. According to Tanaka, "I had thought that I would rather not accept an appointment to the executive level this time around, but I decided to accept because of an urgent plea from Hosokawa and a recommendation from party president Takemura." Thus, work was completed on the formation of a team to firmly surround Prime Minister Hosokawa in the Prime Minister's Residence with appointees from Sakigake. It is true that Ozawa and Shinseito officials had strong dissatisfaction about these appointments, but midlevel Diet members of Shinseito have interpreted the situation as, "Since the Japan New Party and Sakigake do not have members besides Hosokawa and Takemura who are qualified to hold cabinet posts, it is unavoidable that they monopolize posts just below the cabinet level." No stories have been heard about complaints being lodged by Ozawa because of this situation, but it appears as if he is quick to forgive and forget as a matter of personality. Now we direct our thoughts to Takemura, who is not as well known as Hosokawa or Ozawa. It has been only seven years since he first entered central government service by being first elected to the House of Representatives in 1986. If he had remained in the LDP, he'd still be treated as a junior Diet man. The best position he could hope for would be appointment to the post of a committee chairman of the Political Research Council. However, many of the Diet men who were elected to office after the Prime Minister Nakasone double elections in 1986 were exposed to and harbor a feeling of crisis about "Nagato-cho politics" plagued by a series of scandals such as Recruit, Kyowa, and Sagawa. Takemura is not an exception, and when the Recruit scandal broke out, he took the initiative in forming the "Utopia Study Group" composed of one- and two-year Diet men and embarked on political reform. It just so happens that when I conversed with Takemura during an interview for another magazine, he made a subtle statement hinting at the formation of a new party and reorganization of the government which I will introduce at this point. "Recently, I have come to feel that confidence cannot be restored unless we undertake a movement to execute a bold reform of the political world and the LDP--priority of which comes first is immaterial---which the general public can intimately sense as having taken place or is in the process of taking place, because we would be taking only part of the required actions if measures were restricted only to election system reform." And, in reference to the status of future political reorganization, he said, "During the next two to three years, as a minimum, we will probably see a number of movements to include a period in which the political world will assume two major flows or reorganize into two major political parties." At that point at the beginning of this year, Takemura may have already been visualizing establishment of Sakigake, with the Utopia Study Group as a foundation. This writer occasionally travels to Shiga Prefecture to give lectures, but comments by prefecture residents generally appraise him as being "quick to change positions." When I recently visited Otsu, a taxi driver made a statement which could be interpreted as a joke or sarcasm saying, "His actions should be described as `overtaking from behind' rather than `serving as a harbinger.'" It is said, "The wise change themselves to fit changed circumstances. Midgets change their masks." Just as the beauty of a leopard's fur is improved through shedding and renewal, politicians should be allowed to undergo transformation if such action will empower them to embark on new achievements. If one asks individuals who are close to Takemura for their opinion of his characteristics, the reply is, "He is a politician whose future is ahead of him, but he is not an opportunist that fits the so-called orthodox definition of the word. Sources in Shiga Province say that when Takemura was governor of Shiga, he placed a "great amount of importance on the concerns of the prefecture's citizens and common people." Such a stance cannot be appreciated without knowing Takemura's childhood days. "Utopia Study Group" Served as Prototype for Sakigake!? In comparison to the fact that 40 percent of the current Diet members are second-generation Diet men, Takemura, the second son among six children of a poor farm family, lost his parents early in life and was forced to work himself up from the depths of poverty. The influence of such a background inspired him to become an obsessive reader of books on subjects such as Marxist capitalism and Engels' communist doctrine, making him a follower of Marxism. It seems that Takemura's rebellious disposition was acquired from those days of his early life. Although he passed the senior national public service tests with flying colors, he chose to join the Ministry of Home Affairs. Even such a choice was very typical of Takemura. The Ministry of Home Affairs serves as the overall supervisory agency for local governments, but on the other hand, according to a former bureau chief of the ministry, "It also serves as the agency that conveys the opinions of local governments to the central government, providing for a long-existing `tradition' wherein it and the central government are placed in a contentious situation." It is probably because of such tradition that many politicians who were formerly employed by the Ministry of Home Affairs or the former Ministry of Internal Affairs possess a rebellious, antiestablishment characteristic, unlike most bureaucrats. As examples, former Diet men of the Ministry of Home Affairs include the late Yoshimi Furui and Kokichi Nadao, and current Diet members formerly of the ministry include Seisuke Okuno and Masaharu Gotoda, while Takemura is of the same lineage. However, Takemura cast aside his career as a government official in his seventh year with the ministry and became mayor of Yokaichi city, his birthplace. At that time, he was only 37 years of age. Later, Takemura became governor of Shiga Prefecture after a unique election campaign. In that election, Takemura negotiated the support of four reformist, middle-of-the-road parties--the SDPJ, Komeito, DSP, and USDP--(excluding the LDP) and four labor organizations including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan [Sohyo] and Japanese Confederation of Labor [Domei]. At that time in 1974, it would have not been unusual for a reformist candidate to use that kind of support, but it was a first for a conservative on a nationwide basis and became the center of much attention. Takemura virtually ran as a reformist candidate and won the election after defeating an LDP-recommended candidate. There is the proverb which says, "The child is the father of the man," but it may have been a case where young 40-year-old Governor Takemura's soul was being influenced by his readings of Marxism as a young boy. The posture then taken by Takemura in the form of a "grassroots prefectural government" emphasizing the interests of the citizens seems to have something in common with the political ideals of today's Sakigake Party. Probably the main accomplishment of the three-term, 12-year administration of the Takemura prefectural government was the establishment of the 1979 Eutrophication Prevention Ordinance aimed at purifying the waters of Lake Biwa. That ordinance banned the use and sale of domestic synthetic detergents (discharge of phosphorous contained in detergent causes increases in bacteria, attendant advances in red tides, and eventual pollution of lake waters), provided for the control of factory discharges and was considered epochal for the times. The ordinance also provided a fine of less than 200,000 yen for violations of the discharge restrictions. Needless to say, detergent manufacturers waged a fierce battle against the ordinance, but Takemura succeeded in getting the ordinance passed with the support of consumer groups and reformist organizations. Aside from that ordinance, Takemura engineered the establishment of so-called "scenic ordinances" aimed at protecting scenic areas. This type of ordinance is now being established in prefectures throughout the nation as if it were a logical thing to do, but the Shiga prefecture case became a forerunner for the nation. "Environmentalist Takemura" won the strong support of prefectural citizens and won his second and third terms as governor with the support of the LDP and all other parties exclusive of the Communist Party unopposed. It is said that Takemura pondered extensively whether he should run as an LDP candidate for the Diet lower house in the midst of his third term as governor. According to sources at the Shiga Prefecture government office, he applied for recognition as a member of the Abe faction of the LDP, although "he was initially planning to run as an unaligned `Prefectural Citizen Party' candidate." Masayoshi Takemura garnered the attention of the central government circles because he organized the "Utopia Study Group with 20 members." According to Takemura, he launched a study group for young Diet men with the "idea of preserving utopian ideals in politics while advocating reform" as soon as the Recruit scandal surfaced in summer 1989. He alarmed the public by disclosing the political funds balance sheets of all members of the group showing that even "first-year Diet men required an annual average of 100 million yen in political funds." When one notes that six of the 13 members of Sakigake are former members of this Utopia Study Group, it is not difficult to realize that Takemura used the council as an experiment for Sakigake. In his jointly authored book, titled Rise of Junior Warriors of Nagata-cho, compiled by the Utopia Study Group, Takemura relates, "The aim here is to mutually cherish our initial aspirations to become politicians and remain pragmatic forever while upholding our ideals." Little Politician Overcomes Big Politicians and Becomes "Takeo Miki" of Heisei Era There once was a politician named Takeo Miki (former prime minister), but Miki like Takemura was a politician who battled with authority in terms of idealism and reality and survived as a politician. He was a politician who would pursue idealism to the extreme limits, but once he sensed he could no longer persist in such an approach, he would not forget to reverse gears and quickly compromise with reality. At one time, politicians ridiculed Miki as a "Balkan politician," but there was no denying that Miki as a small political force (immediately following World War II, Miki was president of the People's Collaboration Party, a middle- of-the-road party) used a technique which explored ways and means of overpowering major political parties and control the casting vote. It could be that Takemura is the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei era." As the leader of a small force of 13 and as a pragmatic politician with ideals, this is indeed a case of how Takemura will exercise his skills in forming a new political current as he maneuvers among strong forces such as the LDP, Shinseito, and Komeito. Now, Takemura's political schedule, as manager of the coalition government, for the period after November is filled with a number of mentally wrenching issues. Above all matters, the important issue pending now is political reform, but a midterm issue is the fundamental reform of the current tax system. The list of pending issues is endless, starting with the review of direct and indirect taxation ratios emanating from the report submitted by the Tax System Research Council, measures to be taken to cope with the stubborn recession and income tax reductions and the settlement of the Uruguay Round talks by the end of the year. Among them, an issue of supreme priority for resolution by yearend, in accordance with Prime Minister Hosokawa's public pledge, is political reform which is the raison d'etre for the current government. Now that an agreement has been reached with seven parties, in the event an agreement to the SDPJ-proposed amendment cannot be obtained, there is the possibility of a forced vote to win passage of the original draft. Sources close to Takemura reveal, "We believe he will call for yearend dissolution of the cabinet and January elections, if this session of the Diet fails to produce a political reform measure." They are saying that his determination is very strong. Now, in Nagata-cho, there is speculation that movements will be stirred for political restructuring when the political reform laws are passed and when general elections are held to implement the new election system. The initial restructuring is expected between the first part of November when the bills pass the House of Representatives if the legislative actions go smoothly and the latter part of December. This Diet session most likely will undergo an extension for two weeks beginning at the scheduled end of the session on 15 December. The potential has increased for another split in the LDP and the surfacing of a movement for a split in the SDPJ in connection with a revision and compromise concerning the political reform bills. And, incipient movements of the foregoing nature suddenly surfaced in October. It appears that a young group including Masayasu Kitagawa and Michihiko Kano who belong to the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction have been making frequent contacts with Takemura, Kisaburo Tokai, and Hiroyuki Sonoda of the Sakigake Party and former members of the Mitsuzuka faction. It is well known that Kitagawa and his group had moved to support Takemura and Gotoda as prime minister candidates until the non-LDP government was formed. Further, 47 members of the "group to create a new LDP" sponsored by Seiichi Ota and Shokei Arai of the LDP who just resigned from their factions have approached Sakigake and Shinseito and are said to be ready to secede from the LDP if passage of the reform bill is placed at risk during either the House of Representatives or House of Councilors proceedings. Officials of the group who met with this writer have said, "In that event, it will not be a case of defeating the opposition at great risk, but we will have no choice but to make a crucial decision with a focus on realizing the passage of the political reform bills within the year." Further, the LDP Political Reform Promotion Parliamentarian League (chaired by former Prime Minister Kaifu; over 160 members) has confirmed its intent at passage by yearend and that, if members of the executive department of the LDP should stubbornly resist political reform to the very end, according to officials of the alliance, they will resolutely separate themselves from the party conservatives and "form a new LDP and act as a party within a party." On the other hand, even in the SDPJ, a group of 20 to 30 conservatives who are absolutely against adoption of a small electoral district system have shown signs of forming a new force by the end of the year, indicating that both conservative and reformist forces are determined to secede and reorganize. Farewell to Ozawa, Who Embraces Different Policy Concepts and Political Methods We should not overlook the fact that, along with movements of the foregoing nature, differences in political ideas and basic policy are becoming obvious among the coalition parties and within the LDP and that situation and its subtle effect on the introduction of a new election system just may instigate a reorganization of the political world. Of special note is that the LDP has suffered a conspicuous drop in appeal with the appointment of President Kono, projects an image of century-end chaos and the appearance of rapid acceleration of the party dismantling process. The conceptual confrontation between the Kono group which favors preservation of the current Constitution and former Foreign Minister Watanabe who favors constitutional revision is now a decisive one, while the blueprint for the next political restructuring has been made clear in the eyes of the public through Kono's Diet statements during representative questioning in which he circuitously criticized Ozawa, who aims for a mini-super power, and expressed support for the constitutional preservation stance of Hosokawa and Takemura. To begin with, 17 years ago, when Kono formed the Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club, Hosokawa was the first individual that the former recruited for membership among members of the House of Councilors and had listed him as a member when he announced formation of the club. However, the club encountered the opposition of Kakuei Tanaka, then leader of the LDP, and the idea of including Hosokawa as a club member had to be abandoned at the last minute. It would not be strange for the two with very close ideas to unite some time in the future. Further, Tsuneo Suzuki, former member of the House of Representatives, who has served as President Kono's secretary and has worked with Kono on political actions ever since the Shinjiyu Club days, has been a member of the Utopia Study Group ever since its inception and, according to an official of Sakigake, in response to solicitations to join Sakigake during the last general election, "He pondered the invitation extensively, but chose to remain loyal to Mr. Kono." However, he is very close to Takemura. Also, Tanaka, who is the prime minister's special assistant, once belonged to the Shinjiyu Club, has ideas that are similar to those of Kono and Suzuki, and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama expressed views which are in agreement with those of Takemura and Suzuki during Utopia Study Group sessions. Kunio Hatoyama, former minister of education and younger brother of the senior Hatoyama, is now unaffiliated in terms of political party, but he once was elected to the House of Representatives on the recommendation of the Shinjiyu Club. Additionally, it is reported that Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives Heisuke Kujiraoka, former director general of the Environmental Agency, was strongly recommended by Kono, Suzuki, and Hosokawa for his present position. It is quite possible that the core of a new political force will be formed in one or two years embracing constitutional preservation and antinationalism and composed of the current staff of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the LDP Kono group and the Doi-Kujiraoka group in the House of Representatives. On the other hand, we can anticipate formation of a new group centered on individuals who seek constitutional revision with Ozawa as leader and including former Foreign Minister Watanabe; Kozo Watanabe, acting president of Shinseito; Mutsuki Kato, former LDP Political Research Council and currently unaffiliated in terms of political party; Takeo Nishioka, former minister of education; and Toshio Yamaguchi, former minister of labor. It is said that Takemura's opinion is that "the Hosokawa government will last until the next general election." Takemura is currently contemplating a parting of ways with Ozawa's Shinseito, whose policy concepts and political methods are entirely different, before or after the next general election, which is expected to take place at the earliest after the spring of 1995. In that event, there is the possibility that Takemura and his Sakigake will avoid a unified faction composed of non-LDP elements and advocated by Ozawa and launch a separate election campaign. Takemura once told this writer, "I would like to work towards a goal of creating politics that is not deeply influenced by the obsolete sensitivities of Nagata-cho." In this regard, it appears that the future political objective of the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei era" will be to reinforce his contacts and affiliations with junior and reformist groups of the LDP and the junior members of the SDPJ in applying diversionary tactics against Ozawa's Shinseito, ultimately form a new party of 50 or so members, and become a core element in a coalition government based on a new framework. It will be then that Takemura who as an idealistic but pragmatic politician will demonstrate his true capabilities.
