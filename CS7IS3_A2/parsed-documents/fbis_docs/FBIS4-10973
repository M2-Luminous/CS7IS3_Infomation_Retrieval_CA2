FBIS4-10973 "drlat077__a94012" FBIS-LAT-94-077-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Brazil Court Assigns 10 Federal Deputies to Sao Paulo Court Assigns 10 Federal Deputies to Sao Paulo PY1504013694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 14 Apr 94 p 4 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1504013694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia -- In a plenary session held on 12 April, the Superior Electoral Court [TSE] confirmed that the number of federal deputies to be elected for Sao Paulo State will increase from 60 to 70. The TSE did not change, however, the number of federal deputies to be elected for other states. Thus, Sao Paulo State voters will elect 10 more federal deputies in October. If the proportional system established in Supplementary Law No. 78 of 30 December 1993 was to be fully applied, states like Rio de Janeiro, Parana, and Espirito Santo should lose a deputy each, while Bahia State should win three deputies and Minas Gerais two deputies. But the TSE decided to change only the number of deputies for Sao Paulo State, based on that law, which provides that "the largest state will be represented by 70 federal deputies." The TSE made this decision unanimously after ruling that Article 4 of the temporary provisions (which referred to the 1990 elections) is valid and thus endorsed the position that the blocs of federal deputies will not be changed during the first legislature following the issuance of the supplementary law. The aforementioned law, which implements the constitutional rule that the number of federal deputies will be proportional to the population of each state, was not approved until late last year and was not published until 5 January. The law thus will be applicable only to the 1998 elections. In addition to increasing the number of federal deputies in the state, Sao Paulo voters also will be able to elect more state deputies in October, that is, 90 deputies.
