After the talk concluded, Chinese representative Chen Zuoer indicated that to encourage the Hong Kong people who have emigrated to other areas to return to Hong Kong, the Chinese side will leniently handle the question of the right of residence for these people. Chen Zuoer said: The Chinese side welcomes Hong Kong's permanent residents of Chinese nationality who have emigrated to, and become citizens of, a foreign country to return to serve Hong Kong, because they are familiar with Hong Kong and many are experienced specialized professionals. Their return after emigrating will demonstrate that they still have feelings toward Hong Kong and China. He stressed: To encourage Hong Kong emigrants to return, the Chinese side will adopt a fairly lenient measure to handle the question of the right of residence for those who return. However, this is to help those who return to continue serving Hong Kong. The measure is by no means aimed at encouraging those who are still in Hong Kong to emigrate to foreign countries. Chen Zuoer indicated no matter what measures are used, the Chinese side will, on the basis of relevant laws, strive to have the current relevant regulations and provisions of Hong Kong converge with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law of the future Hong Kong Autonomous Administrative Region.
