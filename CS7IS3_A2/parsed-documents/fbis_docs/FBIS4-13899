FBIS4-13899 "drnes079_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 SYRIA Wrapup of Reaction to Rabin Remarks, Christopher Tour Wrapup of Reaction to Rabin Remarks, Christopher Tour Upcoming Tour by U.S. Envoy Noted JN2404081094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 24 Apr 94 JN2404081094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Press commentaries today address the U.S. secretary of state's upcoming tour of the region, which is aimed at activating the peace process and creating an appropriate climate for the resumption of the bilateral negotiations. Under the headline "Israeli Deception," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, Israeli officials have launched an intensive media campaign aimed at misleading the world public in general, and the U.S. public in particular. AL-BA'TH adds: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said that he is willing to consider the dismantling of settlements in the occupied Arab territories, although facts on the ground belie these claims. For, the Israeli Government has continued to Judaize the occupied Arab territories, particularly occupied Jerusalem. The paper believes that it is high time the world community, which has long been deceived by Zionism, realized that the statements and pronouncements made by Israeli officials from time to time on a peaceful settlement are totally different than their real schemes and practices on the ground. For, had Israel been seeking peace as it claims, it would not have pursued a policy of procrastination and prevarication over the past two and a half years; that is, since the inception of the peace talks. This shows that Israel is evading the requirements of peace acknowledged by the international community. AL-BA'TH notes that the failure to make any progress in the peace talks, which were suspended in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre, was not caused by the Arabs, who, as is well known, have done a great deal to render the peace process a success. Rather, the failure to make progress in the peace talks is caused by the Israeli position, which is opposed to the implementation of the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, which constitute the terms of reference of the peace process. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying that the U.S. side must take into account the need to rehabilitate the peace process, and to reestablish it on the terms of reference agreed upon -- the terms which formed the bases for the convening of the Madrid conference. The entire world community, the paper adds, welcomed the convocation of the Madrid conference, and regarded it as a unique opportunity for the achievement of just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of trading land for peace. For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the statements Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has made to express his willingness to dismantle settlements on the Golan, and reiterate that he would avoid complete withdrawal from the Golan. The paper says: These statements show that Rabin is sidestepping the crux of the peace process; indeed, crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict. For, settlements have never been the bone of contention between the Arabs and Israelis. Rather, it was the occupation of Arab territories that has always been the bone of contention between the two communities. The paper adds: When he expressed a willingness to dismantle settlements, which were a product of the occupation, Rabin attempted to throw dust in our eyes. This is because, at the same time, he also underscored his determination to avoid complete withdrawal from the Golan, although Rabin, along with all Israeli officials, are well aware of Syria's position in this regard. Syria's peace stand is rooted in the need for complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; namely, the Golan, the West Bank, Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon. TISHRIN goes on to say: Rabin, who is engaged in a fresh maneuver with regard to the Golan, deliberately seeks to make the peace talks, if they are resumed, revolve in a vicious circle, or to render them void of any meaningful content. Moreover, Rabin's statements regarding the avoidance of complete withdrawal from the Golan are part of a new maneuver that Israel is attempting to cover up by declaring a willingness to dismantle settlements. These statements also betray a flagrant Israeli circumvention of the components of durable and viable peace. TISHRIN concludes by saying: These Israeli proposals are only aimed at perpetuating the occupation. For, had it been serious about the efforts to achieve peace, Israel would not have hesitated to subscribe to the requirements of the peace process, chief among which are complete withdrawal from the occupied territories and the implementation of the relevant international legitimacy resolutions, which provide for the inadmissibility of the acquisition of others' territories by force and call for Israeli troop withdrawals from all occupied Arab territories to achieve just and comprehensive peace. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the same issue, saying: On the eve of his upcoming tour of the region, Christopher announced that he is not carrying any new ideas or proposals. Nonetheless, he has made public his optimism over the possible achievement of positive results to help resume and reactivate the bilateral negotiations. The paper adds: It is hoped that this optimism is well-grounded, and that it will produce tangible developments to allow for the resumption of the negotiations, for progress in the peace talks, and for the promotion of the peace process. The attainment of all this would allow this process to achieve its final objective; that is, a just and comprehensive peace that upholds the principles of right and justice and nullifies all forms of injustice, occupation, and aggression. The paper goes on to say: Eleven rounds of negotiations have been held since the convening of the Madrid conference. During all these rounds, the Arabs ran into Israeli intransigence and determination to conclude partial solutions and separate deals, which cannot achieve peace or bring about stability. As a matter of fact, such solutions and deals can only consecrate injustice, domination, and occupation. The paper says: For now, we cannot see any indication of a change in the Israeli position. Likewise, we have not seen any positive attitude on the part of the Rabin government indicative of an abandonment of its old approaches and concepts, or of an acceptance of the principle of complete and full withdrawal; and this cannot help achieve peace. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: The Arabs, headed by Syria, have not given up hope over the possible emergence of a fair and honest U.S. position that would vindicate the values of right and justice and show impartiality toward the regional conflict. All that we want is to see the United States demonstrate fairness and honesty, and play the role of a full partner with all honesty and impartiality.
