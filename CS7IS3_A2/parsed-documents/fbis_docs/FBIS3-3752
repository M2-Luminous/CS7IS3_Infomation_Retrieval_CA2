Guizhou Governor Chen Sineng briefed him on the conditions and realities in supporting the impoverished in Guizhou. Deputy Wang Kunsheng spoke on Qianxinan Prefecture's work to support the impoverished. Meng Sufen, vice chairwoman of the seventh provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also attended the meeting and gave a briefing on the impoverished conditions of the Mashan area, the most impoverished mountainous area in Guizhou. After listening carefully to the briefings, Chen Junsheng said: The state all along has regarded Guizhou as a key in the work to support the impoverished, and it will remain so. Guizhou has made great progress in supporting the impoverished over the past few years. If soil improvement were to be pursued on half a million mu each year, great changes certainly would take place. Chen Junsheng said: There are still 129 townships isolated from the province's highway network, and this issue must be resolved as quickly as possible. It is hoped that Guizhou will exert efforts, from the top to to grass roots, to become well-off as early as possible. Yang Zhong, deputy head of the leading group and director of the Office for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas, also attended the meeting.
