According to him, the Turkish president gave no directives to the Comrat leaders in this regard. "The Comrat leaders had previously received several foreign delegations at a quite high level which, in my opinion, were useful for all sides," added Grebenscicov. He noted that the Turkish president insisted on preservation of Moldova's integrity. "I do not share the opinion of those who say that the law on status for the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians would lead to Moldova's federalization," specified Grebenscicov. He pointed out that the draft law supposes decentralization. "This implies a broad autonomy and not a republic," he said.
