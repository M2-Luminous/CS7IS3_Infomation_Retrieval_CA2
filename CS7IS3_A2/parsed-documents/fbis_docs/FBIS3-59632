The object of this fantasy: The 14-hectare sludge hole between Bitterfeld and Wolfen, where an evil mixture of sulfite lye, lignin, cellulose, sulfates, bleaching waters, hydrogen sulfides and carbon disulfides, salts, alcohols, phenols and solvents is swimming. For years, toxic waste from the Wolfen film factory created the pool of muck, which--because of its shimmering surface--after the unification became world famous as Silver Lake. Now, a company in the region wants to perform a miracle and free the residents of nearby Wolfen-Wachtendorf from the stench of this sewer. The Sangerhaeuser Maschinenfabrik (SAMAG), which, together with its subsidiaries, takes part in the cleanup of the former film factory, promises to return the water to ecological balance with its Aqua-life unit. To begin with, a large-scale test has been under way since June. Independent environmental laboratories are taking samples every day and checking on the progress. The decision is to be made at the beginning of October. Then, if this succeeds beyond all doubt, a large assault can be made with additional equipment even this year. This is aimed first at the surface of the Silbersee. "The thin layer of water over two million cubic meters of sludge must first resume its function as a hydrological stopper," SAMAG's laboratory chief Axel Koenig explains the principle. This plug will first be enriched with atmospheric oxygen. Then the developing harmful gases will already be oxidized and mineralized below the surface, Koenig anticipates. At the same time bacterial cultures are to initiate biological breakdown processes. The cleanup people's vision: Complete food chains from microorganisms to fish are to be recreated in the oxygen-rich water. Later on, the "disarmed" sludge could be dredged up almost without odor and burned. The cleanup is not without risk. To be sure, in the jelly-like mass of the pit there are only small quantities of heavy metals, says Koenig, and the ground water is protected by a barrier of lignin. The real difficulty threatens on top: "A major danger is that with large additions of air into the not quite 30-centimeter-thin layer of the surface water, the entire brew will begin to churn," the laboratory chief fears. Within the space of three months microbiologists, flow technicians, designers, engineers and workers designed and built a "special ship" which is to overcome the problems: At the end, they gave the discharge from the mobile water purification unit the form of a snout. It avoids swirling up the shallow water. The technical principle is a Venturi system that sucks up polluted water. In the aerator part it is squeezed through a "throat" and mixed with air, which intensifies the oxygen absorption of the water. Subsequently, the water passes through a 15-meter-long flow channel with columns of biological growth surfaces. When the light, oxygen-rich mixture flows through, on the one hand it promotes the growth of microorganisms. On the other, it tears off the overhanging part of the growth and carries it off with the water. That is how new life is supposed to originate. Naturally, SAMAG administrator Eckart Harrmann is more fascinated by the economic than the technical aspects. "If we get the final contract for cleaning up the Silbersee, with another six to 12 units it will become a million-mark deal," he calculates. The image of "having cleaned up to some extent" the notorious sewer would be a priceless reference "in the eyes of the world." Even now, Harrmann convincingly praises the Aqua-life purification system from Sangerhausen. It can be used in creeks, rivers, and standing waters as well as in conventional treatment plants. All it needs is a power supply. Harrmann adds: "The cost of hiring our services until the end of a cleanup mission is low." The company thus accommodates the strained financial situation in many companies and municipalities.
