Was the whole thing just a show, a ritual, or did Chancellor Kohl put pressure on you? [Kirchner] Not at all. We worked out the agreement ourselves, and we are rather proud of that. I make it clear: We were not staging a show. [Jung] Were there long faces among your people? [Kirchner] The Gesamtmetall Executive Committee unanimously approved the result. Of course, some entrepreneur or other may not be enthusiastic. But we have found a fair compromise that pays off. [Jung] Medium-sized companies in particular are teetering on the brink. [Kirchner] Medium-sized industry, too, will recognize the advantages of this contract. We have developed a number of flexible models, which had not previously existed. And it is particularly important is that we have managed to prevent a cost increase for wages. This year's productivity increase may be fully invested in improving competitiveness. [Jung] But the goal was to reduce costs considerably? [Kirchner] In the final analysis, we have a reduction of costs. We can compensate for the wage increases of 2 percent: Until June there are five "zero months." The vacation and Christmas bonuses are being frozen for three years; in addition, the 1994 Christmas bonus is being reduced by 10 percent. All that adds up to a very clear, calculable zero for this year. [Jung] Does that stop the development of entrepreneurs nowadays arranging agreements with shop councils on income and working time on their own? [Kirchner] I hope so. The area wage contract has been opened up a little with the new models so that the companies can adjust their work time in line with their requirements. As a result, the area wage contract will probably regain acceptance. The autonomy of collective bargaining has proved its worth in the crisis. [Jung] Is the metal industry contract a model for the negotiations in the public sector that are still continuing? [Kirchner] We have integrated the agreements at Volkswagen and in the chemical industry. The public sector and the Public Services, Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV) will certainly take the appropriate steps derived from our result.
