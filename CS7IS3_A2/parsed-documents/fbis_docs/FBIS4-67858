Hosokawa made the announcement in a meeting with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a four-day visit. The amount is part of a total of 100 million dollars Japan pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their nuclear weapons. The officials said detailed use of the 11 million dollars will be decided in discussions between the two sides at a committee on cooperation for the destruction of nuclear weapons. Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize, democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they said. Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear weapon state last November. Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping his country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said. Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity near Semipalatinsk. Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to be covered by the 11 million dollars. An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are believed to be left in Kazakhstan. As for environmental problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said the problem should be solved internationally but added Japan would study what it can do, the officials said. Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the meeting said Kazakhstan ``expressed the hope'' that Japan would become a permanent member of the Security Council and ``fulfill its relevant responsibilities.'' Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan intends to fulfill its responsibilities within its capabilities, the officials said. On the international front, the Kazakhstan president proposed holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust. Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia but expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole region such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. Hosokawa suggested the two sides utilize the existing bilateral economic committee. Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners of war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials said. On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.
