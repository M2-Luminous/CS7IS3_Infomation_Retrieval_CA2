FBIS3-31148 "dreeu030__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-030-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Papers on Possible Effects of NATO Ultimatum AU1002134994 Sofia BTA in English 1132 GMT 10 Feb 94 AU1002134994 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [From BTA press review] [Text] Sofia, February 10 (BTA) -- "MP's say that according to number one spy Brigo Asparukhov the air strikes against Bosnia are the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national security in 50 years," the private 24 CHASA daily writes in an extensive front-page article. Mr. Asparukhov, head of the National Intelligence Service, reportedly said so at yesterday's meeting of the Parliamentary National Security Committee, which according to the parliamentary rules of procedures holds its sittings behind closed doors. 24 CHASA quotes the committee's chairman, Mr. Nikolay Slatinski, as saying: "If Turkey chooses to get involved in the conflict, it will not be allowed to use Bulgaria's territory." The daily reminds that on Monday President Zhelyu Zhelev received a letter from Turkey's President Demirel, asking him to back NATO's strike in Bosnia. "Until late last night the president had not given an answer," the daily reports. "Why does President Zhelev pass over Brigo Asparukhov's warning in silence?" the daily asks. In a signed commentary the private KONTINENT daily writes that Bulgaria's reaction must be swift and categorical, otherwise before long its foreign policy will be dictated by Ankara. Under the headline "Politicians Diverge on Yugo-Policy" the DUMA daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party writes that the members of the Parliamentary National Security Committee were perplexed by the statement of Deputy Minister of Defence Boyko Noev that limited air strikes against Bosnia pose no immediate threat to Bulgaria's national security. All papers frontpage reports on NATO's decision to give the Serbs a ten-day ultimatum to lift the siege of Sarajevo. "Thank God the World Overcame the Threat of Another Bloody conflict," reads a headline in the independent OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. "NATO Decided To Strike Serbs in Bosnia," writes the trade-union daily TRUD. "The moment has come for us to say whose side we are going to take," the daily comments. "On the one hand, those who claim to defend democracy insist that we back the strike, threatening that otherwise we will be considered anti-democrats; on the other hand, brother Slavs warn us against such a step, describing it as a betrayal of kinship and good-neighbourliness," reads the commentary. "If we take the side of NATO, we shall be on the winner's side when the war ends. The question is, which war -- in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia or in Bulgaria? For, when it comes to the crunch, the Serbs will hardly hesitate to blast the Balkans," writes TRUD. "And if we turn against NATO, we'll get a "hvala" [Serbo-Croatian for "thank you"], that is, a "spasibo" [Russian for "thank you"], but we will be reduced to pariahs in Europe for years on end," reads the commentary.
