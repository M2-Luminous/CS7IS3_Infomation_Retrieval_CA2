FR940426-1-00090 FR940426-1-00008 EPA requests comment and technical data regarding the effect of the OTC-LEV program on emissions in the OTR. EPA will also review the cost effectiveness of the OTC&hyph;LEV program. Cost estimates of California's LEV program have varied greatly. Much of the variation is attributable to different assumptions regarding the necessary technology, economies of scale, and how development costs should be calculated. During EPA's consideration of California's waiver for its LEV program, California estimated additional costs to be $170 per car, while the automobile industry estimated this figure to be over $1000 per car. While both California and the industry have subsequently refined and reduced their estimates based on new hardware assumptions, the large difference remains an issue. Cost-effectiveness estimates for the OTC&hyph;LEV program will be somewhat distinct from the California LEV cost-effectiveness estimates because some or much of the costs that were included in the California LEV estimates, particularly research and development costs, may be reduced or eliminated in the OTC&hyph;LEV context because the costs have already been expended in developing the California LEV program. EPA requests comment on cost-effectiveness of the OTC&hyph;LEV program, given the continuing existence of the California LEV program. 4. Alternatives to the OTC's Recommended LEV Program The recitation clauses to the OTC recommendation specifically state: Whereas the OTC expects the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through the consultation process provided in Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act, to evaluate alternatives (including the program presented by the automobile manufacturers with enhancements) which are comparable in terms of enforceability, timeliness, and quantity of emission reductions to those achieved by the OTC LEV program, are consistent with the Clean Air Act, and advances technology. This indicates that the OTC intends that EPA consider alternatives, and in particular that EPA should consider the auto manufacturers' alternative. a. Automobile Manufacturers' Alternative to the OTC's Recommended LEV Program. The American Automobile Manufacturers Association's (AAMA) alternative program to the California LEV program is known as the Federal LEV or FLEV program. As proposed by the auto manufacturers, manufacturers would provide FLEVs to all States in the OTC. The FLEV automobiles would meet the following emission standards: 0.125 gpm NMOG; 2.5 gpm CO; 0.3 gpm NO X at 100,000 miles; and 0.2 gpm NO X at 50,000 miles. Light-duty trucks would also have FLEV standards. The FLEV standards would be phased-in, with the standards applicable to 30% of all new cars in model year 2001, 60% in model year 2002, and 100% in model year 2003. These standards represent a substantial improvement from the federal Tier I standards (0.25 gpm NMHC, 3.4 gpm CO, 0.4 NO X ) with which manufacturers must now comply. The standards are, however, less stringent than the federal Tier II ``default'' standards specified in Table 1 in section 202(i)(1) (0.125 gpm NMHC, 1.7 gpm CO, 0.2 gpm NO X ), which cannot apply before model year 2004. They are also less stringent than California's LEV category standards for NMOG (0.075 gpm at 50,000, 0.090 gpm at 100,000) but more stringent than California's LEV category standards for CO (3.4 gpm at 50,000, 4.2 gpm at 100,000). The AAMA proposed that FLEV vehicles would be available nationwide. A sales mandate for ZEVs was not included in the FLEV proposal. Under the FLEV proposal, manufacturers would certify their vehicles to the FLEV standards, but in-use standards would remain at the current federal Tier 1 levels through at least model year 2003. As proposed, the FLEV program would be implemented through a consent decree settling litigation regarding implementation of the LEV program in New York and Massachusetts. The consent decree mechanism was proposed based on the contention that section 202(b)(1)(C) and 202(i) prohibit EPA from imposing the FLEV standards prior to model year 2004 and that section 209 prohibits States from adopting the FLEV standards. Under the proposal, in addition to the manufacturers' obligation to provide cars meeting FLEV standards, the consent decree would reflect the States' agreement not to adopt the LEV program; Massachusetts's and New York's agreement to withdraw their programs; and an agreement that the manufacturers' obligations to provide FLEV cars would terminate if any State adopted a California LEV program. While States would have the right to enforce the FLEV program through the court supervising the consent decree, EPA might provide the information regarding whether particular cars in fact meet the FLEV standards.
