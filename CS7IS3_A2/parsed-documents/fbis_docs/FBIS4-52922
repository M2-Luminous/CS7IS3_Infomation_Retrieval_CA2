FBIS4-52922 "dreas094_i_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Cambodia Khmer Rouge Radio Condemns Ranariddh as `Liar' Khmer Rouge Radio Condemns Ranariddh as `Liar' BK1605064294 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia in Cambodian 2330 GMT 14 May 94 BK1605064294 (Clandestine) Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia Cambodian BFN [Unattributed commentary: "Ranariddh is the Master Liar Prince"] [Text] In a radio interview in Phnom Penh on 12 May, liar Prince Ranariddh intentionally and shamelessly lied, in the same manner that fault-finders and foreign vassals usually do, that Democratic Kampuchea has given the Preah Vihear Temple to Thailand. Liar prince, your should not tell such an empty lie; even the children will not believe you. Do not look down upon your own people as being so ignorant; they know well that you are very notorious. You believe only in the words of the allies and communist Vietnamese who are killing the Cambodian nation and people and the national resistance forces which are struggling for national salvation. The Cambodian nation and people know well that you, the liar prince, have resorted to this tale because the allies and communist Vietnamese have suffered serious defeats everywhere, especially on the Anlung Veng battlefield in February 1994 and on Pailin battlefield in April 1994, and are suffering serious setbacks on the Route 5 battlefield -- in the areas from Nimit to Poipet and from Nimit to Sisophon and so forth. In the same interview, liar Prince Ranariddh further lied that the two-headed elements could not control the influx of millions of Vietnamese immigrants into Cambodia because the Cambodian-Vietnamese border is very long. This statement is really [words indistinct]. This statement is in favor of the influx of Vietnamese in order to turn Cambodia into another Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam]. The liar prince has allowed thousands of Vietnamese nationals to flow into Cambodia every day. They have come by truck, boat, and motor boat through big and small rivers and Routes 1, 2, 3, and so forth. Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh has thought only of attacking his own nation and eliminating the patriotic resistance forces. Why? It is because Ranariddh has sold himself out to the allies, communist Vietnamese, and Vietnamese puppets in exchange for U.S. dollars, gold, jewels, luxurious cars and villas, and private airplanes. The Cambodian nation and people condemn and will continue to condemn the two puppet groups for betraying the nation and people and allowing the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia into late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese Federation.
