The perpetrators of this horrible massacre intended it to violate our people's sacred three: The sacred Friday, the month of Ramadan, and the Ibrahimi Mosque, so the wound would be deeper, the pain doubled, and the outrage profound. The Zionist movement and its successive generations have adopted this kind of massacre as an article of faith and a modus operandi against our Palestinian people. Such massacres have always been a precursor of prominent phases in this long and sanguinary struggle, beginning with the Dayr Yasin and Qafr Qasim massacres, continuing with the Gaza, al-Sammu', Khan Yunis, the al-Aqsa mosque [words indistinct] 'Uyun Qarah [Rishon Letziyyon], and ending with the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. We know that in these massacres, Zionists sought to wipe out the other side and liquidate it so the reality could be the same as the myth. The Jewish myth, characterized by racism and hatred, describes Palestine as a land a without a people. The massacre was designed to wipe out the people and uproot their civilized existence and pave the way for the triumph of the myth. In implementation of the policy of massacres, we find that the leaders of the Zionist movement, who have been and continue to be leaders of the State of Israel, made massacres the main component of their personal history, from which they derive the feeling of supremacy. They participated in the series of massacres, beginning with Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and ending with Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's incumbent prime minister himself. This means that none of the Israeli rulers, past or present, stand against this kind of black, bloody terrorism because none will stand against his own nature and his very being. In this latest massacre and in line with our argument, Rabin cannot be the adversary and judge at the same time, the killer who is asked to protect the Palestinian people. [Words indistinct] clear to the international community which says it wants peace, that it does not approve of these massacres. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre reveals to us that the Zionist settlement in the Palestinian territory cannot be [words indistinct] in blood. The leaders of the Israeli Government have several times tried to improve the image ofthe settlements and belittle their danger. The successive U.S. administrations also tried to belittle the importance of the settlements in order to justify to the (?taxpayer) their costs in tens of billions of dollars. However, the Zionist settlements have always exposed themselves by themselves, affirming that they [words indistinct] and the shedding of Palestinian blood during their prayers. Those in the Israeli governments who created the settlements are aware of this. It is natural that when we plant thorns we should not expect grapes, when we plant bitter plants we do not expect honey, and when we plant settlements we cannot expect peace. In short, settlement building is against peace. The advocates of settlements are against peace. The Israeli Government that wants the settlements to remain, wants the peace to disappear simultaneously. This is the aim of the massacre. This is the motive behind its perpetration at this manner and at this time so it may madly violate the three sanctities at the same time. It is well-known that the peace tool is negotiations and the perpetrators of the murders aim to stop these negotiations. We should not fall in the trap set for us. We should not slip into the abyss prepared for us by the criminals. At the same time, there can be no negotiations for the sake of negotiations. Negotiations must have codes. [Words indistinct] The blood shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque is more important than letting the course of the negotiations proceed as it is. It is more important than adhering to the same items and [word indistinct] of the agenda. Why should it be discussed after two years? Why not now? Why should the first point in the agenda not be the settlers and the settlements, because this point is either the key to peace or the key to the return of bloody clashes. Let everybody take the responsibility.
