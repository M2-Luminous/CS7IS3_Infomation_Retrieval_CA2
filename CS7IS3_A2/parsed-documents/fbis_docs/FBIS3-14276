The Egyptian Government asked the Jordanian Government to postpone the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee meetings, which were scheduled to be held at the end of this month, to another date to be fixed through bilateral contacts. According to Egyptian sources, the meetings will be held in April. The Egyptian Government attributed this postponement to Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's preoccupation with urgent domestic and foreign affairs. Official Jordanian sources were displeased with the last-minute Egyptian request, the second of its kind, as it indicates that the Egyptian Government is not serious about strengthening its relations with Jordan. It will be recalled that Jordanian-Egyptian relations have been strained due to the Gulf war and the Middle East peace process, for which Egypt is apparently very enthusiastic, not to mention the profit and loss factors.
