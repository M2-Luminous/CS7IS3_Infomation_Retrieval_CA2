FR940607-1-00010 FR940607-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 Series Airplanes, KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 and MD&hyph;11 series airplanes. This proposal would require the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This proposal is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Department L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion A recent analysis conducted by the manufacturer revealed that the potential exists for uncommanded spoiler extension due to failure, for any reason, of a lateral control mixer bracket on Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes. The FAA has reviewed the results of this analysis and has determined that failure of the lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler on Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes, and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, as well as on Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, since the brackets are designed similarly on these airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;222 [for Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10 (military) airplanes], and MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 27&hyph;34 (for Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993, that describe procedures for installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This installation will minimize the possibility for uncommanded extension of the spoiler in the event of a bracket failure or separation from the airplane structure. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the applicable service bulletin described previously.
