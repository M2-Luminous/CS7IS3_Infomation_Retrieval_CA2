All conditions have been met to put the new dinar into circulation in these countries. This is what FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Deputy Prime Minister Jovan Zebic stated to our Banja Luka correspondent Branislav Bozic: [Begin recording] [Zebic] The fundamental task stemming from the joint agreement in Banja Luka -- where representatives of the governments of the Srpska republic, the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Yugoslavia were present -- was to agree upon the manner in which the 1994 economic policy would be conducted, as well as the implementation of a new program that would involve the reconstruction of the monetary system and the maintenance of a healthy fiscal policy on an entirely new basis. The introduction of an economic policy to curb hyperinflation, or rather halt it, and, similarly to a stable dinar, facilitate normal conditions for work and an increase in production were also to be discussed. [Bozovic] Can you tell us anything more concrete -- for example, will the new dinar be recognized in these territories? [Zebic] Since all three governments in the FRY and, as I was informed last night, the two governments in the Serbian republics have accepted the program and opted for this unified concept, all conditions have been created to put the new dinar into circulation throughout the entire territory and, therefore, in the Serbian republics as well. [Bozovic] What about payment methods? [Zebic] For the time being, the payment methods are synchronized and maximally coordinated, and we intend to proceed as we have so far. There is a novelty thought here -- namely that payment operations will be done in old and new dinars. [Bozic] Therefore, all in all, you can say that the economy in all the Serbian lands will function on equal conditions? [Zebic] We are trying, and we believe that with this reform, we are safeguarding this goal -- that is, that the entire production in all Serbian lands functions under equal circumstances and that the new convertible dinar be equally significant for the Serbian republics and be present here as well. Naturally, this carries certain conditions with it -- for instance, it must be fully backed either in convertible currency or in gold. [end recording]
