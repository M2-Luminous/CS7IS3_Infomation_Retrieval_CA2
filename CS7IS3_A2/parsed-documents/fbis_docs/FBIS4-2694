Nonetheless, it does mark the return to normalized French-Chinese relations, and leaves room for hope that some major contracts might be wrapped up this summer. By making an official visit to Beijing and Shanghai, the prime minister knew he was indulging in a perilous undertaking. The aim was to give official confirmation of French-Chinese reconciliation and to create a political environment that might benefit French companies, without ceding any ground regarding the respecting of human rights. Beijing's determination to press home its "different" point of view, compared with values which it deems overly Western and, in fact, dangerous for a state that is deeply divided, put an end to this hope. The return to calm which Edouard Balladur was praying for turned into an actual escalation of the situation when two dissidents were arrested in Beijing and three more were detained in Shanghai. Called upon to explain themselves, the Chinese authorities minced their words and duly denied that the arrests had taken place. And on Sunday morning, after Edouard Balladur had left, one of the "non- arrested" dissidents was released, only to be placed under close surveillance in Shanghai. Diplomats unconvincingly pointed out that the Chinese often resort to this system of arrests to coincide with official visits by foreign leaders. However, the damage had been done. The French prime minister who had repeatedly emphasized that success in this area would depend on discretion and a lack of publicity could only watch as he fell into the trap that he had thought he could avoid. The same trap into which U.S. Foreign Secretary Warren Christopher had stumbled more cruelly in mid-March. By openly linking human rights with most-favored nation status, he ran up against a wall of rejection deemed to have dealt the United States a stinging blow. In fact, it has pushed Washington to the point today of looking into the details of a most-favored nation clause that would apply solely to U.S. private companies or investments in China. Upcoming Economic Tests Today, France is avoiding any such contortions. However, even if the results of economic reconciliation are confirmed over the coming months, any such rapprochement will now be politically tainted. And the international authority that Edouard Balladur might have hoped to gain from his trip to China will have been considerably lessened. It remains to be seen whether the Chinese leaders are ready to prove concretely that any link between human rights and business is, as they like putting it, as outdated as the Cold War. If this is the case, then the minor advances made during Edouard Balladur's visit in cultural and economic terms will not have been made in vain. In a country where the French language occupies a marginal position, the opening of a pedagogical cultural center in Beijing is not of negligible importance. The promise to create a post dedicated to economic expansion in Canton, where the consulate was closed as a punishment for French sales of Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan, should enable France to start off on the best footing again. At the same time, France has non-negligible chances of being "awarded" the contract for a second nuclear power station in Daya Bay, for reasons of "loyalty." Which is music to the ears of Framatome, the French manufacturer of nuclear reactors, which completed Daya Bay I last year, together with Spie Batignolles. And without harboring overly high hopes of a 2,500-km TGV [high- speed train] link between Beijing and Shanghai actually going ahead, the Chinese leaders have placed too great an emphasis on the common interests of both countries in this respect to abandon all hope regarding the results of the electricity minister's next visit to Paris, or the mission that Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet will lead in the early summer. Only then will we be able to assess how successful the trip by the French prime minister really was. And know how far Paris is prepared to go to support new contracts thanks to the financial protocol which has to be completed by that time. Leaving aside the Daya Bay II project, valued at something like 15 billion francs, or the Elf refinery due to be built near Shanghai. On the other hand, if Beijing continues to make an indirect link between human rights and economic dossiers in an attempt to raise the stakes, then we might well wonder about the significance of the invitation to visit France which Edouard Balladur confirmed to President Jiang Zemin, on behalf of Francois Mitterrand. One thing is certain. France cannot implement any Asian policy that does not take China into account. Obviously, if Beijing wants to avoid confining itself to two dialogue partners (the United States and Japan), but also seeks to play Europe, then it simply must have the French card at its disposal. However, what was supposed to mark a new phase in French-Chinese relations could take on all the allure of a long, hard march...unless a shift in French foreign policy is confirmed, and the defense of human rights is openly uncoupled from diplomatic and strategic imperatives.
