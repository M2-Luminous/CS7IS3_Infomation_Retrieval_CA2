Brown. Wu is in Washington to co-chair with Brown the Eighth Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade to be held Wednesday and Thursday [13 and 14 April] and to conduct consultations on how to further expand bilateral trade and economic cooperation and other related issues. A 37-member Chinese Government economic and trade delegation led by Wu took part in a Sino-U.S. trade and investment opportunity conference in Los Angeles before flying to Washington, D.C. and will attend a similar event in New York next week. As she arrived at Washington's Dulles Airport Wu said that the "considerable progress" made in Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties had "brought enormous benefits" to both nations since the two countries established diplomatic relations. However, she noted that bilateral trade and economic relations are still plagued by some problems and difficulties, whose solutions require the joint efforts of the governments, statesmen, business communities and people in all walks of life. Wu was hopeful, she said, that the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit last November could be used as a starting point to maintain and boost high-level contact and exchanges between the two countries in all fields, strengthen mutual understanding, expand common interests, reduce and eliminate differences and bring bilateral relationships, including trade and economic aspects, back to healthy development.
