In late 1991 and early 1992 Agapov, at that time deputy chairman for operations work (intelligence and counterintelligence) of the Committee for Security of the USSR State Border, was one of those who insisted: "The Border Troops must be common [for all]. This is not a structure to be pulled down first of all by dragging it apart to national quarters." But a different approach predominated. In the interview presented, Agapov, now vice president of Ingushetia, discusses the consequences of this and the present situation of the Border Troops. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The Border Troops have lived a very troubled life for the last two and one-half years. First they are removed from the USSR KGB, then handed over to the Committee's successor, the Russian Ministry of Security, then again are made into a separate structure. From your point of view as a person who served in the Troops for almost 30 years, to what extent was their independent existence, or to the contrary, their existence within the framework of a particular department, justified? [Agapov] The Border Troops should be independent--this is my profound conviction. It stands to reason that they must be in constant contact with services providing state security, with customs officials, and also with various ministries and departments such as the ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, Finance, and Economy, and with the Foreign Intelligence Service. But only on an independent basis, otherwise the Troops lose their appearance and their professionalism, taking on in their place the coloration and ideology of the department to which they are assigned. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And from the very beginning, from the moment they were established, did the Border Troops exist independently or were they on someone's "leash"? [Agapov] When the Russian Federation Border Guard was established after the Revolution (the Decree establishing it was signed by Lenin on 28 May 1918), where didn't they try to drag this Guard! Into the Ministry of Finance and into some kind of other departments, but nothing worthwhile came of this. And because the primary mission of the Border Troops is to provide state security on the border, in the final account they ended up in that department which also engaged in providing security--on the scale of the entire country. And they fully took root in this system of OGPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB. They took root, I do not wish to hide this. But as I said, in performing certain common functions together with security organs, the Troops unfortunately also assumed other functions alien to them, such as pure counterintelligence connected with internal problems. And some subunits even engaged in the "fifth line," the fight against ideological subversion--true, only in the border zone. Of course, Border Troops personnel did not carry on developments independently, but they collected information that was out of the ordinary and passed it on to where it was supposed to go. By the way, here is one more argument of no small importance in favor of independence. Information which Border Troops personnel have is unique in its way: They observe the development of a situation on border territory--their own and the enemy's. But when Border Troops were part of state security organs, their information did not go to the country's leadership directly. It first went "topside," to the KGB, where it was processed, fitted, and sorted in a suitable manner, and the real picture thus was distorted substantially. Generally there were many different slants. One time, for example, an idea was hanging around (although not carried out, it still hangs around) about subordinating the Border Troops to the Ministry of Defense, or about their organizational development according to the type of one of the branches of the Armed Forces. What also contributed to this was the fact that, to their misfortune, Border Troops personnel were deprived of their own institute where professionals--staffers, organizers of border security, operations personnel--were trained. That is why at one time Border Troops personnel were trained at the Frunze Academy. This ended with us losing specialists in 30 years of such practice. It would turn out that on completing the Border Troops school and serving on the border 5-6 years, an officer would get to the Academy, pick up a "militaristic" intoxication, and then think only in categories of division, corps, army, front. And our troops were slanted toward the Army... True, this later was corrected, a Border Troops faculty was established right there in the Academy, and they provided Border Troops instructors. But still the spirit, way of life, and curriculum were close to that of the Army. At that time the thesis spread that the Border Troops not only should guard the border, but also defend it. Therefore, it was said, in case something happened Border Troops officers are obligated to be ready to command armies, corps and even fronts, although as a matter of fact this is absolutely unrealistic! The Border Troops are incapable of genuinely defending the border. There are border covering forces of ground troops for this. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Then just what should the Troops' activity boil down to? [Agapov] It isn't necessary to reinvent the wheel. The functions of Border Troops are functions of exceptional importance: Controlling entry and exit and stopping the smuggling of drugs, weapons, ammunition and explosives. When I speak of illegal crossings, I naturally have in mind not some kind of idle persons, but the work of enemy special services--insertion of illegals/spies, saboteurs, and terrorists--although of course there have been other instances as well. For example, criminals avoiding justice often tried to flee from us. Some people fled in search of political asylum, and the very same also happened in the other direction. But purely agent insertions remained the important thing. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And to what extent did they bear a mass nature? [Agapov] This path was used most actively after the Patriotic War. Subsequently other opportunities--technical reconnaissance, space reconnaissance--appeared, and well-adjusted technical information services began to arise. Later came the warming in relations between the Soviet Union and the West. Legal opportunities for obtaining information appeared. Superb conditions for collecting information were created on the territory of former Union states: they did not keep our secrets very well there. They acted according to the principle that someone else's secret is not my secret. In particular, Poland became such a fount of information about the Soviet Union's secrets; they were sold there right and left, wholesale and retail. So the need for a form of work such as agent insertion gradually began to disappear. But those states whose legal and technical capabilities were limited, China for example, continued to use the traditional method of inserting illegals. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The border previously was built along the perimeter of all Soviet Union territory. How is it built today? [Agapov] It is terrible to say this, but practically not at all. The old state border security system has collapsed and a new one has not been created. And as a result such breaches gape along the entire perimeter of Russia's borders today that it will take a minimum of 15-20 years to close them somehow. The shortsightedness of politicians and the striving to place their interests over state interests is at fault for everything. When all this was being decided--the Union had disintegrated and the CIS had arisen--there was a group of people in the Border Troops leadership (including me) who said: "Stop and think better of it!" We insisted that we need to preserve a unified border space and ensure a smooth flow of Union Border Troops into CIS Border Troops, and this opinion found support up to a certain point. Appropriate agreements were signed and a CinC CIS Border Troops was appointed--Colonel General Ilya Yakovlevich Kalinichenko. Then everything fell apart. There were too many who wanted to become commanders of their own Border Troops--Ukrainian, Uzbek, Kazakh, Russian and God knows what others. The presence of statehood presumes the presence of borders, they said. The fact is, already then it was understandable that not one former Union republic was capable of ensuring the independent security of its borders on a purely economic and financial basis. The result is gigantic breaches on all axes: On the Central Asiatic--Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenia; in the Transcaucasus--Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia; and although the border is guarded in Ukraine and Belarus, it is far from as it was before. Only a few sectors of the "old" border--built up and with adjusted duty--were preserved: The borders with Norway, Finland, China and Mongolia. These sectors are more or less closed, but the rest... The system was established for over 70 years, bit by bit. Necessary engineer works, obstacles, observation posts, border zastavas, posts and detachments were built. All this was smoothed out and settled. They knew where to send details and where, how, and what to secure in each kilometer. But everything was pulled down in an instant. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And how effectively did the previous system operate? [Agapov] Five or six unpunished border violations during the year were considered a major, inadmissible failure in the work of the Border Troops. There were serious "sortings out," stern measures were taken, and people were removed from the job. The chief of a border zastava could be discharged to the reserve unceremoniously for a penetration. And if the chief of a border detachment had a minimum of two penetrations on his record, that was it; his service ended on that. So only irreproachable, hard-working organizers of border service who did not reserve for themselves the right of failure advanced in service. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And now? [Agapov] Now the penetration count has gone over the thousands. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] What sectors of the border traditionally were considered the most troublesome? [Agapov] The Transcaucasus was considered the most difficult and crucial sector of operation, difficult even for purely geographical reasons: The Soviet population and the population across the border were in maximum proximity to each other, a matter of meters. You understand that it is one thing when there is a 30-40 km border strip from the main line of engineer works to the state border and it is quite another matter when it is 5-6 meters. There are more urges for contacts, illegal crossings, relations, illegal transactions and so on. It is there in the Transcaucasus, on the border with Turkey and Iran, that Border Troops personnel forged their expertise. True, with respect to looking after the border, another troublesome sector was considered to be the Norwegian and the Baltic. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You say that the old border security system has collapsed today. What does this threaten for the country's security? [Agapov] There is a constant movement of weapons, ammunition and drugs across the border. Into whose hands will all this fall? That's the whole point! The criminal situation in Russia today is fraught with the most unpredictable consequences. Terrorism of all stripes and all directions is flourishing. Add to this the overall political instability. Some kind of feverish, helpless attempts are being made to change the situation, but in vain. The conditions in which the Troops find themselves are such that they cannot cope with this task. They are incapable of providing reliable security for Russia's state borders. In addition, Russian Border Troops personnel today have to perform duty on the border of third countries. Russian Border Troops are securing the border of Tajikistan with Afghanistan, Georgia with Turkey, and Armenia with Turkey. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But is this justified? [Agapov] It is justified only because otherwise these borders will not be secured at all. Where is the absurdity? We do not have our own borders with these states--they are "transparent"--and so we have to secure their borders to prevent illegal movements across their territories onto Russian territory. Some generally believe that we must get out of there, post troops along Russia's present perimeter, and that's it. But this is precluded; ready-made positions and the old structure have remained on the former Union border. It is cracking and falling apart, but it still can be used. But to begin from scratch... This will take 15-20 years, not to mention the material and financial costs, which are completely beyond our capability now. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And what is the solution? [Agapov] Only a common border. Heads of CIS member states must sit down at the negotiating table... [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But if we take into account that rivers of weapons and drugs are constantly flowing across uncovered borders, as you yourself say, and all this is being turned into enormous amounts of money... The fact is, this is very, very profitable for someone. Consequently, big problems may arise with the establishment of combined Border Troops... [Agapov] Naturally, and this is why we must set the most rigid conditions today for those states from which this flow is coming. Steps must be taken to bring them to their senses. Say to them: "Brothers, either you properly close your border or we will have a stern talk with you." Or just what do we have? I recently met with the commander of the North Caucasus Border District. So? He recently conducted a troop operation on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan. They confiscated around five billion rubles and detained 60 persons from who knows what countries and of who knows what nationalities, who penetrated into Azerbaijan, then tried to travel into Russia, and the other way around. But for this it was necessary to mobilize practically all district forces, and this for a one-time action, in order to close--for a time(!)--only a small sector of the border. But this probably is not even the most terrible thing--not perforated borders or material disorder. The impression of what a Border Troops person is has been eroded and the previous spirit of these Troops has been lost. Previously in securing the border a Border Troops person secured the entire Soviet people, the whole country, and he was proud of this. But today the Border Troops person is a mercenary. He was ordered: "Go God knows where and secure God knows what." Secure what? On what grounds? Therefore, as with any person forced to do something, he does not guard, but simulates guarding. I am speaking about the officer. And what can be said about the soldier? Does he have a great need for the Georgian or Azerbaijani border so as to put his life on the line for who knows what? Honestly speaking, when the USSR Border Troops were eliminated, many of us found ourselves in a very difficult situation. The question arose: Into which troops should we go serve--Ukrainian, Georgian, Russian, Kazakh, Moldovan or perhaps Belarusian? It was necessary to choose. But I--and not just I alone--served in the Border Troops for 30 years and guarded the safety of the Moldovan and Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, Bashkir and Jew to an equal extent. It was all one for me. And so to go guard the border of some one republic... And I made my choice--I left the Troops. And I know many did the very same. But... Some received an apartment, some did not serve to retirement. And those who already had all this, or the young ones who had to serve 15-20 years until retirement, left. Now the "old-timers" will serve to retirement and also will leave. And again there will be a collapse. A collapse on a collapse.
