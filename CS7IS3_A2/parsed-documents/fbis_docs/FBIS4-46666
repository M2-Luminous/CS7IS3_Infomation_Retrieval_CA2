Smirnov; UDC 621.396.96] [Abstract] The problem examined is a reduction of the distorting influence of the atmosphere due to the refraction of radio waves on electronic measurements of the parameters of vehicular motion: the atmospheric refraction correction problem. The theory of the problem is examined. The method proposed for most effective solution of the problem is an iteration scheme for taking into account tropospheric refraction corrections which operates on the principle of successive (step-by-step) refinement of the influence of the troposphere on electronic measurements of the range to the spacecraft and its radial velocity of motion. A block diagram of the method is given. In the first step the correction of electronic measurements is made on the basis of the surface value of the atmospheric refractive index without using a tropospheric model. The second step, based on the surface value of the refractive index and an exponential model of the troposphere, yields refraction corrections with allowance for the real values of the electronic measurements of range and velocity. The use of direct measurement data makes it possible to take the real influence of the troposphere partially into account. The third step, based on application of an algorithm for the inversion of experimental data from electronic measurements, makes it possible to determine the vertical profile of the troposphere corresponding to its real state. This makes it possible to predict highly accurate refraction corrections for electronic measurements. Specific information is given on the accuracies achieved. These determinations can be used in effectively solving problems in space geodesy and radionavigation. Variants of the method are discussed. Figures 2; references: 7 Russian.
