The most recent phenomenon is the creation of the MEPS (Socialist Popular Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico Popular Socialista], which is linked with the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the former Brazilian Communist Party. The MEPS was approved at the national convention of the PPS, which elected evangelical members to run in the elections for the PPS. One of them is Luis Cavalcante, candidate for state deputy for Sao Paulo State. "The PT [Workers Party] is very close to the Catholic Church. That is why I have come to the PPS," Cavalcante said. He added that the PPS has evangelical candidates in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo States. The increase of progressive members identified with the left can be explained as a reaction to the behavior of evangelical congressmen during the Constituent Assembly and at the impeachment of Collor. The MEP (Popular Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico Popular] was created following Collor's election. "Our objective is to encourage evangelicals to participate in social movements," said Reverend Robinson Cavalcante, who supports Lula. According to Reverend Cavalcante, the MEP encourages its members to join leftist parties and the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. Evangelical interest in participating in social movements has increased in the past 10 years, Cavalcante said. Reverend Oneide Bobison, who also supports Lula, mentioned another factor that contributes to the increase of progressive members. "Young clergymen prefer leftist and center-left parties."
