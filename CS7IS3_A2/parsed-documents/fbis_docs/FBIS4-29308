The government panel, headed by Ambassador Howard Dee and the National Democratic Front (NDF) panel led by Luis Jalandoni reached the agreement during a marathon meeting at Breukelen, the Netherlands last 10 to 14 June. In a joint statement, Messrs. Jalandoni and Dee said the next round of talks will "discuss and agree" on the sequence and the functions of different working committees. The reciprocal working committees in turn will study and make recommendations for the panels in order to forge a lasting peace settlement. The talks were earlier stalled because of several misunderstandings on key issues. The NDF had also repeatedly questioned the sincerity of the government. Last month, negotiations between two parties almost broke apart with the capture of Communist Party of the Philippines Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon. After President Ramos ordered her release, optimisms were raised on the gesture's effect on the talks. Mr. Jalandoni said the talks which ended yesterday resulted in the "clarification of issues and perspectives on both sides." Mr. Dee earlier complained about the NDF's hesitance to engage in preliminary talks, saying the political wing of the communist party failed to communicate with the government panel. Mr. Jalandoni said he is pleased with the outcome of the preliminary meeting. "The Breukelen meeting is significant step on the long and tortuous road towards a just and lasting peace in our country," he said. He added the meeting showed the NDF's commitment to lasting peace in the country. The two panels also signed a ten-point agreement preparatory to the resumption of the second round of talks.
