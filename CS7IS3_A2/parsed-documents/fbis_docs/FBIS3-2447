According to a key adviser to China, Xu Simin, the present leadership is inclined to introduce the practice of declaration of economic interests, adding that he hoped it would be implemented in six months. Mr Xu, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC, said senior party leader Li Ruihuan, also chairman of the conference, had agreed to make a declaration. Mr Xu, publisher of the Hong Kong-based monthly THE MIRROR, said he had further suggested that details of the education and work of the children of cadres should be reported. Meanwhile, Cheng Yiu-tong, a Hong Kong delegate to the NPC said yesterday that he would suggest in the congress that the Chinese Government set up an anti-corruption body independent of the government. It was understood that the antigraft body would be similar to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in Hong Kong. A few provincial and municipal legislatures have already taken steps to enact local-level codes on the formation of ICAC-like bodies. Talking to Hong Kong reporters yesterday, Mr Xu said a declaration of assets by leaders would help eliminate graft activities. "It might be likely that some cadres will transfer their money to accounts under the name of their children," he said. It is widely known that children of some senior leaders have been deeply involved with business activities overseas, particularly through Hong Kong. They included the children of Mr Deng, the late Wang Zhen, and the Rong Yiren families. A number of children of current leaders such as Mr Jiang, Mr Li Peng, Mr Qiao Shi are also known to have studied and settled abroad. Mr Xu said: "I'm not fingering any individuals but I just want to propose a way to solve the problem. "Yes. It's possible that there will be a lot of misreporting or underreporting of property. But at least we can have some information to pursue the matter. If people like Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng have made the declaration, others are not to evade the reporting," he said. Mr Xu asserted that the crux of the battle against corruption was to launch the fight at the leading echelon of the party and the government. "If the leaders do not behave themselves you cannot expect the people further down to give a damn to the [anticorruption] campaign," he said. The CPPCC Standing Committee said it reacted strongly at internal meetings on corruption and was critical over the achievements of the campaign since it was launched in August. In an apparent move to quieten discontent, Mr Xu said the central government would hold a nationwide anti-corruption work conference in the next few days. The convening of the work conference coincides with the meetings of the CPPCC plenum which opened yesterday and the plenary session of the NPC scheduled for opening tomorrow. Early this week, premier Li said in a meeting that unless the leadership was serious in the crackdown on corruption, the ruling party might lose its grip on power. During the peak of the pro-democracy movement in 1989, former Communist Party boss Zhao Ziyang suggested that senior officials should make public their wealth and face public scrutiny. His suggestion was rejected by the senior echelon who accused him of using the issue to divide the party.
