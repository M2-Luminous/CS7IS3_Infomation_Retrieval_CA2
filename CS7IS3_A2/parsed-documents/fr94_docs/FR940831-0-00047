Section 404.614 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §404.614 When an application or other form is considered filed. (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and in §§404.630 through 404.633 which relate to the filing date of an application, an application for benefits, or a written statement, request, or notice is filed on the day it is received by an SSA employee at one of our offices or by an SSA employee who is authorized to receive it at a place other than one of our offices. * * * * * 4. Section 404.615 is amended by adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: §404.615 Claimant must be alive when an application is filed. * * * * * (d) If a person who could receive benefits on the basis of a ``deemed'' filing date of an application under §404.633(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i) dies before an application for the benefits is filed, the application may be signed by a person who would be qualified to receive any benefits due the deceased person as explained in §404.633(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii). 5. A new undesignated heading and a new §404.633 are added to read as follows: Deemed Filing Date Based on Misinformation §404.633 Deemed filing date in a case of misinformation. (a) General. You may have considered applying for monthly benefits for yourself or for another person, and you may have contacted us in writing, by telephone or in person to inquire about filing an application for these benefits. It is possible that in responding to your inquiry, we may have given you misinformation about your eligibility for such benefits, or the eligibility of the person on whose behalf you were considering applying for benefits, which caused you not to file an application at that time. If this happened, and later an application for such benefits is filed with us, we may establish an earlier filing date under this section. Example 1: Mrs. Smith, a widow of an insured individual, contacts a Social Security office when she reaches age 60 to inquire about applying for widow's insurance benefits. She is told by an SSA employee that she must be age 62 to be eligible for these benefits. This information, which was incorrect, causes Mrs. Smith not to file an application for benefits. When Mrs. Smith reaches age 62, she again contacts a Social Security office to ask about filing for widow's insurance benefits and learns that she could have received the benefits at age 60. She files an application for these benefits, provides the information required under paragraph (f) of this section to show that an SSA employee provided misinformation, and requests a deemed filing date based on the misinformation which she received from an SSA employee when she was age 60.
