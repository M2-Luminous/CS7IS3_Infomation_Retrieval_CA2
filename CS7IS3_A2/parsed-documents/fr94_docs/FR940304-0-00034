FR940304-0-00034 FR940304-0-00015 The conference report that accompanied Public Law 100&hyph;360 explained clearly the purpose of the requirement for physician diagnostic coding. After rejecting a Senate provision that would have required the use of diagnosis codes on all prescriptions, because they felt that the requirement would have been ``unduly burdensome,'' the conferees agreed to require diagnostic coding for physician services under Part B. They explained their reasons for this requirement as follows: ``This information would be available for immediate use for utilization review of physician services and could be used in the future to facilitate drug utilization review by merging Part B with drug claims data.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess. 191 (1988). Section 1842(p)(2) of the Act authorizes a denial of payment for a bill submitted by a physician on an assignment-related basis if it does not include the appropriate diagnostic coding. Section 1842(p)(3) of the Act directs the Secretary to impose penalties if a physician who is not paid on an assignment-related basis fails to provide the appropriate diagnostic coding on the bill to the Medicare beneficiary. That is, section 1842(p)(3)(A) of the Act provides for a civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000 if the physician knowingly and willfully fails to provide the appropriate diagnostic coding. Section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act provides for a sanction under 1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician ``knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the obligations and requirements of this subsection,'' to furnish appropriate diagnostic coding. Section 1842(p)(3) of the Act does not prohibit the payment of an unassigned claim solely because the physician did not provide diagnosis codes. As explained in section I of the preamble, effective for services furnished on or after September 1, 1990, regardless of whether they provide services on an assignment related basis, physicians submit claim forms directly to the Medicare carrier. The provisions of section 1848 of the Act, as added by 6102(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;239, do not affect the penalties set forth in this rule for failure to include diagnostic coding on physician bills. This final rule implements the provisions of section 1842 (p)(1) and (p)(2) of the Act. III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule On July 21, 1989 we published a proposed rule (54 FR 30558) to implement the provisions of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act. We proposed that each bill or request for payment for physician services under Part B would have to include appropriate diagnostic coding ``as established by the Secretary,'' relating to the nature of the illness or injury for which the Medicare beneficiary received care. As noted above, generally, physician services furnished directly to a beneficiary are paid under Medicare Part B. In addition, under the regulations set forth at subpart D of 42 CFR part 405, we make payments to hospitals under Part A for physician services related to the supervision and teaching of interns and residents who participate in the care of hospital inpatients. Also, the proposed rule did not apply to suppliers or other providers whose services are covered under Part B. We proposed that a physician would be required to furnish diagnosis codes instead of the narrative description that was previously required. We proposed to deny payment for a bill or request for payment for physician services furnished on an assignment-related basis if the bill or request for payment does not contain the appropriate diagnostic coding. This would not be true for a claim for physician services not furnished on an assignment-related basis. In other words, if the beneficiary seeks Medicare reimbursement for payment for physician services, we proposed not to deny payment solely because the claim does not contain diagnosis codes. If enough information were provided to enable a carrier to process the claim, it would be processed without the diagnosis codes. As explained in section II of the preamble, section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act provides for a sanction under section 1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician ``knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the obligations and requirements of this subsection,'' to furnish appropriate diagnostic coding.
