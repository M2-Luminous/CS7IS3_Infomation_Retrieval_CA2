One of the initiators of its establishment, President of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and twice Hero of Socialist Labor, answers the questions of a PRAVDA correspondent. [Drozd] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you appraise the policy of Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries of the CIS with respect to science, first of all basic science? [Paton] The cooperation of labor of scientists of Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries, which were a part of the USSR, is very significant. This cooperation enriched world science with outstanding achievements and discoveries. The harm, which is being done today to science in our countries under the conditions of the growing economic crisis and is hard to compensate for, is all the more perceptible. Creative collectives and traditional ties, which were established by the efforts of scientists of several generations, are disintegrating, the scale of basic research in the most promising, vitally important directions is decreasing. This then and there resulted in a substantial decrease of the overall level of scientific research, affected the quality of the training of scientists and scientific and technical personnel, and caused irreversible consequences in the entire system of education. Today the governments are no longer able to finance properly even the most prestigeous research institutions that are concentrated in the academies of sciences. Hence the mass ``brain drain.'' All this represents an unmistakable threat to the national interests of Russia, Ukraine, and the other sovereign states and is fraught with the most serious consequences for the intellectual potential of our peoples. For, as the great Pasteur noted, science should be the most sublime incarnation of the homeland. At all times in the most developed countries scientists enjoyed special attention and privileges. Precisely the labor of scientists promoted the economic and social progress of these states. It is appropriate to mention that in the five most developed countries (the United States, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, and France) the financing of science per scientific worker came in 1992 on the average to $130,000--several hundredfold more than in our countries. Such a situation threatens us with chronic backwardness and the irrevocable loss of previously gained leading positions in world science. [Drozd] What must be done to correct the situation? [Paton] It is necessary to formulate quickly a goal-oriented technological strategy, which has been coordinated with the program of the structural reorganization of industry and the conversion of the defense complex and with economic organizational transformations. Further it is necessary to increase state support of basic research and to develop the innovation process. To form what is called ``firm'' science, to establish large state sectorial and intersectorial scientific and technological centers in priority directions, and to ensure the rapid transfer of technologies between the civilian and military spheres. All this should be provided for in the state concept of scientific and technical policy. Ukraine, Russia, and the other countries, which have come into being on the territory of the USSR, thus far do not have such a concept. The efficient coordination of the structures of the state management of the scientific and technical sphere and the financial support, which is independent of them, of priority basic scientific research are needed. [Drozd] Will the established association, apparently, serve the restoration of the intellectual potential and broken scientific ties? [Paton] The scientists of the academies of sciences of the republics, which were a part of the USSR, are sincerely interested in the continuation of cooperation that is based on the community of a large number of scientific schools. International experience also confirms that progress in science is impossible both without the narrow specialization of scientists and without the integration of sciences. The role of science and scientists in the establishment and strengthening of a favorable climate of interrelations among states is also indisputable. That is why the aspiration to preserve the jointly produced scientific potential is inducing people to specific actions. One of them is the uniting of leading scientists in the International Association of Academies of Sciences. [Drozd] In what will the activity of the association consist? [Paton] The concept of the association in the process of its formulation and discussion changed, subject to the political situation. And this is understandable. The changes in the state structure and the profound crisis of national and economic relations, by which the countries that were a part of the USSR were affected, are also affecting the sphere of science. It is therefore exceptionally important to create precisely now such conditions for the cooperation of scientists of the sovereign states, which would make it possible to use effectively the common intellectual potential. Of course, the IAAS neither in its goals and functions nor in the nature of its activity will be any administrative superstructure over the national academies of sciences. Each of them (and not just those from the countries of the CIS) in its activity is completely independent of the association and is guided by its own charter and the legislation of its state. The basic work of the association will be concentrated in permanent and temporary committees for fields, directions, and the most important problems of science, which can be established at scientific centers that hold a leading position in their field. Fundamentally important questions of the development of basic science will be discussed at sessions of the general assembly or at conferences of the association. [Drozd] What assets will the IAAS have? Who will finance it? [Paton] It is proposed to carry out the financing of the IAAS both by means of subsidies of the association members themselves and by means of expert and scientific consulting activity and charitable contributions. [Drozd] How many national academies of sciences were founders of the association? [Paton] The establishment of the IAAS has now been supported by 12 countries of the former USSR. The republics of the Baltic region have expressed interest in cooperating with the association after its establishment. The Academies of Sciences of Vietnam, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic are also among those who signed the agreement on the establishment of the Association. The last two did so as observers. Representatives of the international scientific community: Sir Arnold Bergen, president of the Academy of Europe, and Prof. Mohammed Hassan, executive secretary of the Academy of Sciences of the Third World, also took part in the founding meeting of the IAAS. The agreement on the association is open for signing by the academies of sciences of other states.
