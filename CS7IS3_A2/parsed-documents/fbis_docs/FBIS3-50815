Mr. President, what is your first reaction to this announcement by the PA leadership? [Endara] I must say with regret that I will refrain from making any political statements due to the pledge I made to the Panamanian people at the National Theater in November, when I swore that I would remain impartial and would not involve the state and Presidency in political activities. Regarding my government, I must say that the PA's decision does not disband the government alliance; it means that it has been impossible to form an alliance for the 1994 elections. I know this will have certain consequences for the government, but I believe [words indistinct]. [Miller] Mr. President, along those same lines, what will happen with Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] ministers who are in your cabinet? [Endara] I am not planning to ask any of my ministers to resign. [Miller] This disruption of the talks leads to the assumption that the alliance has been broken off, however. [Endara] The break is political and concerns the 1994 elections. This, unquestionably, might and very likely will affect my government, but my duty as president of the Republic and of all Panamanians is to diminish as much as possible the effects of the schism. [Miller] Don't you believe this situation will benefit other political candidates? [Endara] That is a political comment, and I prefer to refrain from answering. [Miller] How do you respond to the views expressed by certain government leaders that ethics dictate that Molirena cabinet ministers should resign and not wait for you to change them? [Endara] I do not know who made that comment, but I would not ask any minister from Molirena or any other party to resign. [Miller] Mr. President, what do you believe will happen from this point on? [Endara] I will pray to God to help me during these difficult times--which they are, unquestionably--and to help me overcome any negative or harmful effects this situation may have on my government. I want this period to go down in history as a true model electoral period for future governments. [Miller] Mr. President, are you not under the impression that too many political parties that are not the parties that formed the alliance which is now in power and was once a civic movement are aspiring to political power? [Endara] I can understand, more or less, what is happening to these presidential hopefuls, because I went through a similar struggle; therefore, I cannot throw the first stone in that sense. I know that, at least in my opinion, service as president of the Republic is not something you seek because you like it. The exercise of power is, rather, a sacrifice on the people's behalf; therefore, I believe that altruistic and not private interests should prevail in these affairs. Within altruistic interests there can be differences. I understand this perfectly well, because I have experienced all of those things. [Miller] A final question, Mr. President. Along those same lines, isn't it true that this schism favors the political party and the deposed military regime that the current government opposed? [Endara] I would like to answer you, Julio, but I must abstain from doing so. I am very sorry, but I must not answer your question.
