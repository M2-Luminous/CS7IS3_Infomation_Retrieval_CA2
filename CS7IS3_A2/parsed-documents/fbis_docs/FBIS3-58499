Butrus-Ghali had asked Yasushi Akashi, his special representative for the former Yugoslavia, to study the feasibility of using the air power offered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at its summit last week. The NATO leaders made the proposal as part of tougher action to relieve a contingent of Canadian UN troops trapped in the eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia to humanitarian flights. Butrus-Ghali met with top aides here Monday on the NATO offer and asked Akashi to formulate a plan for the troop rotation in Srebrenica, which is under siege by the Serbs, UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said. "A second plan is to be prepared with regard to the possible opening of Tuzla airport and the resources that are necessary to achieve this aim," she told reporters. Gastaut sidestepped questions whether the operations would involve the use of NATO air power saying that the option was "part of a general discussion" and "that we will see when we get to it." Also at the meeting here were UN peace envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and other top UN aides. [passage omitted]
