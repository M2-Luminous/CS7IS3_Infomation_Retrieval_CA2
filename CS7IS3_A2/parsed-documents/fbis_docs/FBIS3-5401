"The Kim Yong-sam group is dumping into the sea a fabulous amount of radioactive substances which destroy the natural ecosystem and inflict fatal damages on human body," he noted, and went on: "Such act shows that they are, indeed, an enemy of the nation who is clean indifferent to the existence of the 70 million fellow countrymen, and international criminals who pay no heed to the importance of the international natural ecosystem. "The nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam group is not unrelated to the nuclear development stepped up in secrecy in South Korea. One of the purposes sought by them in their malicious anti-DPRK row over the fictitious `nuclear issue' is to conceal their nuclear development programme. "With the Kim Yong-sam group left alone, the nation cannot evade a nuclear holocaust. "Hanminjon will get firmly united with the patriotic-minded people of various strata in South Korea and wage a vigorous anti-war, anti-nuke movement and force the bellicose group of Kim Yong-sam, a despicable nuclear war servant, out of power."
