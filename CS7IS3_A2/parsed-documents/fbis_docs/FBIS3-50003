The paper says its information has been confirmed by the head of Skodaexport's General Director's Office, Zdenek Sima, and Czech Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lucie Pilipova. The Iranian authorities imprisoned Vladislav Tyl for several days before releasing him. Now back in Prague, he declined to comment on his imprisonment. Tyl was imprisoned just after a delegation left the country from the Skoda heavy engineering works based in Plzen, west Bohemia, which had been creating business contacts in Tehran. Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek told MLADA FRONTA DNES that he did not find out about Tyl's imprisonment until last week, and that he did not know the cause of his arrest. Sima said that although the Iranians apologized to Tyl after releasing him, they did not explain why they had detained him. Sima does not know exactly who detained Tyl. "I do not know whether it was the secret service, counter-intelligence, or the criminal police. I don't think even Tyl knows," he said.
