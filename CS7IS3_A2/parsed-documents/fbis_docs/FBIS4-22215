Mizrakhi, deputy head of administration of Chelyabinsk Oblast, by Ye. Frantseva; place and date not given: "B. Mizrakhi: `Everything Must Be Done To Bring Creative People to the Duma...'"] [Text] Work on the statutes concerning the oblast Duma and procedure for election to it has been completed. Confirmed by the oblast head of administration, the statutes have acquired the force of local law according to which we will henceforth be guided. The heated discussion and debate is behind us... Working in the oblast administration on the election documents during their final stage of preparation was deputy oblast administration head B. Mizrakhi. [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, how did the work go with regard to the statute on the oblast Duma and statute on the election of its deputies? Were these efforts equally complex? [Mizrakhi] It took longer to draw up the Statute on the oblast Duma--we started working on it sooner and it was confirmed later. It elicited a great many more disputes. The statute on elections went smoother. The fact is--here we had very detailed instructions from the Central Electoral Committee. Essentially, 90 percent of the statute was finished. But fundamental parameters were not indicated in the documents we had to use for guidance in developing the statute on the oblast organ of legislative authority. The numerical strength of the body, for example. Just principles were presented, and arguing over principles is more complicated. Perhaps it was easier, therefore, to reach accord between entirely diverse parties and movements developing their own draft parallel to the administration effort. It must be said that the edicts of the Russian president that were issued one after another concerning structures of power in krays and oblasts--coming out in November, December, and January--also left their mark on the process of preparing the document on the Duma itself. They complicated our work. Edict No. 2266, for example, significantly narrowed the provisions of the Russian Federation Law "On the Kray and Oblast Soviet, Kray and Oblast Administration." Specifically, the provision disappeared according to which it was possible for the oblast organ of representational authority to express a lack of confidence in the head of administration. Like other aspects, this factor had to be taken into account in drawing up the statute on the Duma. [Frantseva] Well, what articles in the statutes on elections and on the Duma itself caused the most difficulties? What elicited the greatest argument in drawing up the documents? [Mizrakhi] The most problematic was probably the question of principles for nominating candidates. What system should be used in the election--majority-based or mixed? Or a proportional system only, i.e., by party slates? The latter prospect was rejected immediately. But the mixed system, the system used for elections to the State Duma, had quite a number of supporters. Guiding documents from the center recommended a majority-based system--by single-seat districts. A mixed system was also permitted, but on an experimental basis. We decided on an election by single-seat districts. I am personally convinced that under today's conditions a mixed system is not suitable for the oblast. The parties that are represented in our oblast have from 50 to 200 members. Can they represent the interests of large enough groups of voters? Of course not! The representatives of parties and movements agreed during the final stage of work on the draft that ordinary elections--by single-seat districts, would be appropriate today all the same for the oblast. There was disagreement as to how many signatures a candidate for the oblast Duma should have to collect in his own support in order to be registered. There were a great many proposals. Agreement was reached that for the initial stage, no less than 4 percent of the total number of voters in the district had to support a candidate. [Frantseva] After the full oblast soviet, a Duma of 15 deputies is unusual. Why was it decided to have precisely this number of deputies in the oblast's representative organ of power? [Mizrakhi] Well, this too was one of the issues discussed to a fairly great extent. There has been a strong trend in recent times towards reducing the number of deputies in representational organs of authority at all levels. But the presidential edict provided us the opportunity to decide on the Duma and on 50 deputies. We were interested in seeing what decision was reached in other regions where elections had already taken place. There was a great spread. In Moscow a Duma of 35 deputies was elected, in Leningrad Oblast--of 20 deputies, in Kurgan Oblast--25. While in Vologda, Kostroma, and Tambov Oblasts, there were 15 deputies, and in Kamchatka--16. We had proposals to elect 17 and 19 deputies to the Duma. This question was examined very closely with the need to divide the oblast into an appropriate number of electoral districts of approximately equal value. We decided upon the figure 15 as a result. All the same, I do not think the number is the most important thing--this is not what will determine the effectiveness of the representational authority. Everything will be decided by which deputies we elect, on how prepared they turn out to be for work in the Duma and how responsible they are. We must do everything we can to see to it that the Duma assembles true creators, people who favor specific deeds over words, who enjoy the confidence of the people and have a rich experience of organizational and administrative work. There are such people in the oblast. [Frantseva] What public proposals, including those of parties and movements, were taken into account in the final version of the statute on the Duma? [Mizrakhi] Articles were included providing for the Duma to adopt oblast regulations and amend them. The Duma's right to legislative initiative was not originally secured in the draft. This was corrected. Also taken into account was the general opinion concerning incompatibility of the status of deputy with an official position or activity in state or other organs. A provision was proposed and inserted into the final version of the document to the effect that a candidate for deputy of the oblast Duma need not reside in the territory of the electoral district for which seat he is campaigning. [Frantseva] It is not infrequently today that we hear it said that the executive authority is creating "under itself" a representational authority in the oblast. And has even invented a name for it... [Mizrakhi] Well, the Duma can change its name. It is its prerogative, as I have already stated, to adopt the oblast regulations and amend them. Should the deputies consider it advisable to introduce amendments to the statute on elections to the Duma, they have the right to do so. By edict of the president, the administration was charged with the responsibility of setting elections to a new organ of representational authority and this is what it did, just as executive organs of authority have done in other krays and oblasts. I have stated many times and wish to repeat here that when you have a situation where one branch of power exists without another, that is an abnormal situation. We need a balance of power. [Frantseva] But why has the election been put off for such a long time--not set for March, as stipulated by presidential edict, and not even for April, but for mid-May? And now it has been proposed, as we recall, for June? [Mizrakhi] The right to make a definitive decision here belongs to the head of the administration. I do not conceal the fact that opinions diverged on this account even within the administration itself. I am one who worked in favor of the election being held at an earlier time frame. But today, now that the decision has been made, there is no place for argument in my view. We must focus attention on preparations for the election. Especially since the Central Electoral Commission has postponed the election of deputies to the Council of the Federation for our oblast to 15 May. [Frantseva] Boris Aleksandrovich, the overwhelming majority of participants in meetings with presidential representative V. Seleznev, as well as members of the working group preparing draft documents on the oblast Duma and elections to it, were from the communist and national-patriotic parties and movements. It is difficult to believe that the leaders of democratic organizations were not invited to take part in these discussions... [Mizrakhi] Unfortunately, their activity level was truly low. The administration received proposals from only a few democratically oriented parties and movements. Their absence from meetings held by V. Seleznev, meetings I participated in, even provided a pretext for accusing me of abandoning democratic principles. Not true! It is simply that those whose views I share failed to show the level of interest in drawing up documents on the election which was exhibited by their opponents. I did everything I could under my control. I engaged in consultations, met with V. Kislitsin representing the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, with N. Shchapin of the Republican Party, and others. As a member of the executive committee of Russia's Choice, I have fought and continue to fight without reservation for democratic principles. Without a doubt, democratic forces in the oblast must work today to quickly surmount disunity. They must join forces. I have great expectations of the recently established bloc Accord, which unites adherents of reforms, including Russia's Choice. I would like to believe that the efforts of this electoral bloc during the election campaign will prove highly productive. [end Mizrakhi] This interview was conducted the end of last week, prior to B. Mizrakhi's trip to Moscow where he participated in a conference of the Social Chamber of the Russian Federation president. Upon his return, B. Mizrakhi stated that the conference was dedicated to elections of representational organs of authority of Federation entities and elections of organs of local self-government. Results of the elections were analyzed at the locations where the elections were held. In some cases these results are disturbing, it was noted at the conference. Serious violations were uncovered with respect to the conduct of the election in a number of regions. In certain oblasts, the majority of deputy seats went to opponents of the president. Great differences were noted in the election provisions of organs of local self-government. A desire was expressed in this regard reflecting the advisability of forming organs of local self-government following the adoption of the appropriate federal law. Conference participants also expressed support for postponing the elections of representational authority in Federation entities until June. Thus, the election in our oblast is not an exception, but rather falls under the general trend. Incidentally, the Central Electoral Committee today noted the carefulness of preparations for the election in our oblast, considering it greater than that exercised in many other oblasts.
