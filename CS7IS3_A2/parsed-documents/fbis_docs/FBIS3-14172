This was conveyed by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, to a 12-member group of Congress-I MP's [Members of Parliament] during their meeting in New Delhi today. She agreed that a solution to the Kashmir issue should be found by India and Pakistan bilaterally within the framework of the Simla Agreement. Briefing newsmen, Mr. V.N. Gadgil and Mr. Hanumanthappa said it was agreed that India and the United States should continue their dialogue to remove misunderstandings and misconceptions. The Congress-I MP's told Ms. Raphel that in Kashmir the political process could not be revived because of Islamabad's continued support to terrorists. She agreed that some hired persons were used by militants in the Hazratbal Shrine incident. The MP's told her that Kashmir should not be treated as a communal problem as Pakistan is trying to make out. Other members of the group included Mr. M.M. Jacob, Mr. Sushil Kumar Shinde, Mr. S.S. Ahluwalia, and Mr. Indrajit. During her meeting with the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, Ms. Raphel reiterated that the United States will continue to urge Pakistan to stop aiding and abetting terrorists operating in India. She conveyed her government's appreciation for India's transparency in Jammu and Kashmir. Ms. Raphel said the main objective of her visit is to clear the misunderstandings created recently and to place Indo-U.S. relations on a sound footing. The home minister said that certain statements from Washington have adversely affected the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He emphasized that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the Indian people will not tolerate attempts to undermine the nation's territorial integrity. Earlier, during her meeting with the head of the American Division in the External Affairs Ministry, she discussed the issues on which there are some differences in the positions of the two countries. Ms. Raphel also met a member of the National Human Rights Commission, Mr. Virendra Dayal. Mr. Dayal told her that respect for human rights is central to India's ethos and traditions and the country is determined to uphold these values. The Clinton administration's offer to Pakistan in return for a freeze on its nuclear weapons program includes supply of not only F-16 fighters but also P-3 antisubmarine warfare planes. This has been reported by the NEW YORK TIMES. PTI quotes analysts in Washington to say that the proposed plan will not require Pakistan to abandon its nuclear program. On the other hand, the analysts are of the view that the plan would legitimize Pakistan's nuclear program so that it could be used as a lever against India.
