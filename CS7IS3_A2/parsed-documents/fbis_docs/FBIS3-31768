Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov's office said after he met with a delegation from the European Union that the talks could be held "under the auspices of the United Nations and with the help of the European Union." The EU delegation headed by European Commissioner for Foreign Relations Hans van den Broek was to relay the Macedonian offer to Greek authorities who broke off negotiations on the dispute last October. Van den Broek said he would meet Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias later Wednesday and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou the following day. He hinted that he may then return to Skopje for further discussions. Van den Broek stressed that it was essential to end the dispute between the two countries to avoid an escalation of the conflict, which has irked Greece's EU partners who have threatened to haul Athens before the European Court of Justice. "Both sides are aware they they are living in a dangerous part of the world," van den Broek said. "And good neighboring relations between Athens and Skopje are a prerequisite to prevent an escalation in the region." Greece announced on February 16 that it was blocking all trade to Macedonia through the northern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the country's imports including oil. Athens justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and by claiming that the former Yugoslav republic has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name. Earlier Wednesday Papoulias said that Athens wishes to have good relations with its neighbor but the latter must accept the "logical" demands made by the Greek Government. The demands call for "Skopje", the name Athens uses to designate Macedonia, to stop "hostile propaganda" against Greece, to remove from its national flag a sun symbol that reflects the ancient Greek dynasty of Macedonia and to remove a constitutional clause calling for the liberation of Macedonia. Meanwhile, Belgium Wednesday, in an apparent affront to Athens over the seemingly endless dispute, recognized The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the provisional name given it pending a resolution of the conflict. Six other EU countries recognised Macedonia before Greece took over the Union's revolving six-month presidency in January.
