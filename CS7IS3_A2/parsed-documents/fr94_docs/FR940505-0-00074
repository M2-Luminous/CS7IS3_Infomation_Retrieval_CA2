FR940505-0-00074 FR940505-0-00020 Accordingly, the definition for ``low-cost items'' in the final rule is the same definition that the Internal Revenue Service uses and includes a provision for annually increasing the cost of such items based on the cost of living. Ten comments stated that requiring a separate certification at the time of mailing would be an administrative and logistical burden for mailers and the Postal Service, urged that mailers needed more information about the process and the consequences of improper certification, and questioned why such a statement could not be included on the mailing statement for each mailing. It was also suggested that the application for special bulk third-class mailing privileges be modified to state that the organization will submit only mailings it thinks qualify for the special bulk third-class rates. In response to these comments, it should be noted that the intended purpose of the certification statement was more instructive than regulatory. That is, the Postal Service was concerned that nonprofits should be aware of the restrictions on nonprofit rates. Because mailing statements are often signed by agents, there was concern that the nonprofits themselves may not be aware of the new rules. Further, although the publication of these rules and a one-time notice to the nonprofit organization would provide sufficient legal notice, the Postal Service took notice that the officers of nonprofit organizations, particularly smaller ones, regularly change, and was concerned that new officers might not be aware of the rules. Nevertheless, in view of the hardships noted by comments, a separate certification will not be required. Instead, the mailing statement that must be completed for each mailing will be modified to refer to the DMM section in which the standards for advertisements are located, as a reminder and a reference. The Postal Service will also explore other ideas to promote awareness of the rules, such as providing information pertaining to this final rule to qualified organizations before the effective date of the rule change. Four comments expressed confusion between advertising, public ``thank yous,'' and free advertisements, and asked for clarification. The definition for advertising that will be used to administer the new eligibility requirements for special bulk third-class matter is in DMM E211.11.1. As discussed above, public service announcements for which no consideration is paid are not considered advertising as stated in DMM E211.11.2. Two examples of a public service announcements are ``Support the Red Cross Blood Drive'' and ``Buy U.S. Savings Bonds.'' Eighty-one comments raised a variety of conflicting views from the perspective of commercial mailers and small or local religious and charitable organizations. The commercial mailers stated that it is unfair to business owners who are not members of a qualified organization to allow qualified organizations to include advertisements of their members in the materials they mail at the special bulk third-class rates, and higher postage should be paid when third-party advertisements are mailed with materials of a qualified organization. The small nonprofit organizations argued against imposing additional restrictions on the advertising in their publications and other materials they mail at the special bulk third-class rates. In general, those comments concern suggestions that the Postal Service has no authority to implement. The Postal Service is required to administer the statutory provisions that prohibit only certain types of advertising in nonprofit mail matter. Three comments (two colleges and a religious organization) stated that advertisements for similar types of organizations and affiliated organizations should be permitted in materials mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. The statutes and implementing rules look to the nature of the product or service promoted, rather than to the identity of the advertiser. As noted above, paid advertisements for ``substantially related'' products or services may be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates, regardless of the identity of the advertiser. One comment stated that the proposed regulations do not include provisions for informing mailers of enforcement decisions or of measures that may serve to assist mailers plan future mailings. Notice of changes in these standards will be published by the Postal Service in accordance with its usual procedures for rulemaking. Two comments suggested that the proposed definition of ``periodical publication'' goes beyond the requirements of the new statute. Nothing in the new statute suggests an intent to modify the established postal definition of periodical publication derived from statutory standards, which the Postal Service believes to be consistent with the common usage and understanding of that term among mailers. The use of the existing definition for a periodical publication would seem consistent with the statute and would in addition help avoid ambiguity and confusion. Seventy-six comments stated that the proposed rule change is vague and complex, does not clearly define ``substantially related'' and ``contribute importantly,'' and does not indicate whether ``front-end'' and ``back-end'' premiums as well as emblematic products will qualify for mailing at the reduced rates. The Postal Service does not believe the rule is unclear. Moreover, the final rule clearly states that the phrases ``substantially related'' and ``contribute importantly'' will be administered in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rulings and precedents. In addition, as discussed, the Postal Service will produce a publication to provide further guidance and examples concerning the rules. The question whether front-end and back-end premium products, as well as emblematic products, are eligible for the special rates will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the statutory restrictions concerning the mailing of ``products.'' That is, these products must meet the definition for low-cost items, be donated or contributed to the mailing organization, or be periodical publications. Thirty-seven comments stated that they oppose retroactive applicability of eligibility restrictions if the qualified organization made an innocent mistake or lacked knowledge of the restriction at the time of mailing, and requested that the Postal Service excuse ``minor infractions'' regarding advertisements that do not meet the ``substantially related'' test. The statute does not provide any such exceptions, and the Postal Service is required to ``maintain procedures for the prompt collection of postage deficiencies arising from'' these rules. 39 U.S.C. 3626(k)(3). See also 39 U.S.C. 2601(a)(1), which requires the Postal Service to ``collect debts due to the Postal Service.'' Indeed, the granting of an exception to some noncomplying mailers would appear to discriminate against mailers who pay postage at the appropriate rate. 39 U.S.C. 403(c). Here, the final rule is being published in advance of its effective date to give mailers time to adjust their methods of operation, and the regulations contain sufficient detailed information to help mailers ensure that they comply with the new eligibility restrictions. In addition, mailers may obtain private legal or financial advice and counsel to assist in making their decisions. Nevertheless, the Postal Service will continue to consider requests for compromise or settlement of revenue deficiencies on a case-by-case basis, consistent with existing postal policies.
