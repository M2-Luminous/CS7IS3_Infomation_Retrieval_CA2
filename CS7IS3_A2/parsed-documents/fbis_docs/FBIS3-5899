The American Consulate told the representatives of 21 travel agents in this area on Friday afternoon that the consulate would cease to issue visas through agents effective April 1. "This is a retaliatory step against us as there has been a move among us to denounce the consulate's earlier decision to restrict the number of travel agents authorized to handle visa requests," a travel agency official said. The consulate said that beginning April 1 travel agents or individuals should apply for visas directly at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. The U.S. Consulate said, however, it would continue to handle visa reissuance for those in Pusan and South and North Kyongsang Provinces, whose application, it said, should be filed individually not through travel agents. The new decision is expected to cause much inconveniences to would-be U.S. travelers as well as to adversely affect the business of travel agents in the region. "We will condemn this measure of the U.S. Consulate General through large-scale rallies to be held jointly with citizens organizations," the travel agency official said.
