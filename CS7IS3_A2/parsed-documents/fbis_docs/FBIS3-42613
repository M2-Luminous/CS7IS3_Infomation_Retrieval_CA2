However, on the other hand, Mr. Pavlenko believes that the departure of the first prime minister will "bring to the surface the polarization of forces that exists within the government, and will make the government more controllable--through the parliament, through political pressure." Nonetheless, as Mr. Pavlenko states, the fact of Gaydar's resignation will entail a new cycle of inflation in any event, and the exchange rate of the dollar will increase to 3,500-5,000 rubles [R] or perhaps more. In his opinion, there are no financial causes for inflation; it has been caused by "the mood of panic among small-, medium-, and a proportion of large-scale entrepreneurs, and in commercial structures" in conjunction with the departure of Yegor Gaydar and general political instability. In the opinion of Sergey Pavlenko, the departure of Yegor Gaydar from the Cabinet of Ministers and the expected resignation of Boris Fedorov, who attempted to pursue a firm financial policy and came out in favor of reducing state subsidies to industry, the military-industrial complex, etc., means that inflation will not be contained successfully because, to this end, members of the government "must have personal courage and not be members of the social group of industry managers, but rather be a separate political force." In his opinion, there are no such people among the expected new members of the cabinet. Besides, at present "it is not even the change of government that poses the greatest danger, but rather its passivity in the environment of cadre and geographical movements. At present, officials are not working, but rather battling over slots in the new government building, the White House," said the first deputy chief of the working center for economic reforms. In general, Sergey Pavlenko thinks that an enhancement of the reform is out of the question in the immediate future; the main task is "to hold on to what has been accomplished by Gaydar, in particular, to prevent the redistribution of property and hyperinflation." Meanwhile, a highly placed government expert who did not wish to be identified stated that a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the national currency is not due to Gaydar's resignation at all because the rate of inflation in 1994 was preordained by decisions of the Russian Federation Government, made in November and December 1993, concerning the almost twofold increase in salaries for the employees of the budget-financed sector, the payment of budget arrears on social programs going into billions, and the allocation of subsidies to the coal industry. All of this, in the opinion of the expert, "generates a powerful inflationary charge for the coming months." The expert believes that the growth of prices may be spurred on the most by the indexation of fixed assets carried out effective 1 January. The book value of funds acquired before 1 July 1992 is being increased by factors of 26 to 44, those purchased in the fourth quarter of 1993 by a factor of 1.4, and so on. As a result of this, amortization allowances and, correspondingly, the producer cost of all products will increase sharply. Besides, Russian Federation Minister of Agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha is demanding state investment exceeding the sum of R27 trillion for the impoverished agro-industrial complex, intimidating the government with the failure of spring field work (to be sure, for now he has been promised R9 trillion for 1994, which is a sizable amount, too). A major increase in prices for services took effect on 1 January; transportation tariffs were raised. To the expert's mind, it is absolutely obvious that all of these actions will cause, in response, a wave of social demands to increase wages, and will create yet another inflationary detonator. In conjunction with this, the expert suggested that at a minimum, the growth of prices by a factor of seven lies in store for Russia in 1994 (the growth of prices by a factor of 4.7, which is lower than in 1993 by a factor of two, is projected officially). The expert doubted the reliability of official data indicating a decline in the rate of price inflation in December to 13 percent; he said that inflation had not dropped below 20 percent.
