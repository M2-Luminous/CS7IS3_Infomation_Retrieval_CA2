In this way, he indicated that the economy had gone through the worst period. In January, industrial production and shipping indexes increased and an inventory-shipment ratio declined. Referring to this, Kumagai noted that there were signs of recovery in consumer spending and other areas. He said: "Although the sales of high-priced products are still sluggish, they are gradually picking up." Concerning the imports of U.S. autos and auto parts discussed in the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks, Kumagai said: "It is necessary for the Japanese industry to have a correct understanding of what the United States is thinking."
