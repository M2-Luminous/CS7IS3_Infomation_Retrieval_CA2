According to press reports Tuesday [21 June], Danbaba said retired Vice-Admiral Elegbede was cut down Sunday by more than 70 bullets when the killers armed with automatic rifles forced his car to stop on the Oworonshoki expressway. Elegbede, 52, had also served as head of administration in Defence Headquarters under former junta leader General Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down in August last year. Police said that they had arrested some suspects over the murder, but the motives were not known. Elegbede was shot as he stepped out of his car to find out what was amiss, Danbaba said. He ran a few metres (yards) but was pursued and sprayed with bullets. The assailants even held his throat to ensure that he stopped breathing, the reports quoted the police boss as saying. Police officers who arrived at the scene engaged the assassins in a shoot-out and injured one of them, Danbaba said. But his colleagues were able to carry him into Elegbede's car and they drove off. One of the guns recovered from the assassins is suspected to be a typical smuggler's weapon and is not part of the armoury of the Armed Forces or police, police said.
