In reply to a reporter's question whether the coalition is in danger, after the SDPP Central Administrative Council meeting, Karayalcin retorted: The arithmetic of the results do not indicate this. Karayalcin announced that his party's Central Administrative Council will convene again tomorrow and following the joint meeting of the SDPP Turkish Grand National Assembly group and ministers, the SDPP Party Council will also probably meet on the weekend. Karayalcin said: [Begin recording] [Karayalcin] Undoubtedly, the Party Council will assess the matter in all its aspects. It will also appraise the achievements of the coalition government. All your questions will be answered after those deliberations. As you know, we are also engaged in work on economic matters. Moreover, we have not yet received all the data that will allow us to make statistical evaluations. [Unidentified reporter] Will the government introduce a package of price increases? [Karayalcin] Statements concerning this subject will be issued later; not by me, probably by the relevant minister. [Unidentified reporter] What did you discuss during today's Central Administrative Council meeting? [Karayalcin] We assessed the elections. [Unidentified reporter] What is the general trend? What are the assessments? [Karayalcin] In actual fact, we have not yet received all the input to enable our colleagues to make detailed evaluations. Nevertheless, the members of the council observed that there is a general shift in political preference in Turkey. A political formation leaning towards rightist parties, especially extreme rightist parties, has emerged in recent elections. The indications were noticeable in previous elections as well. There were signs in 1993. In the 1994 local elections, this trend emerged very clearly. Given the impressions of party members and citizens, our council members expressed concern over the possibility that our citizens could change their preference for a Western-style democracy. [end recording] Answering another question, Karayalcin remarked that his party and the leftists failed to receive the desired results in the elections and that the total votes decreased by 25 percent.
