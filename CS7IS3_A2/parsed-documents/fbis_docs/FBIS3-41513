Five years ago there were about 2.6 million ha [hectares] of treeless mountain areas, and soil erosion was getting worse. To reverse this situation the province set up 490 model tree-planting centers which planted trees on a total area of about 63,000 ha. The centers were also responsible for popularizing advanced technology, and techniques of transplanting trees and cultivating seedlings. Now there are more than 13,000 tree-planting units and forest farms in Jiangxi which are responsible for their own profits and losses. In 1993 the afforested area in the mountain regions of Jiangxi was about 38,000 ha. Statistics show that from 1989 to 1992 the afforested area in the province amounted to 184,000 ha, and the forest coverage rate in the province rose from 30 percent in 1988 to 40.3 percent in 1992.
