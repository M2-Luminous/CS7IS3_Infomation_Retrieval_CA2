The four-star hotel, located in the western sector of the province near Chibirico, has 200 rooms. Fidel toured the hotel, accompanied by authorities and an enthusiastic group of Canadian and German tourists. After getting over their surprise at seeing Castro, all the tourists tried to get near him, and to get souvenirs. [Begin recording] [Unidentified woman in French] Mr. Castro [words indistinct], if you please. [Castro] There you go. [Unidentified woman in French] Thank you, thank you, Mr. Castro. [end recording] The Cuban president admired the hotel, which has been built in the form of terraces on the slope of a mountain. The hotel is part of the tourist development center of the Sierra Maestra Park. Last night, following the event for the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution, and the ceremony during which Fidel Castro was presented with the shield of the city, Fidel met with reporters. [Begin recording] [Reporter] Commander, today you were awarded the highest distinction in the city. How do you feel? [Castro] I am very embarrassed. [Reporter] Embarrassed? [Castro] Yes. I am embarrassed when I receive those honors and distinctions. Of course, I am honored, but also embarrassed. I do not consider myself deserving of so many honors. [Reporter] But it is inevitable that you should receive them. It is a way to thank you. [Castro] When someone gives you something, you must be courteous and accept it. [laughter] [Reporter] Commander, do you know.... [Castro, interrupts] [Words indistinct] I can only accept it. [Reporter] Commander, we Cubans like to make comparisons. The people are asking themselves whether the most difficult year of the special period is now behind us. What do you think? [Castro] I believe this has been the most difficult year. We must do our best to ensure that it was the most difficult. We can do that in 1994 by working more and well. If we do that, we can make the situation change. Proof of this is the sugarcane harvest. The fact that we have a smaller harvest this year means that we are not changing the situation. This is why we must ensure that this harvest is in accordance with the plans. We must mill all the sugarcane we have planned to mill. We must mill it efficiently. This will show us whether we can change the situation. We will then know if we can produce 200,000, 300,000, or 400,000 tons of sugar. It is a good test. We have worked hard and put forth special efforts. New things have been done and we should begin to see some results. For example, the work being done by the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], and the support of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] in the agricultural sector -- they have thousands of soldiers working and producing. We must continue to increase our oil production. We must begin to see our first results in the field of exploration, not extraction, of oil. We must continue to promote tourism. The measures we are taking to decriminalize the excess currency should begin to yield good results. We may begin to see some signs of progress if we do things right. The important thing is to change the situation, even though it is a difficult situation. We are experiencing a special period, the blockade has deepened, and there is an international economic crisis. These are not favorable conditions. This is why we have said that we must overcome not only our problems, but the objective problems experienced by the world, and continue to develop. [Reporter] I saw you five years ago when you launched the socialism or death slogan. Today when I saw you hold up a replica of Antonio Maceo's machete, I could tell that you were more filled with emotion than you were five years ago. Why? [Castro] It is only logical. It is a replica of Antonio Maceo's machete and it was a great honor to receive it. I regret not having a horse like the one Maceo had. I regret not having an enemy in front of me. All I needed was the enemy and Maceo's horse. The truth is that Maceo's machete strengthens the arm and energizes the mind. [end recording]
