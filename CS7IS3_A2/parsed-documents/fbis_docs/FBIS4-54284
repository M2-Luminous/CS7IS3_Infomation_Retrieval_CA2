The proposal incorporates a nuclear inspection system consisting of the three on-site inspection methods -- seismological inspection method, a method to inspect radioactive fallout, and an international inspection method -- as means to inspect nuclear tests conducted secretly. At the working session, Yoshitomo Tanaka, ambassador accredited to the Geneva disarmament conference, announced for the first time that a comprehensive inspection system should be established after coordinating and incorporating each nation's own inspection methods into Japan-proposed system. He then asked the member nations to conclude negotiations by the time Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is extended next April.
