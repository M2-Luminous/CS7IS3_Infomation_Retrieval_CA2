FBIS3-19144 "drweu049_j_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY _o_Parties Minimize Foreign Policy 94P20464A 94P20464A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Media statements by Italy's major political parties and their leaders have largely ignored foreign policy issues during the campaign for the 27-28 March parliamentary elections. Exceptions have been the leftist Progressive Alliance's internal debate on the role of NATO and comments made by several political figures on the recent UN action in shooting down four Bosnian Serb military aircraft. PDS's Ochetto Visits NATO The only mention of foreign policy in the election platform presented by the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) on 15 February addressed the subject in general terms only. A summary of the platform appeared in the Rome daily L'UNITA--the PDS paper--on 16 February, stating that the aim of the PDS is to promote supranational integration, reform the United Nations, ensure equal rights for all ethnic communities, develop a responsible policy on cooperation, eliminate all protectionism, and fight international crime. Regarding Europe, the PDS platform presses for a European seat on the UN Security Council, increasing the powers of the European Commission, Parliament, and central bank, and developing a common European policy on labor, research, training, and taxation. PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto publicly disagreed with assertions by his Progressive Alliance coalition partner, Communist Renewal (RC) Secretary Fausto Bertinotti, that NATO should be abolished because the Warsaw Pact no longer exists and that NATO now often violates its strictly defensive role, a remark reported in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO on 24 February. While visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels on 28 February, Occhetto said that Italy must remain in NATO. An article by Marco Panara in Rome's LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March reported Occhetto's opinion that while it does not make sense for Italy to leave NATO, NATO's role must be redefined. "NATO must now be equipped to deal with the new and different challenges that present themselves to peace," Occhetto said. Panara wrote that the PDS envisages NATO maintaining close cooperation with other international organizations, especially the UN. In discussing his meeting at NATO headquarters, Occhetto said that granting representation to major regional areas to prevent the poorer countries from feeling neglected was discussed, and added that the PDS's intent to "impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role" was welcomed by NATO Secretary General Manf red Woerner. On the Balkans, Occhetto said he had no doubt that "we must intervene in Bosnia and the international community must take up an active position" (LA REPUBBLICA, 10 February). At the NATO headquarters meeting, Occhetto defended the shooting down of the four Bosnian Serb military aircraft, as reported in the RAI Due Television Network on 28 February. RC Against NATO, Intervention in Bosnia As reported by correspondent Maurizio Caprara in the Milan daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA on 24 January, two anti-NATO motions were filed at the RC congress held in late January. The first motion requested that Italy leave NATO and the second requested "fighting against NATO." According to another Caprara article in CORRIERE DELLA SEFA of 24 February, in presenting RC's political platform, party leader Armando Cossuta reaffirmed the demand for eliminating NATO. Caprara emphasized that Cossuta called for "elimination" of--rather than an "exit" from--NATO. According to an article in LA REPUBBLICA of 1O February, RC has taken a stand against foreign armed intervention in Bosnia. As reported in LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March, the party harshly condemned the downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. RC officials asserted that the action may adversely affect the fragile truce in the area. They added that NATO seemed to be looking for a pretext to address the Bosnia problem by military rather than diplomatic means. Northern League Ignores Foreign Issues The Northern League has not focused on foreign policy issues. A 27 February Rome ANSAMAIL Database version of the League's platform totally ignored the subject. A rare monitored reference to a foreign issue appeared in LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March, stating that the League welcomed the news of the NATO downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. The League statement called the action a positive fact and added that NATO's role in Bosnia is confirming how essential NATO is for European security. Forza Italia Supports Military Force in Bosnia ANSAMAIL reported on 28 February that Forza Italia's political platform states: "We want an Italy that is once again a prime mover in the history of Europe, playing an active role in the process of European unification, no longer basing its foreign policy on improvisation but on the correct definition of its national interests." On the Balkans, LA REPUBBLICA of 1O February reported a comment by Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi to the effect that peacemaking actions in Bosnia must be backed by military force and that "Italy must support, within the European Community, the `line of determination,' making available its prestige and its military bases." National Alliance `Cannot Abide' U.S. The National Alliance (AN) "cannot abide the Americans," wrote LA REPUBBLICA correspondent Antonello Caporale on 1 March. The Alliance dreams of a Greater Europe, with East and West finally united and with "no subjugation" to the United States. According to Caporale, AN believes in European autonomy in political and military decisionmaking and espouses a broad-based alliance with South America, with Italy and Spain "as its vanguard of special influence." AN also wants a "30-year European plan for Africa, which would act as a European pillar in competing with the United States and the Far East," Caporale reports. According to Caporale, the AN has called for an unspecified "revision" of the Maastricht Treaty; for Istria, Rijeka, and Dalmatia to be returned to Italy "by means of international treaty"; and for Europe to have a seat on the UN Security Council. In an interview in the Milan daily IL GIORNALE of 31 January, AN ideologue Pino Rauti said he "criticizes Americanism and mercantilism." Italian Liberal Party Calls for Renegotating Maastricht In an opening statement at the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) congress in early February, PLI member and Transport Minister Raffaele Costa has suggested the need for renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty, and in an interview given to IL GIORNALE on 4 February, Costa said he will challenge the European Union (EU) over its "bureaucratic and welfarist approach" and will demand that the treaty be "renegotiated and its implementation reviewed." Pact for Italy Embraces `Western Ideals' The only monitored mention of interest in foreign policy issues by the Pact for Italy appeared in a 2 March CORRIERE DELLA SERA article, which briefly reviewed the Pact's program. According to this article, the program called for a foreign policy that "espouses the Western ideals of freedom and democracy with a view to countering the resurgent specter of ethnic, racial, and religious hatred." Commentary Notes Lack of Interest in Foreign Affairs The lack of a foreign policy in the political platform of most Italian parties was commented on by Franco Venturini in CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 15 February. Venturini wrote that Italy "must learn to create its own foreign policy based on internal [Italian] consensus," which means the country's foreign policy will be different depending on whether the Right or the Left wins in the parliamentary elections. Venturini saw truly "revanchist" feelings concealed in AN leader Gianfranco Fini's attitude toward Istria and Dalmatia, and anti-Western resentment lurking in the fringe groups of the extreme right. On the left, the PDS is allied with RC, which applauds Fidel Castro, Venturini wrote. In the center, silence reigns and an "antihistorical temptation to remain collusively passive is still felt." Venturini concluded his commentary with some dark humor. He reported Foreign Minister Andreatta's quip that Berlusconi rhymes with Zhirinovskiy, that the Italian Republican Party organ VOCE REPUBBLICANA had compared Fini with Nazi German official Von Ribbentrop, and that Italian Popular Party member Rocco Buttiglione had charged Northern League leader Umberto Bossi with being a new fuehrer. With this evidence in hand, Venturini wondered why anyone would still believe that Italy's electoral campaign is neglecting the outside world.
