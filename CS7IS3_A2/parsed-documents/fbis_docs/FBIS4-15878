Pozner begins by asking Grachev why he thinks young people are generally so unwilling to join the Army. Grachev answers that the country's political leaders have changed their attitudes to the Army and the Army has been left to fend for itself. Second, the Army has "opened up" and all the Army's troubles are known to everyone. The Russian Army is still a young one -- only two years old next month. When he became defense minister, Grachev says, the first thing he felt was that the legislative base of the Army had to be changed. He points out the moral and physical attributes required to serve in the Army. Pozner then opens the discussion to the floor. A young man asks why an Army is needed in a country where "three main chiefs gathered together and destroyed a single state at Belovezhskaya Pushcha" [reference to meeting in Brest between President Boris Yeltsin, Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk announced the end of the USSR], and why, contrary to the law, it is trying to recruit students from the new humanitarian university? Grachev replies that the Army is an instrument of the state and its main job is to ensure the security of the state. As far as students are concerned, they are called up only from places that do not have military departments. Pozner then asks: "Pavel Sergeyevich, does the Defense Ministry give recommendations on the call-up? In particular, did you present your point of view to anyone?" Grachev replies: "You... [pauses] Many people are acquainted with the law on defense. The former Supreme Soviet adopted a law on defense in which it determined the strength of the Armed Forces, which, it said, should comprise one percent of the overall population. At the present moment we have about 150 million. That means we must have an Army of 1.5 million. And where do we get it from? Here's a simple example. The spring call-up is now upon us. We have 1,472,000 young people subject to military law. In order to bring the Army's strength up to about 78 percent, in such a way that the units are operationally efficient, in this call-up we need to recruit a minimum of 500,000 men, not taking other departments into account. We have come to the conclusion that this spring we can recruit not only for the Armed Forces but also for all other departments only 216,000 men. That's the second reason, and, naturally we are making recommendations." Grachev is asked next whether a Russian citizen has the right to serve outside Russian territory. He says yes, in accordance with a Supreme Soviet decision, he has such a right if he expresses such a personal wish after six months' service, in consultation with his parents. Grachev clarifies his remark earlier about the Russian Army being only two years old; it has hundreds of years of previous history. A woman representing a group of servicemen's mothers wonders about the cost of the best brains of our young people. This is very high, he says, and a young man's profession is strictly taken into account when he is called up. Answering charges of discrimination against Muslims in the Army, Grachev says this is indeed a problem, and it has become especially evident over the past year. An agreement was concluded with the Orthodox Church that Muslims should be able to confer with priests of both churches prior to call-up. As far as their diet is concerned, that's another matter that is virtually impossible to solve. Grachev assures another young man that reductions in the Army are not a whim of the defense minister or the military command. "Anyone who follows what I do closely knows that I am in favor, at least, of an Army of 2.1 million. At the moment we have 2.3 million. This is the optimal composition of an Army that can work and defend its fatherland." He goes on: "We are conducting a planned discharge of the officer corps, first and foremost those who have served 20 years or more and are entitled to a pension; second, those officers and warrant officers who have unblemished records -- and there are quite a number of them; and, third, those officers and warrant officers who have simply not got used to present-day conditions, i.e. those people who still carry political views and support certain political parties and currents. We have pursued another path. The Army has been depoliticized and de-ideologized and it's job is to defend its fatherland and not to serve one particular party, of whatever hue. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to solve this question at the moment." Pozner recalls that Grachev said that he believes the ideal strength to be 2.1 million. "That is more than one percent of the population." "Of course", Grachev replies. Pozner goes on, "You consider that one percent is a small amount?" Grachev points out that people forget that Western countries are highly developed and their strategic position is different from that of Russia with its huge area, and, therefore, to guarantee the country's security with just one percent of the population is not enough. A questioner from Volgograd complains about the waste of life and lack of justice in the Army. Pozner interrupts with some statistics on deaths in the Army: In 1994, about 2,500 people have died for various reasons. Grachev agrees, people are being killed. "The statistics are these -- first, your figures are insufficient. If you want to be objective, in 1993 1,349 people were killed or died. Fifty percent of those died as a result of auto, air, and other disasters. Something like 25 percent took their own lives, about 20 percent lost their lives during exercises or servicing combat equipment," and another 2 percent died as a result of bullying. Answering a question about pacifism, Grachev believes this is an "anti-state" matter. To another question he regrets that some people who have the money are able to buy themselves out. Pozner presents video clips with the voice-over pointing out apathy and lack of discipline in the Army and delay in paying wages. The video shows men operating tanks, on patrol, on naval vessels, etc. Pozner says he is disheartened by what he hears and asks Grachev if there is a way out of these difficulties. "The way out is there if our elected deputies and our leaders in the government correctly realize that the Army is not striving for ideals and is not asking for money just for its own needs. Let the viewers understand that the Armed Forces still pays for 60 percent of the overall number of Russia's enterprises. We are financing the staff of military factories. Therefore, our sums are realistic, and I emphasize again that the sum now being discussed and endorsed is clearly insufficient even to maintain servicemen's pay and the wages of its employees." Regarding another question from Pozner about reductions in the Army, Grachev reminds him that it costs much more to lose an officer than to it does to keep him on. Grachev then supplies figures about the number of women serving in the Army. He discusses with Pozner the number of female defense ministers in the world -- in fact there are only two. Pozner winds up the program with a series of brief questions. Grachev replies: He supports a professional army in principle, but it would need a huge budget, and: He would prefer that the Defense Ministry be engaged in purely political administrative functions, but we are so used to it being run by the military that we are not yet ready for a civilian minister.
