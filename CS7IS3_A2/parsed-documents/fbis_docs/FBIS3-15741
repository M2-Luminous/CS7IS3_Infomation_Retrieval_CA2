According to preliminary results, some 75 per cent of the electorate went to the polls, or five-six per cent more than most bold home and foreign forecasters predicted. According to chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Karatay Turysov, organisers of the elections were especially worried over northern regions in the republic, where Russian-speaking population and opposition politicians, especially among Cossacks, prevail. They tried to dampen the high spirits of Kazakh voters. However, there was no boycott of the elections there. On the contrary, the percentage of voters who participated in the elections, was higher in the north than the country-wide average -- over 80 per cent. As for allegations by some Western mass media that there were numerous violations of the election procedure, Turysov dismissed them as groundless. No serious complaints have been sent to the Central Electoral Commission for the time being. Those which have been filed, will be thoroughly examined, Turysov stressed, adding that appropriate conclusions will be made on each case.
