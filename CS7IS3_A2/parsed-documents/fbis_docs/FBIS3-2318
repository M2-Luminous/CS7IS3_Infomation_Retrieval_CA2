Aisin Giorro Pu Jie died of illness in Beijing on 28 February, aged 87. Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man [Manchu] nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After returning to northeast China in 1935, he served as a military officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to the Chinese Government to be locked up for reform. In November 1960, they were pardoned and freed. After his release, the party and the government showed great concern for and took very good care of Mr. Pu Jie. When Premier Zhou Enlai cordially met with Pu Yi and with Pu Jie and his family members in 30 January 1961, he encouraged them to study and to work hard to make contributions to the country. Because of the concern shown by Premier Zhou Enlai, Pu Jie's wife Hiro Saga and a daughter who had been separated from Pu Jie for many years returned from Japan in June of that year to live with him. Starting in May 1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's; a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from a brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China and then advanced to become a member of the highest legislative organ of the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's great vision and brilliant policy regarding the transformation of society and classes, and this also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high quality of seeking truth and a bright future. Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and cherished the socialist motherland. This sentiment was embodied in his accounts of himself and the poems that he wrote over the years. He once wrote in a poem that "Under a sea of Red flags today, one can see the total difference between the new and old land." He once sincerely said that "in the evening of my life, I will try my best to make use of every available minute." As vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities Committee, he conscientiously carried out his duties as a people's deputy by showing concern for development and progress in minority nationality areas. Ignoring his feeble condition caused by his old age, he went deep into minority nationality areas to carry out investigations and studies. He offered many valuable suggestions for improving nationality work and worked very hard to safeguard the unification of the motherland and to strengthen unity among nationalities. Being enthusiastic about public welfare work, he vigorously supported welfare and cultural institutions. In April 1990, he was lauded by all sectors of society when he donated his life savings to the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee. For many years Mr. Pu Jie dedicated himself to promoting peace and friendship between China and Japan. He had broad ties with the Japanese royal house and with people of all circles both inside and outside the government. He visited Japan several times. He did a great deal of work to promote Sino-Japanese friendship by according a warm reception to visiting Japanese friends from various circles and by briefing them on the great achievements that China has made in reform, opening up to the outside world, and the modernization drive. When his majesty Emperor Akihito was enthroned, Pu Jie made a special trip to Japan to extend his regards to the emperor during which the Japanese Government and public thought highly of him. For many years, when he cordially received visiting Japanese friends from various circles, he told them of his wish that China and Japan would maintain friendly relations for one generation after another. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University. Mr. Pu Jie was a capable poet and calligrapher because he studied calligraphy and poetry when he was young. He was a well-known calligrapher at home and abroad. He summed up his calligraphic experience this way: "When you copy a model of calligraphy, it is necessary to use the strength of the wrist. If your mind is made up and your concentration is strong, you will turn out graceful and charming calligraphy." Because his life experience was unique, the poems and prose that he wrote about any event came naturally and were sincere in their feeling and artistic in their conception. He authored the "Selected Poems of Pu Jie."
