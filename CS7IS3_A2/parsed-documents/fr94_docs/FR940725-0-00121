FR940725-0-00121 FR940725-0-00019 VI. Information Collection Requirements VII. Federalism VIII. State Plans IX. Authority I. Background A. History of the Regulation In May 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), under authority granted by section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act, 84 Stat. 1590; 29 U.S.C. 655(a)), adopted established Federal standards issued under section 41 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (44 Stat. 1444, as amended; 33 U.S.C. 941), as standards applicable to ship repairing (29 CFR part 1915), shipbuilding (29 CFR part 1916), and shipbreaking (29 CFR part 1917) operations. Additionally, other Federal standards and national consensus standards were similarly adopted as general industry standards (29 CFR part 1910) and were made applicable to all aspects of shipyard operations not specifically covered by parts 1915, 1916, and 1917. On April 20, 1982 (47 FR 16984), parts 1915, 1916, and 1917 were consolidated into a single part 1915, for shipyard employment. The consolidated set of standards, entitled ``Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Shipyard Employment,'' eliminated duplicate and overlapping provisions within the former three parts, but did not alter any substantive requirements. The consolidation had no effect on the applicability of the general industry standards, in part 1910, to hazards or conditions in shipyard employment not specifically addressed in the shipyard standards. On November 29, 1988, OSHA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (53 FR 48092) that would revise its previous standards on explosive and other dangerous atmospheres in vessels and vessel sections, contained in Subpart B of part 1915. The proposed standards covered safe entry into and work on board vessels and vessel sections in shipyards. The NPRM proposed the following revisions to the previous Subpart B: * Expanding the scope so that the entire subpart applied to all phases of shipyard work on board vessels and vessel sections; * Adding several definitions; changing the sequence of testing so that requirements for oxygen, flammability, and toxicity testing are presented in that order (the proposal would not, however, have required testing in that order); * Increasing the oxygen content required for unprotected confined or enclosed space entry from 16.5 percent by volume to 19.5 percent by volume; adding a requirement that spaces containing concentrations of toxic contaminants above the permissible exposure limit be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers''; * Adding a requirement for hot work that the concentration of oxygen not exceed 22 percent by volume; adding a requirement to label spaces if those spaces contain, or are adjacent to a space containing, concentrations of flammable gases or vapors at or above 10 percent of their lower explosive limit; and * Adding two new appendices to aid employers and employees. The NPRM also proposed a revision of ยง1915.7, Competent Person. The previous ยง1915.7, which is contained in Subpart A of the Shipyard Standards, defines a competent person for the purposes of Subparts B, C (Surface Preparation and Preservation), D (Welding, Cutting, and Heating), and H (Tools and Related Equipment). The proposed revision was intended to eliminate the paperwork burden involved in designating competent persons, to clarify the skills required of them, and to simplify requirements relating to logging of inspections and tests. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) gave interested persons until February 27, 1989, to submit comments with respect to the proposal, to file objections, and to request a hearing. OSHA received over 40 comments in response to the proposed rulemaking. There were no hearing requests, and no hearing was held. A short time after the shipyard proposed rule (Subpart B) was published, in November 1988, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) was established to provide OSHA with guidance in revising its shipyard standards and in developing a vertical standard for the shipyard industry. At several SESAC meetings, the proposed rules in Subpart B were on the agenda. Subsequently, on June 5, 1989 (several months after the comment period closed for the proposed revision of Subpart B), OSHA published a proposed rule for permit-required confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080). This general industry permit space proposal was intended to apply to land-side (that is, other than on vessels or vessel sections) operations within shipyards, including all operations and work areas, such as fabricating shops, machine shops, and staging areas. As a result, shipyard employers would have been required to comply with one set of standards for shipboard operations (part 1915, Subpart B) and another for land-side operations (part 1910, ยง1910.146). The general industry permit space proposal was discussed at several SESAC meetings with a view toward incorporating applicable requirements into a vertical confined space standard for the entire shipyard. This would make it unnecessary for the general industry standard to apply to hazardous atmospheres in confined spaces in shipyards, as had been proposed in the 1910 rulemaking.
