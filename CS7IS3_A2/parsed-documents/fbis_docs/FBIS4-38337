He told Interfax that the signing of declarative agreements was a waste of time, given a stable political and ethnic situation in Bashkortostan. "Russia's troubles are rooted in its ailing economy, not in a lack of political declarations," he said. He also pointed out that the Bashkortostan leaders had concentrated on measures to prevent the economic ruin and to create normal conditions for industrial production. To quote Rakhimov, the leaders of Bashkortostan have passed a number of decrees aimed at shaping reserve salary funds and delaying tax payments.
