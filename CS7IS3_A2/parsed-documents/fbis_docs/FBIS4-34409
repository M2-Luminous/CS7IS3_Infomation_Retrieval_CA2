Fujimori said that Limaco Huayuscachi was coordinator of the Shining Path's Central Directorate and was regarded as "the right arm" of Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," currently the top leader of the Maoist group. The Peruvian president said that Mario Vasquez, known as "Comrade Roberto," another ranking leader of the subversive organization, was also arrested. He is the one who occupied the post of Martha Huatay, who was in charge of the SL's "People's Aid" organization. Huatay, one of the main terrorist leaders surrounding Abimael Guzman, the group's founder, ideologue, and foremost leader, was captured shortly after Guzman, who was arrested by policemen on 12 September 1992. Fujimori told newsmen that both terrorists were captured today in Comas district in the northern sector of Lima. He added that Limaco Huayuscachi was responsible for logistical support for "Feliciano" and said that his capture "will further weaken" the Shining Path organization, whose members have rejected the peace proposals made by Guzman to the Fujimori government and have chosen to pursue the path of violence.
