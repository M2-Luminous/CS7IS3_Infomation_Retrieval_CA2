A Foreign Ministry communique notes: "The policy of recovering Bolivia's sea outlet follows the world democratization, trade opening, cooperation enhancement, and true integration processes." The communique adds: "Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean, through a free, sovereign, and useful outlet, through diplomatic procedures, is a priority for our country and our government. It is supported by the hemispheric community." The then-Bolivian port of Antofagasta was seized on 14 February 1879 by the Chilean Army, thus initiating the "War of the Pacific;" a military conflict that involved the Republic of Peru and ended in the loss by Bolivia of the Littoral Department to Chile. The national territory's amputation was consummated through a Peace and Borders Treaty signed under Chilean pressure in 1904 which sentenced Bolivia to become a landlocked country. Various attempts to negotiate a revision of the treaty have failed due to the Chilean unswerving refusal to consider Bolivian aspirations. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been severed since 1962, apart from a brief interval during the government of former de facto President Hugo Banzer. The Foreign Ministry notes that the sea recovery claim will remain unchanged in all international forums. The Foreign Ministry says: "We are committed to pursue, at the appropriate forums and based on a national consensus, the appropriate actions to favorably resolve Bolivia's sea claim, thus implementing justice in international relations and an effective Latin American fraternity."
