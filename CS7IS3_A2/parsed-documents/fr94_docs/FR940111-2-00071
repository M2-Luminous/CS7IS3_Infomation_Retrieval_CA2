ACTION: Notice of exemption. SUMMARY: The Commission exempts from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903&hyph;04 the Southern Pacific Transportation Company's abandonment of and the San Joaquin Valley Railway Company's discontinuance of service over a 4.15-mile segment of the Clovis Branch rail line, from milepost 219.00 at or near the Glorietta rail station, to milepost 223.15, at or near the Cooper Avenue rail station in Fresno County, CA. 1 1 The Southern Pacific Transportation Company also will abandon a 4.71-mile spur track that connects to the Clovis Branch at milepost 220.9 at or near the Pinedale rail station. Under 49 U.S.C. 10907(b)(1) the Commission has no jurisdiction over that action, because the segment is a spur track.
