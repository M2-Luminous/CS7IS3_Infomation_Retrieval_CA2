Last week Ethiopian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fantahun Michael announced that he had formally lodged documents for the repatriation of Mengistu, who has been granted political asylum by President Robert Mugabe, once a close friend of the former Marxist despot. Mr Michael said Mengistu was wanted in Addis Ababa to answer charges that he was responsible for the deaths of up to 100,000 people and "general crimes against humanity" during his 12-year regime. But Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira has expressed annoyance at the affair, telling THE HERALD, the country's main daily newspaper: "I don't like what the ambassador is doing, negotiating through the press". Mengistu has also strained his relations with his hosts, who allowed him to live in Zimbabawe on condition that he kept out of politics. Three weeks ago Mr Shamuyarira had to rebuke Mengistu, telling him to "shut up or get out" after the "butcher of Addis" issued a long letter to the local press in which he said he was ready to go to the "rescue" of his country. Despite the rebuke, Mengistu last weekend issued another statement in which he appeared to snub the Zimbabwe Government, saying it was "totally unacceptable, intolerable and unbearable" for him to "stand by and see the country bleed". Mr Mengistu flew to Zimbabwe under cover of darkness in May 1991 as rebel forces were about to seize Addis Ababa.
