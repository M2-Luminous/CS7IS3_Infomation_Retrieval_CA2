Two of the fishermen returned with serious health problems. One is suffering from Aids and the other cannot walk due to atrophied legs. Fifty of the 99 are the crew members of three fishing vessels, the Watcharin 1, Prasong Charoenchai, and Lim Charoenchai 3, from Samut Sakhon province. They were arrested by Vietnamese officials on Jan 29. The Foreign Ministry negotiated with the Vietnamese government for the release of the crew members and the three boats on behalf of the boat owners. The owners had to pay Vietnam US$800 for each of the returned fisherman. Forty-nine other fishermen imprisoned earlier were released after Sanchat Thephatsadin, the Thai consul in Ho Chi Minh City, contacted the Vietnamese officials to pay the $800-per-person fine after no one else came forward to act on their behalf.
