FR940928-0-00010 FR940928-0-00002 AMS has considered these comments and agrees that skin breaks should remain as a ``free from'' defect for both grades. The agency also believes that the other changes proposed to update and modernize the standard are important and will be incorporated as a result of this final rule. The rationale for this decision is two-fold: First, the record supports maintaining the definition of skin breaks as it now exists in the standard. As indicated above, the stronger case is made for not allowing greater damage tolerances. Second, most comments in favor of the proposed change were based on the belief that this would allow shipment of more apricots into Canada. Canadian Import Requirements state that apricots must meet a U.S. grade to be shipped to Canada. If apricots fail to grade based on skin breaks, then the lot cannot be shipped to Canada. The Canadian government generally defines its import requirements in terms of U.S. standards for the convenience of U.S. shippers, but that does not mean the U.S. standards have to be the terms of regulation for the Canadian government's import requirements. Ultimately, inclusion of skin breaks in the U.S. standard may only prompt the Canadian government to specify their requirements for no skin breaks outside the standard. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) develops and improves standards of quality, condition, grade, and packaging to enhance the marketing of agricultural commodities by fostering consistency in commercial practices. The Agency has determined this final rule will enhance the marketing of apricots. The provisions of this final rule are the same as those in the proposed rule except for skin breaks as previously mentioned and for the editorial changes made for clarity.
