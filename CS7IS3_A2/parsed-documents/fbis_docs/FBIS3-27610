The bed of the Hongze River is higher than the surrounding areas as a result of silt caused by the overflowing of the Yellow River in the past. A 67.25-km-long dam has been built to prevent leakage of water. The dam is five to nine meters higher than the ground level. According to Lu Senlin, director of the Hongze River Harnessing Committee, the government has organized the local people to dig and renovate irrigation ditches, dredge the mouth of the Huaihe River, and build three major floodgates to allow floodwaters to drain off at a rate of 11,800 cu m [cubic meters] per second since the 1950s. While diverting water to irrigate farmland, local people have made full use of the water resources. A survey shows that the output of aquatic products amounted to 71,000 tons last year, an increase of 4.7 times over 1985.
