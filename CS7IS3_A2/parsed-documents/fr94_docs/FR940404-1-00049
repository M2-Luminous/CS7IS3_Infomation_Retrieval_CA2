FR940404-1-00049 FR940404-1-00020 Although the proposed critical habitat included slightly different military tracts than is designated in the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, the benefits to endangered species will not decrease as a result of this withdrawal. Some of the DOD lands that were proposed for critical habitat included excess military lands. Also included were operational areas, such as runways, industrial facilities, and urbanized areas, which did not contain the constituent elements of the habitat needed by listed species. Therefore, the proposed critical habitat included more DOD land than was necessary to support recovered populations of endangered species on Guam. The Service has determined that elimination of these operational areas from the Guam National Wildlife Refuge is appropriate and does not diminish the capability to provide special management to endangered species habitat. Private lands are not included in the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. Even though these lands contain habitat for forest species, the acquisition of private lands was not considered for the refuge because of prohibitive costs associated with land acquisition. Because the Guam National Wildlife Refuge provides for increased protection, management, and program funding for 21,204 acres of essential forest habitat, the protection of endangered forest species' habitat on private lands would best be accomplished through existing environmental compliance processes. In addition, lands owned by the Government of Guam were excluded from the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. Approximately 4,000 acres of land owned by the Government of Guam contain habitat for listed species. Most of this land is currently contained in conservation areas protected through local regulation. Should the Service conclude that designation of critical habitat would be prudent at some future time, a new proposal would be required with the appropriate public comment and response. Among the circumstances which could prompt such reconsideration would be a decision by the U.S. Navy or Air Force to ``excess'' military lands which are now part of the overlay refuge. The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd&hyph;668ee) provides guidelines and directives for the conservation of ``species threatened with extinction'' on all refuge lands. In light of this and other legal mandates, the Guam National Wildlife Refuge will provide special management and protection for Guam's endangered species. Section 3(5)(A)(i) of the Endangered Species Act defines ``critical habitat'', in part, as specific areas ``which may require special management considerations or protection.'' Because the designation of critical habitat would not yield any additional benefits above those provided by the refuge, the designation of critical habitat on Guam is found to be not prudent. In compliance with 4(b)(6)(B)(ii) of the Act of 1973, as amended, the Service withdraws its proposed rule of June 14, 1991, to designate critical habitat for six endangered forest species on Guam.
