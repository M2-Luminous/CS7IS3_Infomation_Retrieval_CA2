Therefore, following its principle of defending the interests of land workers, the Lithuanian Land Workers' Union can no longer bear with the voluntaristic gibberish concerning the process of land reform, and the rules of restoring land and the right to real estate, which recently has come from the particularly vigorous Landowners' Union, as well as parties, nationalistic groups, and separate social activists who support it. Pursuing political goals, they are trying, in particular, to stir and paint with different colors the issue of privatizing personal land. Appealing to justice and the sacred feeling of ownership, the ideologists of this union and parties want to return to the distant past, forgetting that it is impossible to divide our rural settlements into detached farmhouses, parcel out reclaimed farmland as plots, and move the urban population to rural areas. We understand that the commotion that is being raised around this issue is not casual, the more so that the current law regulating land reform states that personal land cannot be restored to other persons, and one is allowed to acquire it in the same manner as land plots for private housing. The forces which are interested in this commotion want to deprive the rural people of the right to produce themselves the amount of food and animal feed necessary for their families and personal farms. Since the very beginning of its activities, the Lithuanian Land Workers' Union has tried to implement its program principle -- "to legalize land ownership for those who work it, and former owners and their children who are returning to farming in rural areas." This formulation of the problem has been unequivocal in all Land Workers' Union documents over its three-year activities. Currently, we have a real chance of resolving this issue, which would allow to stabilize the situation of landless countrymen and remove social tension. Considering these circumstances, the Presidium of the Lithuanian Land Workers' Union Council states and proposes the following: 1. People who live and work in the country have never lost their link with the land, and they have preserved farm buildings and kept animals. Their personal farms are a guarantor of rural stability and a condition for training future farmers and imparting a master's feeling in young people. At the same time, they are the principal source of income for rural pensioners and other persons who require social support. Therefore, the ownership right to this land must not depend on landowner's goodwill -- it must be guaranteed by the state which takes care of its nation's existence. 2. World experience and the laws of a market economy require free ownership of land by the user. Therefore, personal land must be legalized as private property that can be restored instead of formerly possessed land in other places or sold to families which have no land to reclaim. This would be more just than to restore the land cultivated over decades to former owners' children and grandchildren who will never work it and will take part of annual profits earned by workers who lease this land. 3. Personal land must be situated in places where it is more convenient for workers to farm it, despite the fact who owned it according to prewar reform. Users themselves, in cooperation with specialists in land development, must decide how to use the land situated near settlements. Land plots in common use must also be privatized by the general right of ownership, if there is overall agreement. This would create more favorable conditions for cooperation, mechanized farming, fertilizing, caring for crops, harvesting, renewing cultured grassland, and coordinating this work through crop rotation with the land owned by large agrarian companies or individual farmers. 4. Considering the difficult economic situation of land workers, the latter must have the right to buy land not only for money but also for single state payments. The state rather than new owners must pay former owners in line with the law, whose land has been ascribed as repurchased by the state and non-restorable. Since compensation must be paid from the funds accumulated from the sale of land in state possession, it is necessary to legalize the payment for land acquired for private ownership before the final arrangement of agreements on land sale and purchase. 5. It is on personal land alone that food production has not dropped under the difficult and complicated conditions of agrarian reform, and this proves the economic expediency of such land. After vital economic structures become established in rural areas (large or specialized cooperatives or stock companies with intensive farming), personal land will either naturally transform itself into them or remain the source of guaranteed food and income for rural families who are unable to work or who are forced to search for work in other sectors. Thus, there can be no restraints for workers to acquire this land, regardless of its demand for other purposes. This is the undisputable right of all people who did not abandon farming in the former difficult period. 6. We appeal to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania to consider our proposals and promptly resolve the issue of privatizing personal land.
