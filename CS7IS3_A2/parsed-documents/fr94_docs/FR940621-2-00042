FR940621-2-00042 FR940621-2-00032 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;287&hyph;000] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Tariff Filing June 15, 1994. Take notice that on June 10, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 167A. Such tariff sheet is proposed to be effective November 1, 1993. TGPL states that the purpose of the filing is to revise TGPL's Rate Schedule FT tariff provisions consist with the Commission's Order No. 509 Final Rule issued October 4, 1993 in Docket No. RM93&hyph;8&hyph;000 (Final Rule). In that regard, the Final Rule, among other things, removes the regulations governing the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) capacity allocation program and the regulation which provides for abandonment authority. As a result of these changes, Section 9 of TGPL's existing FT Rate Schedule is no longer required. TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested parties. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 22, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
