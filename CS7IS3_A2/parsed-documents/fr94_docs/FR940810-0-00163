FR940810-0-00163 FR940810-0-00021 Comparing costs per provision along the bottom row of the table, incremental costs for engineering controls in auto repair represent the leading expenditure. Other controls bearing significant costs are half-mask respirators ($1.4 million), disposable protective clothing and gloves ($1.1 million), change rooms and lockers ($563 thousand), and shower rooms ($418 thousand). For secondary manufacture of gaskets and packings and secondary auto remanufacturing, where exposures currently are below the revised PEL, OSHA anticipates little or no incremental costs. Therefore, impacts on establishments in these industry groups will be insignificant. Construction. Within the construction industry, 24 unique activities will come under the scope of the proposed revision. These construction activities are found in new construction, asbestos abatement and building demolition, general building renovation and remodeling, and routine facility maintenance and custodial work in public, commercial, and residential buildings and in general industry. Although the construction activities under consideration in this study will require the implementation of different control practices and/or combinations of these practices, the basic characteristics of available control practices are relatively uniform, and the options for combining control practices in the construction industry and during routine maintenance and repair activities in general industry are limited in number. The control mechanisms considered in this analysis include: •Shrouded tools with HEPA vacuums; •HEPA vacuum/ventilation systems; •HEPA vacuums; •Glove bags; •Critical barriers (including the materials and labor for setting up and taking down; •Regulated areas; •Respirators (including the respirator unit, accessories, fit testing, cleaning, and training); •Disposable protective clothing and gloves; •Impermeable drop cloths; •Wet methods (including the sprayer, wetting agent, and labor); •Decontamination areas (or clean changerooms); •Lunch areas; •Training; •Use of competent person supervision; •Exposure assessments and monitoring; •Medical exams; •Recordkeeping; •Labeling of installed asbestos products; •Notification of building owners and employees by contractors; and •Notification of contractors and building occupants by building owners.
