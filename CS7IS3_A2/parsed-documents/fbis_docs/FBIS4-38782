The commission has started to work. On 31 May, deputies elected commission chairmen as a package. As is known, only one vacant seat, that of the Commission for Issues of Ecological Policy, remained vacant. Today, Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz proposed that Ivan Zayets should be elected to this post. But only 156 deputies voted for this proposal, 13 short of the number required. Leonid Kuchma made a speech at the plenary sitting. He noted that the main reason for the crisis in Crimea is that economic problems were becoming aggravated. In his words, there were no active anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian feelings in Crimea two years ago. Leonid Kuchma sees the solution in really giving Crimea a special status. He noted: "However, there is a limit beyond which we cannot go: Crimea should unambiguously be within the composition of Ukraine." Oleksandr Moroz stressed that there are objective factors in the Crimean crisis, i.e. mistakes in the former USSR's policies and mistakes in resolving the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, and also subjective factors, i.e. the clash of several nationalisms in Crimea and the blocking of the creation of a constitutional court. He proposed that economic relations be unblocked and that the tourist season in Crimea be allowed to function normally.
