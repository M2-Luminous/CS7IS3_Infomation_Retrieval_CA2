We do know him. But who are the people who surround Zhirinovskiy in the Duma? What are the views the "liberal- democratic" representatives are defending or opposing in this chaotic Russian Lower House? Their top man is Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (40). He is the runner-up, the "shadow prime minister" of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Last week, he was elected vice-chairman of the Duma. [passage omitted] [Duk] Your political leader is not afraid of uttering nuclear threats. [Vengerovskiy] You should not think that we are devising plans in this office to drop nuclear bombs over the United States or Germany. Russia never attacked or occupied any other countries. The nations always appealed to us for protection. [Duk] Then how should we interpret Zhirinovskiy's statements on a "new Hiroshima?" [Vengerovskiy] Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is our leader, and he is responsible for his words. However, I stick to our party program, which does not refer to any "Hiroshimas." As far as international politics are concerned: We are no government party, so our influence will be limited. However, we will exert as much pressure as possible in Parliament through the committees. Russia must resume its historic role as defender of Europe. At the time, the Mongolian-Tatar hordes had to be stopped, at present it is Muslim fundamentalism. Just imagine what might happen if Russia would disintegrate and leave a vacuum here. [Duk] Your ideology is described as being "fascist." [Vengerovskiy] This is typically Russian rhetoric. Former communists who now claim to be democrats, refer to us, liberals, as being fascists. This is nonsense, we are a normal, liberal party which takes up a center position. Which means: Between the revanchist communists who refuse to abandon the planned economy, and the radicals of Russia's Choice, who have disrupted our national economy and the entire society. We are opting for a "third way," we are the only ones who can carry out this program, because our society's elite has teamed up within the LDP. [Duk] What does this program look like? [Vengerovskiy] Our first important proposal is a general amnesty for political and economic crimes committed since the early days of Perestroika. We must forgive and forget, the capitals which have flowed abroad, must return to Russia. As far as we are concerned, this amnesty also applies to the mob, as long as their hands are clean. We are in favor of protecting our national economy, and against the shock therapy as proposed by the IMF. At present, Russia is a dump for low-quality products from the rest of the world, and at the same time a cheap market for natural resources and beautiful girls. This is wrong. The LDP advocates progressive reforms, and opposes a government which harms our national interests, destroys the state sector, and makes our country an extension of the United States. We are in favor of privatization, but in the interest of the citizens, not in that of the mob. The financial support to former Soviet Republics must be stopped. All former Politburo members are now president somewhere: Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Shevardnadze, etc. Yeltsin is helping his comrades at the Russian people's expense. In the meantime, the world is supporting the former communists, and we are being branded as fascists. Does that make any sense to you? [Duk] Will Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy become Russian president in 1996? [Vengerovskiy] There is not the slightest doubt in my mind. He might even become president much sooner. The parliamentary elections have shown that Snickers and cornflakes failed to achieve their main objective. The Russian people has not lost its own identity. Now is the time for new faces, for young, physically strong people. These people can be found within the LDP: Experts who speak several languages, who have been abroad, and who are not afraid of communicating with the West. We are the new political and cultural factor in Russia. A man like Gaydar has thriven on his grandfather's name (a popular writer of children's books, ed.). We made ourselves, we had to fight for our success. Every day, I am sitting in the subway among common people, and I know their worries. The present leaders have no idea, and never had any idea. That is why they will always lose. [Duk] Do you anticipate a recurrence of the October events? [Vengerovskiy] There will be no second "October." Indeed, Zhirinovskiy has massive support from the army. So this scenario is out of the question.
