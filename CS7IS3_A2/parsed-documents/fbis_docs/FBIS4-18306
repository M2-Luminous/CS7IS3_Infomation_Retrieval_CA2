The poll, which interviewed 202 executives and businessmen, found that 38.7 percent wanted President Scalfaro to give a mandate to Berlusconi, while 30.4 preferred someone close to the winning alliance forged by the owner of Fininvest but more independent. The choice of National Alliance head Giancarlo Fini as premier was the choice of 10.1 percent of those interviewed, while 3.6 percent indicated Northern League leader Umberto Bossi. Berlusconi was preferred more by businessmen, while company executives indicated other solutions. A total of 34.5 percent of those interviewed saw as "very realistic" Forza Italia's program, which included lowering taxes, more jobs and the privatization social services. Another 13.7 percent saw it as "realistic enough." This opposed to 33.9 percent, almost all executives, who saw it as "not very realistic," and 14.9 did not think it was at all realistic. Those in favor of specific guarantees to separate Berlusconi's business and political interests, such as the institution of a blind trust, accounted for 64.9 percent of those interviewed.
