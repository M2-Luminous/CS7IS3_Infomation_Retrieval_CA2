The Wingti Government's expansionist budget strategy, based on the expectation of an oil and mining boom, has left the country with almost no foreign reserves. The mini-Budget, brought down in March by the new Finance Minister, Mr Masket Iangalio was supposed to start bringing the Government's finances back under control by cutting the 1994 deficit from 7 per cent to just under 5 per cent of GDP. It accepted the reality of depressed oil prices, cutting spending and increasing taxes. However, like last November's Budget, the mini-Budge was based on absurdly optimistic estimates of the cost of the war in Bougainville. Mr Iangalio's spending cuts have been almost completely offset by additional, unplanned spending in the province. Economists are now expecting a budget deficit of between 5 and 6 per cent of GDP. It will be the third year in a row that the deficit has exceeded 5 per cent of GDP. Rising oil and mineral prices should come to PNG's aid over the next few years. However, the PNG Government seems determined to do all in its power to deter new mining investment. The Minister for Mining and Petroleum, Mr John Kaputin, has just announced a moratorium on new mining projects while he sorts out a new mining policy. This follows a series of damaging controversies in which the Government has acquired a 15 per cent equity in the Porgera mine, delayed the Lihir project by making contradictory agreements on ownership, and changed the mining laws to deprive CRA [expansion not known] of its Mt Kare tenement. At the same time, BHP [Broken Hill Proprietary] has been the subject of a $4 billion suit over pollution from its Ok Tedi mine. Mr Iangalio immediately contradicted Mr Kaputin's announcement of the moratorium. However, that just seems to confirm that the administration of PNG's mining policy will continue to be erratically driven by short-term political considerations. And these problems overlay the long-standing structure problems of the PNG economy: urban wages that are five to six times higher than the country can afford; an oversized public sector; an overvalued exchange rate; a largely-neglected agricultural sector; and one of the lowest levels of spending on infrastructure in the Third World. Despite the country's extraordinary mineral wealth and generous aid from Australia, the quality of life of the great majority of Papua New Guineans who live in the countryside is below that of comparable developing countries. Education standards are very low, with adult literacy and school participation rates below comparable developing countries. Health services are also inadequate in the country areas. Infant and maternal-mortality rates art very high. Life expectancy is five years below the average for middle-income countries. The result has been the large-scale migration of people to the towns and a breakdown in law and order. In an effort to keep people on the land, the Government has introduced price support schemes for the major export crops -- coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and copra. These schemes, which made an important contribution to the blow-out of spending last year, are highly inefficient because they encourage production of crops when farmers should be cutting back. They also put the Budget at considerable risk. The question is what will it take to persuade PNG's leaders to adopt more responsible economic policies. One option is to leave the country to the tender mercies of the IMF. However, there's no guarantee that PNG's leaders would learn from the experience. What is certain, however, is that Australia will always be under international pressure to bail out PNG. It will be seen by everyone as our special responsibility. Perhaps Australia can do more to avert disaster now. Its aid to PNG is largely determined by treaty, although it may still have some leverage. Australia is switching from general budget assistance to program aid, which gives Canberra more say in the way the money is spent. This year, just over a quarter of our aid to PNG will be program aid. By 1996-97, the proportion of program aid will be up to 52 per cent. What happens after that is a matter for negotiation although the broad agreement is that all aid will be program aid by about the end of the decade. Australia can be more or less generous, depending on the behaviour of the PNG Government. While that may not seem to offer much leverage over Port Moresby's notoriously myopic politicians, it gives Australian ministers an opportunity to comment on the state of PNG economic management and potentially influence the bureaucracy, public opinion and the markets. It may strengthen the hand of those in the PNG Cabinet, like Mr Iangalio, who are trying to achieve reform. We will get no thanks for the intervention, but we might save Papua New Guinea from a period of self-inflicted misery.
