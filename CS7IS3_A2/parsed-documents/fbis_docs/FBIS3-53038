Only 43 members of the house supported the motion, 57 opposed it, and two abstained. The debate centered around the statement by Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, who said the current peace negotiations could lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Peres said the government rejects the establishment of such a state because it opposes the presence of any foreign army west of the Jordan River. [passage omitted] In presenting the no-confidence motion, Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Gonen Segev said the opposition would silence itself if the Labor party went back to the people with a new platform. In the meantime, MK Segev accused the government of violating the current Labor platform of opposing a Palestinian state and in favor of holding on to the Jordan Valley. [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres responded to the no-confidence motion denying any deviation from the Labor party platform. He said the government is not discussing a Palestinian state in the current negotiations, only autonomy for the Palestinians, as stated in the party platform. [passage omitted]
