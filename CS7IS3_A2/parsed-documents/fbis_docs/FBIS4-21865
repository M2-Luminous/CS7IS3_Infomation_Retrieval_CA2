The bloody fight was the outcome of an "ideological debate" between one faction which supports Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, who wants to make peace with the government, and another faction which rejects the proposal and insists on continuing the "popular war" that it declared against Peruvian democracy in 1980. An officer of the Huamanccacca Prison of Huancayo reported that the confrontation began when the dissident group called Red Path [Sendero Rojo], which rejects peace, launched a harsh verbal attack against Guzman during a Shining Path meeting in which the subversive chief's peace proposal was being discussed. Prison personnel and police had to separate the two factions, the source reported. [background passage omitted]
