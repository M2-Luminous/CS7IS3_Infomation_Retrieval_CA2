Denktas held a news conference in Kastamonu, where he is being hosted by the Ilgaz Group. In his news conference, Denktas asked that the pressure and threats directed against the Turkish Cypriot side cease and that there be a realistic bid to resolve the problem. According to TRT correspondent Ihsan Gunal, Denktas remarked that the Greek Cypriots are amassing weapons on the island and they are planning to establish an air force and to allow Greece to build a naval base in Baf [Paphos]. [Begin Denktas recording] This is madness; but, we cannot stick our neck out just because the Greek Cypriots have gone insane and we cannot say yes you are right to all their moves. [end recording] Denktas noted that the Greek Cypriots are engaged in efforts to join the European Union [EU] and if this comes about they will merge with Greece. The Greek Cypriots are already concluding various bilateral agreements with the Greeks, Denktas noted. He announced that if the Greek Cypriots become a member of the EU, then the Turkish Cypriots could opt for economic and political integration with Turkey under conditions to be agreed upon. This will convey the following message to the Greek Cypriots, Denktas explained: The moves you make can be reciprocated and we will courageously undertake such reciprocal moves. Denktas said that Turkey and the Turkish factor should not be forgotten with regard to this issue. In reply to a question, Denktas said that he will not submit the integration proposal to the Turkish Government. [Begin Denktas recording] However, the assessment of the situation and the exchange of views we conducted indicate that this is the only solution in the face of continuing Greek Cypriots moves. [end recording] Later, Denktas flew by helicopter from Kastamonu to Ankara.
