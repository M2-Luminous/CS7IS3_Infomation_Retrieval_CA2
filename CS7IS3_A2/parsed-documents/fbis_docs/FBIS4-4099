The delegation also had dinner with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. During these meetings, they exchanged views on contacts between the mainland and Hong Kong, on the retention of Hong Kong civil servants, on the issuance of special administrative region [SAR] passports, on Hong Kong real estate prices, and on China's economic development and tax reform. At a press conference tonight, Lo Hong-sui said he was happy to have had the opportunity to hold detailed discussions with the two vice premiers on some of Hong Kong's problems. He said that delegation members suggested to the two leaders that methods should be worked out to strengthen contacts between the central authorities and Hong Kong people. They felt that on many issues, the central government did not seem to fully understand Hong Kong citizens' ideas or feelings, and that in general, Hong Kong citizens cannot completely understand or accept central government policies. Therefore they suggested that the central government work out methods for improvement, such as systematically explaining some important contents of the Basic Law to Hong Kong citizens and responding to Hong Kong Government policies and comments. They expressed concern that the continued lack of contact between the Chinese and British Governments would affect economic development in Hong Kong and the Zhu Jiang delta, he pointed out. He cited the following example: Hong Kong's Kwai Chung container port basically will be saturated next year; if the construction of a new port is delayed time and again, this will affect the shipment of Hong Kong's export commodities, apart from causing traffic congestion in the surrounding area. On the other hand, Guangdong Province has started carrying out large-scale infrastructural construction projects, which will form a convergence with Hong Kong. If the two sides still lack contacts, certain difficulties and obstacles will crop up. Delegation member Chu You-ka said that Zhu Rongji briefed them on the mainland's economic development, and that he expressed satisfaction with the present situation. Concerning foreign exchange, the renminbi exchange rates have remained stable since July last year, and the foreign exchange reserve has increased by more than $6 billion. In addition, money injection has slowed down, which will help alleviate inflation. The implementation of the revenue-sharing system, which started early this year, also has yielded results, which are manifested in increased central government revenue without a decrease in local taxes. This is beneficial to reducing deficits in central government revenue. The inflation rate, however, rose from 13 percent last year to 20 percent in the first quarter of this year. This situation merits attention. What is gratifying is that the increase in the people's income is higher than the inflation rate. Zhu Rongji was confident that inflation would fall in the months to come. Lo Hong-sui pointed out that the delegation members had expressed their concern to the two vice premiers and to Lu Ping over the sentencing of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, and had expressed their hope that Chinese leaders would help resolve this issue. These leaders said that they were in charge of administrative institutions and did not participate in judicial operations, so they were not familiar with the details of the case, nor was it convenient for them to influence or meddle in judicial operations. Lo Hong-sui said that after the delegation had returned to Hong Kong, they would write a letter to the relevant Chinese leaders to seek ways to resolve the case.
