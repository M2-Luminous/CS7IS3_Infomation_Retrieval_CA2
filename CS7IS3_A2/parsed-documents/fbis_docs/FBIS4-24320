According to the reports, the consignment of arms and ammunition was intended for the Liberian Peace Council [LPC], and was being escorted to Buchanan by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG. This exposure by the Ghanaian contingent proves what the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and Africa Watch have revealed that the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG is the sole supplier of arms and ammunition to the LPC in its onslaught against the Liberian people in southeast Liberia. In a related development, military personnel of the NPFL recently intercepted large quantities of arms and ammunition from members of the LPC, which had been delivered by the Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers during late hours of the night.
