The Serbian Radical Party is the second-strongest opposition party in the Serbian Parliament. "If Jamahiriya (Seselj's term for the Bosnian Moslem state) and the Bosnian-Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna can subsequently enter a confederation with Croatia, who can prevent the Bosnian Serb Republic to join Yugoslavia," Seselj underscored at a press conference. According to him, Serb politicians should use this opportunity in the best possible way. He added, however, that the Belgrade authorities had voiced their restraint on the issue and lacked courage to make a more resolved move in their foreign policy. He urged that the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina should merge, and consequently have one government, prime minister and parliament. Asked about Germany's decision to expel nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, mainly ethnic Albanians from Serbia's province of Kosovo/Metohija, Seselj said it was a way of putting pressure on Belgrade. He added that this problem could be solved at the border. His solution for the problem was to deny entrance to Yugoslavia to all Albanians who had illegaly come to Kosovo/Metohija in 1948 and later, and who had not acquired Yugoslav citizenship. As for ethnic Albanians who had refused to serve their military term with the Yugoslav Army and had, therefore, escaped to Germany, they should immediately be arrested.
