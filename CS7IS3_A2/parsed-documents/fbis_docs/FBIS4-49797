Implementation of the 1993 Plan Anhui's gross domestic product [GDP] for 1993 amounted to 94 billion yuan, up 21.6 billion yuan or, when calculated in terms of comparable prices, increasing 22 percent from 1992. It was 9 percent higher than the original target. Efforts have been made for attaining comparatively well-off living standards and the rural economy has been invigorated in an all-around manner. The added value of agricultural output was 25.4 billion yuan, up 10 percent. (The total agricultural output value was 41.7 billion yuan, up 8.5 percent.) Village and town enterprises continued to develop rapidly, reporting a sales value of 108.45 billion yuan, up 102.2 percent over that of 1992. Enterprise reform has continued to deepen and industrial output has increased rapidly. Enterprises including Maanshan Iron and Steel, Anhui Energy, and Meiling Corporation have succeeded in conducting reform and listing their stock to be bought and sold at stock markets. Various reforms in enterprises and corporations -- including state ownership under nongovernmental management, collective ownership under private operation, different ways to form enterprises and corporations, and experimental shareholding systems -- have been progressing in a healthy manner. The added value of Anhui's industrial output was 42.9 billion yuan, up 37 percent over that of 1992. (The total industrial output value was 140.2 billion yuan, up 44.6 percent.) Anhui's industries have considerably raised their economic returns. Investment structure has been rationally readjusted. Key construction and technical transformation projects have increased. Public investments in fixed assets were 28.99 billion yuan, up 35 percent over that of 1992. Anhui has opened up wider to the outside world and the total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province has increased remarkably. Export-oriented economic sectors gradually became more active as 16 prefectures and cities and some enterprises have been authorized to export goods on their own. The establishment of 1,040 new "three types of wholly or partly foreign- owned" enterprises was approved in 1993, and the total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province was $260 million, up 420 percent over that of 1992. Domestic markets have been prosperous and active. Anhui has accelerated its pace in price reform. Anhui has considerably increased its revenues, and has made new contributions in financial work. Revenues in 1993 totaled 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent. Anhui's financial expenses in 1993 were 7.22 billion yuan, down 2.6 percent. The financial account for 1993 was balanced. At the end of 1993, the amount of Anhui's public savings at banks was 49.44 billion yuan, up 10.08 billion yuan over that of 1992. The amount of various bank loans extended was 71.21 billion yuan, increasing 12.67 billion yuan over that of 1992. Anhui has accomplished new achievements in science, technology, and education, and has made further progress in various social undertakings. In 1993, Anhui organized and implemented 85 projects to tackle scientific and technological problems, and accomplished 645 scientific and technological achievements at or above the provincial and departmental level. In 1993, Anhui's institutions of higher learning admitted 32,300 students to regular undergraduate and special courses, increasing 35.6 percent. Its secondary specialized schools enrolled 44,600 students, up 52.3 percent. Urban and rural residents have considerably improved their living standards. The population growth rate was lower than the national average. According to a random survey, Anhui urban residents' per capita cash income for living expenses was 2,025.7 yuan and peasants' net per capita income was 724 yuan. In 1993, Anhui's natural population growth rate was 10.67 per thousand. Some major acute contradictions and problems of 1993 follow: We have yet to completely smoothen some links in macroeconomic regulation and administration. Investments in agriculture have been inadequate and infrastructural facilities in the agricultural sector are relatively weak. New key industries have not developed fast enough. Economic benefits still mainly depend on an increased growth rate. Some enterprises are facing difficulties in production and operation. Increases in commodity prices have been too high. Anhui is short of funds. The development of social undertakings has been slow. 2. Guiding Thoughts and Major Objectives of Anhui's 1994 National Economic and Social Development Guiding thoughts of Anhui's 1994 economic work follow: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we should resolutely implement the party Central Committee's policy on "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, enhancing development, and maintaining stability." While ensuring that both quality and benefits are higher than those of 1992, we should facilitate a sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] in the national economy in an effort to promote all-around social progress. The principal goals follow: -- The GDP should increase 13-15 percent over that of 1993. Out of the total, primary industries should increase 3.6-3.8 percent (and the total agricultural output value should rise more than 4 percent); secondary industries should increase 16.6-19 percent (and the total industrial output value should rise more than 25 percent); and tertiary industries should go up 22-24 percent. -- We should strive to further improve our tasks in reversing losses and increasing profits. Enterprises with a gross national product [GNP] of 10,000 yuan or above should reduce energy consumption by 2.25 percent. The marketability rate of industrial products should be more than 96 percent. Major indices of economic efficiency -- including the proportion of profits and taxes as a percentage of total capital, the frequency of circulation funds, and labor force productivity in Anhui -- should all be higher than those of 1993. -- Village and town enterprises should have sales revenues of more than 150 billion yuan. -- Public investments in fixed assets are expected to be 35 billion yuan, increasing 21 percent over those of 1993. This will include state-owned units' investments of 9.32 billion yuan, as allocated by the state at the beginning of 1994. -- Anhui's social commodities retail volume should be 47 billion yuan, or attain a 20-percent increase. -- Our total foreign trade value should be $1.59 billion, or up 23.5 percent, of which the export value should be $1.1 billion. The actual use of foreign funds should amount to $480 million, of which, $180 million should be in the form of medium and long-term foreign loans. -- Anhui's financial revenues should reach 8.538 billion yuan, up 16.6 percent over those of 1992, or when calculated in terms of comparable prices, increasing 9.2 percent from 1992. -- The rate of the increase in overall social retail commodities prices should be controlled to be lower than the national average. -- Regarding 1993 wages as a base, we should considerably increase the average wages of staff and workers. Also, peasants' net per capita income should increase more than 100 yuan from 1993. -- Anhui's natural population growth rate should be controlled under 14.96 per thousand as instructed by the state. 3. Major Objectives of Anhui's 1994 National Economic and Social Development (1) We should regard raising peasants' income as the central task and comprehensively develop the rural economy. It is necessary to further restructure the agricultural production framework. We should stress high yields, high quality, and high efficiency in agriculture; should provide guidance to village and town enterprises according to various categories; and should continually accelerate in carrying out the "1235" [numerals as published] project. Furthermore, we should strive to promote the rural shareholding joint-venture system; raise funds, through various channels, to develop village and town enterprises; make efforts to increase agricultural investments; and enhance the construction of agricultural infrastructural projects. We should strive to raise peasants' incomes by increasing productivity, and take effective measures to ensure that benefits such as higher state procurement prices for cotton and grain are received by peasants. Additionally, we should realistically reduce peasants' burdens and enable poor areas to expeditiously shake off poverty and become rich. (2) Great efforts will be made to readjust industrial structure and build up our capacity for sustained economic development In 1994, we will formulate the development plans for automobiles, engineering machinery, daily-use electric appliances, electronics, iron and steel, non-ferrous metal, and building materials industries, as well as intensive processing industry for agricultural and sideline products. We will support the development of high-priority key industries and products by increasing credit loans, using foreign capital, encouraging joint ventures, recommending the share-holding system, and experimenting on turning debtors into partners. Light, textile, and other conventional industries will particularly pay attention to market demand and to opening up the market. We will continue to strengthen basic industries. (3) We will actively promote the reform of the investment system, make great efforts to readjust investment patterns, increase investment, and earnestly step up the construction of key projects. We will increase investment in infrastructural construction, basic industries and backbone industries, such as agriculture, water resources, transport, telecommunications, energy sources, and important raw and processed materials. More efforts will be made for the technological transformation of enterprises. We will concentrate on the construction of key projects and actively do good preparatory work for the Eighth Five-Year-Plan projects. We will vigorously promote the reform of the investment system. (4) We will step up the construction of the market system and strive to open up the market. We will give higher priorities to planning the construction of 11 wholesale markets for capital goods and agricultural and sideline products, 11 shopping centers, and a number of provincial border markets. We plan to establish a provincial securities trading center, increase securities trading firms, and develop urban and rural cooperative banks. We will accelerate the development of the technology market. We will step up the establishment of labor service and real estate markets. Attention will be paid to the development of brokerage and service agencies in the market. (5) We will open up wider to the outside, make efforts to use foreign capital, and increase exports. We will make full and flexible use of the preferential policies granted by the state to the two open cities Hefei and Wuhu, accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy in the province, and strive to maintain the development momentum of the Wuhu economic and technological development zone and the Hefei high-technological industries development zone. We will vigorously develop international tourism. Efforts will be made to expand export trade. We will actively increase sources of export goods, and strive to enable more of our production-related, scientific and technological, materials, and commercial enterprises to obtain the foreign trade authority. We will rationally arrange imports. We will use foreign capital more boldly and more effectively, and strive to set up 3,000 or more new joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises and to obtain $1 billion of foreign investment this year. We will continue to make effective use of loans from foreign governments, monetary organizations, and commercial banks. (6) We will strive to increase revenues, optimize the credit structure, and promote direct capital flow. We will continue to pay attention to increasing the sources of revenues, match revenue increases with economic growth, and strive to receive 8.5 billion yuan of revenues in 1994. We will actively make banks play the role of main channels of capital flow, vigorously seek savings deposits, and further optimize the use of loans. A further step will be taken to widen the channels of direct capital flow. (7) We will control excessive commodity price increases and strive to improve the people's living standards. First, we will meticulously implement the pricing system reform plan according to the demands set by the state. Second, we will improve macroeconomic coordination, maintain an overall economic balance, make the "vegetable basket" project a success, and ensure market supply. Third, we will establish as soon as possible a reserve system for major agricultural products and keep improving it; and we will establish a grain risk fund. Fourth, we will pay more attention to monitoring and examining the prices of daily necessities and services for residents, and promptly adopt measures to control excessive price rises. A further step will be taken to improve the living standards and increase the income of the people in both urban and rural areas. (8) We will accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces, give high priority to the development of education, and coordinate the development of other social undertakings. First, we will take advantage of planning and the market to accelerate the industrial application of a number of selected major scientific and technological achievements which can be widely applied, yield high added value and good economic efficiency, and play a great promoting role. Second, we will apply advanced science and technology in transforming conventional industries. Third, we will strive to achieve success in the projects of tackling tough scientific and technological problems assigned by the central and provincial authorities, and accelerate the transfer of military industry technologies to civilian sectors. Fourth, we will accelerate the establishment of a system for managing science and technology, as well as a science and technology operating mechanism, which conform to socialist market economic structure. Fifth, we will convene a provincial science and technology congress. We will give high priority to the development of education. Efforts will be made to ensure success in basic education, accelerate the development of secondary vocation and technical education, and develop multi-form, multi-level adult education with on-the-job training and continued education as its main forms. We will steadily develop the higher education and strive to increase educational investment. We will take a further step to step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization and to actively promote cultural, sports, public health, press, publication, radio broadcasting, cinema, television, civil affairs and other social undertakings. We will increase investment in social undertakings through various channels and in various forms. We will continue to improve the family planning work. We will pay attention to nationwide improvement of farmland and environmental protection.
