He added, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, that Libya would take steps to attract this liquidity (partly savings) into the channels of the banking system to prevent a drop in the exchange rate of the Libyan dinar, and to provide the liquidity needed to support projects the authorities have decided to undertake. He views a rise in the interest rate as a major means of attracting these savings, saying that the new interest rate would exceed the 9 percent currently payable on savings deposits. The Libyan official revealed that his country had resorted to an "open exchange policy" (without the security of financial backing) following the 24 percent decline in its revenues during 1993, compared to the previous year, in which foreign currency revenues were nearly LD2.4 billion. He said that allocations for the various sectors had decreased and that the open exchange rate had not exceeded 3 percent of total revenues. He explained that there were great risks in this policy for the exchange rate of the Libyan currency and the economic situation. Zulaytini believes that the reform of the economic system in Libya could occur through the implementation of policies to hold the budget deficit to the lowest possible level. He said that this could happen through a high-interest public bond issue, the allocation of a budget item to service the public debt, and the avoidance of borrowing except for productive projects. Checks and Cash He called on the Libyan people not to deal in cash, but to deposit it in the banking system, so that the use of checks might take the place of cash, with the aim of reducing supply. He confirmed the need to collect Libya's foreign debts, estimated at nearly $2.1 billion and 22 million French francs. He emphasized the settlement of these debts in cash or in kind, and cautioned that his country would resort to legal means to get its money back from abroad should the debtor countries procrastinate. He said that halting the smuggling of Libyan dinars abroad was the responsibility of security and customs at the various frontier points. He called for the strengthening of monitoring of currency flight, and of abiding by a law criminalizing it. He added that the Libyan Central Bank's investment revenues in foreign commercial banks in 1992 amounted to nearly LD4 million, and explained that the Central Bank was going to review domestic housing loans, which are about 15,000 dinars [each]. He spoke of Libyans who postponed marriage due to the scarcity of gold in their country, as the result of the UN-imposed sanctions. He alluded to the drop in his country's gold imports, to between $17-$20 million, in the framework of limiting foreign expenditures.
