ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Kenneth G. Townsend (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit Number PRT&hyph;795603. The requested permit, which is for a period of 10 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler ( Dendroica chrysoparia ). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of a single family residence at Lot 6 Lake Georgetown Estates II Subdivision, Williamson County, Texas. The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take application. A determination of jeopardy to the species for a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the application and EA/HCP should be received on or before January 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy of writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103. Persons wishing to review the EA/HCP may obtain a copy by contacting Joseph E. Johnston, Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 10711 Burnet Road, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78758. Documents will be available for public inspection by written request, by appointment only, during normal business hours (8:00 to 4:00) at the Southwest Regional Office, Division of Endangered Species/Permits, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

Please refer to Permit Number PRT&hyph;795603 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph E. Johnston at the above Ecological Services Field Office address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheek warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. The Applicant plans to construct a single family residence at Lot 6 Lake Georgetown Estates II Subdivision, Williamson County Texas. This action will directly eliminate less than one-half acre of and indirectly impact less than one additional acre of golden cheeked warbler habitat. The application proposes to compensate for this incidental take of golden-cheeked warbler habitat by placing $2,000 into the City of Austin Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Fund to acquire/manage lands for the conservation of the golden-cheeked warbler. The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three of them because they were not economically viable. James A. Young, Acting Regional Director, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
