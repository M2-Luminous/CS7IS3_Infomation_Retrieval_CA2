Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday on the grounds he might destroy evidence. Nakamura asked Tuesday to be freed on bail so he can take part in a Diet vote to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation last Friday over financial dealings. No date has been set for the Diet vote yet. [passage omitted]
