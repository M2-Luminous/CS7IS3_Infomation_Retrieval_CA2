Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, located in southeastern Xinjiang, covers an area of 483,000 square kilometers. Over one-half of China's large petroliferous basin, the Tarim Basin, lies within Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. In early April 1989, the China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation established the Tarim Petroleum Exploration and Development Headquarters at Korla City, which subsequently opened a major petroleum exploration and development effort involving over 20,000 petroleum employees. In the past five years, they have proven six ready oil and gas fields at Lunnan, Donghetang, Sangtam, Jirak, Jiefang [Liberation] Canal East, and Central Tarim No. 4, and they have discovered 25 new industrial oil and gas-bearing structures. During the Eighth 5-Year Plan, they implemented reserve resources sufficient to build a production capacity of 5 million tons. This is especially true of the discovery of the Central Tarim No. 4 100-million-ton oil field, which has revealed the broad prospects for finding a cluster of huge oil fields in the central Tarim region. Now, the five oil fields at Lunnan, Donghetang, Sangtam, Jiefang Canal East, and Central Tarim Number 4 have formed a yearly crude oil production capacity of 2.1 million tons, and they have produced a total of 2.93 million tons over the past five years with a daily output level of 6,000 tons. Oil field development has made Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture the most direct beneficiary. According to statistics, during the past five years of oil field development the oil field headquarters has made direct investments of more than 1 billion yuan in Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture as well as indirect investments in establishing the materials supplies, communication and transportation, equipment maintenance, machinery processing, construction materials and chemical industry, design and construction, labor services, and other areas to support the oil field that totalled several billion yuan. Petroleum development has spurred rapid development of Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's economy. During the past five years, Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture's GNP has doubled, its gross value of industrial and agricultural output has increased two-fold, and its financial income has increased 1.5-fold. Enormous changes have occurred in the autonomous prefecture's communication, urban construction, posts and telecommunication, energy resources, and other basic facilities and it has become one of the few regions in Xinjiang with fully equipped highways, railroads, pipelines, aviation, and telecommunications.
