This attack was also aimed at jeopardizing the democratic process; at hampering the holding of the legislative elections; and at paralyzing economic activities whose effective resumption has started to cause some concern to the enemies of the Togolese people. The government is happy at the failure of the attempt to assassinate the head of state, and expresses to him its deep gratitude for his invaluable contribution for the restoration of peace and security in the country. As of now, the security forces, through their courageous and efficient action, have put to flight the attackers and restored order and security in the country. The government warmly congratulates the Togolese Armed Forces, the National Gendarmery, the national police, and keepers of the territorial security for their courage and their loyalty. It also congratulates the Togolese people in general and those of Lome and its environs in particular for their calm, discipline, and contribution to the restoration of peace. Following these painful events which plunged the Togolese people into mourning, the government expresses its compassion to the bereaved families and wishes a quick recovery to those wounded. Order and security have been restored, and the government is calling on the people of Lome and its environs to go about their normal business beginning today, Saturday, 8 January. However, in order to consolidate peace and tranquility, the curfew will remain in force from 2100 to 0500 in Lome and its environs, beginning today, Saturday, 8 January. Finally, the government has decided to reopen the northern and eastern land borders. Western land borders remains closed until further notice. Issued: Lome, 8 January. [Signed] The Government
