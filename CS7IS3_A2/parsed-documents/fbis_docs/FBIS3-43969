The honorables gave an account of how they were kidnapped from their homes on 21 September and 3 October 1993 and how they had been treated until their release on 10 January 1994. The honorables started by saying that for the first 24 hours of their kidnapping they had been handcuffed, no food had been provided to them, and water was in very short supply. Shortly afterwards, they were taken to an island off the coast of Kismaayo, which was barely fit for human habitation, as the temperature was 40 degrees Celsius during the daytime and very cold at night. The honorables went on to say that in disrespect to their religion UNOSOM sometimes added pork to their meals -- but they threw it away. They said after some time they fell ill in detention and their request for treatment fell on deaf ears, resulting in a deterioration in their health. They also stated that they were subjected to terrible noises coming from jet fighters and helicopters, with the aim of terrorizing them. The citizens also said that the reason for their being taken to Baidoa was to attempt to prove that they were the ones responsible for all acts against UNOSOM troops.
