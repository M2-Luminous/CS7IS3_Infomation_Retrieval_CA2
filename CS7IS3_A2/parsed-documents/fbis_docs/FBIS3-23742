Chairman's Authority Limited in Draft Law"] [Text] The draft law on the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation prepared by the Constitutional Court Work Group was presented yesterday. Now it should soon be submitted to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly as a legislative initiative of the Constitutional Court. As we know, the president suggested that the court engage in legislative activity back in October of last year, when he issued the edict concerning the way for the constitutional judges to spend their time that would be preferable from his viewpoint. Without going into the propriety of such "instructions" from the head of one branch of power to the highest organ of another, it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court really is in need of a new law. The previous one became obsolete because of the numerous amendments made to the previous Constitution. After the adoption of the new one, which gives completely different kinds of authority to the Constitutional Court, it became twice as obsolete. And that is only from the formal standpoint. The law on the Constitutional Court, as distinct from many other laws of the new Russian state which have prototypes in Union practice, was written completely starting from "scratch." Such a reality as this simply did not exist previously. The authors from the Committee on Draft Legislation of the Supreme Soviet created a "cocktail" mainly out of American and German legal norms. Over two years, all of its weak spots "came to light." As for the new document, above all one should point out that it will be a federal constitutional law, with respect to which the Constitution has prescribed much stricter rules for adoption. It is a law that elaborates on the Constitution and fills in its gaps without a procedure for amendment. There will be only a couple of laws like this. Consideration of the constitutionality of political parties has been eliminated from the new law. Therefore, one can assume that the so-called CPSU affair will remain the only precedent. And now every citizen or court may appeal a law that encroaches on the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens. Resolving disputes between federal organs of power and subjects and among various subjects has also been added to the purview of the Constitutional Court. This new norm for the purview of the Constitutional Court is mentioned briefly in the new Constitution, but the law on the Constitutional Court includes the entire procedure. According to it, conflicting parties may appeal to the Court, as can the president if he has not succeeded in his conciliatory role in conflicts of powers. The fact that the Court has been given a completely new right to interpret the Constitution is also an innovation. As for the chairman of the Supreme Court, his authority is significantly restricted now. His role has actually been reduced to conducting sessions and recognizing speakers. Any action on the part of the chairman is accompanied by a stipulation: "by a decision of the Court" "with the Court's consent," etc. All decisions are adopted collegially, which can also lead to making the Court ineffective if the judges, instead of analyzing cases, jointly resolve all issues, right down to economic ones. The developers also tried to envision a number of measures to make politicization of the Court as difficult as possible. In many judicial systems there is such a concept as "restraint" or "silence" of judges. But that is not so much written into the laws as it is prescribed by ethics. Since no kind of silence can be achieved legislatively. Under the previous Russian law, judges were instructed not to discuss cases under consideration by the court while in the new one they are prohibited from expressing their ideas even regarding those issues that could be considered by the Court. From now on, the results of the voting will not be divulged, either: how many voted "for" and how many "against" the decision that was adopted. Moreover, the judge is now prohibited not only from engaging in political activity but even from attending party congresses as a spectator. This prohibition seems rather absurd. One might assume that it was introduced specifically against Constitutional Court Judge Viktor Luchin, on whom, in search of "evidence" of his political activity, the judges subscribing to a pro-presidential political direction "pinned" precisely that. The law on the Constitutional Court also contains many other "innovations" whose apparent purpose is to reduce the political role of the Constitutional Court as much as possible. As we know, the Court began to consider the president's statements of both 20 March and 21 September on its own initiative. The Court has now been deprived of the right to such personal initiative. Incidentally, another ban has been imposed: The Constitutional Court may not consider actions and decisions of officials that are not expressed in normative acts (another veiled reference to 20 March of last year). In order to accelerate the movement of cases, the Court has been divided into two chambers, which have equal rights and are not specialized. No position for chairman has been envisioned in the chambers. In addition to these innovations, an extremely important aspect, which was initially proposed by specialists from the work group but was eliminated in the stage of coordination, is missing. This measure could prevent extremely negative political consequences of the adoption of unconstitutional laws. We are speaking about preliminary monitoring of laws published by parliament. In the opinion of the leader of the Department of International Law of the Constitutional Court, Vadim Sobakin, "If the Court were given the right to verify the constitutionality of laws after they were adopted but before they were published, this would help to significantly reduce the intensity of political passions. For after the law takes effect, irreversible consequences begin. For example, the law on taxes. Let us say that it encroaches on citizens' rights. But how many people have to pay the taxes it establishes before we consider their constitutionality! And it is precisely the honest taxpayers who suffer. This would also mean that the president would not have to be discredited again--after all, when a law is abolished, his okay goes with it. This practice is widespread in many European countries whose Constitutional Court proceedings are extremely similar to ours. Such as Italy, Austria, Romania, Poland, Portugal, and other countries."
