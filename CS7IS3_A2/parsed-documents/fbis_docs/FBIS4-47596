Guided by a Wise Budget'': ``Science Will Not Remain in Debt''--first six paragraph are POISK introduction] [Text] Each time, when attending a general meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences, you try to detect in what is happening something new, a mark of what has been introduced into science by our fast-paced times. What is meant are not only the problems and achievements of academic science, an extensive list of which was contained in the speech of RAS [Russian Academy of Sciences] President Yuriy Osipov and the report of Chief Scientific Secretary of the Academy Igor Makarov, but also the changes, which affect the overall mood and future of the scientific community. This time the meeting took place, it appears, guided by timid hopes for bright prospects for the RAS this year. The State Duma Decree ``On the Crisis in Russian Science'' and the changed, as one wants to hope, attitude of the government toward the needs of research collectives became the culture medium of the cautious optimism of scientists. In the draft of the federal budget, which the State Duma should pass, the science line is supported by a figure that for the present is quite reassuring. Moreover, they are also promising to pay last year's debts. Vladimir Khlebodarov, president of the Council of Trade Unions of Workers of the RAS, acquainted people with a letter, which was addressed to the council by Deputy Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation A. Astakhov. Here are a few excerpts from this letter: ``In the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation for 1994 the reimbursement of the outlays on the repayment of the debt during the past year in the amount of 22.9 billion rubles [R] is envisaged for the RAS and its regional departments. Moreover, the amounts of financing of these institutions, 10 percent of which were sequestrated and which were envisaged by the draft of the republic budget of the Russian Federation for the second through fourth quarters of that year in the amount of R60.2 billion, were restored. The appropriations were increased by R16.4 billion in March of that year in connection with the increase in December 1993 of the minimum wage by 1.9-fold." And although no one saw the promised money, and no one knows when it will begin to arrive, the spirit of hope hovered above the heads of those who had gathered. For some it resurrected the dream of returning to the good old times--at that time familiar exultant self-reports with prospects for a subsidy were heard from the rostrum. Before others the hope afforded new prospects, and they spoke about what is needed in order to make them come true and proposed their own means of the organization and development of Russian academic science. In this issue we acquaint the readers with brief accounts of the speech of Yu. Osipov and the report of I. Makarov at the general meeting of the RAS. Lists of the newly elected full members and corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences are published on page 2 of the newspaper.'' Science Will Not Remain in Debt In describing the situation, under which the academy operated, it is possible, unfortunately, to repeat much of what was said in the speeches at the general meetings in December 1992 and April 1993 and to speak about the confusion of statewide goals and guidelines, including in the area of science, about the deformation of social values, about the destruction of historical traditions, and about the problems of science, culture and education under the conditions of the economic crisis and political upheavals. But however difficult it is for us, our academy is being preserved and is operating, it is playing a decisive role in Russian science--as the most important component of the spiritual and intellectual wealth of Russia. The main contribution of the academic community of the present and future of science also lies in this. In my speech I would like not only to speak about several results of the year, but also to touch upon a number of very urgent and difficult problems, with which the academy had occasion to be faced. I should say at once that, in spite of all the difficulties which the meeting participants know better than anyone, the academy succeeded as a whole in maintaining a high level of conducted research. (The president dwelt in detail on the achievements, by which the work of a number of scientific collectives of the RAS was commended.) Only individual examples of the scientific results of the year under review were named. I, of course, do not have the opportunity to mention other results. But such results exist. And this inspires certain optimism. I will speak about several other aspects of our activity. I will recall that our regional departments are financed by a separate line in the state budget. The total budget of the academy in 1993 was R141 billion. Incidentally, in comparable prices it is one-fourth to one-tenth as much (here the estimates are different) as the 1990 budget. I stress that it is one-fourth to one-tenth as much as the 1990 budget. We failed to receive R22 billion last year, mainly during the fourth quarter, therefore, the budget was fulfilled by approximately 85 percent. And the fact that this indicator is higher than in other scientific departments of Russia, of course, is not comforting. And how the academy literally monthly wrung out these meager assets is a theme for another discussion. A few words about scientific personnel. The presidium of the RAS tried to do everything possible to preserve the personnel potential of the staff of the academy. In 1992 the total number of workers decreased by 4.5 percent and in 1993, by 3.7 percent. Here the number of candidates of sciences decreased by 1.4 percent, while the number of doctors of sciences even increased by 5.6 percent. This testifies that people are defending doctoral dissertations, in spite of all the difficulties. It is gratifying that after the sharp decrease of the hiring to academic institutes of young specialists by a factor of 3.5 in the last three years during the year under review this process has been starting to stabilize somewhat--1,149 people came to us, I have in mind the central part of the academy, which is slightly more than in 1992. Some change in the dynamics of admission to graduate studies emerged. In 1993, 767 graduate students were registered. This exceed by 100 this indicator in 1992. However, the total number of people studying in academic graduate studies decreased from 5,000 in 1992 to 4,220 in 1993. The ``brain drain,'' which is worrying us, has continued, although on a smaller scale. We have lost not only prominent, established scientists, but also talented young people: In the past two years approximately 500 associates of the academy have gone abroad for permanent residence, and more than 1,700 associates are on extended missions. I think you will agree that our international relations have become more striking and diverse. Cooperation within the framework of long-term agreements with our foreign partners, membership in international organizations, as well as participation in international scientific projects remain the basic forms of our relations. Today there are 74 agreements, which encompass nearly all the directions of contemporary basic science, with scientific organizations of the far and intermediate abroad. We have membership in 235 organizations. However, it is alarming that the Russian Academy of Sciences is beginning to lose its positions in these organizations, although five Russian scientists have been elected presidents, 50 have been elected vice presidents, and about 80 have been elected members of the governing bodies. In the past two years funds have been allotted to us to pay the dues in international organizations. The Russian Academy of Sciences represents not only its own interests, but also the interests of the state. However, the funds being allotted are insufficient, and due to this we are beginning to lose positions in international scientific organizations. It is gratifying that the scientific ties of the RAS with the academies of sciences of the former republics of the USSR have begun to be restored. I believe that these academies are parts of the common organism of our scientific community, which are united by scientific schools, unique tools and sets of scientific research, and organizational principles. Integration is now being carried out both within the framework of bilateral agreements and through the International Association of Academies of Sciences. I would like to say a few words about cooperation with state structures. It is necessary to mention a number of important decisions that were made by state bodies on the initiative and at the insistence of the Academy of Sciences. There is the well-known edict of the president of 21 September 1993. It applies to all the scientific associates of Russia, who have the academic degree of candidate and doctor of sciences. This is a significant edict, unfortunately, its implementation is being dragged out. But the situation all the same is straightening out, and now they are beginning to allocate money for these purposes. I would like to note the very important April decree of the Supreme Soviet of 1993. According to it all the land, which the academy had at its disposal, is passing to its permanent, gratuitous, free use. And, of course, the Supreme Soviet helped us, having adopted the decision which prohibits the privatization of the scientific facilities of the Russian Academy of Sciences with the permission of the presidium of the Academy of Sciences. But I have to say that the State Committee for the Management of State Property is continuing to violate this law. The protocol with the Ministry of Finance on the budget for 1994. This, I believe, is an important agreement. In my opinion, it was proposed to allocate about R5 trillion for science, then this figure was lowered to R4.18 trillion, then Boris Georiyevich Saltykov fought with the Ministry of Finance and raised this figure to R4.4 trillion. The budget of the academy remains the same, they did not touch it, it was not cut in comparison with the budgets of other departments. And, of course, I cannot but speak here about the important statement in support of science, which the State Duma has now adopted. To preserve and develop our basic science is only a part, though the main one, but only a part of the duty of the academy to Russia. And reality is such that we will not get the support of society, if we keep aloof of its concerns and shut ourselves up in our own problems. The academy is obliged to make its contribution to overcoming the crisis of Russia, a more substantial contribution than so far. There is a historical law: Since the times of Archimedes, if not earlier, scientists came to the aid of their society, during wars and during dislocations and economic and political upheavals. We have considerable resources to help the country. In the area of the natural and exact sciences the academy has basic developments with enormous potential introduction. Given the proper organization of the matter and the support of the authorities many of them could be used in the immediate future. The legislation that now exists, unfortunately, is impeding the development of this work. In the area of the social sciences our scientists should make their contribution to the understanding of what is now happening in the country, from where the decay of civil ethics, outbursts of mass violence and blood-letting ethnic clashes originated, whether there are real means of their prediction and prevention or has the decline of civilization as we know it begun. The academy should give help to the state, participating in the work of specific commissions and committees and in the drafting of specific programs and documents, which require professional scientific knowledge. In particular, it is necessary in the immediate future to develop the legal basis of state science and technology policy and the status of the scientific organization and the scientific associate. To insert proposals in the draft of the new civil and customs codes and in tax and credit legislation and to specify the competences of federal and state bodies of management. Russia needs a Federal Program of the Development of Science for the Next 10 Years. The academy of sciences should take an active part in the formulation of this program, particularly in the area that concerns basic research. State guidelines in the area of science should thereby be formulated. The academy should coordinate basic research in the country to a greater extent. From this standpoint the role of the scientific councils attached to the presidium and the departments should be increased substantially. The academy is obliged to use its prestige for the support of prominent centers of sectorial science, many of which are in a more difficult position than the academy. We should participate most actively in the immediate completion and in the carrying through legislative bodies of a package of laws that are connected with the existence and activity of our science cities. Much is being said on this theme, but no headway is being made. The thorough integration of the academy with leading universities of Russia is necessary. Keeping in mind the recertification of institutes, it is necessary first of all to assess what contribution the institute has made, say, in the last five years to basic science. Of course, recertification is also needed for the improvement of the scientific structure of the academy. There are proposals to consider the question of the possibility of changing the academic status (from the standpoint of base financing) of the subdivisions, in which basic science is poorly developed and the nature of the activity of which--at times extremely important activity--does not correspond to the basic tasks of the academy. We should also think about uniting in the interests of the cause several of our subdivisions. A number of proposals concern the possibility of decreasing the number of scientific departments of the RAS and uniting several of them. This question is a very ticklish one and cannot be settled imperatively, inasmuch as such radical changes can worsen the contact with institutes, while the material gain from such unification is small. Not rejecting the very posing of the question, I think that it should be studied carefully by the presidium. The procedure of distributing base financing should promote the elimination of inefficiently operating subdivisions and of associates, who do not carry a significant and necessary load, and the reorientation of individual collectives and associates in the priority directions. It is not a question of mass reductions at the academy. The presidium if opposed to such a statement of the question. We should receive very substantial assets for science, if we are to use correctly our property and basic developments that are ready for pilot introduction. For this it is necessary to raise the professionalism in the use of these sources and to create an atmosphere of openness and mutual trust and serious control.
