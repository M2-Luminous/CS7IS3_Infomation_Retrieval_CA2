Bouvard stressed that Albania's associate membership in the North Atlantic Assembly was an important step in its integration with NATO. Zhulali described Bouvard's speech to the Albanian parliament as "the warmest ever" by a foreign political figure. Zhulali asked for greater support to counteract the effects of the embargo on former Yugoslavia, and expressed the view that there will be no "definitive end" to the Balkan crisis without a solution to the Kosovo, the largely ethnic-Albanian enclave within Serbia.
