This came in a speech before an annual meeting of the UN agency caring for Palestinian refugees, read on behalf of his royal highness by Minister of State Mr. 'Adil 'Irshayd. The crown prince said the continued frustrations Arab people have lived over the past two years are regressing now, and are being replaced by cautious optimism that the peace process will continue its march until it reaches a comprehensive solution. But Prince Hasan added that the feelings of fear and anxiety are still there, referring to unresolved Arab-Israeli issues and agreements signed but never implemented. Prince Hasan said the UN Relief and Works Agency should continue health and education services until the plight of 3 million refugees were settled in a fair and permanent way that secures their rights in line with UN resolutions.
