It is the best resort place in the former Soviet Union, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview on Friday [17 June] in the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana. The president is attending an international forum on East-West cooperation. "There is no need to worry, and this is not because I am optimistic by nature, but because the reality proves premature character of rumors claiming aggravated situation in the Crimea," he said. Commenting on the Simferopol-Kiev relations, the president said that the "stage of unilateral pressure and force methods has ceased to exist." The tension can be removed through negotiations following the example of Russia and Tatarstan. The current situation is "not a confrontation but the necessary elucidation of relations," said Yuriy Meshkov. Further dialogue will help to reach accord to ensure certainty and stability. If Russia influences the situation rather actively, things will normalize for both Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, stressed the Crimean leader. As for the Crimean-Russian relations, the bilateral trade and economic agreements, including the agreement with the Moscow government, shall be filled in with content. "This opens up great prospects, and it is up to us not to miss them," he added. Asked what Russia shall do now, the president said it "should use all of its possibilities and finally satisfy its state interest." Solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem would, certainly, help the stabilization but, unfortunately, there are attempts to settle the problem without the Crimean participation, noted Meshkov. "The Black Sea Fleet can and must be located on our territory. The Crimea does not and will not have problems with the Black Sea Fleet," said the Crimean leader.
