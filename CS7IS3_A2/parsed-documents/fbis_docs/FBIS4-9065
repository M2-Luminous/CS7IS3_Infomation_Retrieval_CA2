Havel told CTK at a press conference at the close of the summit that, in a telephone call with him on Thursday, Klaus excused himself, arguing that he was not quite well and had to prepare for a trip to South America. "I have no reason whatsoever to look for a different background to this," Havel said, adding that none of the presidents commented on Klaus' absence because none of them were accompanied by a premier. Journalists present considered Klaus' absence to be one of the most interesting aspects of the summit. Speculations were being spread whether a mere personal problem, probably concerning the division of powers, was behind Klaus's gestures or whether another, deeper meaning should be searched for. First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra and Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde were also invited to attend the meeting. Uhde excused himself because of a very important meeting in Velka Bites, south Moravia, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek said.
