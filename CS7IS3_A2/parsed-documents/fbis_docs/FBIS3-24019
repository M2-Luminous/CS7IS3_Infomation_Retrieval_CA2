An ITAR--TASS correspondent was informed about this by one of the Ukrgazprom executives who wished to remain unanimous. Ukrgazprom representatives refused to indicate the amount of gas taken from Russia in that manner. As indicated by material released by the UNIAN agency, thanks to its energetic "pirating," Ukraine provided heating for communal needs and prevented stoppage of major industrial enterprises during the recent freezing weather. At present the situation is becoming stabilized as temperatures start to rise. Several more days, however, will be needed in order to renew the export delivery of Russian gas in full volume. In accordance with Ukrainian - Russian agreements such acts require payment of fines.
