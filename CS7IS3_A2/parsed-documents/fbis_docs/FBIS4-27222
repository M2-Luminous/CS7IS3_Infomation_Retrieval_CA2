"It was the right thing to do," said Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday. "I am glad the President took the hard but right decision," he told reporters when he officiated at NTUC's [National Trade Union Congress] May Day Family Gathering at the Singapore Zoological Gardens. In a turn-around of policy, Mr Clinton also announced that he would sever the link between China's MFN status and human rights. He had imposed the improvement of China's human rights record as a condition for MFN renewal. He is now facing pressure from American legislators, including those from his own Democratic Party who are enraged by his about- face on China. NTUC chief Lim Boon Heng, who was also present at the NTUC function, also welcomed the move: "Any measure that promotes world trade will be good for Singapore. Singapore entrepreneurs should take advantage of the better business climate in China." [passage omitted]
