This time, without the usual ultimatum given in such cases, U.S. F-16 planes from the NATO base in Aviano dropped three bombs on 10 April about 13 km southwest of Gorazde. Yesterday NATO aircraft renewed the air strikes. Throughout Sunday the Western media agitated for these strikes. Report after report came off the printers that the Serbs had already entered Gorazde, that chemical weapons had been used, causing about 1,500 deaths, that street fighting was going on in the town, and that thousands of patients were fleeing in panic to avoid becoming victims of a Serbian slaughter. Thus, this time, the world electronic media carried out the preliminary "softening up by artillery bombardment." When the U.S. Phantoms [as published] carried out their air strikes, it was even immediately insinuated that they had been approved by the UN secretary general and that Russia had also given her consent. Subsequently it turned out that President Clinton was unable to answer a question that President Yeltsin asked him on the telephone as to whether Butrus-Ghali had approved the air strikes against the Serbs. It also materialized that Yeltsin had not only not given his consent to the strikes, but had demanded an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issue. Now it is already clear that the U.S. bombs dropped near Gorazde had been planned in advance. This act of war was already known about when U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Council of Joint Chiefs of Staff were assuring the world that the United States and NATO did not plan any intervention around Gorazde. By saying this, they simply inflamed the Serbs' ambitions to capture the town, because for them it represented an important guarantee, as it transformed the Drina River into a Serbian river, instead of a border between Bosnia and Serbia. Furthermore, it is no accident that the United States and NATO are joining the side of one of the warring parties at the moment when no other than the Bosnian Serbs made a comprehensive proposal for a lasting and stable peace. However, it transpired that the Bosniaks feared that it might lead to the present front lines becoming border divisions. Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin arrived in Belgrade to try to persuade the Serbs to put an end to the war. However, it is much more uncertain whether U.S. special envoy Charles Redman will persuade the Bosnians to stop counting on warfare and international military intervention, especially at a moment when this intervention has already begun. As a first emotional reaction, the Bosnian Serbs broke off relations with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. It is doubtful whether this is a sensible step. Now no one should try to pretend to be offended or insulted. It is not the right time now for either bad blood or acts of revenge, but the time for immediately resuming the negotiations process, with all three parties taking part on an equal footing. As the war approaches its second anniversary this month, let this not mark the beginning of a new war, this time with the participation of the 16 NATO states.
