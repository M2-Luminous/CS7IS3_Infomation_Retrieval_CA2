We know that the old parties need a bogeyman to divert attention from their own failures. We are convinced that the German people are being subjected to foreign dictates. There is a historical reason for this. Never before in history has a nation twice suffered crushing defeat and humiliation in such a short period of time. The Old Testament principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth still applies to Germany. German politicians have become toothless over the years. Fear of the media, especially directed from the U.S. East Coast, has equipped them with an early warning system that triggers an appropriate response in the event of danger. Exercises in repentance are the order of the day. If there is any doubt, Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker leads the prayers. Whoever does not want to follow the "American way of life" is afraid of being ostracized for considering it corrupt. We have a damned duty and responsibility to fall into the arms of those who want to turn us into the 51st U.S. state. We are also opposed to the kind of double standard that in as short a time as possible mobilized half the world against Iraq just because oil interests were endangered, but watches passively as a people bleed to death on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We do not want such far-reaching liberalization that we are confronted with pornography and violence on television every evening. We do not want Germany to become a Harlem. We do not want the kind of security that only rich people can afford, with watch towers, barbed wire, and private armies. We do not want the Mafia, which has been reexported from the United States to Italy, to destroy our children with drugs. Mammon is not our god. We believe that the strong should help the weak. What we value does not lie in a safe, but in our hearts! It was worth struggling for these ideas. We do not want Gottfried Benn's merciless statement to become reality: "The Occident is not heading for destruction because of totalitarian systems or because of spiritual poverty, but because of the servility of intelligence vis-a-vis political expediency."
