While the belief of oil experts and also the position of the other 11 OPEC members and the psychological atmosphere of the market was favourable for reduction of the production ceiling by 1 to 1.4 million barrels per day, Riyadh disagreed with any reduction in the production of its oil. On the basis of these views such a reduction by member states could cause the price of oil to increase by dlrs 3.00 to 4.00 per barrel. All witnesses and reasons indicate that the opposition of Saudi Arabia with other OPEC members and especially Islamic Iran as one of the countries that offered that proposal in the recent OPEC meeting was merely political and was adopted without taking into account the interests of other members. Oil and economic experts emphasize on this point that the responsible officials in Saudi Arabia should not relate its dispute with Iran over the number of Mecca pilgrims to oil issues. The recent decision-making by the Saudi Government in the area of oil issues has always created the suspicion that this country prefers Western interest to the interests of Muslim countries and other OPEC member states. Although the OPEC secretariat had warned that if the production ceiling was not reduced within the next two months the oil price would fall several dollars from the present level. Nevertheless Saudi Arabia remained stubborn on its strange position without considering the realities. Because Saudi Arabia is considered as the biggest oil producing country of the world it has suffered more loss than other countries due to the falling trend of the price of oil during this past year. The income of this country has been reduced at dlrs 2.5 billion for each dollar in the fall of oil price. Iran's policies has indicated the reality that the Islamic republic has always considered the issue of understanding within OPEC, the stability of oil market and the interests of other members and as a result the interests of the Muslim world. It should also be noted that for attaining these goals the Islamic republic has at time even overlooked its own interests. Saudi Arabia, by supplying eight million bpd [barrels per day] of oil to the oil market has played an effective role in reducing the price of oil and the perpetuation of this unprincipled policy has always guaranteed the protection of the interests of the West and the wealthy consumers of oil. 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-Attiyah [name as received], energy minister of Qatar voiced his dissatisfaction in this regard in an interview with the state news agency of Qatar. He emphasized the importance of the reduction in oil production of member countries with the view to improve the situation of the market. According to OPEC secretary general of OPEC, Sobroto, Nigeria and Indonesia, too, offered separate proposals for reducing OPEC production at the level of 1 to 1.4 million bpd which also includes the reduction of the quota of Saudi Arabia. The oil minister of Oman, too, wrote a letter to OPEC on behalf of eight non-OPEC countries saying these countries are ready to reduce the sum of their output by 250,000 bpd. In the opinion of a political expert in the present situation that many of the oil producing countries which, under the influence of diferent factors including reduced oil prices, face economic stagnation, any decision which should create hindrances in the way of the determination of a just and reasonable oil price will be in fact a measure against the interests of developing nations and developing countries. The same expert says Saudi Arabia, by creating a chaos in the adoption of a common decision in OPEC for reducing the volume of oil production has caused considerable loss to the oil producing countries and with respect to the warming temperature there is now the likelihood that the crisis caused by the reduction of oil prices will stretch its heavy shadow on the economy of many oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. He also believed that the opposition of the government of Saudi Arabia with the increase in oil prices is in fact some sort of antagonism and opposition with the Islamic Republic of Iran. At any rate eonomic experts have a consensus of opinion in one issue which is that the position of Saudi Arabia did not aim at understanding, unity and solidarity of OPEC members and this decision-making has deeply astounded and at the same time angered producing countries. It is said that in Geneva the officials of the Saudi Government in their direct talks with the Iranian sides admitted that their opposition to the increase in the oil price is a reply to the position of Iran in relation to the issue of hajj and reaction to the violation of Saudi Arabia of its previous commitments. Such reports, in case they are true, more than anything else are indicative of the presence of political weakness, and there is the expectation that the officials of Saudi Arabia will look at issues with more realism and refuse to take a decision which inflicts the biggest loss to this country.
