He reported that the Abkhazian party had put forward a concept of Abkhazia's legal statute that is absolutely unacceptable for Georgia. It stipulates "not even a confederative restructuring within the frame of an integral Georgia but rather a form of a treaty much more resembling relations between two neighbor states, in addition, rather cool." Machavariani particularly pointed out that the Abkhazian party behaves as a "victor" in the light of recent events in Gali Rayon and this causes extreme aggravation in the atmosphere of the talks. However, said Machavariani, representatives of the world community and Russia at the talks keep backing an idea of Georgia's territorial integrity and in this respect their position is quite close to that of Georgia. This permits us to pin hopes on reaching a certain consensus while handling the problem. According to Machavariani, a concluding sitting will be held tomorrow, when the work carried out at the talks will be summed up.
