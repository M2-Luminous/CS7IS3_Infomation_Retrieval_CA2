The demonstrators also called for the release of all Palestinian prisoners. Violent clashes between Hebron residents and soldiers took place today against the background of the growing tension surrounding the prisoner release. Our correspondent Yoram Kohen reports: What may have looked like just another demonstration for the release of all the Palestinian prisoners was actually more than that. Today's demonstrations in Jericho were really a protest against the peace process. This afternoon, over 2,000 supporters of the rejectionist organizations, mostly from George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], gathered to protest the Gaza-Jericho First agreement while demanding the immediate release of all Palestinian prisoners. The demonstration marched uninterrupted down the town's main streets. Palestinian policemen were prepared for the event but did not intervene. Earlier, after Friday prayers, hundreds of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] supporters demonstrated in the town for the same reasons. The Hamas activists, however, had a different slogan. They shouted that Islam is the solution. [passage omitted] Residents of the Gaza Strip also demonstrated today over the prisoner issue. The demonstrations have been held every day for a week now. The rally was organized by the PFLP. The residents are furious with the Palestinian leadership and claim it capitulated to Israel on this issue. Nabil Sha'th said today that the negotiations on the release of those prisoners who still remain in jail will start at the beginning of next week. Up till now, approximately 1,300 prisoners have refused to sign a commitment to stop terrorist activity. [passage omitted]
