The conversation centered on the complex situation of the Georgian economy and solutions to this problem. The head of state mentioned that the situation in Georgia is so grave that a specific social solution has to be found. There are acute problems in power engineering and grain supplies; inflation is rising. Therefore, regulating solely the tax system will not resolve all the problems provided the rest of the issues are settled, to which end the efforts of the supreme authorities are directed [sentence as heard]. Mr. Boshman agreed with the head of state and said that it is time realistic actions are carried out in order to get out of the situation, all the more when east European countries have had an experience of it.
