With the latest agreements signed, these actions will increase further, mainly in trade, cultural cooperation, and science and technology. Two recent examples are Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin's visit to the island and today's signing of documents authorizing the recent resolutions of the mixed commission that met in this capital last month to establish new cultural and educational agreements. In the first semester of 1994, a monumental effort by the two Latin American countries led to a decision to work together on a number of projects in public health, cattle and farming, energy, and cultural and educational exchanges. Likewise, in the metallurgical, the iron and steel, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and construction materials industries, common interests were found which could result in an important increase in the total volume of bilateral trade. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Martinez Beaton, the Cuban ambassador in Bogota, referred to current negotiations on the eventual supplying of crude oil to the island, as well as to increasing trade between the two countries. Martinez said that following the agreement under which Colombia would accept Cuban products in payment for a debt of approximately $40 million, a list of products was exchanged upon which broader future trade relations could be based. Martinez said the possible sale of Colombian hydrocarbons to Cuba is being studied, as are methods of payment, shipment, and other issues common to trade negotiations. This was confirmed by Foreign Minister Sanin upon her arrival in Havana. The ambassador was optimistic about advances in Colombian and Cuban trade relations and emphasized visits to Cuba in recent months by the South American nation's ministers of mines and energy, health, and agriculture, the result of which was the signing of trade agreements in each area. In the case of Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, it was revealed recently that during his stay in Havana an agreement was reached on joint ventures in fishing, phytosanitation norms, biological control of plagues, and the marketing of veterinary and farming products. Another result of the conversations held by Ocampo was the decision by a delegation of Colombian sugar cane and coffee growers associations to visit Cuba in June to discuss joint ventures with their Cuban counterparts. Ambassador Martinez said that this month a large delegation of Colombian investors will visit Cuba for a first-hand study of areas for possible joint ventures with the Caribbean state.
