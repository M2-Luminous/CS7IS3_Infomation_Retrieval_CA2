FR940630-0-00003 FR940630-0-00001 Food Safety and Inspection Service 9 CFR Parts 318, 319, 325 and 381 [Docket No. 90&hyph;010F] Incorporation by Reference; Updating of Text AGENCY: Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to update references to the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)'' Book of Methods. The 15th edition of this AOAC publication was published in 1990, after its previous incorporation by reference in certain sections of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. The AOAC's page numbers have changed and therefore the citations in the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations also need to be changed. To make it easier for the reader to find the referenced analytical methods in past editions and the current edition of this AOAC publication, the new citations in the regulations reflect the chapters where the referenced methods can be found in this AOAC publication, rather than the page numbers. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paula M. Cohen, Director, Regulations Development, Policy, Evaluation and Planning Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 720&hyph;7163. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Effect on Small Entities The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This final rule updates references to a publication previously approved for incorporation by reference and changes cites for referenced analytical methods from page numbers to chapters.
