While this will be a trip undertaken on very short notice after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision to resign, it is deemed necessary to fill the diplomatic vacuum resulting from the domestic political confusion. Hata has also decided to push through with the European visit because of the need to establish a relationship of trust with leaders of European countries before the meeting of leaders of the advanced nations (Naples summit) in July. Furthermore, since cooperation with the European states is closely linked to a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. relations, the primary diplomatic task for Japan at the moment, the prime minister is expected to face a serious diplomatic challenge immediately after his assumption of office. Hata is scheduled to hold talks with French President Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the new Italian prime minister during his European tour. However, the political situation in Italy remains volatile, and the new prime minister may not be chosen before Hata's visit. This visit to Europe was originally planned for former Prime Minister Hosokawa during the Golden Week holidays [29 April-5 May]. Hata has decided to comply with the original schedule as the successor to Hosokawa. During his meetings with European leaders, Hata is expected to convey the message that, even after the change of political regimes, Japan's basic policies will remain unchanged under the new administration, and the Hosokawa administration's reform policy of market liberalization through deregulation and other measures will be maintained and further developed. Russia's participation in the Naples summit will also be a major item on the agenda. Hata will also exchange views with the European leaders on the DPRK's development of nuclear devices, and the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Both the Japanese ruling and opposition parties agree that the primary diplomatic issue for the new administration is how to effect a breakthrough in the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The government would like to find a solution before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held during the Naples summit. In this connection, since the European countries have consistently taken the position that the numerical targets demanded by the United States may contribute to managed trade, the Japanese Government believes that "the prime minister's upcoming visit to Europe will be important for Japan's relations with the United States" (according to a Foreign Ministry source).
