The National Assembly voted to pass some articles on which there were still differing views and some chapters of the draft law before passing the entire revised law on election of people's council. Then Nguyen Van Yeu, member of the National Assembly Secretariat, on behalf of the law drafting committee, the investigation committee, and the National Assembly Secretariat read a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on amendments to Chapter Two of the revised law on the organization of people's councils and people's committees.

The revised law on the organization of people's councils and people's committees and the revised law on election of people's councils that have been passed by the National Assembly are the two important laws that help to revamp in one step the organization and activity of the people's councils and people's committees at all levels. These two laws will help to further perfect the legislative system for the organization of the administration mechanism. On 22 June, the National Assembly will work in the conference hall.
