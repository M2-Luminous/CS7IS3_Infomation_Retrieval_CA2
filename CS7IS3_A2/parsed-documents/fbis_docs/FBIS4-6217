FBIS4-6217 "dreas075_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Thailand Army Chief Discusses Cambodian Border `Warning' Army Chief Discusses Cambodian Border `Warning' BK1704114194 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 17 Apr 94 p A2 BK1704114194 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION English BFN [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit was guarded yesterday in his reaction to Phnom Penh's warning it would attack Khmer Rouge tanks found on Thai soil, saying only that the military was responsible for safety and security along the border. Wimon refused to make any comment about exactly how the Army would respond to any possible encroachment on Thai territory by Phnom Penh forces. He repeated Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's comment on Friday that the allegations by Cambodian leaders that the Khmer Rouge was operating from Thai soil were groundless. Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh last week alleged Khmer Rouge tanks had fired from inside Thailand at Phnom Penh government forces in Pailin. On Thursday the Prince warned that his forces might attack the Khmer Rouge tanks even if they were on Thai territory and that he was losing patience over what he called Thailand's continued failure to crack down on Khmer Rouge forces. "If you say they are not on your territory, please don't make any protest if we violate your territory. We don't intend to do that," he reportedly said. The Khmer Rouge are universally held responsible for the deaths of more than one million Cambodians during the Pol Pot reign of terror from 1974 to 1979. Wimon on Friday met Foreign Minister Prasong, Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak and senior military officials to discuss the charges. Meanwhile, Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan insisted that Thailand has never allowed any foreign troops onto its territory and that Prince Norodom's allegation was unfounded and unfair to Thailand. He also said the Army has not been involved in Cambodia's internal affairs or provided assistance to the Maoist faction since the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in August 1991. "Cambodia should think of its relationship with Thailand before making accusations of this sort," he said. Phalangkun also said the Army would give an abrupt and harsh response if Cambodian forces are found on Thai soil.
