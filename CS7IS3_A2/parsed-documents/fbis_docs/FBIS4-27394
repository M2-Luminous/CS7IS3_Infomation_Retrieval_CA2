In the morning, the deputies broke into groups and discussed the draft law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use. In these group discussions, they also offered views on the draft regulation on rights and obligations of organizations over their granted and rented land and the draft regulation on rights and obligations of foreign individuals and organizations over their rented land in Vietnam. In the afternoon, the National Assembly held a plenary session in the conference hall under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to discuss the draft law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use. The draft law consists of six chapters with 26 articles. As of noon, the National Assembly Secretariat received 29 reports on the discussion of the draft law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use held by all the groups. In the afternoon, they took turns to present their views on the draft law. All of them agreed that it is necessary to promulgate a law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use in order to improve land management, strictly implement the law on land promulgated on 15 October 1993, and increase revenue for the state budget. The expressed opinions concentrated on the following issues: the subjects to the law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use, the basis for tax rate calculation, exemptions to the law, and the date the law will become effective. Most of the deputies agreed with the draft law on the subjects to the law as they are all individuals and organizations. Some deputies suggested that it should be clearly specified that organizations are economic organizations. However, some opinions suggested that the word organizations in the draft law should be removed for the reason that land is granted to organizations by the government. When the land is not used, it must be returned to the government. Some deputies suggested that there should be a classification for individuals and organizations that receive their rights on land use before and after 1975. Before 1975, the people had to pay for their rights of land use. But now the people can be granted the right to land use free. Therefore, it is not fair when they are classified in the same category. Most of the deputies agreed with a suggestion to grant tax exemptions to families of fallen combatants; injured soldiers of class one and class two; and cadres, workers, and public servants deployed to work in other localities. Other opinions also proposed that tax exemptions should also be reduced for sick soldiers of class one. Tax exemptions or reductions, however, should not be granted when people move to other residential areas of their choice. Some opinions said that it is necessary to encourage people, who turn fallow land into agricultural land or use land along the national border and on islands for production activity, with appropriate tax privileges. Most of the deputies held that the proposed tax scale is too high. They suggested that the maximum rate should not be set at 20 percent as outlined in the draft law. The rates should be set at 5, 10, and 15 percent. The deputies agreed with the draft law that the people's committees of provinces and cities directly subordinated to the central government must set appropriate rates for their own areas, based on the guidelines issued by the government and on the local situation and provided that their rates do not exceed more than 20 percent of the guidelines. A deputy voiced his query that the draft law stipulates that tax payers must pay their tax where their land is located. What will happen if a person transfers his rights on land use and another person receives the rights on land use reside in different localities? Somebody suggested that taxes should be reduced on a piece of land that has been transferred more than two times. But somebody else suggested that in this case the tax should be many times higher in order to stop the trading of land for profit, thus preventing the increase of land prices. Many deputies suggested deleting article four calling organizations and individuals to support the taxation service in its execution of the law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use. Other deputies proposed that this article should be put together with article 15 about participation, reward, and punishment. Most of the expressed opinions suggested that the law on taxes levied on the transfer of rights on land use should come into effect on the day that the law is promulgated and it should be retroactive to 15 October 1993, the promulgation date of the Law on Land. Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue its debate in the conference hall.
