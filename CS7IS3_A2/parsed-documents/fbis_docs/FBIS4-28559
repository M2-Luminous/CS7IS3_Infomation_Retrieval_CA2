Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement it is "extremely regrettable" that China went on with the nuclear experiment despite other nuclear states' moratorium and when negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty is under way in Geneva. Japan strongly urges China to never repeat nuclear tests, the statement said, and also called on other nuclear countries to continue refraining from conducting such tests. The latest nuclear test was the first since last October and is believed to have been detonated at China's Lop Nor nuclear testing site in western China.
