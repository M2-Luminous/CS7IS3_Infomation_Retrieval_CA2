Furthermore, he told a media briefing in Cape Town, the Natal issue would be taken up by the management committee of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) on Monday. He welcomed political initiatives which he said had been started with a meeting between President F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela this week and which had continued with Mr de Klerk meeting kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the weekend. Political initiatives, however, were not enough. Security forces had to be deployed to protect people from roving bands of armed killers, he urged. "As the ANC we will insist that security forces protect the lives of our people and guarantee that elections take place. The ANC has also embarked on rolling mass action to ensure that we get our demands for free political activity. This will escalate unless Chief Buthelezi and the government agree that our people will be given the political space, and agrees with the TEC to ensure free and fair elections are held." He said all homeland governments would cease to exist on April 27 and that whoever was a chief minister or minister would lose his position on April 27 when the new constitution came into operation. "Chief Buthelezi will cease to be chief minister but what happens between now and then is a moot question. Clearly we expect the kwaZulu government to co-operate in holding free and fair elections." The TEC would discuss the IEC's [Independent Electoral Council] report on the kwaZulu situation and would need to reflect on the position put forward.
