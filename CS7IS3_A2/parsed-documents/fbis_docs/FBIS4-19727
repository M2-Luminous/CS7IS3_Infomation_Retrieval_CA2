"It's the same thinking as in Sarajevo," Juppe said, speaking of an earlier warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they continued to shell the Bosnian capital. "NATO should force compliance with the UN Security Council decision, including issuing an ultimatum," he said. Juppe was speaking to reporters shortly before NATO was to meet in Brussels to discuss a possible extension of air strikes in Bosnia in the wake of a UN Security Council resolution calling on the Bosnian Serbs to observe a ceasefire around Gorazde and pull their forces back from the town.
