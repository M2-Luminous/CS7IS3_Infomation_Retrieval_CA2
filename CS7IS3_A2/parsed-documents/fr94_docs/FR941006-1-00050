ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of public comment period. SUMMARY: On August 10, 1994 the EPA proposed to approve, through ``direct final'' procedure, the exemption request from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (Act) for the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area in Michigan. See 59 FR 40840 (proposed rule) and 59 FR 40826 (final rule). The EPA has received adverse comments and requests for an extension of the public comment period. As a result, the public comment period will be extended an additional 30 days from the date of the publication of this action. Under the ``direct final'' procedures all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule (based upon the proposed rule cited above). DATES: The public comment period is extended until November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: All written comments should be addressed to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604&hyph;3590.
