FR940902-2-00106 FR940902-2-00049 As noted in UIPL 13&hyph;94, Change 1, the justifiable cause exception does not supersede State able and available requirements, but rather is an additional eligibility requirement related to participation in reemployment services. Claimants may be determined to have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services; however, they must still meet a State's able and available requirements to be eligible for UI. For example, although a claimant who is ill may have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services, the claimant is still subject to the State's able and available requirements and may, as a result, be ineligible for UI. e. Appeal Rights. Under paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 303(a), SSA, any eligibility determination that a claimant has failed to participate in reemployment services must be appealable. In addition, all determinations of UI eligibility must contain appeal rights in accordance with the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations. Although States must allow claimants to appeal denials for failure to participate in orientation and assessment, States are not required to permit claimants to contest the propriety of the referral to orientation and assessment. Orientation and assessment are aimed at determining what, if any, additional reemployment services may be needed by the claimants. Obviously, if claimants do not report, this determination cannot be made. In this regard, referrals to orientation and assessment are similar to reporting and ``call-in'' requirements. Claimants must, however, be allowed to question whether any services tailored to the individual are, in fact, needed. If any evidence appears at any stage of the nonmonetary determination or appeals process indicating that the claimant does not need these services, the UI agency must take the initiative in determining whether the referral was proper. If it is found not to be proper, then the participation requirement does not apply and there is no need to address exceptions such as justifiable cause. 12. Feedback and Reporting. Section 303(j)(1)(C), SSA, requires that States collect follow-up information relating to the reemployment services received by the referred claimants and the employment outcomes for these claimants. This information is to be used in refining the profiling system. Section 303(a)(6), SSA, also requires the States to provide ``such reports, in such form and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require *␣*␣*.'' Under these authorities, States will be required to submit information concerning profiling to the Department. This UIPL does not address what information must be collected or reported. Specific instructions for reporting any information on services and outcomes will be issued as changes to ETA Handbook 401, ``Unemployment Insurance Reports Handbook''. 13. Action Required. Administrators are requested to provide this information to the staff developing the worker profiling and reemployment services system. 14. Inquiries. Inquiries should be directed to the appropriate Regional Office. 15. Attachment. Sections 303(j)(1) and 303(a)(10), SSA. Attachment to UPIL Sections 303(j)(1) and 303(a)(10), SSA 1. Section 303(j)(1), SSA_Establishment of Profiling System The State agency charged with the administration of the State law shall establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular compensation that_ (A) Identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment; (B) Refers claimants identified pursuant to subparagraph (A) to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, available under any State or Federal law; (C) Collects follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and the employment outcomes for such claimants subsequent to receiving such services and utilizes such information in making identifications pursuant to subparagraph (A); and (D) Meets other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate. 2. Section 303(a)(10), SSA_Participation Requirement [State law must contain] (10) A requirement that, as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for any week, any claimant who has been referred to reemployment services pursuant to the profiling system under subsection (j)(1)(B) participate in such services or in similar services unless the State agency charged with the administration of the State law determines_ (A) Such claimant has completed such services; or (B) There is justifiable cause for such claimant's failure to participate in such services.
