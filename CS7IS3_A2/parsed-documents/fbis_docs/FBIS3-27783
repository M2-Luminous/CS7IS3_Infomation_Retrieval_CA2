Many people point out that in reality the ROK was left out of the process of such negotiations... [Han Sung-su] It is a pity that I cannot disclose the contents of the cooperation agreed upon between the ROK and the United States. The ROK and the United States discussed in advance the wording of the statement announced as a result of the two high-level talks between the United States and North Korea last year. We also took countermeasures and did analytic work with the State Department before and after every New York contact. [end Han] However, sometimes there seem to be questionable aspects in this cooperative system. The first Vienna contact held early this month between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is being considered as a unilateral decision made by the United States with North Korea. After the 29 December contact, the final New York contact for 1993, the ROK Embassy revealed that there would be a contact between North Korea and the IAEA after one or two working-level contacts in New York in the beginning of the new year. However, at its 5 January regular briefing, the State Department revealed that the working-level contacts in New York had ended for the time being. Since then, there was a telephone contact between North Korea and the United States, and the ROK Embassy confirmed such a U.S. contact after the 5 January State Department briefing. Regarding this matter, Ambassador Han said that there might be differences between the two countries in marginal matters, but since they are in complete agreement with the fact that North Korea must not develop nuclear weapons, differences in marginal matters cannot be regarded as a problem. [Nam] Last November, President Clinton revealed that he will by no means allow North Korea to "develop" nuclear weapons. However, since then, there were rumors that North Korea may already possess nuclear weapons. In this connection, government sources are saying that the remark made by President Clinton in November is being explained as "work is being carried out so that North Korea cannot become a nuclear power." [Han] President Clinton's strategic plan to move away from the Cold War is basically one to free mankind from the terror of nuclear weapons, including the extension until next year of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This must be explained from a broad point of view in that existing nuclear weapons must be reduced and also that work must be carried out so that nuclear weapons can no longer be produced. On whether North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, some people say that "it might possess nuclear weapons," and some other people say that "it might not possess nuclear weapons." This itself is ambiguous, but I do not think that North Korea completely possesses the special technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. [Nam] Nevertheless, policies must be mapped out to be prepared in case North Korea does possess nuclear bombs. Do you not think that all policies at this time are being made under the premise that North Korea does not possess nuclear bombs? [Han] The common goal of the ROK and the United States is to achieve denuclearization, whether North Korea possesses nuclear bombs or not. All negotiations and policies will be regulated in accordance with that goal and according to the situation. [end Han] Many Americans strongly criticized the United States because it might have made a conditional capitulation in the nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Ambassador Han, however, was confident that this will not greatly change the U.S. Administration's existing policy toward North Korea. [Han] Hard-liners and moderates can exist anywhere. It seems that hard-liners and conservatives, in particular, are saying that the United States made conditional capitulation. However, if the IAEA proclaims that the continuity of the nuclear safeguards has been broken, there will be no objection to the fact that this issue will unconditionally be handed over to the United Nations, regardless of the hard-liners and soft-liners. Currently, the IAEA is only saying that the safeguards have been damaged. It has not said whether they have been broken yet. Therefore, all diplomatic means are currently mobilized to find out the truth. [Nam] Let us go into details. Some media organizations recently reported that North Korea decided to receive only one round of inspection, and hawks-conservatives interpreted North Korea's alleged acceptance of one round of inspection to be its surrender. [Han] This problem arose when THE NEW YORK TIMES once carried a report on an "agreement on one round of inspection." This is an incorrect report. The newspaper carried an incorrect report because another reporter wrote it while the reporter in charge of the nuclear issue was traveling in the Far East. When this report was carried, Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally instructed Undersecretary Lynn Davis to do something about the incorrect report. Undersecretary Davis gave a news conference three hours after it was published. At that time, he made it clear that nuclear safeguards must be maintained not on a one-time basis, that the continuity of safeguards must be ensured, that the United States would present this matter to the United Nations anytime the continuity is not ensured. [end Han] However, most of the reports on nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States by THE NEW YORK TIMES or THE WASHINGTON POST have proven to be correct. Meanwhile, ROK newspapers generally quote those newspapers. [Nam] The ROK Embassy in the United States should inform domestic newspapers of the details of the negotiations to a certain extent, should it not? The U.S. Department of State leaks information to THE NEW YORK TIMES and other media organizations. Our government agencies merely keep silent. [Han] The Department of State and we agreed at first to withhold the details of the negotiations from public circulation. However, THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES carried a correct report or two. So, I called high-ranking State Department officials. I protested to them, saying, "We are very much embarrassed by the fact that U.S. newspapers reported details of the negotiations." After that, the United States and we agreed to merely confirm whether contacts take place in New York and keep silent about the details of the negotiations. Because the U.S. Administration has kept silent about the New York contacts, U.S. reporters have even called me. [end Han] Ambassador Han said: There are many think tanks and research institutes in Washington, and many of the people working in those institutes are former government officials. Therefore, those people have leaked information to media organizations on many occasions. For example, a State Department official may leak information when he receives a call from his former boss. [Nam] How will the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York proceed? [Han] I think New York contacts are a useful venue for discussing a third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea. North Korea seems to think New York is a good place for such contacts because it is easy to communicate with Pyongyang from its UN Mission in New York, and the State Department, too, thinks New York is convenient because it is not far away from Washington. All channels of contacts other than New York contacts have now been closed. I think the United States and North Korea will use the New York channel for the time being. [Nam] What is going on with the North Korean nuclear issue now? [Han] Agreement has been reached on general principles. However, no agreement has been reached on the details. An agreement on nuclear inspection between North Korea and the IAEA is merely one of the prerequisites for resolving the nuclear issue. North-South dialogue, another prerequisite, must take place soon. Holding North-South working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys is not sufficient. That is a mere preliminary step. The most important thing is finding a better way to resolve the nuclear issue. North-South exchange of special envoys must take place. [end Han] Ambassador Han, an economic expert, said: "Compared to conflicts in the economic negotiations, the two countries [the United States and the ROK] have virtually no conflict in the negotiations on security affairs between the State and Defense Departments and the ROK counterparts." However, it seemed to be clear that given last year's experiences, a consensus of views or close cooperation is far from true as far as the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue itself is concerned.
