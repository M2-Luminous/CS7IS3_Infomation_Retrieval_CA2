The Zhirinovskiy phenomenon and the delaying tactics of the opposition in the State Duma against the Partnership for Peace with the Atlantic Alliance, as offered to Russia, are new examples for it. However, it is most likely that such a Partnership for Peace will come about if Russia is conceded a relationship of "particular quality" with NATO, including adequate considerations for legitimate Russian interests and the recognition of Russia's position as a major power, as was recently demanded by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in Bonn. After all, President Boris Yeltsin, The Russian military leadership and Russian diplomacy -- as represented by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- are sticking to the declared intention to conclude such an agreement with NATO for the benefit of both sides. On the other hand, one must not ignore the flare-up of greater Russian chauvinism, including threatening gestures toward Russia's neighbors, particularly the former non-Russian peoples of the empire: The demands voiced by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr Rutskoy to restore the imperial union within the borders of the USSR has cast warning signs across East Europe. Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav-Orthodox unity party, together with a clear turn against the West and Islam, has once more raised the question of Russia's orientation. Will it return to Europe or -- as frequently in the past -- will it seek to continue to isolate itself against the West and link East Europe again with a Russian empire in a firm bloc? Zhirinovskiy's pan-Slav vision will turn out to be a chimera like that of his 19th century predecessors, Aksakov, Samarin, Fadeyev, Danilevskiy (the totalitarian philosopher of an all-Russian-pan-Slav utopia), Katkov, and Ignatyev, or that of the milder "neo-Slav" new edition of the beginning of this century. Any attempt politically to unite, for example, the Poles, Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, or Croats, let alone the Ruthenian-Galician West Ukrainians, under Russian leadership in a "Slav Union" in line with Zhirinovskiy's model, would fail merely as a result of these nations' determination for national independence along the cultural dividing line between the Latin-Catholic and the Byzantine-Orthodox cultural heritage of East Europe. Thus, the Moscow Congress of Slav Peoples will not be able, either, to show the way to overcoming historical antagonisms, which 100 years ago, when religion and the pan-Slav idea were still creating a lot of emotion, set external limits to political pan-Slavism. Russia's Balkans policy suffered severe setbacks between 1875 and 1878, then again at the beginning of our century, in all the Balkan wars, even after military victories, and, finally, during the war in 1917, leading to the collapse of the Czarist Empire, whose borders have also been requested by Zhirinovskiy as has a new division of Poland between Russia and Germany. What remains is -- apart from the illusionary pan-Slav appeal -- the strongly anti-Western orientation of the new nationalistic front line. With his turn against London and Paris, Zhirinovskiy is returning to Bolshevik foreign policy, which regarded Germany as a partner against West Europe, and which contributed to the isolation of the Soviet Union -- temporarily continued by Stalin until World War II, and transferred first of all to the United States after 1945. For Russia, this return would lead to becoming detached from Europe and isolated without the rank of a major power, because the foundations of Stalinist power policy cannot be restored. Times have changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The impression created by the pan-Slav and all-Russian-imperialist appeal particularly in Ukraine, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, and also in the Baltic countries and in Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia, will even strengthen these countries' urge to move west near the protective umbrella of the Atlantic alliance. This will make it even more difficult for the NATO states to keep the necessary balance between the integration of East-Central Europe into the alliance and the equally necessary cooperation with Russia in a special "strategic partnership" for European security, as recently mentioned by Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in St. Petersburg. Yet a European balance as a basis for joint security and the extension of the alliance to those countries that feel politically and culturally part of West Europe and are also seeking European Union membership, is the precondition for the structural stability of the post-Soviet nations, including the freedom of peoples and independence in a European home of security. On the other hand, Russian participation will require moderation in Russian foreign policy and cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance on mutually acceptable conditions for preserving security in Europe without a "condominium" on the former allies of the USSR in an extraordinary political relationship -- as accepted by the Partnership for Peace principle. President Yeltsin, his government and the Russian Army have a lot of interest in it because cooperation with NATO would stabilize them at home, too, and would prevent Russian isolation. This dual consolidation is now the most urgent task of joint security policy.
