Happonen declared that they are ready to station CSCE observers in the Karabakh conflict zone shortly. A control point will also be established in Idzhevan, and the delegation arrived in the region to deal with the technical matters. According to Col. Happonen, thanks to the efforts of the CSCE, Russia, and all other countries interested in the peaceful resolution of Karabakh conflict, peace has never been so close as it is now. To fail now would plunge the entire region into disaster. The colonel also declared that another CSCE delegation is currently working in Azerbaijan, and there is hope that, in keeping with the agreement, the yellow berets and the CIS disengagement forces will soon be deployed all along the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict zone.
