Is it a Party in Exile or..."] [Text] A PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] delegation has been visiting Tirana for the past few days. This is the party of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], namely one half of the so-called radical wing based in Tetovo and led by Arben Xhaferi and Mendu Taci. Over these past few days, the delegation has had intensive meetings with [Albanian Democratic Party, DP, leaders] Eduard Selami and Tritan Shehu, with DP deputies, and perhaps with the Albanian head of state himself, Mr. Sali Berisha, who also received the credentials of the ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia in Tirana during the same period. The newspapers have written nothing at all about this delegation. Neither the radio nor the television mentioned it. Why? How can one explain this silence when, in the past, every one of their visits was received with fanfares and given detailed television coverage. The delegation stayed in villa no. 30. Today it may have left. Or perhaps it is still there. Who knows? The villa is guarded by soldiers who are members of the SHiK [National Security Service]. Or perhaps, on the way to Tetova, they are taking a break in Durres or Pogradec, resting in the government residential villas, as the former nomenklatura villas are called today. In a few days' time perhaps, the newspaper of the ruling party and the television will announce, "A friendly visit has been paid to our country..." -- as the practice once was with the Marxist-Leninist party groups that we nannied in secrecy so that they could put on weight and get fat in the nomenklatura villas in Durres, Vlore, Pogradec, and so on. There is nothing wrong with receiving and seeing off a PDP group. The evil lies in the silence and secrecy. It is worse if such a thing is done at someone else's expense.
