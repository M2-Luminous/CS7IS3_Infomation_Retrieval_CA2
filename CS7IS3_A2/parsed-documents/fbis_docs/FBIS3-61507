The procedure is based on using a KFK-2MP photoelectrocolorimeter since the bacteria are only 0.6-3 �m in size, and their study calls for an instrument whose dimensions are several times smaller than the subject of inquiry. The proposed method is thus quite suitable because the luminous flux wavelength falls within a 315-980 nm range which is smaller than the bacterial cell by two- to threefold. A day old Escherichia coli culture cultivated at a 37�C temperature is the subject of investigation. The experimental procedure is outlined. The bacterial population reproduction curve plotted by traditional microbiological and photoelectrocolorimetric methods are cited. The difference in the curves is attributed to the latter method's higher resolution (by 240 times). The findings confirm the possibility of using the photoelectrocolorimetric method for analyzing bacterial life and demonstrate its obvious advantages, e.g., the higher resolution (making it possible to trace the bacterial life changes at a 5 s interval), promptness, high sensitivity, and low labor outlays.
