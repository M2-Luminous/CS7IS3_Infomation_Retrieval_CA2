This is an enormous improvement over the existing situation, for instance in fighting the smuggling of cars. So far, four to six ministries, the embassies, and other authorities had to be used in prosecuting offenses beyond borders, Beckstein said yesterday after speaking to his Hungarian colleague Imre Konya. The CSU politician said that establishing an international investigation pool is an objective to be put into practice in the medium term. Only through access to other countries' car registration data can international car smuggling gangs be stopped. Stolen cars are mainly taken across the eastern borders. Beckstein estimates that this is true for 50 percent of the 150,000 cars reported stolen in Germany last year. The cheaper cars went to Romania, the more expensive ones to the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus. At the Bavarian borders, 15,688 foreigners were seized for trying to cross the border illegally. This figure is 22 percent higher than last year. At the border with the Czech Republic alone, 13,191 persons were discovered; in addition, border police arrested 4,256 persons that were smuggled into the country, which is an increase of 89 percent over 1992. A total of 1,698 people were arrested for smuggling foreigners into the country (126 percent more than in 1992). Of the 29,378 persons arrested at Germany's borders last year, 65 percent were seized by Bavarian border authorities. The interior minister considered this to be a proof of the particularly "intensive investigation work" done by Bavarian border police.
