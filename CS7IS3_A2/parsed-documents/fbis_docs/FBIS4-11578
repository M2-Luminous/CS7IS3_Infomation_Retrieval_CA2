We will continue to work together on the agreed tasks, but as a front, it is disbanded." With these words, a spokeswoman of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) signed the death certificate for the front that groups Trotskyist leaning parties. The other two groups that made up the front -- the Socialist Movement of the Workers (MST), headed by Luis Zamora, and the Workers Party (PO), headed by Jorge Altamirano -- have decided to act jointly. As a first measure, on 1 May at 1500 there will be a commemoration of Labor Day at the Plaza de Mayo. The MAS will hold its own commemoration at the Boxing Federation. [passage omitted] Thus, the Trotskyist alliance ends following its poor performance in the 10 April elections. It had been born in February. At the national level, the Trotskyists lost 31,000 votes compared with the results they obtained in October 1993, with a large loss in the Federal Capital and especially in Greater Buenos Aires. In these two districts "the wave rolled toward the Grand Front and we could do nothing," a spokesperson acknowledged on 26 April, "but in the provinces of Jujuy, Neuquen, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and especially in Santa Cruz we increased our vote. There were workers' struggles in those provinces and it is no coincidence that we had better results there." In Santa Cruz Province the FIS obtained two seats in the Constituent Assembly, the only seats that it was able to gain in the whole country.
