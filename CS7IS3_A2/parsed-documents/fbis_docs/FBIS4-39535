Prior to the session, the president had addressed the parliament in a message, advocating an acceleration of market-oriented reforms and suggesting a wide package of measures to take the country's economy out of the crisis. The message was officially referred to the parliament secretariat on Thursday morning. In the afternoon the message is expected to be presented to the deputies for study and discussion. According to competent sources, the message makes a political evaluation of the internal situation in the country and Kazakhstan's foreign-policy stand, and the reform process, and analyses the activities of state power bodies to implement the strategic policy of building a democratic state with a market economy. At the same time the message defines key orientations of state policy consistently to carry out reforms in all spheres of economic and social life, strengthen Kazakhstan's statehood and the socio-political unity of the peoples inhabiting it. The message formulates clearly political and economic goals and sets appropriate tasks to power and administration bodies for a subsequent period. The presidential message is manifestly aimed at consolidating all branches of state power and all forces of society and at mustering the efforts of all political parties, movements and associations and all robust potential of the state with a view to taking the country out of the deep crisis, deepening reforms, contributing towards democracy and strengthening the Republic's sovereignty.
