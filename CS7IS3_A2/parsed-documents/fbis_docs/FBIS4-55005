FBIS4-55005 "dreeu089_i_94016" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA UN Resolution `Dead Letter' in Gorazde UN Resolution `Dead Letter' in Gorazde AU0905110694 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1000 GMT 9 May 94 AU0905110694 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] [Text] The UN resolution and the NATO ultimatum represent only a dead letter on the paper and the flagrant deceit by the international community that the civilian population of the free territory of Gorazde will be protected. Nothing contained in the decisions adopted by the Security Council and NATO has been respected in the free territory of Gorazde. A real hell reigns here. Is indeed a pity that reputable world press and television agencies have not come here to film the suffering of the unarmed people. The attempts by the citizens from local communities and the villages of Kopaci, Uvjeri, Vran Potok, Causevici, Kazlagici, Zubcici, Zuzevo, Milanovici, Brijez, Pticino Polje, and other areas in the 3 km zone to return to their houses have all been in vain. The evacuation of the seriously wounded children has not been going according to plan either. We do not know whose mistake it was, but a three-year-old boy, Adnan Azovic, was not on the list of those evacuated to a modern hospital. He is seriously ill. Permission for his evacuation was obtained a year ago and yet he is still in Gorazde. His parents have medicines, [name indistinct] for only two more days. This medicine means life to him. If he is not evacuated, his childhood will end forever. Therefore, we again appeal to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and all international medical organizations to secure the evacuation of the seriously ill children from Gorazde.
