The ministers from all 16 NATO members except France said in a statement after two days of talks they were worried about the "growing risks" posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. "We expressed serious concern at the actions taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the possible consequences for regional security and stability, as well as the potential repercussions in other parts of the world." The ministers called on Pyongyang to abide by the provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The North Koreans have threatened to suspend their adherence to the treaty in a dispute over inspection of two suspected nuclear sites. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation defence chiefs also urged the Ukraine to fulfill pledges to dismantle its nuclear arsenal inherited from the old Soviet Union and to ratify the START I disarmament treaty. They called for "intensified efforts" to prevent a spread of nuclear arms "and to address and to counter if necessary the associated risks to alliance security." NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner expressed the hope that the alliance's summit here next month would adopt a U.S. proposal for active steps to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists and renegade states. But he acknowledged that financing would be a major problem in a key element of the U.S. counter-proliferation scheme, an anti- missile defence system. "There is such a costly expense that nobody can go it alone," Woerner told a news conference. "Perhaps the Americans but not Europeans."
