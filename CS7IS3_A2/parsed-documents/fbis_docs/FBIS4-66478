It appears that the U.S. intends to put a stop to the plutonium research effort of Japan and Russia. This may cause considerable difficulty for Japan which is promoting plutonium research on a global scale. The United States is objecting to two subjects of the research: 1) development of advanced fast reactors that use lead instead of sodium coolant; 2) research on group partition of radioactive waste. Japan proposed these topics in response to requests from the Russians. The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute is leading the research cooperation efforts. The Board of Directors of the International Science and Technology Center met for the first time in Moscow on 17-18 March 1994. The U.S. Government informed the Japanese Government just prior to the meeting of their ``objection to adopt a project that promotes the use of plutonium in Russia.'' The reasons reported for their objections include: 1) fear of sloppy management of nuclear materials in Russia; 2) plutonium-related projects violate U.S. non-proliferation policy. In response to their objections, the Japanese side stated, ``it would be inappropriate not to adopt all of the plutonium-related projects because the Center' s objective is to prevent scientists and engineers who have been involved in plutonium developments from leaving the country.'' There was no official discussion held during the Beard of Directors' meeting in March, but the projects in question were kept on hold. On the other hand, 23 projects (valued at $12 million) including nuclear power safety technology which is not directly related with plutonium use, were confirmed for the first phase. Additional projects are supposed to be selected at the next Board of Directors meeting in June 1994. The Japanese government, in the mean time, will discuss with the U.S. side the validity of the plutonium-related projects. Some government sources are saying that a portion of the projects may have to be revised in order to proceed with the projects smoothly. Greatly Cautious Toward Japan-Russia Cooperation [Commentary] This latest U.S. pressure on project selection at the International Science and Technology Center seems to have been motivated by deep-rooted American caution over Japan' s involvement with technologies related to mass destruction weapons as well as differences between the two countries' positions on the use of plutonium. The Center has been established to provide research opportunities for peaceful purposes and to encourage those scientists and engineers who were involved in the development of nuclear weapons and missiles to switch jobs. It is only natural that doubts may arise about the possibility that weapons-related information flowing from those experts in the course of cooperation on plutonium-related projects with Japan. On the other hand, Russia is eager to use plutonium for non-military purposes and is very eager to cooperate with Japan. The U.S. does not interfere with Japan using plutonium in Japan. But it would oppose more active use of plutonium through cooperation between Japan and Russia. Japan has offered to invest $20 million, almost 1/3 of the total funding for the International Science and Technology Center. Japan is eager to absorb the fruits of Russian research on fast reactors and plutonium. Those involved in promoting the project may become highly frustrated if they are unable to select research subjects freely because of US objections.
