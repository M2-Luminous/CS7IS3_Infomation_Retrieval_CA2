The president of Russia said that his meetings with the inhabitants of the capital of Tatarstan showed that the political situation in the republic is returning to normal after the conclusion of the bilateral treaty. Boris Yeltsin stressed at the same time that the treaty should not become just a "piece of paper". A bilateral commission has been set up to implement the treaty. It will be headed on the Russian side by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and not by Sergey Shakhray as was planned. "On the Tatarstan side, the commission will be headed by the prime minister [Mukhammet Sabirov]," the president of Russia said. In Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Russia is now to move toward decentralization on a country-wide scale. However, it is inadvisable to apply the terms of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan to other subjects of the federation. "A separate treaty should be signed with every republic, kray, and oblast, a separate demarcation of powers should be envisioned. We will move along that path but not so quickly that similar treaties will be signed with other regions this year," the Russian president said. Replying to questions on the possibility of applying the bilateral treaty with Tatarstan to the CIS, the leader of Russia said that it is still too early to talk of that. In his opinion this model must first be developed within the framework of Russia. Boris Yeltsin will leave Kazan for Moscow once the meeting is over.
