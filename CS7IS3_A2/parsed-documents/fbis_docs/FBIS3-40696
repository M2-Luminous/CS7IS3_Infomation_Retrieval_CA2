The "dirty tricks department" of the ruling party appeared to have reactivated itself, and while it ensured that the Opposition could not draw a drop of blood along with the proverbial pound of flesh, the manner in which the footlights faded on the Dunkel drama actually constituted one of the darker pages in the parliamentary chronicle. The Opposition was justified in feeling cheated. After disrupting the House for almost two days over the signing of the Final Draft Act--to get the terminology correct--the Opposition had withdrawn its protest after being given to understand that the Prime Minister would address some of its anxieties. The Deputy Chairman had clearly told them Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao would make a statement and the closed-circuit television information system had flashed the same message. Even when the Deputy Chairman ordered that clarifications be sought on the Commerce Minister's statement. Opposition members thought Mr Rao would eventually make a few remarks. They did not sense something amiss when, in response to a query from among their ranks about the Prime Minister making a statement, the Deputy Chairman indicated a change in the format. Thus it was that the Opposition reacted with dismay and surprise when, immediately after Mr Pranab Mukherjee concluded his reply, the House was adjourned for the day. There was no opportunity to demand that the Prime Minister speak and no chance to exercise the legitimate form of expressing displeasure through a walk-out. The manner in which the Government handled the entire affair did nothing to suggest that it genuinely treated members with respect. When the Opposition questioned the veracity of newspaper reports that the Cabinet had given the negotiators in Geneva the green signal, there was no response. It took an occupation of the well to dislodge Mr Kamaluddeen Ahmed from his seat, and all he had to offer was that a statement might be made later in the day. The Opposition did not overdo the obstructionist tactics. The Deputy Chairman ordered a brief adjournment, saying she would contact the Commerce Minister. When the House reassembled, no protest was made when Dr Najma Heptullah explained that she had not been able to talk to the Minister since he was attending a meeting. Then Mr Mukherjee came to the House, but only minutes before the scheduled lunch-break. Yet when the post-lunch session commenced, it was announced that the statement would be made the following day--after the agreement would have been signed. Obviously, the reaction of the Opposition was one of extreme displeasure and the House was brought to a virtual standstill. Disgruntled members relented on the understanding that the Prime Minister would intervene, but as things turned out, that was not to be. It was not merely from the parliamentary angle that the Government bungled. The impression it sent out was that it was not particularly convinced about the positive aspects of the agreements. The parliamentary version of the GATT dispute also brought another important issue into focus--the status of the reports of the Standing Committees that were introduced earlier this year. The Opposition maintained that the Government had totally ignored the unanimous recommendations of a committee comprising members of all the political parties, and, therefore, questioned the utility of the Standing Committees. It was only technically correct. As the Commerce Minister pointed out, the committee presented its report to Parliament only a day before the expiry of the deadline to sign the agreement, so how could anyone expect the Government to formulate its negotiating stance on the basis of the report? Since just about anyone with even a faint knowledge of the GATT process was aware of the December 15 deadline, surely the committee, headed by an experienced person like Mr I.K. Gujral, ought to have been alert about that. What purpose, other than completing a formality, could the members of the committee have imagined would be served by submitting a report on December 14? The ruling party members appeared quite happy that they had outplayed the Opposition and averted any kind of attack on the Prime Minister. But they wore false smiles. They had not been deft, but devious. And the difference between the two is enormous. The varied tactics adopted by the BJP to protest against the arrest of its leaders (not particularly effective since by the end of the week few even took note of its absence) resulted in M.P.s doing some thinking about the disruption of question hour as a valid form of protest. When the members of the other parties raised strong objections to being denied one of their most valued instruments, the message went home. No disruptions thereafter. There was, however, another dimension to the issue.
