A Council of State has taken over the day-to-day running from President Teatao Teannati moved out of the presidential residency hours after he fell from power, the state-owned Broadcasting and Publications Authority said. In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, the assembly, the ruling National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when the opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate the misuse of public funds. Opposition Maneaba Party MP Teburoro Tito claimed funds had been misused in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment and gifts. In an attempt to settle the situation, Vice-President Taomati Iuta proposed setting up a commission of inquiry, instead of a parliamentary committee, but this also was defeated. Speaker Beretitara Neeti then dissolved parliament. He now sits in the interim Council of State along with the chief justice and the chairman of the Public Service Commission. Under the constitution, general elections are expected to take place by August. Elections are normally held every four years and another was not due until next year. Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands, consists of 33 islands scattered over five million square kilometers (two million square miles) in the Pacific Ocean. Its 68,000 people, known as "I-Kiribati," are predominantly Micronesian. The word Kiribati is the closest local pronunciation that the 13-letter island alphabet could manage for Gilbert. Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the Americans when they landed marines there in 1943 to dislodge Japanese forces, who had taken over most of the Gilberts. The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or Ocean Island although British phosphate mining all but destroyed the island and most of its people have been resettled in Fiji.
