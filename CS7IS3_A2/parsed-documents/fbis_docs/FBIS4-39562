But Boris Yeltsin's latest appointments stand out from this crowd. Two weeks ago it was announced that Ivan Rybkin has become a member of the Security Council. Now the other speaker -- Vladimir Shumeyko -- has been included into the council as a non-permanent member. With this appointment the president honors the terms of the national accord pact while the speaker gets the possibility to expand his presence on the Russian political Olympus. The edict appointing Vladimir Shumeyko to the Security Council lay in the Kremlin exactly two weeks: It is dated 23 May (on that day Ivan Rybkin was officially co-opted into the Security Council). An official in the presidential administration explained that the delay in promulgating the edict was due not to political but to "diplomatic" reasons: The Kremlin thought it unethical to publish the edict before the Federation Council speaker's return from his Latin American tour. As far as Shumeyko himself is concerned, this course of events is very opportune. Expanded powers are vital at present for the speaker of the parliament's upper chamber. With all the importance of Shumeyko's position, and his authority in the Federation Council, his prospects as a politician are at best foggy. Under the Constitution, beginning in 1995 Federation Council members will not be elected but appointed: One representative from the legislative and executive branch of each component. And in accordance with the fundamental law, the career of Shumeyko the senator is to end (unless, of course, corresponding changes are made in the Constitution) in a year and a half. Shumeyko's life shows that he is not among those who would be happy to continue his career as an ambassador or president of some foundation. Likewise, after his position as chairman of the parliament upper chamber, he will hardly be content with a mere deputyship. Perhaps the sole place acceptable to Shumeyko is the president's chair. But the play for the presidency involves a great number of dangers: Everyone remembers Sergey Shakhray's sad experience. Moreover, participation in elections as Yeltsin's rival not only reduces Shumeyko's chances to zero, but could also mar his relations with long-standing associates. Yet something else is also remembered. Boris Yeltsin once let drop a phrase to the effect that a new leader should be at least tall enough and that he, Yeltsin, intends to breed his own successor. Obviously such statements by the president could not but set Shumeyko thinking in a certain direction. Therefore, if Yeltsin does not run for another term, Shumeyko's candidacy as "heir" will be quite in place. His connections with regional leaders and his contacts (in the post of chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly) with the CIS state leadership will be to his advantage. Yet the seriousness of Shumeyko's intentions comes through especially clearly in his efforts to promote friendly relations with the army. On 21 April Vladimir Shumeyko stated that he "intends to get acquainted with all branches of the Armed Forces and meet their commanders and personnel." Unlike the president, who has apparently forgotten about his monthly "military day," the speaker conscientiously visits military units. He accompanies these trips by loud statements about the need to increase the military budget and revise articles of military laws granting service deferments to too many -- in the military's opinion -- of those liable for conscription. Moreover, Shumeyko has taken such a liking to the Baltic Fleet sailors that he decided to "adopt" (of course, on behalf of the Federation Council) a missile carrier. The speaker's rising influence cannot but be enhanced by his participation in Security Council sessions. The possibility of promoting good relations with the power ministers, participation in discussing the key aspects of national security, and finally the mere presence in the presidential "inner circle" should help Vladimir Shumeyko prepare a reliable bridgehead for subsequent maneuvers.
