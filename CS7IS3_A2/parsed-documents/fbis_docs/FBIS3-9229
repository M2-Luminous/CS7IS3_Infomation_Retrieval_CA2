However, he said his party was willing to cooperate with the new government despite the Hungarian parties not being members of the government coalition. The previous cabinet of Vladimir Meciar rejected any dialogue, he added. Zolyomi said he agreed that the ethnic Hungarian parties held the balance of power in the Slovak parliament. Premier Jozef Moravcik said that the coalition parties expected the above mentioned cooperation. A hierarchy of problems solvable before early elections, to be held at the end of September and beginning of October, has been created, Moravcik added.
