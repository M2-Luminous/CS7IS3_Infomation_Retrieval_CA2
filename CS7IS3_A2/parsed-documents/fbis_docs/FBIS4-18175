An official source described these claims as unfounded and dangerous. Political circles note: First: The Turks give details regarding the supposed presence of such foreigners in Cyprus to create more convincing impressions for third parties. Second: There is an effort to involve other countries, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, and cause wider concern. The goal is to divert attention from impressions of the murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis [chairman of the Committee for Solidarity With Kurdistan] by the Turkish Secret Service and to justify its activities in the free areas of Cyprus with the usual pretenses. According to Foreign Ministry officials' statements, these pretenses are systematically cultivated in the Turkish press and are reproduced in the Turkish Cypriot newspapers to convey them later, through propaganda bulletins, to other quarters. These claims were brought back to light by [the Turkish Cypriot newspaper] YENI DEMOKRAT, which published the "information" regarding facilities offered by the Cypriot Government to "Kurdish and Armenian terrorists."
