Kosolapov, an expert of the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers Department for Coordinating Activities of Administrative Bodies, by A. Bezveselnyy; place and date not given: "Modern Ostap Benders"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Bezveselnyy] You have mentioned an important problem such as the destruction and recycling of weapons and military equipment. How will Belarus benefit from the successful resolution of this problem? [Kosolapov] As a matter of fact, some of these weapons pose a threat to the people and environment. Despite a limited budget, the Defense Ministry has managed to find possibilities for financing appropriate scientific-research and experimental-design works in the interest of the Belarusian Armed Forces. The first results of this work can now be summarized. According to specialists' estimates, the implementation of the project for recycling rocket fuel Melanzh alone will make it possible to develop a competitive technology, profit more than 1 billion Russian rubles, and resolve a whole range of ecological and other problems. At the 43d Defense Ministry repair-mechanical plant near Dobrush, recycling of weapons useless for combat is being launched. It is expected that more than 50,000 pieces of dangerous weapons will be reprocessed by 1997, which will significantly contribute to resolving the issues of environmental security and the problems of explosive materials in the republic, as well as turning a considerable profit. There is another very interesting example. At Belarusian aircraft-repair plants and other aviation industry facilities, active work is currently being conducted to develop the aircraft Belarus in cooperation with Russia and Kazakhstan. Additionally, this is accompanied by considerable activity in international cooperation regarding conversion. This, however, is a topic for another conversation. [Bezveselnyy] Yuriy Georgiyevich, apparently, the situation with the conversion is not so bad, despite certain skeptics' complaints. [Kosolapov] Exactly. Officials from the Defense Ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers understand very well that there are many political, socioeconomic, and scientific problems hampering the conversion of military facilities. Many of these problems are of an interdepartmental nature. Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers believes that it is necessary to develop new organizational forms and methods to improve this process, and to implement the government conversion program more efficiently.
