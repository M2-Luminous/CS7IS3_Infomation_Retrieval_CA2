(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1218&hyph;0133) Appendix A to §1910.1001 [Amended] 4. Appendix A to §1910.1001 is amended by the revising the second sentence of the introductory paragraph to read as follows: *␣*␣* The sampling and analytical methods described below represent the elements of the available monitoring methods (such as Appendix B of their regulation, the most current version of the OSHA method ID&hyph;160, or the most current version of the NIOSH Method 7400). *␣*␣* * * * * * 5. Paragraph 2. of the section of Appendix A to §1910.1001 entitled Sampling and Analytical Procedure is amended by adding the following sentence to the end: * * * * * 2. *␣*␣* Do not reuse or reload cassettes for asbestos sample collection. * * * * * 6. Paragraph 11 of the section of Appendix A to §1910.1001 entitled Sampling and Analytical Procedure is revised to read as follows: * * * * * 11. Each set of samples taken will include 10% field blanks or a minimum of 2 field blanks. These blanks must come from the same lot as the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be averaged and subtracted from the analytical results before reporting. A set consists of any sample or group of samples for which an evaluation for this standard must be made. Any samples represented by a field blank having a fiber count in excess of the detection limit of the method being used shall be rejected. * * * * * 7. Paragraph 2 of the section of Appendix A to §1910.1001 entitled Quality Control Procedures is amended by redesignating it as paragraph 2a and by adding paragraph 2b to read as follows: * * * * * 2.b. All laboratories should also participate in a national sample testing scheme such as the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program (PAT), or the Asbestos Registry sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). * * * * * 8. Appendix B of 1910.1001 is revised to read as follows: Appendix B to §1910.1001_Detailed Procedures for Asbestos Sampling and Analysis_Non-mandatory ␣ 1␣ 1Air Matrix: OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits: Time Weighted Average 0.1 fiber/cc Excursion Level (30 minutes) 1.0 fiber/cc Collection Procedure: A known volume of air is drawn through a 25-mm diameter cassette containing a mixed-cellulose ester filter. The cassette must be equipped with an electrically conductive 50-mm extension cowl. The sampling time and rate are chosen to give a fiber density of between 100 to 1,300 fibers/mm 2 on the filter. Recommended Sampling Rate 0.5 to 5.0 liters/minute (L/min) Recommended Air Volumes: Minimum 25 L Maximum 2,400 L Analytical Procedure: A portion of the sample filter is cleared and prepared for asbestos fiber counting by Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) at 400X. Commercial manufacturers and products mentioned in this method are for descriptive use only and do not constitute endorsements by USDOL-OSHA. Similar products from other sources can be substituted. 1. Introduction This method describes the collection of airborne asbestos fibers using calibrated sampling pumps with mixed-cellulose ester (MCE) filters and analysis by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). Some terms used are unique to this method and are defined below: Asbestos: A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. Asbestos includes chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite (cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos), tremolite asbestos, actinolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and any of these minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. The precise chemical formulation of each species will vary with the location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are listed: 1␣ 1␣ Chrysotile Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 Crocidolite Na 2 Fe 3 2 +Fe 2 3+ Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2 Amosite (Mg,Fe) 7 Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2 Tremolite-actinolite Ca 2 (Mg,Fe) 5 Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2 Anthophyllite (Mg,Fe) 7 Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2 Asbestos Fiber: A fiber of asbestos which meets the criteria specified below for a fiber. Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the length of a fiber to it's diameter (e.g. 3:1, 5:1 aspect ratios). Cleavage Fragments: Mineral particles formed by comminution of minerals, especially those characterized by parallel sides and a moderate aspect ratio (usually less than 20:1). Detection Limit: The number of fibers necessary to be 95% certain that the result is greater than zero.
