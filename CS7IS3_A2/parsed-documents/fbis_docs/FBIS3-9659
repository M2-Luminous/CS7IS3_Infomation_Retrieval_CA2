It needs a break to gain time and see where and how to go on. Forces are once again gathering, the process is reversed. The blocs fell apart, the problems that had existed before transformed themselves into mutant forms after the balance of the bipolar world was disturbed, and neither now nor in the near future will there be any efficient mechanisms for their solution. Therefore, there will probably be, if only for a short time, a return to the old tried and tested experiences. That is why there is Russian presence in the Balkans. The Russian Blue Helmets have been in Croatia, as part of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], since the beginning of the mission, but they went to Bosnia at Karadjic's request. This was an excuse, they took advantage of the good opportunity. One of the political anomalies is that Russia has now achieved something it could never do before [the Russian presence in Bosnia] -- neither in czarist times, nor through ideology, let alone during Tito's lifetime -- with UN sponsorship and as a partner of the United States. Maybe the world is trying to dress its ranks, to think in a different way, but it is a fact that it is still following the pattern it has shaped and that is the reason for us, in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to believe that all solutions are possible, and expected, in the still undefined political territory that is the Balkans. Let us not forget that Macedonia is not in the CSCE system of collective security, it is not on the list of countries with a ticket for the Partnership for Peace plan, the United States has frozen the establishment of diplomatic relations, and in that sense, all options are still possible. What was the role of Greece in urging Russia to enter the Balkans -- practically at the gates of NATO? Logically, there should not be many reasons, but just take a look at what is going on: Andrey Kozyrev was in Athens at precisely the time when Greece announced the introduction of the economic blockade against Macedonia and not only did he say nothing regarding the blockade but, until the present day we have not yet heard any official Russian stance on this issue, except for its readiness to mediate in the dispute. Probably Kozyrev knows that there is already a mediator in the dispute with Greece; it is Cyrus Vance, and the new dispute is not a problem of a bilateral nature, but a problem the European Union has with one of its members, and it is not a dispute, but a unilateral declaration of economic war. Therefore, one gets the unavoidable impression that Kozyrev thought it was good that that Russia has now increased its activity on the territory of former Yugoslavia, it could finish its job and extend the zone of Russian interest to a point that Russia was never allowed to reach before. Even more than that, because "we and the Russians are Slavs," and moreover, we are orthodox. Russia has not abandoned its legitimate interest in Bulgaria despite the altered milieu there. Recently, in Bulgaria, as the concept of an orthodox-western division strengthened, a "concern about the possible transfer of the Bosnia syndrome to Bulgarian soil" appeared and the Muslim (Turkish) minority was mentioned as a danger, as well as Turkey itself, which is a sign that the Orthodox-Slav concept has its supporters in Bulgaria, who disturb the United States' interest in the East-West transversal. Another subsidiary effect, no less important in such a strategy if it is applied to Macedonia, is that Russia could outflank Kosovo and Albania, which is totally different from having the United States outflank Serbia. Somewhat below, some 200 kilometers to the south, there is Greece, a barrier to the greater ambitions of the orthodox allies, under the full protection of the United States and the European Union, a pet that was given a role in the blocs' world. It is very well thought of, and it has to be mentioned that it was well prepared. It is not known what and how big the contribution of major partner, the United States, was in all this, but that Greece came up with this idea is perfectly well known. At times through direct channels, at others through indirect channels, official Macedonia received signals of "attractive" offers, and as is always the case, they were followed by the threat that was it not for Greece and Serbia, Macedonia would collapse. Just take a look at the Serbian press lately, it is totally obvious, just listen to the statements of the Serbian politicians and "scientists" and everything becomes clear. Vuk Draskovic has already opened the season of confederations, saying, or better wishing, to see Macedonia in confederal relations with Serbia, that is logical for him. In BORBA of 22 March, in the report from Washington titled "Through Krajina to the Yugo-Basket" it was written that "the agreement between Washington and Moscow on Krajina is an announcement of their joint activity in finding a loose confederal structure for former Yugoslavia (without Slovenia, and Macedonia for now)." On the other hand, there is the view of Croat journalist Gojko Marinkovic that "a long time ago, the United States provided itself with a big aircraft carrier in 'Eastern Yugoslavia' called Macedonia." That seems to be the crux of Greece's dissatisfaction. It is using direct, and other, means to marginalize Macedonia's position in order to return to other questions of top national interest -- Cyprus and the Greek minority in Albania, which were referred to by the contradictory [Greek Alternate Foreign Affairs Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos as even more important than the border with Macedonia, for which he recommended another policy, because the one implemented by Greece at this moment "is understood by no one in the world." This diplomat, if everything, is okay with his thinking machine [as published], which allows him to make logical judgments, as shown by his latest statement that "the border with our country will remain closed because the embargo is just and the reasons deep," but we should expect changes in Greek policy, as well as in the behavior of the people. Whatever it might imply, it seems to me that the Europeans and the United States are rubbing our nose in it, just on the eve of Papandreou's visit to Washington, which has now been postponed three times, with a possibility of also being postponed this time. If an expressedly anti-American rally of 1 million people is under preparation in Salonika, reinforced by the possible visit of John Shalikasvili to Macedonia at the beginning of April, the Clinton-Papandreou meeting will be at risk. In any case, the integral statement of Pangalos should be understood as an announcement of the agenda of the Washington meeting and as a presentation of two additional open and awkward problems in the White House Oval Office related to its zone of interest. However, all this does not mean that Greece has lost its favorable position in relation to Macedonia, or its interest in us. Pangalos should not be trusted when he says that the issue that his country has created is of a lesser importance than the ones he announced, or the ones he defrosted. It would be naive. Greece will still be engaged in marginalize Macedonia, but this time with the help of other means. An example of the directions of the "new Greek policy" may be the attempt at the European Conference on Transport, where it [Greece] proposed the construction of the Drac-Salonika-Istanbul corridor, with the aim of by-passing Macedonia. The proposal was not adopted because transport can not be influenced easily by one country's wishes, and it is of great interest to many factors. Even such a proposal does not give the answer to the question about the north-west corridor, which is as important, if not more important, for Greece. In this case, Macedonia cannot be avoided, unless Greece presents a reserve plan for a repeated by-passing of Macedonia -- that part of the road should go across Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. Concerned about how to make all its moves, our neighbor, it seems, has not counted on the simple fact that the United States will not easily give up its strategic interests and games merely out of friendship with Greece. Russia is also not a country that can be tricked. You cannot trade with it the way the "Salonika merchants" are doing, presenting the Macedonian-Greek dispute the way they want to, without receiving an adequate reply from the United States. The United States has -- just after the experience in Bosnia- Herzegovina, where Russia became the guarantor for Karadjic's Serbs -- announced and implemented its own symbolic additional presence in Macedonia within the frameworks of UNPROFOR. It looked like an extra deposit on a deposit for a certain territory. Moreover, reliable sources revealed to us that the unestablished, frozen U.S. ambassador comes with a team composed of mainly economic experts, therefore it is normal to think that the plan for a greater Russian component on our territory will not be possible for the moment. Nevertheless, we should not be lulled by this relatively well- defined Macedonian position. It does not mean that such attempts and definite Greek-Serbian pressures on Macedonia will disappear. In the text above we mentioned the elements of concern. Let us add to them: The world community, particularly the United States and the European Union, has not offered Macedonia much from its pockets except for its ponderous sympathy and respect. Not much has been left out of the decision that it was indispensable to provide financial aid in order to make some small compensation for the damage caused by the blockade against Serbia and Montenegro, including the damage that is yet to come after the Greek unilateral blockade. Here and there we can hear that a certain country eased its conscience with a couple of million dollars, in a situation when everyone knows your needs are for hundreds of millions of dollars. If that becomes part of the basket of preventive diplomacy that is now being exercised in our country, then there will hardly be any effects of the prevention if the citizens of Macedonia don't make their own contribution. In other words, the best prevention is ourselves and our awareness that this is a very dangerous situation, and a policy that will not help in our own destruction. Trade and the partners' balance of forces are on course, and we have no serious guarantees for the final outcome. If Europe existed as Toto Cottugno sang about it -- united and with strong national interests in each separate country member for the creation of a joint European policy -- that would be another story.
