Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Chen Ziying was replying to reporters who had suggested the Government's funding request from legislators for $820 million for the Chek Lap Kok airport railway might damage the talks. "Things are moving on. Why are you so pessimistic?" he said. Pro-China legislator Tam Yiu-chung said he believed the Airport Committee meeting on Friday had made some progress. He did not think the funding request would hamper future talks. "The airport projects have started. It is no longer a matter of whether to build it or not. "The most important thing is the size of borrowings should not go beyond the $5 billion ceiling as laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport projects," he said.
