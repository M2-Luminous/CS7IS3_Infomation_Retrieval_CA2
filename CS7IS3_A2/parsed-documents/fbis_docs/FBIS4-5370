With North Korea's support, last month the Cambodian Army was able to capture Pailin, the "capital" of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the SANKEI SHIMBUN said. Pyongyang supplied the materiel free of charge to maintain friendly relations with Southeast Asian nations in a bid to avoid international isolation resulting from suspicions over its nuclear program, the newspaper quoted a Cambodian Army official as saying. The North Koreans sent six troop transport vehicles and scores of tons of field guns, mortars, rifles and ammunition by air to Cambodia and plan to supply additional ammunition in April, according to the official. Making use of the North Korean weapons, the Cambodian Army staged a fierce attack on the rebels and succeeded in driving them out of Pailin on March 21, the official said. Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk and North Korean President Kim Il-song have maintained a close relationship and Sihanouk visits Pyongyang every year, according to the official.
