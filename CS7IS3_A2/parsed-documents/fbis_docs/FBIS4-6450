Aguinaldo] [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) yesterday voiced support for newly appointed Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, saying he is "better than most" officials. Cashiered Army Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, Capt. Danilo Lim, Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan, and Navy Capt. Proceso Maligalig said Mr. Enrile was a good replacement for Gen. Lisandro Abadia. The former army chief assumed the post the other day in a turnover ceremony attended by President Ramos, Vice President Joseph Estrada, and former President Corazon Aquino. At the command conference held immediately after the formal turnover of duties, Mr. Enrile said he gave orders on how to enhance "professionalism and unity" in the military ranks. With a new batch of promoted officers set to assume roles in the armed forces following the retirement of 19 generals this year and the attrition of at least 42 younger officers, the RAM-SFP-YOU urged soldiers to "reinvent themselves by going to the lower rank and file and make unpopular decisions that could make a difference in the future." "If Mr. Enrile can make unpopular decisions, then we will be very happy," Mr. Honasan said. The reform group also said it was "beyond Mr. Abadia" to determine if factionalism still exists in the military organization. Last Tuesday, Mr. Abadia included the unification of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as one of his achievements as chief of staff for the last three years. The president also said the military is now more unified and professional because of Mr. Abadia's efforts. Mr. Lim, spokesperson of the RAM-SFP-YOU, said Mr. Ramos might be referring to other groups when he said the age of "adventurism" is over. "We are not mere adventurists, that is why we are still here. Maybe the president was not referring to us." he said. At the same time, Mr. Maligalig said the government panel headed by Prof. Alfredo Tadiar is "in constant touch with the group (RAM)." He added, both panels are now in the process of exchanging position papers. The committees on electoral reforms, military reforms, economic reforms, social justice, and good government maintain open communication, he said. In another development, Jose Maria Sison, head of the central committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has expressed support to the decision of the Melito Glor Command headed by Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal to execute Leopoldo Mabilangan, as the former leader of the Banahaw Command was "afforded due process under the justice system of the people's revolutionary government." Mr. Rosal recently said a "people's court" found Mr. Mabilangan guilty of crimes punishable by death and that he was invited to attend proceedings several times last year. In a faxed statement, Mr. Sison also said the Melito Glor Command has the authority to "take the necessary action when confronted with any hostile subject who is armed and dangerous." "Mabilangan was clearly an armed agent of the Ramos regime and the reactionary armed forces," Mr. Sison said, in an attempt to justify the killing of the former NPA [New People's Army] leader who openly voiced out support to the government's amnesty program. Mr. Mabilangan was killed noon of Easter Sunday in front of Sto. Tomas Church in Batangas. He was buried yesterday by thousands of followers. No untoward incident occurred even as police investigators have yet to make concrete progress in arresting his assailants.
