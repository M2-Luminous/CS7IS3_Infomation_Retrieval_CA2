The papers, part of a United Nations dossier which was passed to the British Government more than two years ago, related to the role of UK industry in building Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb. Since the Gulf war, UN inspectors have found that UK-made computers, electronics and machine tools were used in Iraq's nuclear bomb production line. The findings imply that British companies were not only exporting arms to Iraq, but were also supplying parts for the country's nuclear programme. Yet Customs has not prosecuted any of the companies alleged by the UN to have been involved. Six members of the defence team in the "nuclear triggers" case, the only "arms to Iraq" trial in Britain where people have been jailed, have obtained copies of the crucial UN papers from Customs and Excise in preparation for an appeal that is due to be heard within the next two months. Customs has persuaded the Lord Chief Justice to make an order banning the six from divulging the contents of the papers. Lord Taylor granted an application at a secret special hearing, and any breach would be a contempt of court punishable by up to two years' jail. The UN papers have been kept secret during the time of John Major's government, and blame cannot be laid on Margaret Thatcher's administration as other "arms to Iraq" fiascos have been. Sources suggest that civil servants have tried to avoid further embarrassment for the Government by deciding not to volunteer to disclose the documents to the Scott inquiry, which is due to hear evidence from the Prime Minister next week. A DTI spokeswoman would say only: "The Scott inquiry has been set up to look at all these matters and it is for the Scott inquiry to consider all questions related to this subject." Lady Thatcher told the Scott inquiry last month that when she was Prime Minister, she was "particularly concerned" that no exports for Saddam's nuclear bomb programme should leave Britain's shores. She told Lord Justice Scott: "The thought of anything nuclear getting into the hands of a government in Iraq, who would have no scruples about the use of the ultimate weapon, was absolutely horrific." The Sunday Telegraph has not asked any of the "gagged" six to defy the banning order. An 18-month undercover US-UK customs operation -- which was praised at the Scott inquiry by Lady Thatcher -- resulted in the conviction of Ali Daghir and Jeanine Speckman in 1991 for trying to export capacitors allegedly destined for the detonation device of Iraq's nuclear bomb. Senior Customs figures were so concerned about keeping the embarrassing UN documents secret that they discussed seeking an injunction to prevent the broadcast last month of an ITV programme about the nuclear triggers case, in the mistaken fear that it would disclose the contents of the papers. A producer at the programme "The Big Story" said: "There was even a call to the office on the day of transmission from someone claiming to be from Customs who said we were about to have several injunctions served on us. A newspaper newsdesk was then tipped off that we were being banned. But it never happened." Daghir and Speckman were sentenced to five years and 18 months respectively, and Speckman has completed her sentence. Both are appealing on several grounds. Two years ago, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH revealed that a secret Iraqi report seized by UN inspectors cast doubt on the convictions. The report suggested that electronic components intercepted by British Customs officers in a highly publicised "sting" at London's Heathrow Airport in 1990 had nothing to do with Saddam's nuclear bomb project. On the strength of this, Daghir was released from jail on Â£200,000 bail pending appeal. Other evidence in our possession points to their innocence. This includes covertly recorded tapes of conversations suggesting US Customs undercover agents set up Daghir and Speckman. After obtaining the Iraqi report, an expert witness for the defence sought more of the three-volume UN dossier to see if there was more evidence in it to support the defence claim of wrongful conviction. Dr. John Hassard, a nuclear expert at London's Imperial College, was given more documents by the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency and yet more by the DTI -- with no conditions attached. He and the defence team obtained further sections from Customs. While claiming that they were irrelevant to the case, Customs lawyers agreed to hand over to the defence team, on a confidential basis, the sections from the UN dossier listing the British manufacturers which allegedly sent exports for Iraq's nuclear programme in breach of sanctions. UN inspections of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme found that UK companies supplied computers and built a semiconductor manufacturing plant. Inspectors also found machinery in Saddam Hussain's bomb production line from nine British machine tool companies. It is understood that the suppressed papers are viewed by the defence lawyers as another crucial part of the new evidence on which they will seek to rely at their appeal because the lists do not include their export company, Euromac. In view of the basis on which the gagging order was obtained, and the fact that their appeal will be heard in public, they are likely to meet stiff opposition from Customs. The Customs' position is that no comment can be made on any matter related to the Daghir and Speckman case while their appeal is pending and the Scott inquiry is still running.
