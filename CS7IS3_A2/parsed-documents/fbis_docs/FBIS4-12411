[Al-Bashir] Yes, we have come for this purpose. Our delegation is under Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the Transitional National Council, who chaired all the previous rounds of negotiations. We are convinced of the need to depend on what was discussed in the past. We love peace and hate war. We are aware that the other side is the same. However, this does not prevent the existence of a group whose interests are linked with this war. We know of the existence of regional, international, and, regrettably, local forces that believe that the continuation of the war will realize their desire to remove the current government by putting pressure on us and spreading rumors. [Hamid] You are speaking of international pressures. Certain circles indicate the possibility that you will offer concessions. [Al-Bashir] They are harboring an illusion. We believe in God and in fate, whether for good or for worse. We are aware that nothing will afflict us unless it is ordained for us. They themselves are aware of the false allegations that we attack civilians and prevent aid from reaching the affected people, who are Sudanese citizens. We gather aid for them from all the people and we provide transportation through the Nile as well as by railway and by air. All organizations working in this field can testify to the truth of this. I reiterate that we have principles. We will not relinquish them. These principles have been accepted by our people, who realize the size of the external plotting. They have announced their readiness to meet every eventuality. In alluding to certain local forces, I meant some Sudanese citizens from the opposition who reside in hotels abroad. They are pushing colonialism in their own country in order to regain the power they think belongs to them forever. [Hamid] Did it not occur to you to negotiate with opposition figures from the north, who are both inside the country and abroad? [Al-Bashir] We negotiate over whatever advances Sudan's interests. If you are asking about leaders of the banned parties, we have asked them to take an active part in shouldering responsibilities. But they have their eyes set on power. For evidence, watch their meetings and coordination with Western forces that do not wish the country well. Such people think that power in the country is a cake to be carved up and that being in office should bring with it wealth and control of the country's resources. The Ministry of Trade used to be coveted, given the privileges it brings with it. This ministry had to be divided into two sections. One was for internal trade. It was entrusted to the Democratic Unionist Party so party members who were in business would exploit it for their own benefit. The Ministry of Foreign Trade usually went to the Ummah Party and was handled by Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi. All the Sudanese will testify to his practices at the ministry. We now view government as an exercise in power-sharing and a burden rather than a cake. The Ministry of Trade is not important any more. We have scrapped the import system licenses altogether and the licenses are now handled by commercial banks. We now consider the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and Irrigation Ministry to be the most important. This is to promote the exploitation of the country's resources and self-reliance. We have achieved a good measure of success on that front, which has earned us the West's hostility. [Hamid] What is your assessment of the Arab community's reaction to the challenges facing Sudan? [Al-Bashir] Regrettably, a unified Arab stand is completely absent. However, we still hope that Arab reconciliation will be restored and the Arab atmosphere cleared. [passage omitted]
