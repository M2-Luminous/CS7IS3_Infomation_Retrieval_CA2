Kirillova*, Novosibirsk Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences; *Institute of Biophysics, Ministry of Health, Moscow, Russia; UDC 577.113.4/6] [Abstract] Homogenous phosphotriesterase synthesis was employed for the preparation of oligonucleotides derivatized on the 5'- or 3'-ends with DDP or Fe(III)DDP in 15-30 min in yields approaching 95%. Both agents were effective in modifying DNA, particularly Fe(III)DDP in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction mechanisms involved covalent adduct formation adjacent to a guanosine duplex, direct scission of the DNA, as well as molecular lesions that led to DNA cleavage after addition of piperidine. In analogy to porphyrins, the derivatized oligonucleotids also bound to HeLa, bone marrow and Krebs-2 ascitic carcinoma cells. These observations support the contention that oligonucleotides derivatized with DDP and Fe(III)DDP may have applications in modifying gene expression.
