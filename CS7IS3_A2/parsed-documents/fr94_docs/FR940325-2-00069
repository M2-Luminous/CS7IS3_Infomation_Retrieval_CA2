Under a partnership agreement, the applicant will be responsible for the fiscal, administrative and programmatic management of the grant. D. Available Funds Subject to availability of funds, ANA estimates that approximately $1,000,000 is available for financial assistance in FY 1994 under this program announcement. For Category I, Planning Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $50,000. For Category II, Design and/or Implementation Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $125,000.

Multi-Year Projects This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to three years. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for three years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the three-year project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government.
