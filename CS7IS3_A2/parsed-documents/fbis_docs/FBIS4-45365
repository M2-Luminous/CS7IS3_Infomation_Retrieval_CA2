FBIS4-45365 "jptdd026__l94044" JPRS-TDD-94-026-L JPRS Narcotics 31 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Air Force Spokesmen: `No Express Ban' on U.S. Aircraft Air Force Spokesmen: `No Express Ban' on U.S. Aircraft Overflying Territory PY0806214494 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 31 May 94 p A5 PY0806214494 Lima EL COMERCIO Spanish BFN [Text] Peruvian Air Force [FAP] spokesmen have asserted that there is no express ban on U.S. Air Force `Awacs' and `Orion' planes overflying Peruvian territory, as was stated in U.S. press reports. The reports state that the alleged measure is a Peruvian `reprisal' to the U.S. decision to suspend the supply of information collected by these aircraft which is very necessary for the FAP to intercept the traffickers' planes. The consulted sources stated that the problem is simply that the U.S. South Command has not requested permission to enter Peruvian airspace. Under international laws, no country can prohibit air traffic over its territory. All that is necessary is to request a permit and to state the route that will be followed. The sources stated that the antinarcotic agreement, the part concerning the FAP, is still in force and this is why the radar sent by the Panama-based U.S. South Command is still in Yurimaguas. Although this radar is obsolete, whenever it is not out of order it helps somewhat the Tucano aircraft to intercept traffickers planes. FAP spokesmen admitted that the `electronic intelligence' supplied by U.S. `Awacs' and `Orion' is of vital importance for the interdiction operations against traffickers planes and without their participation the Air Force's operations would not be as effective.
