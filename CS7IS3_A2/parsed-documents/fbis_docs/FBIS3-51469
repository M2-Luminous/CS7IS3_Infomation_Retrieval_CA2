This visit is the third stage of a tour he is making of five African countries. Robaina was met at the airport by (Estanislus Chiwedere), permanent secretary of the foreign ministry, who highlighted the two nations' common interests. In his welcoming speech, this high-ranking official said he was welcoming the representative of a nation that has shown solidarity toward Zimbabwe ever since Zimbabwe was struggling for independence, and with which (?it) shares many positions. Robaina, for his part, said his visit was in response to the interest in explaining how his people live and work and in exchanging mutually beneficial experiences. Robaina had earlier been in Angola, where he had talks with high-ranking Angolan officials. Those talks have been described as very fruitful. Shortly before leaving Angola, the Cuban foreign minister held a news conference. Here, from Luanda, is journalist (Issac Nenei). [(Nenei)] -- live] As we said, he left Luanda this morning on his way to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, continuing his diplomatic offensive through southern Africa. Namibia and Zambia will be the last countries he visits. The objective of this visit is, as we have already said, to explain what is happening in Cuba and, at the same time, to find out what is happening in this part of the world. [Begin recording] [Robaina] I am really leaving with the satisfaction of having been able to carry out, in a short time, an intense program. But I am also leaving with the satisfaction of now being highly informed, and brought up to date, about a reality that my people follow very closely. We Cubans follow very closely what happens in Angola; and, truly, since we know that the Angolans also follow very closely what happens in Cuba, we have tried to give them as much information as possible. [Unidentified journalist, speaking Portuguese] What does Cuba expect (?to obtain) from Angola and other African countries? [Robaina] Cuba expects from Angola and other African countries what we expect of the world. And although some may think that what we expect from Angola and the world, or of any country in particular, is the solution to our problems....[rephrases] Please, the solution to Cuba's problems depends first of all on the Cubans themselves, and on a mechanism that Cuba maintains with many in the world. Cuba expects, from Angola and from the world, what Cuba also advocates for the world: understanding and respect. Simply that. [Unidentified journalist, speaking Spanish] As regards the crisis Angola is experiencing right now, Robaina, who is a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, said that the Cuban people hope Angola will solve its problems [word indistinct]. [end recording] [(Nenei)] From Luanda, this is (Issac Nenei) for the National Radio Newscast in Cuba. [In a similar item, Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish on 16 Jan at 1300 GMT reports that Robaina said that Cuba wants to establish stronger economic ties with various countries as part of its policy to neutralize the effects of the U.S. blockade and the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe. Robaina said Cuba is seeking mutually beneficial cooperation, a principle that is the basis for the country's opening to foreign capital and the establishment of joint enterprises. In statements to the media, Robaina rejected reports of a possible barter of Cuban weapons for Angolan petroleum. Robaina will head for Zambia and Namibia following his visit to Zimbabwe].
