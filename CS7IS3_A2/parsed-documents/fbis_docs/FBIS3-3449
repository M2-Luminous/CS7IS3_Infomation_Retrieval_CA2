The 71-year-old Cambodian monarch, who underwent surgery on October 7 to remove a tumor in the prostate area, left the hospital "recently" after he "endured the treatment very well." King Sihanouk is to travel to Pyongyang at the end of the month to visit his longtime friend, President Kim Il-song, before returning to Phnom Penh on April 8 for Khmer New Year. A Western diplomat said that after his anti-cancer treatment, King Sihanouk had lost his hair but had gained weight.
