In an interview with Kampala's capital radio, Major Kagame criticized the United Nations for pulling out its peacekeeping forces at the height of the massacres, and he did not see why they now want to come back. He said it would appear that they want to protect those who are carrying out the massacres. He said the struggle of the RPF to bring the situation under control is worth it. He stressed that capturing Kigali, on which the RPF now has a strong grip, might not solve the problem, and they are trying to bring the situation in the whole country under control. He said it is now just a matter of time to accomplish this task. He admitted that many people have lost their lives in the struggle to end the massacre.
