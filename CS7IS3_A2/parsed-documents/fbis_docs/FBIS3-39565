One hundred and twenty-five million consumers with the world's highest average purchasing power make Japan Europe's second largest potential market. To make the most of this, European companies need extra help to deal with the special demands of the Japanese market ranging from information and consultancy services in Europe through to introducing companies to the Japanese market. The Commission's export promotion initiatives are not only the natural counterpart to its market-opening efforts with the Japanese, they directly meet the needs of companies exporting and wishing to export to Japan. "Gateway to Japan" is the second integrated campaign which will be made up of a series of initiatives to foster lasting success in the Japanese market by European enterprises in sectors which are internationally competitive, but underperforming in Japan. The Commission's aims are both to answer the problem of the Community's trade deficit with Japan by helping to increase exports to Japan and to encourage European enterprises to confront their Japanese competitors in the Japanese market, enabling them to maintain their competitive edge in other markets worldwide. The approach adopted by the Commission for the `gateway' campaign is based on the experiences of the first export promotion campaign. The campaign will provide services in response to the needs of companies following the logical chain of activities which companies face when developing trade with Japan. Workshops At the first stage, `gateway' offers information for European enterprises here in Europe on their company's needs and will attempt to help coordinate their approach. Throughout Europe, the Commission will be holding strategy workshops for European companies interested in Japan. These will provide both general information on the obstacles and opportunities of the Japanese market and also market information on those sectors selected by the Commission for participation in the campaign. Trade Missions and Trade Fairs The bulk of "Gateway to Japan" campaign activities will take place in Japan. on the basis of a qualitative assessment of export promotion methods and in the light of the experience of the first campaign, the Commission has identified trade missions and trade fairs as the most effective way of engineering long-term profitable relationships between European companies and Japanese buyers. The campaign will organize European groups at Japanese trade fairs, providing European pavilions, orchestrating European days and facilitating contacts with suitable, potential clients. Trade missions will take place before, during or after trade fairs in order to offer companies the opportunity to study the market and to develop contacts directly with Japanese counterparts. For both fairs and missions, participating companies may then receive financial and logistical support from the Commission in complementarity with support provided by the member states. Follow-up Services A Long-term commitment to developing a presence in the market is essential in order to profit to the full from the opportunities in Japan. Bearing this in mind, the Commission will offer follow-up services for companies who have participated in the fairs and missions in Japan. In line with the view that the campaign should be responsive to the needs of the market, the exact nature of the follow-up activities will depend on the requirements of companies after their participation in fairs and missions. Funding The scope of export promotion activities is limited by budget. The European Parliament agreed an increase in the exprom budget of ECU1.5 million to ECU8 million for the financial year 1994. This allows ECU7.1 million for "Gateway to Japan" for the three years of the campaign. The Sectors In the first phase, 1994-5, the campaign will support companies from the medical equipment, mechanical handling, machine tools and furniture sectors. For the second phase, 1995-6, the five sectors for selection are still to be decided. Those under consideration include marine equipment, construction materials, construction equipment, waste management technologies and packaging machinery. These sectors have been selected on the basis of three sets of criteria - competitivity, promotability and complementarity. Competitivity demands that the sector should be made up of European companies which are competitive in price and product worldwide, but which are still underperforming in the Japanese market. Based on the experience of the first campaign, `gateway' will promote seven capital goods sectors and two consumer goods sectors. The scope for success also depends on the extent to which these sectors will answer a real need in Japan. Naturally, therefore, selection has been and will be responsive to the changing demands of the Japanese market. Competitivity cannot be the sole criterion. The experience of the first campaign has shown that another significant element is the extent to which a sector can be promoted within the framework of our program. This principle of promotability requires that participating sectors should be represented by a strong European trade federation and have access to a viable trade fair in Japan. The campaign is also run in a spirit of complementarity with the member states. "Gateway to Japan" aims primarily at medium-sized enterprises. It intends to help both those companies which wish to start exporting to Japan and those which are planning to develop their existing trade. The campaign is directed by the European Commission's unit for relations with Japan. The campaign will be implemented by the non profit-making organization Eurochambres -- the association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Their job will be general coordination, publicity, distribution of information and the sectoral initiatives of the campaign. In all this they will work in a consortium partnership with Roland Berger GmbH, the management consultants with offices in Tokyo. The consortium partnership of Eurochambres and Roland Berger was selected on the basis of a call for tender in the EC Official Journal. The campaign will be run in cooperation with both industry and the member states. National chambers of commerce, the European Business Council in Tokyo and European trade associations will provide information networks and will help coordinate our activities with individual companies. The campaign haS been developed in consultation with the member states in the Exprom [EC export promotion program] experts group meetings, meetings with the commercial counselors in Tokyo and through overseas national trade bodies. In launching the campaign the Commission appreciates the cooperation and contribution of its Japanese counterparts. "Gateway to Japan" will be coordinating its activities with the import promotion programs of MITI [Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry] and JETRO [Japan External Trade Organization]. The Commission welcomes this active cooperation and sees it as further evidence of the development of Europe's partnership with Japan.
