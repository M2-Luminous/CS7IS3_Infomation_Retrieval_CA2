It is no secret that the other side of this "coin" is a terribly unpopular increase in bread prices. Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Ye.F. Saburov already had occasion to have it out with the people on this subject at the beginning of April. After three days of unrest and anxiety, everything settled down somehow. Crimean residents and guests still eat cheap bread. [Gornaya] So, Yevgeniy Fedorovich, why does the government need the extra hassle of targeted support? [Saburov] The government takes a firm position that support for the population must be as targeted as possible. This is the principle of the social policy during the transition period. We can make basic foodstuffs and some services cheaper through budget financing of enterprises, or we can give this money directly to those who need it most. Aid to enterprises does not belong in the category of social programs. What happens when subsidies are not targeted? Take the example of bread: In order to keep prices down, the bread-baking industry was subsidized, which required enormous budget expenditures. Which, by the way, came not from some abstract state but from the pocket of that same low-income taxpayer. That is, the poor foot the bill for the right to buy cheap bread not only for themselves but also for well-to-do people, plus visitors. Now, one way or the other, the vacation season has begun. Bread production has increased 1.5-fold. We, Crimean residents, pay the cost of the additional 50 percent for better-off vacationers. By the way, bread in Russia is considerably more expensive than in the Crimea, and nobody there is shocked by this, because the population's income there is higher. Our budget, on the other hand, carries unjustified expenses that do not protect anyone here, in the Crimea. This was clear even to the previous government. But because of various political events and endless elections nobody dared to get rid of the absurdity. Completely different mechanisms were utilized. Loans were obtained at horrendous interest rates. Paper games were played with the cost of flour--ostensibly cheaper flour was used for subsidized bread while flour purchased at a higher price was sort of set aside for later. And this is how it still goes. At the end of summer grain from the new harvest will begin to arrive, and then a huge jump in the cost of bread is inevitable. [Gornaya] Especially considering that the yield of grain crops is predicted to meet just about half of the need. [Saburov] And not only in the Crimea. The entire south of Ukraine was struck by drought. We will have to go quite a distance to buy the rest of the grain. Plus rising fuel prices--just make a mental calculation how much transportation is involved on the path from the field to a loaf of bread. Had bread prices been rising gradually, the current expected jump would have been substantially smaller. [Gornaya] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you said all this before in mid-spring, when the government attempted to raise prices. But then it came out, as the president said, that some additional information had not been taken into account, allowing prices to be restored apparently without losses for the budget. [Saburov] It is rather awkward for me to criticize the president's actions, since I am his deputy. Frankly, Meshkov's decision at the time to repeal the announced price increase was unexpected for me--after all, concurrence had been reached on this issue, and the government could not do something like this unilaterally. The explanation is that candidates for deputy seats put tremendous pressure on the president at the time. Remember the time period between the first and the second round of parliamentary elections? You may put it this way: The president could not go against the will of the Crimean people expressed by the candidates for deputies. From the political standpoint, I can understand him. Although from an economic standpoint it only swept the problem further under the rug. Now, however, in the midst of vacation season, it is simply laughable for us to feed visitors at our own expense. The same goes for excise taxes on alcohol. Our wine is considerable cheaper than in Russia. Visitors are very happy to buy it. If we now introduce a normal excise tax, it will not faze these visitors. So why should we provide "free" booze for them over the entire vacation season? [Gornaya] In the winter it was said that wine-making enterprises had surplus inventories. As I understand it, this problem no longer exists, does it? [Saburov] That is why we propose a flexible excise tax that envisages regulation both in the event of surplus and when demand goes up. The deputies got concerned, however, suspecting that it would create conditions for corruption. They started talking about auditing the Ministry of Finance. Where will the money from redistribution of subsidies go? Well, first, to aid low-income people. Second, it is time to start thinking about preparations for winter. Schools and other municipal sphere facilities will need repairs. And most importantly, we need to stockpile fuel. Pump in gas, bring in coal. We are catastrophically short on money for these purposes. And at the same time, one may say that vacationers are happily drinking up our winter fuel. [Gornaya] And you are probably also facing the necessity to find the money in the local budget for MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] maintenance... [Saburov] Yes, this will be a considerable amount. We keep facing new problems all the time. I am very concerned about the situation in Crimean institutions of higher learning. Financing from the Ukrainian state budget only covers teachers' pay and student stipends. But what about building repairs? Or supply of fuel? We have to preserve our institutions of higher learning--the only Russian-language higher education schools in Ukraine--at any cost. [Gornaya] Our new parliament has abandoned the tradition of the old Supreme Council to decide right at the plenary meetings the issues involving subsidies, compensations, and so on. And has abandoned it so completely that it only "took under advisement"-- this was the wording adopted at the presidium meeting--all these problems associated with the necessity to raise prices and targeted subsidies. Taking into account how socially acute this matter is, such a position of people's elected representatives does not look very noble. [Saburov] Parliament members like to use the word "ethics." Here is a specific situation. Future deputies begged in the spring to keep bread prices down. Then they won the election. But the problem remains unresolved. The government is ready to face the criticism. Nothing we can do about it--this is the fate of every government. In this particular case we asked for only one thing--for the Supreme Council to approve the government's actions with respect to targeted protection of the population. But the presidium only "took it under advisement." All right, this is a trifle. I am concerned about a different matter: Over the period of these entire three months, in all its concrete undertakings the government not only has not got any support but has more often faced opposition. We came here to work. After all, we did not beg to be invited. [Gornaya] Yes, it is not easy to be in the role of the hated one... All right, what if this political issue of bread prices is again thrown at the mercy of populism? And on top of that we will be drinking cheap vodka all summer? [Saburov] We will make it through to the fall. By then we will eat up the entire budget. By the time winter comes, we will be without fuel and bread. [Gornaya] And then "mommy dearest" will be able to extend a helping hand in the form of direct presidential rule. [Saburov] The whole thing is a paradox: What kind of independence can there be if we have to crawl for pennies to Kiev on every occasion? In order to strengthen Crimean independence, which is what the deputies are dreaming of, we have to take care of keeping revenue coming into the budget. No constitution by itself will feed the people and keep them warm. We have to do something, not just talk, in order to attract additional money to the Crimea. For instance, our proposals to attract money to the Crimea may be implemented instantly, but they are stymied time and again by the position of the Republic Bank of Crimea. Next. We need to immediately deregulate all prices--both industrial and agricultural producers are convinced of it. We do not have to fear a sharp jump in prices as it had happened in Russia, Here the solvent demand already limits price rises. In short, it is time to move to a market economy and stop this decay the Crimea has been wallowing in for several years. [Gornaya] Are you sure that the system of targeted support will be effective and those who need help will indeed get it? [Saburov] In principle, it already has been worked out and in operation in the Crimea for quite some time. Currently we are only talking about strengthening it. By the way, in April certain categories of the population received an anticipatory targeted subsidy, and although bread prices were brought back to the old level, the subsidy is being paid to this day.
