Republican Guard brigades are deployed in al-Rashidiyah, al-Suwayrah, and along the road to al-Ramadi. Our sources add that the regime's organs of oppression have conducted extensive arrests of innocent citizens since the beginning of January.

The arrests were on a scale not seen the suppression of the eternal Sha'ban [March 1991] uprising.
