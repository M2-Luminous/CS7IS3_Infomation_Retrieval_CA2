Aidid left the Kenyan capital, Nairobi earlier Thursday. He had been in Kenya since UN-sponsored peace talks in Addis Ababa collapsed last month. Efforts to open Kenyan-brokered negotiations in Nairobi between Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) and the Group of 12 factions led by his enemy, self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, met with little success, according to Somali sources. Aidid was expected to spend a few days in Uganda before returning to Mogadishu via Nairobi. He had planned to return to the Somali capital this weekend, but changed his plans when Museveni agreed to receive him in Entebbe, a source close to the warlord said.
