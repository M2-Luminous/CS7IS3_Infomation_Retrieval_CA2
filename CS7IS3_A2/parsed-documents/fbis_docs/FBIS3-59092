[Weizman] A negotiating process never continues in the same way as it began. It is natural for certain problems to arise in time. The problems that emerged in the aftermath of the agreement signed with the Palestinians can be summarized under the following three headings: The boundaries of Jericho which will be granted autonomous status, control over entries and exits from the area, and the disagreements within the PLO. [Ipek] In your opinion, can Turkey play a role in the Middle East peace process? [Weizman] Yes, definitely. I would like to tell you that I have been in office for eight months. During this period, I received invitations from many countries, but I postponed almost all of them. I am conducting my first official visit to Turkey, because Turkey is an important and large country in the region. It also has a large population; and moreover, it is Muslim. It is a democratic and secular country. It has common borders with Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in addition to the former Soviet republics. There is no need to explain in length the importance of Turkey, which is a part of the Balkans and has two important straits. Turkey and Palestine [as heard] share a common foundation because of these characteristics. Turkey, which is an important power in the Middle East, can be influential in the peace process. It can influence the PLO and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Turkey can play an extremely important role for peace, and it is doing so. [Ipek] Various international issues were also discussed during the talks. Within this framework, can you comment on the tragic situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenian attacks against Azerbaijan? [Weizman] Various international issues were raised with Mr. Demirel. We discussed the newly independent republics and the developments in Russia. It is not clear what developments will take place in Russia. These must be closely followed. I hope the developments will pursue a democratic path. We did not discuss Armenian attacks with the Turkish president. The situation in former Yugoslavia, however, and the tragic developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, were discussed. The international community, the United Nations, and NATO must do something to halt this course, which caused the death of some 200,000 people. Mr. Demirel is concerned about the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would not like to speak on his behalf, but I think he believes that this stems largely from the fact that the world remains a spectator to the tragedy in Bosnia and the weakness of the United Nations. [Ipek] Lastly, what in your opinion is the future of Turkish-Israeli relations? [Weizman] I am very pleased with the warmth we encountered in Ankara. The talks were extremely constructive and were held in full understanding. There is an important future for bilateral economic cooperation. I believe that during the 24 hours I spent with Mr. Demirel, we created a brand new beginning for the relations between the two countries. There is a beautiful and bright sun in Ankara. I believe that the future of bilateral relations is as bright as this sun.
