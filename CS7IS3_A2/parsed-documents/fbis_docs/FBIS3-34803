Riak Machar, head of one of two rival factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum's military government had taken advantage of the rebels' divisions to launch its biggest offensive ever in the past two months. "An estimated four million people are at risk of death in south Sudan due to the Sudan government military offensive, drought and starvation," Machar told a news conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. UN officials said at least two million people were threatened with starvation in the rebel-held south, as well as another two million displaced southerners living in squalid camps around Khartoum. They said the offensive was driving 140,000 southerners towards the Ugandan border. "The deplorable and despicable practices of slavery and slave trade have surfaced," Machar said. Speaking a day after UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expressed concern about the escalation of the war and widespread human rights violations by all sides, Machar accused government forces of kidnapping children and selling them to Sudanese farmers and to Saudi Arabia and Libya. He said the government was "exporting its brand of Iranian Islamic fundamentalism to neighbouring states of Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda." Eritrea has complained of attacks by terrorist groups based in Sudan. Machar urged the United Nations to appoint a peace mediator to negotiate an end to the decades-old conflict between the Arabised north and the largely black south which erupted into full-scale civil war in 1983. Machar, who broke with SPLA leader John Garang in 1991 to form the SPLA-United splinter group, urged the United Nations to impose an oil and arms embargo on Sudan, "establish safe havens for civilians in south Sudan, and put pressure on Khartoum to accept an immediate ceasefire and allow in relief supplies." He said the United Nations should send peacekeepers if Khartoum refused to comply, dismissing suggestions that the world body could not despatch troops without government approval. "There is no government in south Sudan," Machar said. "The government is in the north. We have been fighting one another for the past 40 years. The war is a result of imposed unity and imposed Arabic, Islam, racial hatred and religious intolerance." Western diplomats, however, said the United Nations was unlikely to intervene in Sudan after its debacle in Somalia. They also noted that intervention would be complicated because the conflict was three-sided, as Machar's Nuer tribesmen had often fought Garang's Dinka forces. Machar denied Garang's accusation that his forces had fought on the government's side. The two rebel factions agreed in December to press for a referendum on southern self-determination, a demand rejected by the government which fears secession of the south. The government has banned relief flights to key destinations along the southern border with Uganda while sending warplanes and tens of thousands of troops south in what diplomats said looked like a final push to crush the rebellion. Most foreign relief workers have been forced to leave. Machar accused Khartoum of "using food as a weapon" and trying to "exterminate the civilian population of south Sudan by starvation."
