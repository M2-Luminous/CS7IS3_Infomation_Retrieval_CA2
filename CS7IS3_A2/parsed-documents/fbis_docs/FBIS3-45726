Otherwise, he added, their is no use in holding a meeting of the Airport Committee. After attending a ceremony to raise donations toward a school building fund under Project Hope, which was held by the Shatin Rotary Club yesterday, Zhang was asked to express his view on the Hong Kong Government application to the Legislative Council (Legco) Finance Committee for the amount of HK$1.6 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. In reply, Zhang said the British side is always raising obstacles and expressed the hope that the British side would act according to the MOU. When commenting on Chris Patten's accusation that the Chinese side is refusing to hold a meeting, Zhang Junsheng said: The British side's programs have always failed to comply with the MOU. In that case, what is the use in holding a meeting. The British side, as well as Mr. Patten, has repeatedly stressed the need to value the interests of Hong Kong people above everything else, but they have stirred up so many political disputes and now they have refused to tackle the airport issue according to the MOU. I believe Hong Kong citizens will judge for themselves whether the British side and Mr. Patten have acted in their own interests or in the Hong Kong people's interests. When asked whether the two sides had explored the possibility of resuming talks through diplomatic channels, Zhang responded: If the British side should withdraw the partial electoral bill submitted to Legco by the Hong Kong governor, it would be possible to discuss through diplomatic channels the likelihood of resuming talks. But the British side has closed the door tight. When asked to comment on the Hong Kong Government's allegation that the tabling of the first phase of the constitutional reform package in Legco was to prepare for the 1994/95 elections, Zhang said: That is just an excuse. If the British side had sincerity and had not created side issues, the two sides would have reached agreement on the district board elections in the 17th round of talks. If the British side had not insisted on lumping the single- vote, single-seat system for Legco elections with the district board elections, an agreement would have been reached. The relevant legislation would have been easy and there would have been no time problem. So it is meaningless for Chris Patten to keep talking nonsense. He added: Since the Sino-British talks over the 1994/95 elections have broken down, there will be no through train, and the three-tier councils will be disbanded after 1997, because British rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997. The British foreign secretary and Chris Patten have said on several occasions that it is impossible for China to reorganize the councils. That is their illusion. The Preliminary Working Committee is now discussing ways to reorganize the councils and will present a proposal to the Preparatory Committee of the Special Administrative Region for a decision.
