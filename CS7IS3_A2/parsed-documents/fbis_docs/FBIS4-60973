It will be produced under license from the well-known German firm of "Neoplan." The decision to set up a joint venture in conjunction with the "Avtobus-ZIL" closed-type, joint-stock company was made 28 April by the Moscow City Government. Fifty-one percent of its shares will be held by the "ZIL" Moscow Automobile Company, with the rest being held by the Moscow Committee for the Management of State Property. There is very high demand for a Russian-made vehicle of this type. Moscow alone will require no less than 1,000 a year. The city's bus fleets are currently short 2,400-2,500 vehicles. The Hungarian "Ikarusz," which currently have to be bought for foreign exchange, are obsolete and leave us dependent on shipments of spares from abroad. Moreover, Moscow's motor industry enterprises have found themselves in a difficult financial and economic position, and the city authorities took this into account in deciding to support the "ZIL," not with preferential hand-outs or tax breaks, but with a major long-term production program. As Yu. Luzhkov reported at the session, "ZIL" specialists made their choice of the basic model suitable for our conditions after looking at examples from around the world -- from France to Japan. The German firm's proposal was the most acceptable in terms of its technical characteristics as well as from the standpoint of foreign exchange expenditure. The "Neoplan" license plus the purchase of components to produce the first batch of 150 buses in 1994-95 will cost 49.51 million German marks. Off-site "ZIL" teams will begin assembling the vehicles at the firm's plant in Pilsting (Bavaria), from where they will be dispatched to Moscow. Components and parts production will gradually move to "ZIL" shops, and it is ultimately planned to supply the engines from the Bashkir city of Ishimbay. Assembly of the new vehicles, V. Saykin, first deputy general director of the "ZIL" Moscow Automobile Company, said, will be launched in the modernized wing of one of the capital's unused motor vehicle pools. The motor vehicle plant intends to develop a whole family of passenger vehicles based on the "Neoplan."
