The official said that the working groups will continue discussion for another 30 minutes and may adopt a joint communique. Both delegations have contacted their presidents via the hot line several times and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met with his Ukrainian counterpart Yefim Zvyagilsky to discuss the issue. The Ukrainian delegation agreed on Wednesday to return to one of the four variants of fleet division proposed by Russia and rejected by Ukraine earlier. The stumbling block at the talks which have been underway for three days is the disagreement over the location of the Ukrainian and Russian navies.
