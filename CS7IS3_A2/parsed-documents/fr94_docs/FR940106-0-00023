Sections 295.3 through 295.10 are redesignated as §§295.6 through 295.13, and newly designated §§295.3 through 295.5 are added to read as follows: §295.3 Eligibility of United States- and foreign-owned businesses. (a) A company shall be eligible to receive an award from the Program only if: (1) The Program finds that the company's participation in the Program would be in the economic interest of the United States, as evidenced by investments in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing (including, for example, the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States); significant contributions to employment in the United States; and agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance provided by the Program to promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology (taking into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry), and to procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers; and (2) Either the company is a United States-owned company, or the Program finds that the company is incorporated in the United States and has a parent company which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned companies opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to those authorized under the Program; affords the United States-owned companies local investment opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other company; and affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual property rights of United States-owned companies. (b) The Program may, within 30 days after notice to Congress, suspend a company or joint venture from continued assistance under the Program if the Program determines that the company, the country of incorporation of the company or a parent company, or the joint venture has failed to satisfy any of the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this section, and that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so. §295.4 The selection process. (a) The selection process for awards is a multi-step process based on the criteria listed in §295.6. In the first step, called ``preliminary screening,'' proposals are eliminated that do not meet the requirements of this rule or the program announcement. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for eliminating a proposal at this stage is that the proposal: is deemed to have serious deficiencies in either the technical or business plan; or does not meet the definition of precompetitive, generic technology; or, is not industry-led; or is significantly overpriced or underpriced given the scope of the work; or does not meet the requirements set out in the Notice of Availability of Funds issued pursuant to §295.7; or in the case of joint ventures, requests more than a minority share of funding. NIST will also examine proposals that have been submitted to a previous competition to determine whether substantive revisions have been made to the earlier proposal, and if not, may reject the proposal or forward it to a later stage in the review process based upon the earlier review. (b) In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' proposals are evaluated under the criteria found in §295.6. Proposals are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Proposals must have high scientific and technical merit to be recommended. Only those proposals rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. These applicants are referred to as ``semifinalists.'' (c) In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Program prepares a final scoring and ranking of semifinalist proposals. During this step, the semifinalist proposers may be asked to make oral presentations on their proposals at NIST, and in some cases site visits may be required. Subject to the provisions of §295.6, a list of ranked finalists is submitted to the selecting official.
