ACTION: Amendments to rules of procedure for Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees. SUMMARY: Canada and the United States have amended the rules of procedure for Annex 1904.13 extraordinary challenge proceedings. These amendments are intended to improve the extraordinary challenge proceeding process under Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 8, 1994. The Rules of Procedure, herewithin, apply to all extraordinary challenge committee proceedings under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') commenced on or after the effective date. Specifically, these Rules of Procedure govern any extraordinary challenge arising out of a panel review of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published, for which notice is received prior to January 1, 1994, the date of entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''). In the event that either Canada or the United States withdraws from the NAFTA, the Agreement would revive between them and these Rules of Procedure again would apply.

For procedural matters involving cases under extraordinary challenge committee review, contact James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, Binational Secretariat, room 2061, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5438. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing country. In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, that (a)(i) a member of a panel materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction, and that (b) any of the actions set out in (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational panel review process, that Party may request formation of an extraordinary challenge committee (``ECC''). Extraordinary challenge committee review is therefore not a routine appeal. Rather, as the name suggests, the United States or Canada may have recourse to an ECC only in extraordinary cases. Title IV of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement Implementation Agreement Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100&hyph;449, 102 Stat. 1851 (1988) amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement.
