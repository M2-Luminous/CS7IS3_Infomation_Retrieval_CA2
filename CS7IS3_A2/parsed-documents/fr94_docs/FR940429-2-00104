FR940429-2-00104 FR940429-2-00076 If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure maps submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land-use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator under ยง150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been accomplished. The FAA formally received the noise compatibility program for Manassas Regional Airport also effective of February 24, 1992. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to the approval or disapproval of the program. The former review period limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before October 21, 1994. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR 150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing non-compatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional non-compatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land-use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. The public comment period ends June 6, 1994. Copies of the noise exposure maps and the FAA's evaluation of the maps are available for examination at the following locations: Eastern Regional Office, FAA_Fitzgerald Federal Building, Airports Division, room 337, JFK International Airport, Jamaica, NY 11430. Washington Airports District Office, FAA_101 West Broad Street, suite 300, Falls Church, VA 22046. Manassas Regional Airport, Airport Manager, P.O. Box 560, 10522 Terminal Road, Manassas, VA 22110. Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Issued in Jamaica, New York on April 8, 1994. Peter A. Nelson, Acting Manager, Airports Division, Eastern Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10281 Filed 4&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
