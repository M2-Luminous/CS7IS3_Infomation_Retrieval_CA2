FR941219-2-00044 FR941219-2-00033 [FRL&hyph;5123&hyph;7] Notice of Availability of Great Lakes Dredged Material Testing and Evaluation Manual and Request for Comment SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of and requests public comment on the draft testing manual entitled ``Great Lakes Dredged Material Testing and Evaluation Manual (Draft)'' (draft Great Lakes Manual). The manual was prepared by an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Army Corps of Engineers (CE) workgroup comprised of staff with scientific and/or programmatic expertise related to Great Lakes dredged material discharge activities. This manual supplements the manual entitled ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft)'' (draft National Manual) which was noticed for comment in the Federal Register on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37234). The draft Great Lakes manual contains more specific information for the Great Lakes system, including detailed bioassay test protocols. Both manuals were issued pursuant to the provisions of section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act and 40 CFR part 230. DATES: Written comments on the draft Great Lakes Manual must be postmarked or submitted by hand on or before March 21, 1995 to Marc Tuchman at the address listed below under ADDRESSES . ADDRESSES: A copy of the draft Great Lakes Manual can be obtained by calling or writing to Jan Miller, USACE North Central Division, CENCD&hyph;ED&hyph;WL, 111 North Canal Street, Chicago, Ill., 60606&hyph;7205; telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;6354. Comments on the draft Great Lakes Manual may be mailed or delivered to: Marc Tuchman, USEPA Great Lakes National Program Office_G&hyph;9J, Attention: Great Lakes Manual Comments, 77 West Jackson Street, Chicago, Ill. 60604; telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;1369. Commentors are requested to submit an original and 3 copies of their written comments and enclosures. Commentors who want receipt of their comments acknowledged should include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. No facsimiles (faxes) will be accepted. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jan Miller, USACE North Central Division, CENCD&hyph;ED&hyph;WL, 111 North Canal Street, Chicago, Ill., 60606&hyph;7205; telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;6354; Marc Tuchman, USEPA Great Lakes National Program Office_G&hyph;9J, 77 West Jackson Street, Chicago, Ill. 60604; telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;1369; or John Dorkin, USEPA Region 5_WS&hyph;16J, 77 West Jackson Street, Chicago, Ill. 60604; telephone: 312&hyph;886&hyph;1980. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in Great Lakes Waters must be evaluated to determine the potential environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically, Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended by the CWA, Public Law 95&hyph;217, requires that the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. be permitted by the CE. EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental guidelines_the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with the CE, by which permit applications must be evaluated. The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR Part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that dredged or fill material should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such a discharge will not have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern. Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The draft Great Lakes Manual provides regional guidance on the testing provision of the Guidelines, supplementing the draft National Manual which was noticed for comment in the Federal Register on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37234). The manuals detail the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined in §§230.60 and 230.61, including technical guidance on sampling and handling, quality assurance, chemical and physical analysis, and biological effects testing. The draft Great Lakes Manual contains more specific information for the Great Lakes system, including detailed bioassay test protocols. Conclusions reached utilizing the manuals will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged material. The final Great Lakes Manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments received on this draft and in coordination with the development of the final National Manual. Dated: December 7, 1994. Valdas Adamkus, Regional Administrator, Region 5. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30947 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
