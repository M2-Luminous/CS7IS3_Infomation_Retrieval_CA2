Yi wrote in the KUKJONG SINMUM, an administration newspaper for public servants: "The combat ability as well as performance of equipment of the South Korean military are superior to those of the North Korean military. And our scientific war performance system overwhelms the North Korean one. "Even if North Korea misjudges the situation and provokes a full- fledged war, it will taste only miserable defeat. The joint South Korean and U.S. forces will win a decisive victory after all." The government's overall policy, however, is to deter North Korea's development of nuclear weaponry while preventing war and solving the nuclear problem peacefully, although security on the Korean peninsula is subject to increasing tension. "For the survival of the nation, we must keep the North from developing nuclear weapons. Moreover, the military should adopt a perfect defense posture to immediately meet any situation that might arise if the North Korean nuclear problem is not solved in a peaceful way." On a promising note, he said the military has not found any signs of an imminent North Korean attack on the South. "The reason why the North is threatening the South is that it wants to control the North Korean people, who are agitated over the economic crisis. The North is also trying to obtain the maximum concessions from the United States and disturb the South psychologically." Yi added that the South Korean military has prepared a water- tight defense posture.
