The aid, which will be delivered by Medecins sans Frontieres-France [Doctors Without Borders], will include: - Caring for the wounded on both sides; - Providing essential care to displaced persons from the south who have grouped together in Aden and Lahej (a town 40 km north of Aden). They are living in schools and other public buildings under extremely precarious conditions; - Assistance to the 7,000 Somali refugees in the Al Kawd camp in the territory of Abyan, located to the east of Aden and support to move them away from the front lines as soon as possible. The aid is being organized out of two centers. The Aden team will provide first aid material to the civilian hospitals and will monitor the hygiene conditions of displaced persons. The Sana'a team will supply the hospitals in Sana'a and the territories of Ibb and Taez. It will also be responsible for moving the refugee camp. The aid from ECHO, the humanitarian office of the European Community, will be used to buy, transport, and distribute medical kits and pharmaceuticals, to buy materials on site for displaced persons and refugees, and to help defray the cost of sending expatriate staff there for one month. Since the beginning of the confrontations between the forces of the north and south on 5 May, the Commission has granted ECU500,000 in emergency aid.
