The negotiating teams are slowly coming to an understanding, but there are no indications that a general and definitive accord might be written within the next few days. Alves Antonio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: [Begin Antonio recording] The government and UNITA teams to the Lusaka peace talks continue to discuss the conclusion of the presidential elections. Of the eight points in the section on the specific principles governing the conclusion of the presidential elections, six have already been dealt with. Two remain and they are giving enough trouble. The negotiating teams met on their own the whole day today. They have reached no understanding yet, even though sources close to the talks say consensus is around the corner. To that end, the advice of UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the mediator at the talks, has been asked. What is the source of disagreement, after all? Well, UNITA is insisting on Electoral Law amendments it deems necessary, but the government has its own formula and has reservations about such amendments. The final source of disagreement has to do with the role of the media during the presidential elections, notably the role of national mass media whose work is not linked to the specific work of the National Electoral Council.
