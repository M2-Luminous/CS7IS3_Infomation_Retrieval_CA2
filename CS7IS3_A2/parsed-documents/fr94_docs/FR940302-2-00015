FR940302-2-00015 FR940302-2-00007 Petitioner argues that these gains do not appear to relate to the production operations for subject merchandise, and therefore should be excluded from the general and administrative expenses calculation. Department's Position: We agree with the petitioner. During verification, the respondent provided an exhibit that specifically identified the gains that related to the Komatsu plant manufacturing the subject merchandise. (See cost verification exhibit number 29.) No documentation or other support was provided to establish a basis on which to allow an offset for the gains on sales of the other plant assets. Comment 10: Aida states that the Department double counted an adjustment it made to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses in applying these adjustments to the CV format for one of the U.S. sales. Department's Position: We agree with Aida and have corrected the adjustment to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses. Comment 11: Aida states, in its case brief, that the Department made certain clerical errors in its calculations, with respect to inland freight, packing, credit and warranty. Department's Position: We agree, and have adjusted our calculations accordingly.

The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of review for all shipments of MTPs from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the reviewed companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the less than fair value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case, in accordance with the Court of International Trade's decisions in Floral Trade Council v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83. The all others rate is 14.51 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of APO is a sanctionable violation. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: February 22, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4736 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
