Slavutich was in Odessa where it took part in the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the city's liberation from the Nazis, and is currently moving toward Sevastopol. According to Baltin, a marine ship of the Black Sea Fleet left for Odessa on 14 April to take on board military servicemen of a Black Sea Fleet division and their families. However, since the Ukrainian defense minister ordered the ports of Odessa, Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Kherson not to let Black Sea Fleet ships in, the ship had to return to Sevastopol. In the meantime, Head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's press service Aleksandr Kluban told INTERFAX-Ukraine, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry granted all of its resources -- ships and air transport -- to take out those military servicemen. In particular, there was a proposal to transport people on board the Slavutich.
