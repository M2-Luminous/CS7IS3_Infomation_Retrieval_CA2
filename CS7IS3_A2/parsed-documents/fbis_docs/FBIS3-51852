We have already discussed the latter; now let us look at the first point. War of the magnitude it had reached at the end of the 1980's has disappeared, but the government can take more credit for this than the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. In fact, it was when the new government took office that the imperialist sponsorship of armed counterrevolution ceased, and it is the new government that is spearheading the dismantling of the army of resistance. In this phase, Sandinism bears the responsibility for reducing the Army and its ensuing disputes, and it must stand firm in professionalizing the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] and the police. However, it has not been possible to dispel fully the idea of some underground sponsorship of new episodes of violence, particularly as a good part of those outbreaks are to some extent legitimized by the justice of the demands. So we must still go further in converting the Army and the police, in the eyes of the citizens--both Sandinists and non-Sandinists--into models of professionalism, thus erasing any doubt about dual loyalties and, through this process, firmly preventing this government from converting them into pretorian guards that will back arbitrary actions and revanchism, particularly in the case of the Ministry of Government and the police. Finally, there is the behavior of popular organizations and their methods, an area where we sincerely believe we have not managed to eliminate some of the stigmas attached to us, stigmas that contributed to the 1990 defeat. We have not yet learned to distinguish between the use of violence to stop revanchist violence and the socio-economic crushing of the people. Taking these methods to extremes will culminate in destruction or unnecessary troubles that are frowned upon by those whom we wish to attract to our cause, and even worse, will lead the government to wash its hands and claim to be victims of Sandinism, which does not allow it to govern. Despite the falsity of that charge, it cannot be denied that we are still viewed as combative and violent by the ordinary citizen, who subconsciously expects even worse clashes if we get back in the government. We need to remember the resources that we control so that in any conflict, without renouncing our principles and our demands, we can make use of these resources, and so make our claims stronger and bring together the majority of the Nicaraguan population. We know that improving our methods of struggle is a serious challenge in today's grave situation, but facing such challenges is part of the integral vision that a good politician needs to have. Let us leave for a third part the FSLN's political work and its repercussions on the Sandinist grass roots and the people in general. That is perhaps where we have made the most progress, even though we continue to read articles about the so-called co-government, articles which contain the same amount of disinformation as in the beginning, and the same line that unconsciously blocks the harmony that must exist between political action and popular struggle. In summary, perhaps we may also include in this next part other elements that affect this entire situation: the lack of an alternative, essentially Sandinist program; the issue of personalities in the leadership; and electoral expectations of combining those personalities with future presidential candidacies.
