The meetings included Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and rejectionist organizations members. The meetings were held to prepare for the autonomy period. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports the meetings were initiated by PLO officials in the Gaza Strip. The participants discussed cooperation possibilities between the various organizations, with the view of establishing a civilian and security cooperation apparatus after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdraws from the area. The meetings were held against the background of an agreement reached yesterday between 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, and the Fatah Hawks on putting an end to acts of revenge against collaborators and stopping the strikes.
