Officials said Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a three-day official visit, expressed concern over the issue in which North Korea has refused to allow unimpeded inspections of its controversial nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The two leaders also agreed that Japan and South Korea should construct a future-oriented bilateral relationship, while keeping in mind the dark episodes in their past history. The reference was to the Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910-45. Hosokawa and Kim discussed their respective experiences in implementing political reforms in their countries, the officials said. Kim reportedly said if North Korea tries to buy time on the nuclear issue, there will be a limit to South Korean patience and it will be unavoidable for the international community to take a tough stance. South Korea has prepared thorough security measures and will start this year's joint military exercises with the United States, code-named "Team Spirit," if Pyongyang does not change its stance, Kim said. He said he will make a concrete decision after his visit to China, which he leaves for from Japan on Saturday. Hosokawa said it is imperative to leave open an avenue for dialogue with North Korea and to respond step by step.
