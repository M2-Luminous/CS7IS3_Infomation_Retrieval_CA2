Three of these are of a nationwide nature; the other three apply to their branch of industry. The sides discussed demands put forward by industry branches as well as a timetable for further talks. Late in the evening, following a meeting with Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski, the miners demanded that a fixed date be given for the coming into force of the Enterprise Pact. Following Minister Pol's 26 April decision to cancel the restructuring of the lignite mining industry, the miners promised that they will deliver enough coal to power stations before 2000 on Thursday so that they will be able to generate power to about one-third of their total capacity. If the government fails to present a timetable for the implementation of Solidarity demands after that time, the unionists have warned that protest action will escalate. Miners striking in the Belchatow and Turow mines have been delivering coal in the quantities agreed upon Tuesday, while awaiting the outcome of talks held in Konin, PAP correspondents were told on at 2200 on Thursday.
