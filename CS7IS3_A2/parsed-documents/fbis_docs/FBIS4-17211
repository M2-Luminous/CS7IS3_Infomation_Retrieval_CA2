In outward appearance these banknotes differ little from those circulating in Russia. National symbolic elements give them the function of "purely Tajik money." As reported to IZVESTIYA at the Central Bank, these new bills will be issued to the client in May or June and they will become the basic means of payment on the republic territory. In point of fact we are talking about an actual national currency "in ruble form," but the intergovernmental agreement indicates that it is to play the role of a "transitional monetary unit." The reference here is to an indefinite transition period during which Dushanbe is expected to prepare its economy and its approach for entry into the ruble zone. According to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Tajikistan could become Russia's second partner in the currency union after Belorussia [Belarus]. In spirit Dushanbe has long been ready for such a partnership. Unlike other CIS countries, it never left the ruble zone, nor did it try to introduce its own currency, even ignoring IMF recommendations. In June 1993, when Russia introduced new money and the Asian CIS countries introduced their own currencies, Tajikistan became a dumping ground for old-style rubles which had lost their purchasing power. Hot money made its way into the Tajik market from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. In January this year Dushanbe received R70 billion in new banknotes out of R120 billion in credits offered by Russia on the security of part of its gold reserves and controlling packages of shares in a number of industrial facilities, including the Nurek Hydroelectric Power Station. Some R350 billion in old money accumulated by Tajik branches of the Savings Bank became worthless. The republic ended up on meager currency rations. Out of some 90 billion new rubles brought into circulation, a little over 10 percent returned to the bank. A certain amount stayed in the population's pockets, but the majority flowed into Uzbekistan. Uzbek entrepreneurs found their feet instantly, organizing a huge market in cheap food on the border with famished Tajikistan. Tajik Premier Abdujalil Samadov acknowledged the senselessness of a ruble injection into the local economy and expressed support for the introduction of coupons. Now this role will be fulfilled by paper currency with special markings. These will circulate on an equal footing with Russian rubles, and they will be exchanged at a rate of 1:1. Moscow has not recognized the old money deposited in Tajik enterprises' accounts, totaling around R200 billion in all, since 1992 and does not accept them as a means of payment. It emerges that, by bringing the new denominations into circulation, Russia is simultaneously depriving the Tajik economy of this sum. The fate of the "leftovers" now depends on whether or not Tajikistan can demonstrate the viability of the new ruble which has become the bulwark of the financial system, or whether it will meet the fate of its predecessor.
