FR940916-2-00088 FR940916-2-00076 As such, the proposed license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not involve any changes to the plant design or operation. Therefore, no margins of safety, as defined by the plant's accident analyses, are impacted. Relaxation of the frequency for verifying the position of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers of the existing Technical Specification 3.6.4.1, ACTION c from at least once every 72 hours to at least once every 14 days will not affect the ability of the drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breakers to perform their intended safety function. The extended frequency provides adequate assurance that the vacuum breakers will perform their intended safety function. Each drywell-suppression chamber vacuum breaker will continue to be demonstrated OPERABLE and closed at least once per 31 days and after any discharge of steam to the suppression chamber in accordance with Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a. In addition, performance of Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.b requires pressurization of the drywell to approximately 1.0 psig and then verifying that the differential drywell to suppression chamber pressure is maintained greater than one-half the initial differential pressure for one hour without nitrogen makeup. During this evolution actual pressure will increase as high as 1.1 psig before stablizing. The Drywell Pressure_High setpoint, which initiates a reactor scram and a Group 1 isolation, is less than or equal to 2.0 psig (the actual setpoint is 1.8 psig). As such, performance of this evolution once per 72 hours unnecessarily risks a plant transient without providing a significant increase in the level of safety gained by performing the verification on a 14 day frequency. The new surveillance requirement provided in proposed Technical Specification 4.6.4.1.a will require that each vacuum breaker be verified to be closed at least once every 14 days. The new surveillance provides further assurance that the vacuum breakers are capable of performing their design function under accident conditions of allowing the venting of non-condensible gases from the suppression chamber to the drywell while not allowing bypass flow from the drywell to the suppression chamber. Based on the above reasoning, the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
