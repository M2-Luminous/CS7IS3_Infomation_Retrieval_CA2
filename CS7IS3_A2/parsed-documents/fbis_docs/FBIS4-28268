Kim called Hata at 9 AM and emphasized that UN sanctions against North Korea are inevitable if it chooses to go ahead with its nuclear weapons program, aides said. Reiterating that Pyongyang's nuclear program must be stopped, the president sought Japanese cooperation, they said. Kim briefed the Japanese leader on his telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton in which they emphasized tripartite efforts by Seoul, Tokyo and Washington on sanctions. Hata responded that Japan acknowledges U.N. sanctions are unavoidable due to North Korea's attitude and the current international situation, although it is Tokyo's basic stance to try and solve the nuclear problem through dialogue. The prime minister promised the closest cooperation allowed under the Japanese Constitution on the sanctions in consultations among Japan, South Korea and the United States, Kim's spokesman Chu Ton- sik said. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is due in Seoul this Saturday, and Kim said he will have his Foreign Minister Han Sung- chu explain to Kakizawa China's stance on the North Korean nuclear issue. Han returns later Thursday from Beijing, where he held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Hata said he will have Kakizawa call on President Kim to discuss many issues. Kim is expected to call President Clinton soon to brief him on his Russian visit and to consult again on the North Korean nuclear situation.
