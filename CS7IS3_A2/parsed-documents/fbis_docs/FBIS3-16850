Tavrovskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has arrived in Moscow on a three-day visit. During meetings with the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry and other leaders, Hata is going to discuss a wide range of issues. Firstly, long-standing disputes over the Kuril Islands, which cause great anxiety on the part of the Japanese side in light of the recent statement by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, that there is no territorial problem between our two countries. Hata also wants to discuss Russia' policy in the former Yugoslavia in greater detail, economic cooperation issues, and the possibility of Russia joining G7 -- the minister is very reserved regarding the latter. Before departure, Hata admitted frankly that he was going to ask Russia's assistance in settling the situation on the Korean Peninsula. To all appearances, Marshall Kim Il-song continues to develop nuclear weapons, and the pressure exerted by South Korea and the United States is evidently insufficient. All these issues will be discussed tomorrow when the six-hour time lag between Moscow and Tokyo will not be affecting the minister so strongly. Today, Hata laid a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown soldier and visited the Moscow State University and the Morozov hospital.
