Chien made the remarks when answering questions from legislator Chen Chien-jen at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting. The United States has promised to make arrangements for Lien's stay in the U.S., Chien said, adding that he personally hopes that bilateral relations between Taipei and Washington will be further boosted after June 3, when the U.S. has to make a final decision on whether to renew the most-favored-nation trade status of Beijing. Washington has been very cautious in handling matters concerning Taiwan and Mainland China, he noted. Lien, scheduled to leave Taipei for El Salvador and Guatemala on May 30 for an eight-day trip, will attend the inauguration of newly elected Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol on June 1 in San Salvador and begin a four-day visit in Guatemala City starting June 2.
