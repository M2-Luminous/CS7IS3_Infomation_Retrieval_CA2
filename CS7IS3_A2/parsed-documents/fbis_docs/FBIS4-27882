First of all, together with all countrymen, I pray for the repose of the souls of those who are resting at this sacred place of the nation, respectfully bowing before their souls. At the same time, I would like to say words of deep respect and consolation to those who have done meritorious deeds and members of the families of those who have dedicated their lives to the country, who have only lived indefatigably for the country and the society with dignity and purposeful life even under the difficult circumstances, and those military servicemen and policemen who are still suffering in the hospital from the wounds they suffered during the Korean war and the Vietnamese war. Fellow countrymen: We are enjoying much freedom and prosperity today and have been able to secure a firm position in the world. We owe this to the noble sacrifice of those who have done meritorious deeds for the country, including the deceased patriots and the war dead. They dedicated with delight their flowering youth in the Korean and Vietnamese wars, thereby laying the foundation for bringing today's remarkable development and democracy into blossom. At this solemn ceremony today, we should solidify our resolve to repay their patriotic loyalty by deeply bearing in our mind the real meaning of the fatherland that they defended with blood and sweat. The country they really wanted was a unified fatherland in which the whole nation can enjoy a happy life amid abundance while all people's freedom and human rights are respected and democracy is rooted. Today's world, in which communism has collapsed and the ideological confrontation between the East and West has ended, clearly shows that their faith in free democracy was correct. However, the unchanged confrontational aspect of the Cold War era still remains on the Korean peninsula, the ground for our Korean nation's living, the only example of such a kind on earth. Under these circumstances, looking at our compatriots who have fled the North who are suffering from all kinds of hardships while wandering about China and Russia, we cannot but feel warm compassion and patriotic love toward the North Korean residents whose basic human rights are not being guaranteed. This is why we feel reverence toward the great meritorious deeds of those who dedicated their lives to the country--who made today's ROK possible with a firm faith in the future of their nation--when the fate of the fatherland was at stake. Fellow countrymen: The reality of our national security is that the vigilance against the North is increasingly weakening [taebuk kyonggaksimi chomcha huibakhaejigo issomyo] in spite of the fact that North Korea is pushing for its southward strategy in the reunification front and its nuclear development at a heightened level and that even a callousness to national security is spreading and we are not noticing it. We should resolutely cope with those forces that are threatening our free democratic system and should exercise wisdom and sagacity to prepare with composure for a unified fatherland of tomorrow based on a firm view of the country and a sense of national security, while giving up hasty expectations or illusions on the unification. Now is the time to concentrate all national strength on increasing the national competitive power at a time when we are faced with an important stage that will determine the future of the nation. This notwithstanding, some circles in our society are putting forth reckless claims and allegations, and excessive selfishness. This is very worrisome. Even under these circumstances, all our countrymen should establish a mature democratic society through participation and reconciliation from a broadminded viewpoint of developing a national community. Souls of those who dedicated their lives for the country: We do not forget even for a moment your meritorious deeds, who made today's fatherland possible by defending the free democracy in this land. We will establish a blissful country where freedom and justice overflows and open the era of the Korean nation which will toweringly stand in the world to repay your sacrifice. The government will make further efforts in providing your beloved descendants with material and spiritual courteous treatment to help them enjoy their life with honor and dignity, thereby helping the spirit of your noble patriotism lay in the hearts of the countrymen forever. Today, on this meaningful Memorial Day, we respectfully pray for the repose of the souls of those who are resting at the National Cemetery--the sacred ground of the nation--once again paying tribute to them, while recalling once again the patriotic loyalty of the war dead and those who dedicated their lives to the country.
