Aninat made this comment in a speech before the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) Assembly in Guadalajara, Mexico. He added that Chile will use every international meeting to denounce this practice. He noted that "after long efforts to increase the quantity and variety of its goods and services, Chile is operating with an export capability of 33 percent to the Latin American countries, 31.8 percent to Europe, and 31 percent to Asia. [no closing quotation marks as published] Aninat also proposed the formation of open and sophisticated regional groups for investment and international trade. He added that the Chilean Government was pleased to hear the reaffirmation made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that Chile continues to be the primary candidate for joining NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada, or for negotiating a bilateral agreement "because we are not against either of the two formulas," said Aninat. Aninat also recognized the contribution made by the IDB for regional integration. He expressed optimism that this organization would support the hemispheric summit called by President Bill Clinton in Miami next December.
