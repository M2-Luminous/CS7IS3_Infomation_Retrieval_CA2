The most dangerous and the most difficult to deal with are foreign and internal debts and the payments hold-ups between enterprises. The prime minister believes that Poland, with the potential of its people and its economic potential, is capable of holding a worthy place in Europe. Listeners asked the prime minister about his views on privatization: [Begin Pawlak recording] As far as the principle goes I think one can say one thing: we must sell less and sell it better -- and then we shall all be satisfied -- because when comparing the effects of privatization for this year, when revenue from privatization amounts to about $400 million, when comparing this to some specific undertakings I don't know whether with this kind of money one could build as much as a Kwidzyn [city in Gdansk province]. So this illustrates the scale of this phenomenon. So I would like to stress again: The point is to sell less -- for a better price. And then there will be no doubts regarding this process. It is important that privatization should not be a program motivated only by ideology; it should be an undertaking which would improve the efficiency of the economy and an undertaking which would allow us to stabilize the economic situation. Here we have the example of other countries which managed to implement large privatization projects and to stabilize their economy. If this revenue is not used as soon as it is received then there will be both acceptance and justification for effecting such important undertakings. This task faces us all -- faces the government but also those who have a good grasp of the money market: to introduce procedures which will be effective. [end recording]
