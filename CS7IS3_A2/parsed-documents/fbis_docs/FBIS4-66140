It is neither anomalous nor something definitive or irreversible which, for instance, could not be overturned when it comes to debating issues of great importance or constitutional amendments. Yesterday the Senate acknowledged the fact that, thanks to the winner-take-all system, the coalition led by the new prime minister won the elections and decided that it was correct to put it to the test. This, even though it lacks an absolute majority of seats in the chamber headed by Scognamiglio. Let us say at once that we consider this a display of wisdom. For the opposition forces, too, it is better, much better, to reserve their strength for fundamental matters of principle rather than to waste it in a hazardous venture whose outcome is uncertain. Furthermore, we must accustom ourselves to the fact that this is in the nature of a winner-take-all system: At least with regard to the coalition or party that is to govern, it is the people who decide. If something does not work, no recourse to bizarre parliamentary conjuring should normally be permitted. Unless in the case of temporary solutions, the only way to obviate this kind of problem is to hold another election. The left-wing and center forces must understand the fundamental significance of the electoral law that they themselves desired: It must be the voters, the people, who decide not only on the balance of forces in Parliament, but also who should occupy the government seats and who should occupy the opposition seats. The only opportunity to try to reverse the situation is through an election. Does this mean that from now on all that the Left and the Center can do in Parliament is to perform a mere supervisory role? And that it is of no consequence that the opposition forces in the Senate are stronger (numerically) than those of the government? Not at all. But this advantage must be used wisely, on issues of vital importance over which they are prepared to face an electoral challenge in the near future. Thus the period in which the government coalition was able to consider it a right that the Senate grant it the majority that it lacksr came to an end yesterday. Now they will have to earn anything more. And bland reassurances will not be enough. With regard to the promises made during the election campaign, there is not much to be said: The voters will judge whether or not they have been honored. However, there is something to be said with regard to two or three other matters. First, the separation between Berlusconi the businessman (in the media field, moreover) and Berlusconi the politician. Agreed, as he himself said, the entire country will be watching him. But that is not enough. The prime minister must consider it his obligation to make it known soon whether, and if so how and within what timeframe he intends to separate the businessman from the politician. Second, the presence of postfascist ministers and under secretaries in the government. As we have already said, we do not believe that a restoration of the Mussolini regime is under way in Italy. Not even in a more modern guise, better suited to the approach of the year 2000. But Berlusconi and even [National Alliance leader] Fini can do much more to make it clear to the country, and above all to the rest of the world, that fascism is not only something which died 50 years ago and about which everyone has his own opinions. Antitotalitarian values, which Mr. Fini, too, says he has espoused, must be truly alive. There must be no more little mistakes, gaffes, ambiguous remarks: We cannot permit ourselves for a single moment to yield to the "new apathy" that we have been obliged to condemn several times recently in these columns. Last, there is the issue of guarantees -- and for the moment we will confine ourselves to consider those affecting parliament -- for those who are not part of this majority. Here too, so far there have been errors, gaffes, and rash remarks. Very well, we want to know as soon as possible the names of the committee chairmen on which the government majority has the final say and the other public appointments with respect to which the winners of the elections will be foregoing the practice of military occupation. Let this be clear: Nobody wants new forms of associationism, horse trading, and confusion between winners and losers in the 27 March elections. But since it is the custom in all civilized countries that the opposition forces can enjoy means of control, it is time for the government to make absolutely clear which posts it intends to grant to its adversaries and which to independents (chosen jointly with the opposition) providing guarantees of impartial conduct. These three are only a few issues, but they are crucial ones. We hope that the opposition too will concentrate on them in a concrete and constructive manner. This means abandoning the pointless and wasteful daily lamentations in which it has recently tried in vain to drown its post-electoral disappointment.
