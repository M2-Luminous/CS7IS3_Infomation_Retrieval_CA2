Talking to ZDF, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said that this is unacceptable. Bosnia has more Russians than it needs. The country does not want any Russians, who do not cooperate in stopping the war. They are only supporting the Serbs and just serve to cover up the domestic problems between the government in Moscow and Russian right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy and divert attention from their internal problems, Ganic stated.
