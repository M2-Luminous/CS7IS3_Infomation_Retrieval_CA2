Certain aspects of the lengthy dialogue between President Caldera and Granier follow: [Granier] President Caldera, when Venezuelans elected you as president of the Republic for a second time, the country was experiencing a serious political, economic, and social crisis. During the short time that has passed since you took office, we have observed a growing stabilization in the political arena. The instability, confusion, dislike, and contempt that have existed regarding politics have begun to vanish, and one senses the people have regained pride in their basic institutions. There is a revival of trust in that area. When will we be able to see the same stabilization we have witnessed in the political arena in the economic and social areas? [Caldera] We are on the way. I am determined and convinced I will achieve it once the puzzle is assembled, but this country is in the midst of chaos; everyone is looking after his own interests. I want to urge my friends and colleagues at the university: Show the country that you feel as a part of Venezuela, that your problem is part of a larger problem that affects the entire country, that you are willing to make sacrifices, as we all should, to get the country going. The economic situation has been, undoubtedly, on the front burner. First, it was Banco Latino's intervention, which, despite being a very serious problem, was resolved, and satisfactorily, according to many. The intervention of Banco Latino has unveiled the fact that other banks were facing problems as well, that a systemic crisis was occurring. Those banks that receive financial assistance from Fogade are actually obtaining money the Central Bank withdraws from its reserves. The Central Bank gives these funds to Fogade, which, in turn, gives it to the banks, and rumors claim that bankers receive the money, which is untrue. These funds are given to depositors, savers, those who have suffered anxiety similar to that experienced by those involved in the Banco Latino case. Those people numbered almost as many depositors as those affected by the intervention of Banco Latino. Incidentally, I would like to insist on this explanation. That money has not been given away; it was given to the banks in exchange for their shares, their assets, and their properties. Those banks no longer belong to bankers but, rather, to the country. The country will have to rehabilitate them in order to see whether it privatizes or sells them, and whatever profits are made from their sale will help reimburse the Central Bank for its loan to Fogade. It has truly been a serious situation, but, fortunately, it is stabilizing. I have met, almost daily, with the Central Bank Board of Directors, discussing the problem over with them, and I have told them of my decision to take any necessary measures, because I am willing to put the country's interest above all. They have talked about it, studied it, and made various suggestions, and so far we believe the current system is heading toward a balance. [Granier] It has been, undoubtedly, a significant move. Many are blaming the exacerbation of the problem on a lack of coordination of your economic team. Is that why you have made the cabinet changes the media published yesterday? [Caldera] It is natural for a government team to be organized in accordance with its party. Adjustments may be implemented later, but a government team arrives with built-in machinery. The English, for instance, have a proposed cabinet so that when the opposition assumes power it does so accompanied by its entire team. This is not the case here. We had a true convergence, and due to the participation of people from various trends, we have had to incorporate different views. Thus, the machinery has been organized, adapted, and the system has been established. The government team has worked hard. The problem is that we received this country in an extremely poor condition. I do not believe it would be constructive or prudent for the people if we were to persist in telling them of the disarray we have encountered. Do you believe I am like Perez? [Granier] Not at all, thank God. [Caldera] Commander Chavez is the one person who you should not confuse me with Perez. I am not interested nor do I believe it is appropriate for me to engage in a discussion with him. I have given him every assurance for his return to civilian life and for him to use all the rights he has as a Venezuelan. If this is the way he feels, fine; he has the right to say so even though what he says many times borders on what the laws tolerate. Anyway, it is best for the country to hear him and for the country to begin seeing things the way they really are. It is best for the country to begin realizing who is who, how people think, and what they want. [Granier] It has been said one cause of the economic problem is the many and contradictory statements the government spokesmen are making about it. Will the cabinet change mean the government will have only one economic spokesman? [Caldera] According to the law, the Finance Ministry is the center of the government's economic policy. Dr. Julio Sosa is the government's most authorized authority in economic matters. Julio's full name is Julio Sosa Rodriguez. Somebody has said we are cousins, because I am Caldera Rodriguez. There is no kinship between us or between us and the Rodriguez relatives of Carlos Andres Perez. We cannot avoid cabinet members speaking to the media at various activities. I have occasionally noticed this; some have different ideas, different points of view, and we have been working on this. This is why I am receiving reports from all the ministers at least once a week and from certain ministers several times a week. I have done this in compliance with a commitment, because I think the president, as the country's manager, must manage his government team. I have done this to create, to build a common position in the government. There have been difficulties, and I have not achieved a perfect situation, but I think we are marching in that direction. [Granier] Currency exchange stability is very important for the economic stability we all want, but there are two other matters on which I would like for you to comment. Venezuela urgently needs investments, and they will be coming, basically, from abroad. To make changes possible, Venezuela needs programs of social assistance; that is, there are people who are more negatively affected when the value of the dollar rises from 120 to 160 bolivares. The economic recession that exists due to the hike in the value of the dollar, the drop in imports, and the reduction in oil exports has negatively affected economic growth. The impact of this situation is more severe on certain people more than others. What social assistance plans or programs does your government have? [Caldera] I will begin by saying there is no single week during which I fail to receive the visit of one, two, or more foreign investors who come to tell me of their plans to invest in Venezuela. I would like to see Venezuelan investors come to me in the same number as the foreign investors. We have opened some doors. The Law for Construction of Works Using the Concessions System is most important, as acknowledged by the many people who are connected with the construction industry or the economy. This opens the doors for important public works that the state cannot carry out now and that need to be concluded, and this is why it is necessary to take advantage of investments. Those who use services are prepared to pay for them. Tolls on highways will be a heavy burden, but the people are willing to pay, because they will get where they are going quicker, more comfortably, and will save on fuel and car wear. For example, how long has it been since the opening of the Romulo Betancour Highway in the east? We are again promoting the Program on Equipping Neighborhoods and Public Housing. This neighborhood program is very interesting, because in some of those neighborhoods there are houses built by the townspeople with great efforts, homes that are comfortable with fairly good amenities but without public services. There are no streets, no water, no sewage, and no telephones. We are trying to create awareness and the possibility of the communities living decently. I realize that this drama that is over--I think it is, fortunately, over this matter of the dollar and the exchange rate--has produced, due to devaluation, another process of inflation and that this directly affects the poor sectors. We have to face that. I am prepared to make all the necessary efforts, serious efforts. I do not want to tell lies. I do not want to announce things that will not be carried out.
