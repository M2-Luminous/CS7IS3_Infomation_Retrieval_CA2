"Ambassadors Hwang Pyong-tae of South Korea and Chu Chang-chon of North Korea nearly met here through arrangements made by an influential ethnic Korean living in Beijing last November when negotiations between the United States and North Korea were making hardly any progress," the diplomat said. That meeting failed to take place, he said, but chances that the two Koreas will get together behind the scenes are bright because of recent developments, the diplomat said, asking for anonymity. The United States has said it will refer the matter to the U.N. Security Council unless North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reach agreement on inspections before the IAEA convenes a Board of Governors' meeting on Feb. 21. According to the source, the South Korean Embassy here received a proposal from the North Korean Embassy in a councilor-level contact urging that they arrange a Hwang-Chu meeting. The South Korean Embassy has studied the proposal but withheld any decision because North Korea was already in contact secretly with the United States in New York and because the timing was wrong, the diplomat said. In addition, the two Koreas have an existing channel for such contacts, he added. The source said, however, a view is gaining strength within the South Korean Government that Seoul must determine Pyongyang's true nuclear intentions as its talks with the United States and the IAEA appear to have reached their limit. Besides, South Korea must know the North's position on the issue because President Kim Yong-sam is expected to discuss it at a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he visits China in March, the source said. Consequently, there is a strong possibility that Hwang and Chu will hold a secret meeting in Beijing in the near future, the source said.
