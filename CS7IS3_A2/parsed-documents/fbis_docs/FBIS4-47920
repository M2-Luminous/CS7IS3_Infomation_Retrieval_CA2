[words indistinct] it seems the government has been taking the action to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]-held areas, notably N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province, east of the capital Luanda. There have been reports of heavy fighting there, and now the government claims to have captured the town. From Luanda Neto Shackson reports: The state's news agency ANGOP [ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY] said today government troops captured N'dalatando, but there has been no confirmation from military headquarters. UNITA radio two days ago reported heavy government shellings to the town, and government commander in Dondo, about 100 km south west of N'dalatando, told me late last month a government offensive had reached positions very close to the town. The matter of who controls Huambo in Andola is [words indistinct]. The government holds many towns and cities, while UNITA holds most of the surrounding countryside. The progress of war is patchy. Last month UNITA captured Chongoroi, in the western Province of Benguela, and the government newspapers said today there has been heavy fighting in the southern government-held town of Cuchi. But, as with all military information in Angola, there has been no reliable confirmation.
