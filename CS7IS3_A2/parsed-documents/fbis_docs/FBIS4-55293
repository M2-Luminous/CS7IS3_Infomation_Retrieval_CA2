He said that the program of economic stabilization gave some encouraging results, but that the prices of especially services and agricultural produce are still very high. Our reporter asked the federal prime minister to comment on yesterday's statement by the governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, Dragoslav Avramovic, that the bank would not give any credits to the Federal Government before it has secured wheat. Let us listen what Radoje Kontic said: [Begin recording] [Reporter Radoslav Nikolic] How do you interpret the governor's statement that he will no longer give any credits to the Federal Government? [Kontic] I did not hear this statement. However, I must immediately point our that there have been absolutely no problems in cooperation between the Federal Government and the National Bank of Yugoslavia so far. We have managed to resolve all the issues very quickly and efficiently to mutual satisfaction. I see no reason why this would not be the case in the coming period. If we share the same strategic goal, which we do, namely, the preservation of the dinar's stability, the preservation of the stability of prices, and, within this context, the reanimation of the overall economic activity and production, then I really see no reason why we could not agree on measures, mechanisms, and instruments with which we would accomplish such strategic goals. [Nikolic] Mr. Prime Minister, the Federal Government has issued bonds with an 11 percent interest rate. To what extent has this damaged the economic program of stabilization? [Kontic] Well, it is a well known fact that the federal budget suffers from a rather heavy budget deficit and this budget deficit can be actively serviced in two ways -- through money issue, which is inflationary and ill-advised, and through real sources of income. It is perfectly common in such situations for a government to issue bonds and in this way secure real sources of income from the financial market in order to cover the budget deficit. In this particular case, this involved some 15 million FRY dinars, with which we had to settle obligations toward the Yugoslav Army, or to be precise, toward the military industry. Bearing in mind that the overall sources were de facto placed into the military industry, it is absolutely certain that they will serve the reanimation of production, that is, that they will comply with the realization of the program of economic stabilization. I personally believe that governor's remark did not refer to the fact that bonds were released, but to the conditions in which the bonds were released. We have acknowledged his suggestion and, in the future, we will, in agreement with the National Bank of Yugoslavia, define the conditions for the issue of bonds. [end recording]
