FR940907-1-00041 FR940907-1-00015 3. Security Ratings Disclosure Practices Notwithstanding these developments, little has changed with respect to most ratings disclosures and regulatory policies using such ratings. Today, a traditional corporate debt instrument with fixed principal and interest obligations, a structured note whose principal or interest is tied, for example to an index of securities, an ``interest-only'' strip (``IO''), a collateralized mortgage obligation (``CMO'') security, a residual interest in a CMO offering, and a cash flow (or ``kitchen-sink'') bond all can be designated ``triple-a,'' notwithstanding that investment returns on most of these instruments are largely dependent on factors in addition to the issuer's creditworthiness and that the scope of the rating differs among the securities. Moreover, despite the differences among these securities, issuers, financial intermediaries, and investors have availed themselves of the regulatory accommodations provided for securities rated investment grade by NRSROs. 31 31 In a companion concept release issued today, the Commission is soliciting comment on the Commission's regulatory use of the ratings assigned by NRSROs. The release solicits a wide range of comments both as to the specific regulatory uses of NRSRO ratings, as well as the Commission's process for designating and monitoring NRSROs. See Exchange Act Release No. 34616. The proposals contained in this release are aimed at improving the quality and timeliness of disclosure of ratings in Commission filings under the current regulatory approach to ratings and rating organizations. II. Proposals A. General The growth of customized asset-backed, derivative, and structured securities that have significant non-credit payment risks, as well as the development of ``limited scope'' ratings, 32 have caused the Commission to reconsider its voluntary ratings disclosure policy. When these complex, customized securities first developed, they were purchased by a relatively small number of large, highly sophisticated institutional investors. Recent evidence suggests that these securities are increasingly being offered and sold to a larger investor base, either directly or through mutual funds and pension plans. 33 32 For purposes of this release, a ``limited scope'' rating means a rating that assesses less than the promised (or expected, if different from the promised) return on the security. 33 See supra note 26. Current rating designations and the variation in meaning and scope of the ratings represented, together with the widely disparate payment obligations of the securities rated, have a substantial potential to confuse, and in some cases mislead, investors. This problem is exacerbated in secondary market transactions where no disclosure document may be delivered and ratings are described simply by shorthand reference to the rating letter designation. Even where there is a delivered disclosure document, it is often difficult to understand clearly the scope of the rating. Likewise, many market participants have assumed that the same regulatory treatment should apply to similarly rated securities, notwithstanding significant differences in the nature of the payment obligations, the significant non-credit payment risk exposure for many of today's securities, and the limited scope of some security ratings. Given the extensive use of, and reliance on, ratings, and the wide disparity in the meaning and significance of the rating, the Commission today is proposing a mandatory ratings disclosure scheme. B. Mandated Disclosures Today's proposals would replace the current voluntary ratings disclosure policy with a system requiring disclosure in a final prospectus of a rating given by an NRSRO whenever a rating with respect to the securities being offered is obtained by or on behalf of an issuer. Material changes in ratings would be required to be reported on Form 8&hyph;K under the Exchange Act. The new disclosure requirements are intended to enhance security rating disclosures so that investors clearly understand what terms of a security are being rated and the limitations, if any, on the rating, and are advised on a current basis of material rating changes. In particular, the proposed disclosure would highlight whether the assigned rating covers timely payment of all obligations or whether it is limited in its scope, and whether there are significant non-credit payment risks not addressed by the rating. 1. Mandated Prospectus Disclosure Under the proposal, when a security rating is obtained by or on behalf of an issuer from an NRSRO (a ``solicited rating''), the issuer would be required to disclose in the final prospectus 34 the rating assigned and a discussion of the scope of the rating. 35 The issuer would be required to keep the prospectus disclosure of ratings current so long as the offering continued. 36 The mandated disclosure also would apply when any rating (whether or not assigned by an NRSRO) is used in connection with the offer or sale of a security by any participant in the offering. 37 Commenters are requested to address the proposed treatment of ratings used by any participant in the offering, particularly in view of the need to provide a consent of the rating organization if it is not an NRSRO. 34 As used in this release, final prospectus refers to a prospectus complying with Section 10(a) under the Securities Act. 15 USC 77j. 35 When a final rating is not assigned until after effectiveness of a registration statement, a preliminary prospectus should disclose the preliminary rating (if any) assigned by the rating organization in accordance with the disclosure requirements described below. If a disclosed rating is materially changed or if a materially different rating becomes available before effectiveness, the issuer should file a pre-effective amendment and should consider recirculating the preliminary prospectus. The issuer would update the final prospectus to reflect the final rating assigned and all related disclosure. Under the proposals, the final rating is considered ``pricing information'' that may be included in a final prospectus under Rule 430A of Regulation C. 17 CFR 230.430A. In connection with delayed shelf offerings, the final rating would be disclosed in a prospectus supplement. If a consent is required, it would be filed as part of a post-effective amendment or, for companies eligible to use a short-form registration statement, a Form 8&hyph;K. 36 Changes in the rating information during the offering period would be disclosed in a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). 17 CFR 230.424. 37 Participant refers to the issuer, any selling securityholder, any underwriter and any member of the selling group. As proposed, the rule would require disclosure of ``obtained'' NRSRO ratings, whether or not the issuer (or a participant in the offering) chooses to use the rating in the selling effort. Commenters should address whether this requirement could lead to attempts to thwart the mandated disclosure merely by non-substantive or procedural modification to the practice of assigning ratings so that, for example, an issuer would not view a security rating as ``obtained by or on behalf of the issuer'' unless agreed to by the issuer. Of course, such attempts would raise substantial antifraud issues. If this outcome is possible, should the disclosure obligation be keyed off another event such as when an NRSRO provides the issuer with a ``preliminary'' indication of what the rating would be? Should the rule mandate disclosure only when the NRSRO rating is used in the offering? Would this result in use and therefore disclosure of favorable ratings, and non-use and non-disclosure of unfavorable ratings? Where no NRSRO rating is provided in the prospectus, should the rule require disclosure that the securities have not been rated by an NRSRO, a discussion of whether there were any contacts with an NRSRO about rating the securities, and a summary description of the contacts which would include any actions taken by the NRSRO, and any views expressed by the NRSRO? Commenters also should address the extent to which practices to avoid disclosure of unfavorable ratings are likely to occur.
