This phrase faithfully reflects reality. [Former Prime Minister] Konstandinos Mitsotakis, who wanted to settle the Skopje issue any old way, failed to achieve his goal because of Andonis Samaras' internal resistance in the New Democracy (ND), the Panhellenic Socialist Movement's (PASOK) "hardline" stance, and public opposition. The PASOK government, which inherited an issue rife with "faits accomplis" is thus compelled to follow a defensive policy on this issue, since Greece lost the possibility of a veto it held in the European Union (EU) following Skopje's entrance into the UN. However, why did the PASOK government postpone the procedure of UN intervention, which the ND had agreed to? From the very beginning, the PASOK government was opposed to the name of "Macedonia" for Skopje. This position was developed by Mr. Papandreou both during political leaders' meetings and in his pre-electoral campaign. While the UN procedure that the ND had accepted reinforced the three conditions demanded at this time by Mr. Papandreou from Mr. Gligorov, it resulted in the name of "Nova Makedonia." The former government had proposed to the UN secretary general the name of "Slavomakedonia," which Skopje rejected. Both names used the term "Macedonia," and therefore were contrary to PASOK's expressed policy. Hence, the PASOK government expected nothing from that UN procedure. Which are the three conditions set by the government to come to the negotiating table with Skopje? The first is changing the preamble of the Skopjean Constitution, the second is a clear statement by Skopje regarding the inviolability of Greek borders, and the third is the removal of the Veryina star from Skopje symbols. [passage omitted] Why did Mr. Papandreou mention at this time that the name issue is included in the negotiations as well, since, as he himself stressed, Greece will not recognize a state with the name of "Macedonia"? Mr. Papandreou's tactical maneuver was undertaken to bring Skopje to the negotiating table. And, of course, because the differences between Greece and Skopje center essentially on the name. Therefore, no dialogue could take place under a UN aegis if--at least in theory, the name issue was not one of the elements of this dialogue (something that, according to information, the UN transmitted to Athens through the United States). Additionally, Mr. Papandreou wants to make clear that if the Skopjeans agree to the three conditions, this does not mean that the differences between them and Athens cease to exist. Simply, the issue of the name can be settled at a later time. Yesterday's statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos is characteristic: "We can live without the immediate settlement of the name issue." Does a dialogue in which Greece negotiates--but does not discuss the name issue--mean that it is aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries, with the name issue in abeyance? As long as the Skopjeans are not convinced by Greek arguments (political and economic) to change their name and the present impasse on the name persists, then naturally the dialogue with Skopje has no other objective than to promote a peaceful coexistence between the two countries. Could the Greek side exert pressure on Skopje--on a bilateral level--so that it will change its name? Greece could use a number of severe measures against Skopje, such as not allowing goods to reach this country by closing the border or the Salonica port. However, this measure would have negative consequences for Greece now that Skopje is a UN member and has been recognized by every country in the world. This would show that Athens is a destabilizing influence in the area and flouts international legality. Secondly, it would create enormous legal problems for Greece within the Community, for Athens has no right to obstruct intra-EC trade. Thirdly, because Athens-Skopje relations will become very tense, with Skopje henceforth depending on Bulgaria, Albania, and Turkey, which would like to play a primary role in the region. If Greece closes the border, it will throw Skopje into the arms of the countries nourishing designs on it. On the contrary, if a hardline stance had been adopted since the beginning of Yugoslavia's dissolution, perhaps things would be different today. So, is Greece condemned to live peacefully with Skopje? It is. Because stability in the region mandates the continued existence of the statelet, given that Skopje's neighbors (with the exception of Greece), nourish territorial ambitions against it. However, the dismemberment of the statelet (between Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria) would both strengthen these countries and not change the borders in the area, thus opening Pandora's box.
