"No one from his family or circle of friends paid him a visit in spite of the suspension being lifted," confirmed the director-general of social rehabilitation Baharuddin Lopa on Wednesday. Visitors wishing to visit him must first be screened by the prison guards. Questions are asked on the purpose of the visit and they must disclose their relations with Xanana. "The exercise is aimed at stopping bonafide visitors who may just want to see what Xanana looks like," said Lopa who is also secretary-general of the National Commission on Human Rights. When asked about the decision to allow former dissident and chairman of the Indonesian Law Aid Foundation (YLBHI), Adnan Buyung Nasution, to visit Xanana, Lopa said the case was still under consideration. "Nasution's letter of request is with the justice minister and he alone can grant the permission." [passage omitted]
