In his address he stated, among other things, that we understand Partnership for Peace as a means toward NATO membership. Speaking about the tasks of the Army of the Slovak Republic in the coming period, Kanis described as one of the most important the preparation of an optimal variant of the Army's transformation into new organizational structures while abiding by the limits concerning troop numbers and weapon systems set by the Vienna and Paris agreements. At a news conference following the meeting with functionaries and civilian employees of the Army Command of the Slovak Republic in Trencin, Kanis analyzed the causes of the tense relations between the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic and the Army Command of the Slovak Republic. One of the causes, in his opinion, was that, in the process of division of the former federal Army and the establishment of an independent Army of the Slovak Republic, the Army Command was set up first and the Ministry of Defense only later. In his opinion, this has caused problems in the search for the optimal structure of relations and powers between the two institutions. Specific problems of this relationship rested, according to Pavol Kanis, also in the fact that the minister of defense was a soldier. Dealing with the reduction of basic military service to 12 months, Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, commander of the Army of the Slovak Republic, stated, among other things, that this period is sufficient for the military training of rank-and-file soldiers but not for NCO's. Their specialized training has been reduced from six to three months, which is generally considered insufficient. The Army wants to address this problem by means of the gradual professionalization of some NCO's, as is common in NATO armies.
