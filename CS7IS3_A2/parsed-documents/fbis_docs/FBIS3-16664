With the Aim of Stabilizing the Republic's Energy Supply"] [Excerpt] It seems that the serious situation that took shape in the republic in winter due to the acute shortage of electric power is gradually returning to normal. Elimination of the consequences of the recent accident at the Tbilisi State Regional Power Station, the supply of natural gas and fuel oil from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, in spite of the large debts that Georgia owes to these countries, and the spring high-water in the rivers, which has increased the seasonal output of hydro-electric stations, have enabled us to improve to some degree the supply of electric power to vitally important installations such as bakeries and hospitals and also to the population. During the last few days, the Tbilisi subway, though operating according to a strict schedule, has been functioning almost normally; it carries more than 90 percent of all passengers travelling in the Georgian capital. Trolleybuses have again started to operate along certain city lines. Telephone communications have been restored in most areas. However, there is still very much that needs to be done in order to achieve complete stability in the republic's electric power complex. As before, the new residential areas in Tbilisi and individual cities and rayons in the republic are permanently without electricity. Industrial enterprises remain idle, while expecting a change in the electric power situation.... This was a topic of discussion at the regular session of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Presidium under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia that was held on 9 March. The main point on the agenda was the question of urgent measures aimed at stabilizing the situation that has taken shape in the republic's electric power complex. A thorough analysis of both the objective and subjective reasons that have given rise to the crisis in this most important branch has enabled us to elaborate a concrete program aimed at bringing it out of this serious situation and creating real preconditions for a radical improvement in energy supplies to the economic complex and the population during the autumn and winter of 1994-95. It is planned to increase the production of electric power this year to 11-12 billion kilowatt hours; at the same time, compared with last year, the rate of increase amounts to 112.2 percent. In order to implement this program, it has been decided to allocate 3.5 billion rubles to this branch from the credits received by Georgia; this money will go, first and foremost, on repairing the equipment at the Tbilisi State Regional Hydro-Power Station and the Inguri Hydro-Power Station and on increasing the level of production. In accordance with the adopted decree, the appropriate instructions have been given to the "Sakenergo" [Georgian electric power production and consumption] department and other departments and ministries, the heads of enterprises and organizations, and the republic's town and rayon local administrative bodies in order to bring the branch out of the crisis.
