At a news conference in Pretoria, Mr Botha warned of an "ominous possibility of bloodshed and conflict" in Natal/kwaZulu. He said he did not know to what extent kwaZulu chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi was prepared to allow the Independent Electoral Commission to do its work to ensure free and fair elections. The fact was that the African National Congress [ANC] and the IFP were at war with each other, he said, suggesting that 20-strong delegations of the ANC and the IFP under the chairmanship of an international figure or the chief justice meet to sort out their differences. "With so much intimidation in so many places there can hardly be a free and fair election." Mr Botha warned of the danger that South Africa could be "forgotten" after the election and inauguration of the new president if the violence and intolerance did not come to an end. He appealed to the ANC and the IFP to put South Africa first, rather than party political interests.
