The Lithuanian border guards were not been informed about this train in advance. Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the headquarters of the state protection service, told the Baltic News Service correspondent that the Lithuanian border guards only learned about the military cargo after the arrival of the train at the Kybartai post on the border with Kaliningrad region. The armored vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen who did not have the necessary permission issued by the Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs to transport weapons. It was decided to allow the train to cross the border so that the dangerous cargo should not get stuck near Lithuania. The border protection servicemen watched the train all the time to ensure that the armored vehicles would not detrain on the way. The train with the armored vehicles left the territory of Lithuania crossing the Kena border post on the Belarusian border without incident at 0500 on Sunday. According to Colonel Dragunaitis, the working group for negotiations with the CIS should reach an agreement with Russia as soon as possible on the procedure of such transit, so that no conflicts should arise in the future.
