At the end of the talks with Andrey Kozyrev, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic stated that his forces will end the blockade of the airport at the besieged city of Tuzla and its starving population will now be able to receive humanitarian aid. The West tried long and unsuccessfully to get the Serbs to take this step. Karadzic remained firm: The Serbs were afraid that the Muslims would use the airport for arms shipments. The Serbian weapons deployed in the immediate vicinity of the runway could have destroyed any aircraft approaching Tuzla. Since May 1992 the airport has been virtually inoperative. The humanitarian aid convoys have had to be sent overland -- along very difficult roads. The several hundred thousand inhabitants of the Muslim enclave (including 25,000 Serbs) were in a desperate position. In the West there were increasingly frequent calls to end the blockade of the airport by military means. France officially put forward such a proposal. As in the case of Sarajevo it was Moscow which undertook the mediation mission. "Tuzla was one of the most sensitive problems on Bosnian territory," Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, told IZVESTIYA. "We talked with the Serbs for a long time about opening the airport so that the accord which was reached in Moscow was no surprise." The crucial argument which convinced the Serbs to make concessions was Russia's readiness to send its observers to Tuzla where they could monitor the freight arriving at the airport. "We trust the impartiality of the Russians. Their presence is the guarantee that the Muslims will not receive weapons instead of food," Karadzic stated. The date of the start of the operation has not been announced yet. In Churkin's words, 50 Russian observers are ready to fly to Bosnia in the immediate future. Moscow has promised that the first plane carrying humanitarian aid to land at Tuzla airport after the lifting of the blockade will be Russian. There are two reasons for the Serbs' compliance. First, the persistence of Churkin and Kozyrev. The head of Russian diplomacy has acknowledged that the talks with Karadzic, lasting over two hours, were difficult. Once again Moscow had to use all its influence on the Serbs to persuade them to accept a compromise. The second reason is the firmness shown by NATO in the skies over Bosnia on Monday: Four planes violated the UN no-fly ban and were shot down by U.S. fighters. The Serbs realized that the West was prepared for firm action and that this time its threats were not empty talk. Moscow, in turn, made it clear that it would not enter into confrontation with NATO for the Serbs' sake. The Russian reaction to the incident in the air was indicative in this respect. The Foreign Ministry supported the West and pinned all the blame on the violators of the "no-fly zone," although there was hardly any doubt that the downed planes were Serbian. By all accounts, Karadzic realized that in the present situation stubbornness will cost dear and concessions are inevitable. Russia's proposal to send its observers to Tuzla enabled Karadzic to save face and at the same time rebuff the supporters of the hard line in parliament and the army, who have been accusing him of being too soft. Karadzic supported Boris Yeltsin's proposal for a summit meeting on Bosnia to be held in Moscow. He let it be known that the Serbs could make new compromises. The joint communique adopted on the results of the talks reflected that idea although it was worded very vaguely: "The Bosnian Serbs will show the maximum constructiveness taking into account among other things the qualitative criteria of the territorial demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina." In the opinion of Russian diplomats, Karadzic is prepared to abide by the promise to withdraw the artillery 20 km from besieged Sarajevo as NATO is demanding. Admittedly, there have been reports lately that the Serbs are not fulfilling their obligations and that from time to time their tanks have been violating the "prohibited zone." In Moscow, however, they are convinced that such incidents are happening against the will of the Bosnian Serb leadership, which is not in full control of its armed formations.
