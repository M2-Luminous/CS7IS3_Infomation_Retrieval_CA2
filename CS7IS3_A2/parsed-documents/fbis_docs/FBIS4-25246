Speaking at the meeting, Vice President of the People's Bank of China Dai Xianglong urged that all banks and relevant departments should prepare sufficient funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing crops in a timely manner so that farmers will not be given "IOU's." Dai Xianglong called on all localities to seriously implement the responsibility system of supplying funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing crops. Under the unified leadership of governments at all levels, banks and relevant departments should ensure funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing crops. All branches of the People's Bank of China should supervise the supply of money in addition to coordinating the work of supplying purchasing funds. Before the end of June the supply and management of funds for the purchase of grain and oil-bearing crops will be the responsibility of the Agricultural Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Beginning 1 July, the Agricultural Bank will undertake sole responsibility for supply and management. Dai Xianglong stressed: To ensure the needs for purchasing funds, all banks should strengthen unified management and ensure the orderly use of funds. The branches of specialized banks should ensure payment, ensure funds for the purchase of grain and oil-bearing crops in various localities, and grant other loans in accordance with plans and policies and the amount of available capital. Should there be a surplus of funds, it should be used under the unified management of banks of a higher level. He said: Serious efforts should be made to strengthen management to ensure the prompt supply of funds for the purchase of grain and oil-bearing crops and to prevent the diversion of purchasing funds for other purposes. Specialized banks and their branches, and the People's Bank should ensure their funds and short-term loans are first used for payment and purchasing of grain and oil-bearing crops. The People's Bank will allocate an additional sum of 6 billion yuan to the Agricultural Bank to be used for purchasing farm and sideline products. Dai Xianglong pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen control over the size of purchasing funds. When funds for the purchase of state-controlled farm and sideline products such as grain and oil-bearing crops are insufficient, purchasing authorities may obtain loans first and report the borrowing to the state later. He also stressed: It is necessary to strengthen the management of markets for grain and oil-bearing crops in coordination with relevant departments by applying the means of credit and account settlement. Granting loans to support rush purchasing in other localities and selling and buying grain and oil-bearing crops outside the prescribed limits must be strictly prohibited. In conclusion, Dai Xianglong urged all banks to do a good job in supplying and managing funds for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing crops, and to satisfy the farmers by avoiding the practice of writing "IOU'S" due a shortage of purchasing funds.
