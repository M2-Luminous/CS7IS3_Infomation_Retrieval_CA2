Confronted with devastating opinion polls, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl felt obliged to conjure up his own political upswing. Back then, not even his friends in his own party expected him to win the 1994 Bundestag elections. But the political compass May figures (conducted exclusively for FOCUS by Basis Research) make his forecasts look like prophesies: The economic outlook is viewed with growing optimism, Kohl is catching up with his opponent Rudolf Scharping, and for the first time since December 1993, the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] is ahead of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in the traditional Sunday polls. Kohl's opponent has to make himself familiar with the role of loser. Never before have the Germans -- both east and west -- viewed the general economic situation as positively as they have done in May. Although pessimists still outnumber optimists, the number of those answering "bad/very bad" to "How do you rate the general economic situation?" has decreased since March (March: 49 percent, April: 43 percent, and May: 38 percent). Optimists are experiencing the opposite trend. Their number has been going up between January and May (from 15 percent to 23 percent). This is particularly significant as unemployment (60 percent), social policy (23 percent), and economic policy (21 percent) have been considered priorities. With the number of people believing in an upswing increasing, confidence in the Federal Government and its leadership is growing. Only 36 percent currently think that an SPD government is competent enough to solve the existing problems, while the figure was 43 percent last month. This means that the SPD is only 2 percent ahead of the CDU/CSU in terms of economic competence. The trend for the Union is clearly an upward one. This also emerges from the Sunday poll. In the data projected onto the actual voting behavior on 16 October, the CDU/CSU comes out as winner in the political compass for the first time. If there were Bundestag elections next Sunday, the Bundestag would look like this: CDU/CSU 38 percent, SPD 37 percent, Alliance 90/Greens 9 percent, FDP [Free Democratic Party] 6 percent, PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] 4.5 percent, Republikaner 3.5 percent, and others 2 percent. Asked for whom they would vote, if the chancellor could be elected in a direct vote, voters expressed wide support for Helmut Kohl. While the CDU chairman is supported by 38 percent (April: 29 percent), Rudolf Scharping has plunged -- from 47 percent in April to 41 percent in May. In February, the SPD chairman was still far ahead of Kohl at 52 percent over 24 percent. One of the main reasons why the Social Democrat has lost ground have been discussions in the SPD on its election campaign and the supplementary surcharge. The FDP is the problem child. The liberals are experiencing a clear downward trend. They have lost another 0.5 percent over April and would only be elected by 6 percent of the voters at the moment -- the end of their time in parliament might be near. It is doubtful whether the junior coalition partner will be able to struggle to its feet again and will continue to tip the scales. It does not have any outstanding personalities, and only 3 percent of those polled consider the FDP competent in the traditional field of economic policy. The parties will have to reckon with the PDS. The successor party to the GDR's Socialist Unity Party has gained 0.5 percent throughout Germany. This is all the more significant as it has lost support in eastern Germany (from 15.5 percent to 14 percent). This means that support in the old laender has seen a substantial increase: from 1 percent to 2 percent.
