When praising his former rival for SPD chairman, Scharping did not miss the opportunity to pay due tribute to the federal SPD too, which he is heading. [Begin Scharping recording] It has been a clear victory for Gerhard Schroeder and the Lower Saxon SPD, and the principal credit goes to them. The success is the result of high concentration on issues of economic development, fighting unemployment, and the restoration of social rights, against the background of remarkable achievements in the land in terms of housing construction, kindergartens, and education policy. The fact that, at a federal level, the SPD has become a stable force, was certainly not a disadvantage -- I think it was even helpful. [end recording] Gerhard Schroeder had given assurance that he and Scharping were only temporary rivals while now they were friends again just as in the past. Moreover, he is certainly too intelligent to indulge in excessive muscle flexing. Nevertheless, Schroeder will not hide his light under a bushel, and his weight in the federal party has certainly increased. Despite the satisfaction about the good start into the 1994 super election year, Rudolf Scharping's statements were characterized by his traditional sobriety. He said that the election victory gave the SPD the opportunity to achieve clear leadership. [Begin Scharping recording] From that aspect, the result is optimal. It does not mean the trees will grow to unprecedented heights but it indicates that we do have good chances and that we have to continue our hard work and maintain our high concentration. I would like to warn everybody in our own party against sticking their noses up in the air. [end recording] Lower Saxony is the first land in which a coalition between the SPD and Greens went through a whole legislative term, and in which the SPD was not harmed through its alliance with the Greens. Nevertheless, the SPD leadership does not yet want to draw any conclusions from that for the Bundestag election and, what is more, does not want to have a coalition discussion forced upon it at an early stage. The goal of becoming the strongest party has now become even more realistic, Scharping said, and he anticipates that the offer of coalition partners will be larger than the demand -- which, as everybody knows, is something that always reduces prices, he said. Scharping assessed the renaissance of the main parties, which won 80 percent of the vote in Lower Saxony, as positive. This is a sign that there is still a chance to reduce the public irritation with politicians and political parties, Scharping said. In addition, it was encouraging that the Republikaner were given a rebuff. Nevertheless, their share in the vote was still much too high, Scharping concluded.
