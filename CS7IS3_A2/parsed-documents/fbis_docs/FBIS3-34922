Abbas Raza Kazmi told AFP that the embassy's military attache had visited the planes at the northern base of al-Qulay'at and informed the authorities that Pakistan was interested in buying them. "We are now waiting for a response from the Lebanese authorities. We need a price range and details because as you know these are old planes which need maintenance," he said. On Monday, the government decided to sell the 10 French-made planes, which have been grounded since the early days of Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and for which there are no spare parts. Former prime minister 'Umar Karami, during a visit to France in 1992, tried in vain to trade them in for spare parts to equip the army or for military helicopters, officials here said. Three Hawker Hunters make up Lebanon's current air force, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
