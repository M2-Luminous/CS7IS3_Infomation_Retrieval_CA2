FR940216-0-00033 FR940216-0-00009 The SSC's revisions to the ABCs recommended by the Plan Team for Bogoslof pollock, Greenland turbot and Atka mackerel are discussed below. Bogoslof Pollock The Plan Team indicated in the final 1994 SAFE report that the current estimate of biomass of Aleutian Basin pollock (490,000 mt) is the best estimate, assuming that no recruitment to the stock has occurred and that natural mortality (M) is 0.2. Reassessment of the Bogoslof area hydroacoustic survey with new threshold levels of abundance has not changed previous conclusions that this stock has declined since 1988. The Plan Team assumed that no recruitment occurred in 1993 or will occur in 1994, and projected a biomass for 1994 of 490,000 mt using M=.02. The Plan Team then calculated the F 0.35 exploitation rate of 0.26 to derive an ABC of 127,000. The SSC, however, adjusted the exploitation rate downward by 25 percent to select a ratio of current biomass to optimal biomass. This leads to an ABC of 31,750. Due to lack of recruitment predicted for 1993 and 1994, the Council recommended a TAC of 1,000 mt to provide for bycatch in other groundfish operations. Greenland Turbot The Plan Team used a new stock synthesis model to estimate the ABC, which was updated with catch and survey data through October 1993. A more conservative exploitation rate of F 0.40 and an increased slope survey catchability coefficient of 0.75 was selected. These adjustments resulted in a conservative ABC of 17,200 mt. Continued poor recruitment and stock abundance levels lead the SSC to recommend a continuation of the present 7,000 mt ABC for this species. The Council concurred with this recommendation and set the TAC at 7,000 for this species. The Council further recommended apportioning two-thirds of the Greenland turbot TAC (4,667 mt) to the eastern Bering Sea, and one-third of the TAC (2,333 mt) to the Aleutian Islands in proportion to the biomass estimates in these areas. The Council's recommendation will spread fishing effort over a larger area. Atka Mackerel The SSC accepted the Plan Team's 1994 estimate of ABC (245,000 mt), although it expressed concern that the time series of trawl surveys is short and inconsistent in coverage. The SSC also was apprehensive about possible environmental problems that may result from an increased catch of the magnitude implied by the Plan Team's estimate of 1994 ABC. Atka mackerel is a prey species of northern fur seals and Steller sea lions. During their migrations, northern fur seals (a depleted species) feed heavily on Atka mackerel as they move through the Aleutian passes. Given these concerns, the SSC recommended to continue its 1992 and 1993 policy to phase in the Plan Team's estimate of ABC over a 6-year period by adopting the 1993 biomass estimate (816,000 mt) and raising the exploitation rate in steps. These incremental steps are as follows: (M)(1)/6 in 1992, (M)(2)/6 in 1993, (M)(3)/6 in 1994, (M)(4)/6 in 1995, (M)(5)/6 in 1996 and M in 1997. According to this schedule, the recommended ABC for 1994 is (0.30/2)(816,000)=122,500 mt. The main purpose of this approach is to postpone a large ABC increase until new survey estimates are available to evaluate the phase-in policy. Amendment 28 to the BSAI FMP became effective August 11, 1993 (58 FR 37660, July 13, 1993). This amendment establishes three new management districts in the Aleutian Islands (AI) subarea (western, central, and eastern AI management districts) for the purpose of apportioning TAC of groundfish. The intent of this action is to improve TAC management, disperse fishing effort, and minimize the potential for undesirable effects of concentrated fishing effort. The Council recommended a 68,000 mt TAC for Atka mackerel in the BSAI in 1994. Based on the authority provided by Amendment 28, the Council recommended apportionment of the TAC for Atka mackerel among the AI management districts and the Bering Sea relative to survey biomass estimates: 10,000 mt in the western area; 44,525 mt in the central area; and 13,475 mt in the eastern area and Bering Sea combined. TAC Specifications The Council developed its TAC recommendations (Table 1) based on the final ABCs as adjusted for other biological and socioeconomic considerations, including maintaining the total TAC in the required OY range of 1.4&hyph;2.0 million mt. Each of the Council's recommended TACs for 1994 is equal to or less than the final 1994 ABC for each species category. Therefore, NMFS finds that the recommended TACs are consistent with the biological condition of groundfish stocks. The final ABCs, TACs, ITACs, overfishing levels and initial apportionments of groundfish in the BSAI area for 1994 are given in Table 1 of this action. The apportionment of pollock TACs among fisheries and seasons is discussed below. Apportionment of TAC As required by §§675.20(a)(3) and 675.20(a)(7)(i), each species' TAC initially is reduced by 15 percent. The sum of these 15 percent amounts is the reserve. The reserve is not designated by species or species group, and any amount of the reserve may be reapportioned to a target species or the ``other species'' category during the year, providing that such reapportionments do not result in overfishing. The initial TAC (ITAC) for each target species and the ``other species'' category at the beginning of the year, which is equal to 85 percent of TAC, is then apportioned between the domestic annual harvest (DAH) category and the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). Each DAH amount is further apportioned between two categories of U.S. fishing vessels. The domestic annual processing (DAP) category includes U.S. vessels that process their catch on board or deliver it to U.S. fish processors. The joint venture processing (JVP) category includes U.S. fishing vessels working in joint ventures with foreign processing vessels authorized to receive catches in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. In consultation with the Council, the initial amounts of DAP and JVP are determined by the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director). Consistent with the final notice of 1991&hyph;1993 initial specifications, the Council recommended that 1994 DAP specifications be set equal to TAC and that zero amounts of groundfish be allocated to JVP and TALFF. In making this recommendation, the Council considered the capacity of DAP harvesting and processing operations and anticipated that 1994 DAP operations will harvest the full TAC specified for each BSAI groundfish species category. Apportionment of the Pollock TAC to the Inshore and Offshore Components and to the Western Alaska Community Development Quota Regulations at §675.20(a)(2)(iii) require that the 1994 pollock ITAC specified for the BSAI be allocated 35 percent to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 65 percent to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component (Table 2). Definitions of these components are found at §675.2.
