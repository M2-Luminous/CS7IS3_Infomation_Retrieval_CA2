Although such summits rarely accomplished miracles, the leaders gathering in Naples, Italy, on July 8-10 are expected to reassure the world with promises of cooperation in dealing with currency market turmoil. The leaders of the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and Canada will also have a chance to underscore their commitment to implement the Uruguay Round agreement, observers said. The meeting comes at a time of cautious pride for the G-7 nations, when each of them has brought inflation at below three percent and some, like the U.S. and Canada, are enjoying robust economic growth. There are underlying concerns. The jobless rate in Western Europe is hovering at between 11 and 12 percent. Current account and trade imbalances are big worries for Washington. Japan's economy stays flat. "There is a law that tends to govern the summit process, the law of unintended crises. This time, clearly, is the difficulties of the dollar," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. The dollar hit a historic low last Tuesday, its worth less than 100 Japanese yen. Government interventions by major industrial nations, which own two thirds of the world gross national products, have largely failed. The Clinton administration, which stressed that it did not intend to use the dollar as an instrument to cut U.S. trade deficit, still has a long way to go to eliminate such concerns in the markets. While dumping the issue of dollar decline is impossible at the summit, the leaders have to walk a fine line between recognizing the importance of this issue and avoiding raising expectations too high, observers said. Summit participants are not central bankers. And if they cannot deliver, the markets, hoping high for breakthroughs on currencies and macroeconomic policies, will be disappointed and bring in new volatility. Although U.S. Federal Reserve is not considering intervention before things get worse, it can raise interest rates in coordination with the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan for market stability. Is it possible? "They'll talk about intervention, but I doubt that we'd see a coordinated interest rates changes coming out of this summit," said C. Michael Aho, senior international economist at Prudential Securities. While the Clinton administration still shows considerable interests in the reforms in Russia and other former Soviet Union republics, aid is clearly not a priority concern for the White House now. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is scheduled to attend the summit, will not see new big aid sums under discussion. Moscow was promised with 43.4 billion dollars of aid at last year's G-7 summit in Tokyo. Without U.S. leadership, noted Robert Legvoid, a political scientist at Columbia University, "I don't think other members of the G-7 know how to get their act together in terms of the industrialized West dealing with Russia." The meeting is also a follow-up to the G-7 jobs summit held in March in Detroit, Michigan, although until today, there is no money or deadlines attached to the jobs proportion of the summit agenda. "This was an overall rubric that had to do with macroeconomic stimulation, deregulation, renewed commitment to free trade," said Robert Stokes, director of the International Trade Project for the Council on Foreign Relations. The summit, the 20th of its kind since 1975, also provides the leaders, both the new and old faces, a chance to reflect on the summit process. It is a kick-off for Cairo's U.N. Conference on Population.
