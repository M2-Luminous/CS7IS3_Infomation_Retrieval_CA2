With its latest communique, the election organization considered the counting of votes cast by Liberal Party members in response to the "internal primary" carried out by the party during the parliamentary elections to be concluded. The primary was independent of the parliamentary elections and was made upon a request from the party's board of directors. Out of 2,562,694 votes counted, the 43-year-old Samper, a former ambassador to Spain, obtained 1,245,283. Humberto de la Calle, who was government minister until two years ago, concurring with the period when Samper was development minister, followed with 335,165 votes. Samper Pizano, one of the seven presidential hopefuls who participated in the "internal primary," will be officially proclaimed party candidate on Friday during the celebration of the party's national convention in Santa Fe de Bogota. In May the Liberal Party candidate will compete with 10 other candidates from the various political parties who want to replace President Cesar Gaviria as president of Colombia on 7 August for the 1994-1998 period. Polls show Samper and Andres Pastrana, of the Social Conservative Party, as the people's favorites. National Registrar Luis Camilo Osorio explained today that his office will not issue any more bulletins on the votes for the liberal candidates because he has much work to do with the final count of the votes for the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. During Sunday's elections, in addition to absenteeism of 70 percent, 14 percent of the votes were either void or blank. Osorio has attributed this to the cumbersome ballots that contained more than 5,300 names of candidates to the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liberal Party voting: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Votes |Percentage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ernesto Samper |1,245,283 |48.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Humberto De la Calle |335,165 |12.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carlos Lleras de la Fuen-|202,925 |7.85 | |te | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |David Turbay |172,096 |6.66 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Carlos Lemos Simmonds |129,283 |5.03 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rodolfo Gonzalez |72,573 |2.80 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gloria Gaitan |65,456 |2.53 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Blank votes |160,751 |6.22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Voided votes |198,472 |7.68 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |2,562,694 [as received] | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
