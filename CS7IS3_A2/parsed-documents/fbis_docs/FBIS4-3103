The measures have brought initial success. Economic development in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, has enjoyed a good start this year, as reflected by the economic figures of the first quarter. This information was released today by the foreign trade and economic cooperation committee of Guangzhou city. The new series of reforms in the tax system, foreign currency, banking and foreign trade introduced nationwide this year by the Chinese Government has allowed more margin for the development of Guangzhou, a city already boasting the most brisk and prosperous economic activities of the country. During the first quarter this year, 699 contracts for foreign investment were signed and actually-utilized overseas capital totalled 489 million U.S. dollars, with a growth of 80.8 percent over the same period last year. The city has earned 820 million U.S. dollars in exports during the first three months, up 23 percent over the same period in 1993. This has been stimulated by the abolition of the dual exchange rates and the previous rules that foreign currency earned had to be turned over to the government. To further expand exports, Guangzhou has set up three overseas enterprises and will establish commercial centers soon in New York, Sydney and Moscow. According to Wang Deye, director of the Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee, Guangzhou has further relaxed limits on some high-tech enterprises and old enterprises in urgent need of technological renovation in absorbing foreign funds. By the end of last month, projects involving overseas capital higher than five million U.S. dollars each had totalled 134, covering fields like industrial processing, transport, real estate, tourism and service industry. The number of countries and regions that have directly opened enterprises in Guangzhou increased from 12 to 19 in the first quarter as against the same period of last year. Investments in the city totalling more than 20 million U.S. dollars have come from each of the following: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Britain and the United States. Israel, Germany and Finland have also expressed intentions to invest or expand cooperation.
