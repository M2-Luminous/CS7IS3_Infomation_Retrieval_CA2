The chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [RSS], Mr Rajendra Singh, today justified the demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya and exhorted the Muslim leaders of the country to hand over the religious sites in Mathura and Varanasi "since it is not of the same importance for the Muslims as it is for the Hindus." He added that such an action would go a long way in restoring confidence of the Muslim community in the minds of the Hindus. He then went on to say, "We are all sons of the same soil and equal in all respects before the eyes of the law." Mr Singh was addressing his first RSS rally after being appointed the Sarsanghchalak. He laid the blame squarely on the Government for the demolition of the Babri Masjid since, he said, it had failed to find a solution to the problem. "No one else but the Government is responsible," he told the estimated 25,000 RSS volunteers, who had gathered at the Ramlia grounds on the occasion of the Varsha Pratiprada Utsav, the Hindu New Year Day. In his hour-long address, Mr Singh touched on a wide range of issues. On GATT: He charged the Government with what he called sacrificing the interests of the nation by deciding to sign the draft of the General Agreements on Tariff and Trade in Marrakesh on April 15. He said he wondered why the Government was keen on signing the treaty when India's share in the volume of international trade was a meagre 0.5 percent. On the contrary, it would be more advisable to sign bilateral treaties with trading nations, he said, since that would, by itself, raise the share of the country in world trade. He said that the Government was going ahead with its decision to sign the treaty when the external debt of the country was a staggering Rs 240,000 [rupees] crores as compared to Rs 17,000 crores in 1980. On Kashmir: Criticizing the recent moves by the Government to initiate the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Singh said that the Centre's efforts would be futile since the militants continued to hold sway in the Valley. On the N-issue: Regarding the question whether India should go nuclear, Mr Singh said that possessing nuclear weapons did not mean that India would launch a nuclear attack on any country. On politics: Without naming the Congress(I), he charged it with breaking up the Telugu Desam Party and the Janata Dal(A) to ensure that it secured a majority on the floor of the House. Speaking about corruption, he said that the Government was, itself, not setting a good example for the people to follow. "Otherwise, how could a minority Government attain a majority?" he said. Also present at the rally, were Ministers in the Delhi Government, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, Mr Lal Behari Tiwari, Mr Jagdish Mukhi, and leaders of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], Mr Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Mr Kedar Nath Sahni.
