Applied for the first time between 1988 and 1990 to force Washington's trade partners to open their markets to U.S. products, it proved its efficiency, particularly against Japan which, at the time, was already in Washington's line of sight. Recommended by congressional officials, its re-establishment through a presidential decree will please a U.S. public opinion that is sensitive to a measure which, according to Mr Clinton, will "create jobs" on the other side of the Atlantic. The escalation tactics that Washington decided to adopt toward Japan are nevertheless inopportune. They create an impasse in the very unequal state of health of the two principal economic powers of the world. The United States' strong growth stimulates imports, while Japan, faced with a recession unprecedented since the end of the war, is applying the brakes on imports. Part of the U.S. deficit ought to be ascribed to the present gap. It is also inopportune for President Clinton to take it out on a Japanese prime minister already seriously weakened domestically, especially at a time when the Japanese Government promises to open significantly the Japanese market to foreign competition, against the opinion of part of the administration. Japan is not alone in having to worry about U.S. actions. This is true also of Mexico and Canada, now linked to Washington by a free-trade agreement. It is equally true of the Europe of the Twelve. Beyond the fact that the Americans would sell more to Japan to the detriment of the European Union, it is the edifice that was laboriously constructed thanks to the GATT during the Uruguay Round negotiations that appears threatened. The EU [European Union] countries--and France more than others--have insisted on the major advance represented by the creation of a World Trade Organization to replace the GATT. Responsible for smoothing out future trade conflicts, this organization is supposed to mark the end of "bilateralism," and thus deprive the United States of the right to impose its law on less powerful partners. A month and a half away from the official signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round, the reestablishment of "Super 301" proves that Washington intends to preserve its full freedom of action.
