Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), said that workers and staff members, as "masters of the state and state-owned enterprises", are in charge of state property, and shoulder the responsibility of preserving its value. Yang was speaking at a national conference on trade unions held in this capital of north China's Hebei Province. "Unlike workers in Western countries," he said, "Chinese workers can participate in the democratic management of state-owned enterprises through the workers' congress system with Chinese characteristics." Yang said that workers' congresses have been set up in nearly all the state-owned enterprises, and the system is upheld in China's Constitution, the Enterprise Law, the Trade Union Law and the Corporate Law. Yang claimed that the economic efficiency of state enterprises can be raised through workers' democratic involvement. Of millions of proposals from the workers' congresses across the country every year, more than half concern production and business operations, according to the vice-chairman. However, he lamented, "in some areas, the democratic involvement mechanism has not been beefed up in line with the autonomy rights gained by enterprises." And the incidents of workers' rights being infringed upon by collectively owned enterprises are increasing, he noted. He urged all parties to explore new ways to strengthen the role of the workers' congresses in the transitional period. He stressed that state-owned enterprises, state-funded corporations and limited-liability companies funded by the state should improve their workers' congresses in accordance with the new Corporation Law and the Enterprise Law. The rights of the congresses should include participation in the policy-making process concerning the development, production and operation of the enterprises. The congresses should have the right to examine salaries and bonuses, check safety measures and working conditions, and supervise the business operations of top executives. Corporations should have workers' representatives on their boards of directors and boards of supervisors, Yang said. Workers should account for one third of the members of the boards of directors and one third to half of the members of the boards of supervisors, he said. Yang said foreign-funded enterprises should also make it a rule to let workers take part in their management, by establishing trade unions or labor-management committees.
