Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk said this at a meeting with journalists at the Market Reforms Press Club in Kiev. As far as political federalization is concerned, the president believes it is premature, although he does not rule out its introduction in future. Today, according to Leonid Kravchuk, this is unrealizable due to objective reasons, and could endanger Ukraine's independence and the progress of the economic reform. In addition, the president termed as dangerous the policy which the president of Crimea has been conducting of late. Leonid Kravchuk emphasized that not a single decree on economic issues has so far been issued by Yuryy Meshkov and no economic decisions have been made toward that end.
