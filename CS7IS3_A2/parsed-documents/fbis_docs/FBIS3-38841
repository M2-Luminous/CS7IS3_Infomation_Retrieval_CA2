"The moment the first raid takes place, it must be clear that the level of engagement for all UN peacekeepers stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina will change in nature," the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who declined to be identified, said. His comments came on the eve of a meeting in Brussels of NATO ambassadors who, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely to authorise use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive action following Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo in which 68 people died and about 200 were injured. The UNPROFOR officer said that for months, some 60 UN military observers and thousands of pictures taken by NATO planes have identified the precise position of Serb forces around the capital. He said the latest UNPROFOR figures show that the Serbs have about 300 artillery pieces within range of the capital, meaning 30 kilometres (18 miles), and most of the weapons are stationed southeast of Sarajevo. The figure includes cannon, which are in fixed positions, and mortars which can be moved around. The UNPROFOR officer said that even though NATO warplanes would be able to zero in on all of the big guns stationed around the Bosnian capital, it would be a different matter in terms of locating the mortars. "A mortar consists of a simple tube on a 60-kilogram (130-pound) metal plate and all you need is two men and a pickup truck," he said. "And in order to wipe out the mortars you would need tactical air support which means war, and our current mandate does not call for such action." He added that in addition to the mortars, the Serbs besieging the city also have multiple rocket launchers that are mobile and powerful. In terms of manpower, the Serbs are said to have about 15,000 soldiers stationed around Sarajevo, while the mainly Moslem Bosnian army has 13,000 troops with access to 150 artillery pieces. "Lifting a siege and using only air strikes is possible but one must destroy everything," the UNPROFOR officer said. "If we launch air strikes we can't give up afterwards because they will come back and recapture their positions." He said such strikes would also mean that the UN mandate in Bosnia would no longer be to provide humanitarian assistance but to reestablish peace. "The politicians must decide what they want," he said, adding that the latest threats to bomb the Serbs amounted to a lot of "gesturing." He pointed out that similar previous attempts to intimidate the Serbs were met with threats to retaliate against UN peacekeepers on the ground and to stop all humanitarian aid.
