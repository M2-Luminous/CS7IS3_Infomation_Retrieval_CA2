The two splinter groups in the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction have failed to resolve their leadership dispute. The Liberia Peace Council has been on the offensive against Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeast. And now the commander of the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, has come out with a strong complaint about how Taylor's forces have been behaving at the Firestone rubber plantation some 30 miles from the capital. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: General Hezekiah Bowen today threatened to turn Liberia into another Kigali if heavily armed NPFL fighters do not vacate Harbel and stop their attacks on AFL soldiers patrolling the area. Bowen told newsmen at his headquarters in Monrovia that fighters of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front, currently occupying certain strategic areas in and around Harbel, are constantly disarming AFL soldiers on assignment there. Bowen said the latest incidents of the NPFL troops moving into Harbel occurred last Friday [13 May] when an AFL sergeant was disarmed by 10 child soldiers from the NPFL. The child soldiers then seized their Firestone rubber plantation's company vehicle. Gen. Bowen said that some of the Firestone employees were undressed and kicked and had their personal effects taken away leaving them only in their underpants. According to Bowen, NPFL fighters told the Firestone workers that the company can only operate with the approval of Charles Taylor. If this situation is not properly addressed by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], said Bowen, the world should not be surprise to see the AFL bitterly engaging the NPFL in a battle that could turn Liberia into another Kigali. He claimed that the influx of NPFL troops in Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious risk to the AFL barracks at Schieffelin, as well as to Monrovia, and if they are not cleared from the area we, said Bowen, will go to war soon. Meanwhile, NPFL leader Charles Taylor said on Saturday [14 May] that he would no longer carry on disarming and handing in weapons to ECOMOG. They, he said, are not neutral. A Gbarnga Radio broadcast monitored here said that Taylor had accused Nigerian elements among the peacekeepers of gun running between the two ULIMO factions and the Liberian Peace Council which is battling with the NPFL for control of southeatern Liberia.
