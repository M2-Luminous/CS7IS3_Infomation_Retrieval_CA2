FR941021-2-00006 FR941021-2-00003 [A&hyph;351&hyph;605] Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice From Brazil; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation of Order in Part AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review and revocation in part. SUMMARY: On February 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil, and its intent to revoke the order in part (59 FR 5174). We have now completed this review and determined the margins for Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic to be zero or de minimis during the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992. We have also determined that Frutropic has met the requirements for revocation. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Lebowitz or Kelly Parkhill, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 5, 1987, the Department published in the Federal Register an antidumping duty order on FCOJ from Brazil (52 FR 16424). On May 31, 1992, pursuant to the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (57 FR 19412) of the order for the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992, Branco Peres, Citropectina, and Frutropic requested an administrative review. Accordingly, the Department initiated this administrative review on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212). On May 29, 1992, Frutropic submitted a timely request for revocation of the antidumping duty order, accompanied by the certification required by 19 CFR 353.25(b)(1). Frutropic did not submit an agreement to immediate reinstatement of the order under 19 CFR 353.25(a)(2)(iii). Frutropic claimed that it was not required to do so because Frutropic was not originally investigated and had never been found to have sold at less than foreign market value (FMV) in any administrative review. On February 3, 1994, the Department published the preliminary results of its administrative review and its intent to revoke the order in part (59 FR 51174). We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. No comments were received. In the preliminary results of this review, we erroneously stated that FMV periods of less than one month were used because distortions could result from the application of a monthly FMV due to hyperinflation. In fact, shorter periods were used to avoid distortions which would have been created through the use of a monthly FMV due to significant price fluctuations unrelated to hyperinflation. The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Review Imports covered by the administrative review are shipments of FCOJ from Brazil. The merchandise is currently classifiable under item 2009.11.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. Final Results of the Review The final results of our review are identical to those in the preliminary results of review: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/ Exporter 1Time period 1Margin (percent) Branco Peres 5/1/91&hyph;4/30/92 0.03 Citropectina 5/1/91&hyph;4/30/92 0 Frutropic 5/1/91&hyph;4/30/92 0
