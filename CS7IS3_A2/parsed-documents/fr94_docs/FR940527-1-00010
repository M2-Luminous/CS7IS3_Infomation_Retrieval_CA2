Special Analyses It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these proposed regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Comments and Request for a Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments that are timely submitted (preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying in their entirety. A public hearing will be scheduled and held upon written request by any person who timely submits written comments on the proposed rules. Notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in the Federal Register . Drafting Information The principal author of these proposed regulations is Joel S. Rutstein, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service.
