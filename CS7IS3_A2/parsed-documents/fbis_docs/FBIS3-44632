The procuratorial officers performing this mission were besieged for nine hours and were beaten, while eight police cars were smashed. At around 1700 on the afternoon of 5 November 1993, a team of 10 officers from Handan's Wuan People's Procuratorate in Hebei traveled in three police cars to Shahe, Xingtai to arrest the accused, Hao Benliang, according to law and to search his house. Hao Benliang was the deputy director and accountant of a private ore-dressing plant in Wuan's Shimen village. In doing business with Hao Xiangxian, a Shimen villager who was also director of the ore- dressing plant, Hao Beiliang's involvement in tax evasion was affirmed. Hao Xiangxian was arrested on 1 November, but Hao Benliang escaped. The officers of the Wuan People's Procuratorate searched Hao Benliang's house in accordance with legal procedures, finding some bills and 12,000 yuan in cash. At that moment, Hao Benliang's son threatened the officers with two knives. Hao's daughter tore up the bills and cash that had been discovered, which made it difficult for the search to proceed. The Wuan procuratorial officers decided to leave. Hao's wife, son, and daughter stopped them and smashed two police cars, which further caused a further deterioration in the situation. The procuratorial officers then decided to take Hao's wife to the office of the Wuan People's Procuratorate. At 1830, a police car and four policemen were besieged by villagers who were unaware of the truth. Hao Benliang's son pulled two policemen out of their car, beating, kicking, and handcuffing them. When the officers were taken to the courtyard of the village committee, Hao's son and son-in-law continued to beat the two officers until they broke their batons. At around 2300, the two officers were gagged and blindfolded, and were driven into the wilderness, where they were beaten for four hours, resulting in serious injuries. During this period, the leaders of the Wuan People's Procuratorate led more than 30 officers to the village in six police cars. The following announcement was made over loud speakers: "All villagers: Officers of the Wuan People's Procuratorate have come. Come out immediately!" At that moment, all the officers were besieged by hundreds of villagers. The head and political instructor of the village police station ordered that the road be blocked with a police car and with a bulldozer from a nearby ore- dressing plant. As he stopped the procuratorial officers, the six police cars were damaged. He aimed his pistol at the procuratorial officers and said: "All officers must get out and no one may leave!" The political commissar of the Shahe Public Security Bureau and a deputy chief of the city's procuratorate rushed to the scene. They decided to move the vehicles to the police station, which avoided further damages. To quell the incident as early as possible, Hao Benliang's wife was sent back to the village and the two detained officers were released, thanks to the proposals made by the Shahe Public Security Bureau and Procuratorate. It was already 0700 the next morning. The released officers were sent immediately to the Handan Hospital for treatment. Public opinion here paid close attention to this incident, believing that the practice of a defendant's relatives detaining and beating procuratorial officers, smashing cars, and inciting mass trouble constituted a serious crime of hindering a public mission, which had an adverse influence. In the struggle to sternly attack serious economic and other crime, it is absolutely necessary to seriously handle and punish people who are involved in inciting trouble.
