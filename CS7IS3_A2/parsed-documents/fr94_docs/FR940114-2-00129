FR940114-2-00129 FR940114-2-00078 Pursuant to the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 Feasibility of Catalytic Preheating Using Latent Heat Energy Storage Notice is hereby given that, on October 18, 1993, pursuant to section 6(a) of the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, 15 U.S.C. 4301 et seq. (``the Act''), the Southwest Research Institute (``SwRI'') has filed written notifications simultaneously with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing (1) the identities of the parties and (2) the nature and objective of the research project. The notifications were filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages under specified circumstances. Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Act, the identities of the parties are Daimler Benz, Stuttgart, Germany; Nissan Motor Company, Ltd., through Nissan Research and Development, Inc., Farmington, MI; and Nippon Shokubai, Hyogo, Japan. The objective of the research project is to investigate the feasibility of preheating on automotive exhaust catalytic converter using stored thermal exhaust energy through the evaluation of several reactor designs using various storage media such as packed beds and phase change materials, so as to define the medium's operating conditions; obtain and analyze potential media; design and evaluate a variety of storage beds; examine insulation and heat transfer aspects of the storage medium and container design; and outline a prototype system for implementation on a vehicle. Membership in the project remains open, and the parties intend to file additional written notification disclosing all changes in membership to the group research project. Joseph H. Widmar, Director of Operations, Antitrust Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;932 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;01&hyph;M
