Previous co-generation systems used waste heat to produce cold water for air coolers by employing a hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator, but in small-scale operations the temperature of the waste heat was so low that efficiency was poor for such a large piece of equipment. This new system not only takes up 30% less space than previous equipment from Tokyo Gas, but also costs about 10% less. Tokyo Gas will install the new system at its Energy Technology Research Institute in Minato-ku, Tokyo, and begin demonstration testing by August. In previous co-generation systems a hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator that used waste heat emerging from gas turbines and gas engines at 80-90�C was combined with a gas-powered absorption water-cooler in a two-tiered system for generating cool air. In the new system, the waste heat is recovered by the heat exchanger directly and inserted into the gas-powered absorption water-cooler cycle. The hot water in this cycle heats the refrigerant and produces cool air through the action of evaporation. Tokyo Gas says it was possible to improve the performance of the heat exchanger, and thus enable direct connection with the cooling water. Because the new heat exchanger is much smaller than the hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator, it is possible to make the whole system more compact. Normally, co-generation plants are installed in areas with limited space such as basements and rooftops, so making the unit more compact offers considerable advantages. In terms of cost, the new system offers almost no change in operating costs such as gas consumption, but the cost of the unit itself will be about 10% lower than before. Because the system has been simplified, maintenance costs are also expected to be lower. As far as the old systems are concerned, for a plant on the scale of 100 tons refrigeration, an additional investment of about ¥1 million to add the new heat exchanger will allow the hot-water-powered absorption refrigerator to be eliminated, just like in the new systems. Tokyo Gas has replaced the 50 tons refrigeration-class co-generation system at its Technology Research Institute with the new type, continued performance testing, and confirmed its stability. Therefore, Tokyo Gas plans to install a large demonstration system and attempt to bring performance to an even higher level. The system is expected to appear on the general market next spring.
