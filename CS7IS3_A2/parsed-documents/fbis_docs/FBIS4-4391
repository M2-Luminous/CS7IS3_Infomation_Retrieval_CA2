Security Council [UNSC]. Ziaur, speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, said Japan deserves "a more effective institutional role" in the U.N. system in general and in the Security Council in particular by virtue of its status as an Asian "economic superpower." The 48-year-old premier, one of only three women now serving as head of an Islamic country, said Bangladesh's support stems from its belief "that the leadership and positive posture of Japan are important for further strengthening the role of Asia in international relations." Ziaur earlier made a considerably stronger declaration of support at a dinner banquet hosted by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday, in which she told her host country, "We are totally behind you in your effort to be a permanent member of the Security Council." In summit talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, she was quoted as offering to drum up support for Japan's bid among other countries with which Bangladesh maintains close relations. Ziaur told reporters that ties between Bangladesh and Japan are "excellent." Expressing appreciation for Japanese assistance, she noted that it has so far been aimed at supporting democratic progress, economic reforms and social development. In an implicit request for continued aid, especially grants, she added, "We expect continued Japanese support for social sectors such as primary and mass education, primary health care, poverty alleviation and environmental development." Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for an official visit, is scheduled to return home via Osaka on Friday.
