The democratic Government of Lesotho announced today that an Independent Salary Review Commission would be established to review the salary structure of all civil servants. A government spokesman said that this recommendation was proposed during negotiations between the Lesotho Government ministerial delegation and representatives of the police force over the past few days. The work of the proposed salary review commission will be carried out by professionals from outside the country. Toward this end the government will request assistance from the international donor community to help in the identification of such specialists and their assignment to Lesotho to undertake the work as soon as it is appropriate. It is understood that the work of mounting such a commission was of such complexity and magnitude that it could take from three to six months to accomplish.

A government spokesman made the announcement this afternoon without giving reasons for the resignation. Mr. Moleleki's resignation from the cabinet was made while he lived outside the country.
