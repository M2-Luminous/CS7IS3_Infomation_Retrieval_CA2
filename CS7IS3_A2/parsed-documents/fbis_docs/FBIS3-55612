Were they the Massandra agreements, the START-I ratification with all its provisos, the adoption of Ukrainian foreign policy directions, or some aspects of negotiations? [Zlenko] I want to start by pointing out that Ukraine has been acknowledged by 145 nations of the world, and 132 have initiated diplomatic relations with us. This is very pleasant. This is a factor of great significance for the development of our state. With regard to dramatic events, all the issues that you mentioned had influenced the work of the Foreign Ministry in some way, as well as the life of the state in general. However, speaking of the most relevant problems that may impact on the future, I think these were nuclear issues, in particular, the discussion and ratification of START and the Lisbon Protocol. I would like to underline that right at this moment, when we are holding this interview, Ukraine is not in isolation. It enjoys normal relations with different nations of the world and this, too, gives me grounds to say that we will soon find a resolution for this difficult problem. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Andrey Kozyrev is another representative of a new generation of diplomats. You probably worked with his predecessors. Interesting situations something occur when this man says different things about Ukraine. [Zlenko] I pay attention to this, and I openly criticize Andrey Kozyrev in his and my retinue's presence. I openly speak out at forums trying to rebut [his statements] to a maximum extent. This, in particular, happened both in Brussels and Rome. Speaking of who is victorious in such disputes.... We have special relations with Russia; we are trying to treat Russia as a special partner. Of course, a large number of unresolved, complicated problems has piled up. We are trying to find ways to resolve them which determines the nature of our negotiations. One cannot say that these issues have been unresolved because Ukraine did not try hard or because the Russian side outwitted us. I think that the very fact that these problems still exist does no credit to either Ukraine or Russia. [Reporter] What are your relations with the current legislature? One sometimes gets the impression that the Supreme Council treats the Foreign Ministry as an office issuing documents for lawmakers' foreign trips. [Zlenko] I want to point out that in general, my relations with the current legislature are good. A lot of legislative acts drafted by the Foreign Ministry were approved by the Supreme Council. There were difficulties in lobbying the foreign policy concept but lawmakers finally passed it. I think that the majority of deputies have an understanding of today's foreign policy and the activities of the Foreign Ministry. Of course, there have been conflicts with some of the deputies, even overt attacks on me. But I have never descended to their level and held debates with them. I would like the next Supreme Council to be professional and manned with patriots of Ukraine with an understanding of the problems of foreign policy. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What was your and your team's main accomplishment in 1993 on the international arena? [Zlenko] I think that the first matter worth mentioning is the completion of the first stage of determining Ukraine's foreign policy. Second, we have managed to create the basis for developing international relations. Third, we have formed a diplomatic and consular infrastructure abroad. Finally, it is the very fact that we are now sitting in this new building with new people arriving. The process of expanding the Foreign Ministry is under way. However, the main issue for me is that during the difficult year of 1993 our people displayed courage, patience, and wisdom and that we have ended the year in peace and accord. There were no ethnic conflicts. Perhaps, the living standards have deteriorated but we have not stooped to grabbing arms to resolve ethnic or other problems. I believe that this was our main accomplishment in 1993.
