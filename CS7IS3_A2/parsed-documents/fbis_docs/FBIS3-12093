This replacement will probably be made easier following the end of the Cold War in Europe and the disarmament treaties signed in that continent, which means a large number of very good quality tanks are being sold at very low prices or even being given away. Like other National Defense branches, the Army is undergoing a modernization process that includes the replacement of its old armored vehicles, which currently do not surpass 300. Most of them are Sherman and M-41 tanks that were in use at the end of Second World War. Through agreements with other countries, our country has the necessary technology to co-manufacture artillery systems, trucks, short-range weapons, and rocket systems like the "Lightning." Asked about possible plans to replace Army hardware, General Augusto Pinochet, the Army commander in chief, replied that the Army neither comments on nor publicizes its acquisitions. "We do not display our things ... we would rather be discreet," he noted. It was leaked that a European nation may soon supply Chile with a fleet of medium-sized French AMX-30 or German Leopard-1 tanks in a number comparable to the Sherman tanks that are now in service. Meanwhile, the Army has decided that, until a deal is finalized, it will refurbish its oldest hardware. Brigadier General Luis Iracabal, the Famae [Army Ordnance] director general, has said there have been preliminary talks about replacing the tanks but there has not been "a real institutional need" to close any deals. He pointed out that "Famae has refurbished several tanks and jeeps, fitting them with anti-tank cannons with the help of the Army's War Material service." Gen. Iracabal said the only alternative for an Armed Forces without large resources at their disposal is to maintain their equipment in good condition. "We are now working at full speed on the manufacture of an armored personnel carrier -- the Mowak 8 x 8 -- since this project is behind schedule," he noted. Asked about the presence of Famae at the FIDAE [International Aerospace Fair] '94, Gen. Iracabal said Chilean Army's most important military manufacturer is exhibiting a new anti-aircraft system, which was entirely designed in Chile. The "Lynx" was developed in partnership with Linxtronic [not further identified] and consists of a defense radar mounted on a truck, which can be fitted with up to 16 different systems of anti-aircraft weapons, such as missiles and rapid-firing cannons, even of Russian origin. He explained that the system, which is totally computerized, can track anything at a distance of 40 km and aim the interconnected weapons at the target.
