It has been learned that all units in Guangdong, which carry out institutional reform this year, should promptly practice the civil service system in coordination with progress in institutional reform. According to the schedule, the provincial-level administrative organs should conduct experiments in the first half of this year and basically complete it in the first quarter of next year, and administrative organs at the city, county, township, and town levels should begin experiments in the second half of this year. The plan for reforming the wage system in Guangdong's state organs and nonprofit institutions is scheduled to be basically completed in the first half of this year. The present wage reform focuses on the establishment of a normal incremental wage system, with state organs and nonprofit institutions practicing different wage systems. State organs are to practice a post-rank wage system, which will be composed of four parts, i.e. post wage, rank wage, basic wage, and seniority wage. Nonprofit institutions are to practice five different kinds of wage system among specialized technical personnel. The first, covering educational, scientific research, public health, and other nonprofit institutions, is a specialized technical post-rank wage system; the second, covering geological, survey and drawing, marine, aquatic, and other nonprofit institutions, is a specialized technical post wage system; the third, covering cultural, art, and other performing organizations, is an art structure wage system; the fourth, covering athletes, is a sports allowance and bonus system; and the fifth, covering financial units, is a rank wage system. A staff post-rank wage system is to be practiced among the administrative personnel of nonprofit institutions. Wages in nonprofit institutions are divided into two parts, the fixed part and the active part. The former chiefly reflects the level of staff and the latter their actual work amount so as to encourage specialized technical personnel to concentrate their energy on doing their own jobs or tasks well.
