Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and Chinese president, and Li Peng, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and premier, today delivered important speeches at the meeting, which was presided over by member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. Jiang said that agriculture and the work in rural areas are very important to manage well the relations between reforms, development and stability in China. He noted that this year is an important year for China to set up the socialist market economic structure and to carry forward reforms in the sectors of finance, taxation, investment and foreign trade. He said that the smooth implementation of the reform measures depends on a sound economic environment and a stable social environment, especially on stability and development of agriculture and the rural economy. He noted that stability in rural areas and a strong agricultural base will ensure stability in the country, smooth reforms and continuous, rapid and healthy development. He pointed out that the general situation in rural areas is good, but there are some relatively urgent problems, including a decline in grain output in south China, two consecutive years of reduction of cotton production, remarkable rises in the prices of non-staple foods and slow growth of famers' incomes. Jiang stressed the importance of production and supply of grain, cotton, edible oil and vegetables. He said that China has 1.2 billion people and it must be self- reliant in grain production and supply. He urged all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities to make investigations and analysis of their grain production and supply, and to make an overall check on their grain storage. He said that the reform of the grain sale and purchase system should be deepened and macro control of the system be enhanced so as to ensure state control of necessary grain sources. He said it is an arduous yet important task to increase farm income with the development of agricultural production this year. He said that on the basis of raising grain and cotton output, measures should be taken to readjust industrial setups in rural areas, developing high-efficiency agriculture, a diversified economy and rural industry. On maintaining the stability of rural areas, he urged the leaders at various levels to make a timely disposal of problems concerning people's interests, including reducing farmers' burdens, dealing with various crimes, checking unhealthy tendencies in the party and in society, and aiding the development of poverty-stricken areas. On the question of enhancing the party's leadership over agriculture and rural work, he said that within the whole economic scheme, whether agriculture is given top priority is a big issue that concerns setting economic development at the core of all work. He said party committees and governments at various levels should correctly handle the relations between industry and agriculture, that is, under the precondition of sustained, steady growth of agriculture, they should establish the development scale and rate of growth of the national economy and proportionally arrange investment in the first, second and tertiary industries. He stressed that both central departments and local governments should continue to implement the policies and measures issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. He called on the leaders of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities to conduct investigations in the countryside and listen to people's opinions and suggestions and make arrangements for the work in agriculture and rural areas. Premier Li Peng urged the leading officials at various levels to take a sober-minded approach to rural work. He said that China has 900 million residents in rural areas and that it is the major factor in China's stability. He said that the production and supply of agricultural products has a direct bearing on the stability of prices. He called on leading officials to assure bumper harvest in agricultural production, especially in grain and cotton production. On the major tasks this year, Premier Li Peng called for ensuring the growing area for grain, cotton and vegetables. In northern China, the grain growing area should be on the increase; in southern China and coastal areas, the grain growing area should be extended by a large proportion. He also talked about other measures for rural work including raising purchase prices of grain and cotton to stimulate farmers' initiative; ensuring supply of farming production materials; carrying on reforms of the grain purchase system and setting up grain risk funds; popularizing science and technology in farming; state control of ample grain resources; improving of farming production conditions; increasing of investment into farming and promoting of the development of rural industry. He stressed that governors, chairmen and mayors should bear the responsibility for rural work, and the responsibility system must also be carried out with governments at various levels.
