The new titanium alloy is called a carbide-diffused, wear-resistant titanium alloy. It has titanium carbide as an additive, and the TiC forms fine crystals in the &bgr; matrix phase, which greatly increases wear resistance. One drawback of titanium alloys has been their poor wear resistance. With this new titanium alloy, however, Sumitomo hopes to extend their usage to automobile engine parts, sea water pump parts, sliding parts, etc. Therefore, Sumitomo will aggressively strive to develop new demands for this product. This new wear-resistant alloy developed by Sumitomo has titanium carbide added to the common titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, an alloy with 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium added to the titanium. When titanium carbide is added, the titanium alloy matrix changes from the &agr;-&bgr; phase to the &bgr; phase, which is tougher. In addition, the TiC is finely dispersed and forms a fine crystal structure, so the alloy not only has excellent strength, but also greatly increased wear resistance. In terms of wear resistance, Ti-6Al-V4 is not even worthy of comparison, for the wear resistance of the new alloy equals that of Stellite No. 6 (a nickel-chrome-cobalt alloy), an alloy with excellent properties. When we consider the mechanical properties as well, such as the fact that Stellite has poor ductility, it is clear that this new alloy can also be used as structural component. Titanium alloys are known for their high strength, light weight and excellent corrosion resistance, but they have drawbacks such as a Young's modulus only half that of steel materials, obviously poorer wear resistance, and poorer cutting properties. Therefore, countermeasures to overcome this poor wear resistance, such as forming a wear-resistant surface layer with molten molybdenum, have been tried. However, many problems remain to be solved such as the thickness of the overlay, and so there has been great demand for the development of a wear-resistant titanium alloy. Sumitomo Metal believes that SAT64AW will answer the demand for wear resistance, and plans to develop new applications for it such as automobile engine parts, solid cast titanium valves, etc. In terms of cutting properties, Sumitomo has also developed smooth-cutting titanium alloys by adding 0.2% nickel and 0.2-0.6% mesh metal to Ti-6Al-4V and to Ti-3Al-2.5V, which is an alloy with the lower amounts of 3% aluminum and 2.5% vanadium added to the titanium. Together with its wear-resistant alloy, Sumitomo hopes to expand use of these alloys to automobile engines and machine parts.
