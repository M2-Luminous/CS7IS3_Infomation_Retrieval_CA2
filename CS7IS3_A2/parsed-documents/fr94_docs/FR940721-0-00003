FR940721-0-00003 FR940721-0-00001 §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;04␣Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;8975. Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;19&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 214ST helicopters, with main rotor mast (mast), part number (P/N) 214&hyph;040&hyph;090&hyph;109 installed, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within 10 calendar days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish the following: (1) Create a component history card or an equivalent record for the affected mast. (2) Determine and record the total time-in-service (TIS) accumulated for the mast as follows: (i) If the TIS of the mast is unknown, use a TIS of 900 hours' per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. (ii) If the TIS is known, use that total TIS. (3) Determine and record the accumulated takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) for the mast as follows: (i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). (ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as total accumulated high-power events. (b) After compliance with paragraph (a) of this AD, continue to record the TIS and high-power events and add the high-power events to the previously recorded sum. (c) Remove the mast from further service in accordance with the following: (1) For each mast with 9,900 hours' or more total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast within the next 100 hours' TIS. (2) For each mast with less than 9,900 hours' total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast before it attains 10,000 hours' TIS. (3) For each mast with 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast on or before the accumulation of an additional 1,100 high-power events. (4) For each mast with less than 48,900 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast before it attains 50,000 high-power events. (d) This AD revises the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing a new retirement life for the mast of 10,000 hours' TIS, or 50,000 high-power events, whichever occurs first. However, for masts with 9,900 hours' or more TIS or 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, those masts need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS or 1,100 high-power events, respectively. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) This amendment becomes effective August 25, 1994. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on July 13, 1994. James D. Erickson, Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
