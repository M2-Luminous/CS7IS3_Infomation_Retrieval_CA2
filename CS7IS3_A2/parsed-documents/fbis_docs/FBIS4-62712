On 14 May, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers discussed a draft plan for NJSC stock placing. Enterprises, which belong to the Ukrainian oil and gas industry, are supposed to be amalgamated in NJSC as the latter's affiliates through contributing their stocks to its authorized fund. These enterprises constitute a special group, for which the President's decree specified certain conditions involving their transformation into joint-stock societies ("On holding companies, which are set up in the process of corporatization and privatization", of 11 May 1994). The Cabinet approved a decision to set up NJSC as early as 12 April 1994. However, its materialization will be possible only after the aggregate property, which belongs to the enterprises to be NJSC's stock-holders, has been evaluated. (For more details see UBN no. 14/1994). Tentative estimates appraise it at over $22 billion (in 1992's prices). However, it is subject to great variation depending on evaluation approaches and methods and the number of affiliate enterprises to undergo the merger. In the meantime, the decision on Ukrneftegaz's establishment has triggered ambivalent responses from the interested circles. Prior to making the decision, top-placed officers of the State Committee for Oil and Gas repeatedly urged NJSC establishment as a national agent, capable of speedily resolving the crucial problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to Russia for its fuels supplied to Ukraine, as well as of accumulating enough means, foreign investments included, to develop the oil and gas industry. They did not conceal the fact that the National Joint-Stock Company would be a monopolist structure. Since there were no other options, the holding company idea had to be accepted. Nonetheless, in view of Ukraine's very peculiar mode of denationalization, which, among other things, provides for the State's invariably controlling parcels of stocks in all the supposedly denationalized enterprises, the little trivial peccadillo of monopolism on the part of the State per se, may be overlooked. Since, as the State Committee for Oil and Gas maintains, the affiliate enterprises are supposed to retain relative independence on NJSC, they may well develop into the latter's competitors, in due time. Contrary to this upper echelon mood, the grass-roots sentiment tends to doubt NJSC's expediency as a unified and integrated structure. As managers of enterprises under the Ukrneft (Ukraine's Oil) and Ukrgaz (Ukraine's Gas) associations (substructures of the State Committee for Oil and Gas) maintain, NJSC will likely channel the thus pooled means to targets, other than the enterprises' development, which will reduce to naught the generally laudable concept of the industry's denationalization and individual enterprises' privatization, as well as badly compromise their stabilization chances. NJSC's inexpedience is further predicted on grounds, it will form yet another unnecessary administrative suprastructure among the none too few Ukraine's bureaucratic institutions. Such misgivings and apprehensions are not altogether groundless, since the Cabinet's thinkers are rumored to be very busily engaged in masterminding yet another ministry specifically to exercise control over NJSC (along the lines of Russia's Ministry for Power and Fuels). Presently, Ukraine's oil and gas industry has basically four levels of hierarchy: immediate producers, seven major pipe-line agencies, the Ukrgaz, Ukrneft, Ukrgazprom associations, and the State Committee for Oil and Gas on top of them. NJSC and probably the new ministry will likely make up as many as six levels. Such a restructuring mode will likely result in renaming the old structures and setting up new administrative bodies. As attentive observers maintain, it is hard to predict, which trend will prevail, since the two options are dictated by the involved parties' ambivalent and often clashing opinions, which make the resultant vector too dim and obscure.
