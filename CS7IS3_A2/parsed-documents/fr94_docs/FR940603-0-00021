FR940603-0-00021 FR940603-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Fiscal Service [Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No. 1&hyph;93] 31 CFR Part 356 Sale and Issue of Marketable Book-Entry Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds AGENCY: Bureau of the Public Debt, Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form an amendment to 31 CFR part 356, published as a final rule on January 5, 1993 (58 FR 412). 31 CFR part 356, also referred to as the uniform offering circular, sets out terms and conditions for the sale and issue by the Department to the public of marketable book-entry Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The amendment contained herein allows for Treasury securities awarded to a submitter that is a member of a clearing corporation to be delivered to an account of the clearing corporation at a depository institution, provided the securities are for the submitter's own account and certain agreements have been executed by the parties and filed with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank. Specifically, this change will enable a clearing corporation to net securities awarded at an auction to submitters that are its members with the when-issued and secondary market trades of such members in the same securities. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Don Hammond, Acting Director, Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt (202) 219&hyph;3632, or Margaret Marquette, Attorney-Adviser, Office of the Chief Counsel, Bureau of the Public Debt (202) 219&hyph;3320. (TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 219&hyph;9274.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Analysis Clearing corporations play an increasingly important role in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. To date, clearing corporation involvement in the clearance and settlement of Treasury securities has been limited to the secondary market. The Department believes that including Treasury auction purchases in a multilateral netting system operated by a clearing agency registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') can be beneficial to the efficiency of the government securities market. For example, with respect to the book-entry system for Treasury securities, it can reduce the number of securities transfers. In addition, it can enable the clearing agency to improve its risk management by providing a more complete picture of its members' positions. This amendment to the uniform offering circular specifies the conditions under which Federal Reserve Banks may deliver to an account of a clearing corporation at a depository institution securities awarded at auction to submitters that are members of the clearing corporation. The amendment permits only securities awarded to a submitter for its own account to be delivered through a clearing corporation. To qualify as a clearing corporation for purposes of this rule, an entity must be registered with the SEC as a clearing agency. Currently, the only SEC-registered clearing agency that nets trades in Treasury securities is the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC''). GSCC has proposed to net GSCC netting member auction awards of Treasury securities against their when-issued and secondary market trades in the same securities. On March 10, 1994, the SEC published the GSCC's proposed rule amendments necessary to implement the netting of the proprietary auction awards of its members (59 FR 11345). The SEC comment period ended on March 31, 1994. This rule amends §§356.2, 356.11, 356.16, and 356.24 of the uniform offering circular. Specifically, in §356.2, the definition of the term ``autocharge agreement'' has been expanded to allow for an autocharge between a clearing corporation and a depository institution. In addition, the term ``clearing corporation'' is defined as a clearing agency, as defined by §3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that is registered with the SEC. The term ``delivery and payment agreement'' has also been added to the definitions in §356.2. This term refers to an agreement between a submitter and a clearing corporation authorizing a Federal Reserve Bank to deliver securities awarded to a submitter to, and accept payment from, a depository institution for the clearing corporation. This new agreement is needed to authorize the delivery of securities to a clearing corporation's account rather than to the submitter's account. Any existing autocharge agreements between a submitter and a depository institution will continue to govern delivery and payment for submitters not taking delivery through a clearing corporation. In addition, any existing autocharge agreements will continue to govern the delivery of and payment for securities awarded to customers. New paragraph 356.11(b)(2) makes clear that for competitive bids submitted in paper form, a submitter that is a clearing corporation member and is submitting bids for its own account and for customers must submit a separate tender for each specific delivery instruction. This requirement also applies to any other submitter instructing delivery of awarded securities to more than one account.
