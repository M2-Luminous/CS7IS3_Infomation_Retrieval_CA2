This evening Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said there would be no negotiations. [Begin Mendieta recording] I would like to point out that Mr. Luis Ignacio Montiel, from Comalapa, Chontales, 37, was never a member of the RN as he claims. He participated in highway occupations in 1990 and, subsequently, was involved in considerable criminal activities. He was arrested for a murder in Nueva Guinea Department. According to his record, in 1980 he was charged with the murder of an Agriculture Ministry employee, and in 1991 he again participated in highway occupations and other acts of protest against the government. Mr. [indistinct] Madariaga, 36, a former member of the National Guard and a former member of the [word indistinct], was discharged in December of the same year [as heard] and reenlisted in the National Guard in January 1979. He subsequently left the country and returned after the 1990 elections. I have sufficient evidence to assert that there have been ties between these individuals and followers of Charrito and Northiel. Over the past week the two sectors even held conversations. [end recording] The government minister also asserted that today's actions are linked to actions by Northiel and Charrito in northern Nicaragua. These actions, he said, are financed by Quinonez and other members of the former RN. [Begin Mendieta recording] If Mr. Quinonez' involvement in today's incidents is clearly proven, and, if after today's meeting such ties are clearly established, Mr. Quinonez will be arrested. [end recording] The government minister did not dismiss the possibility that the occupiers of the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS headquarters may be dislodged this evening. [Begin Mendieta recording] I have asked the Colombian ambassador, through the Foreign Ministry, to authorize the police to dislodge them, and we are awaiting Colombia's answer. We are making the same request of the CIAV-OAS to immediately dislodge the occupiers. [end recording]
