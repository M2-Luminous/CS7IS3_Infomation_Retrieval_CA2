Reform heretofore can be roughly divided into two stages. In its first stage, i.e., from 1978 to 1991, reform was carried out in rural areas first, and afterward in urban areas; in the domain of distribution, and then in that of production; in enterprise management structure, and then in ownership structure; in commodity price adjustment, and then in their relaxation; and in consumer goods markets, and then in capital markets. This was a progressive pattern of reform in order of priorities, which was a path in keeping with China's actual conditions, and in particular, with the structure and development background at the initial stage of reform. Hence, the reform attained success, made momentous advances, and gave impetus to the change of the entire economic structure from a planned economy to a socialist market economy. Although reform at the first stage could not be referred to simplistically as having forged ahead in single items and penetrated in depth by isolated forces, yet reform indeed had not been carried out in a comprehensive way. As a selected strategy, reform was guided by the principle of decentralizing power and granting benefits to lower levels so that it could make steady advances. As the ultimate goal of transforming the entire structure was not clear at the beginning, however, reform could be carried out only one step after another, just like "feeling the stones in order to wade across the river," so that inevitably it was restricted in breadth, as well as in depth. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his south China tour in early 1992, as well as the 14th National Party Congress, oriented the transformation of the entire economic structure toward the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, which brought the reform theory as a policy guide to a new height. With the distinct orientation of reform goal, there came a juncture, at which we entered a new stage of economic reform, and conditions are ripe for reform to select a strategy of changing from gradual to accelerated progress, from a partial to an overall scale, and from tentative experiments to comprehensive planning. Accelerated and coordinated reform, however, call for even more careful consideration and preparations. Reform in 1993 was conducted against precisely this background. Judging from the high plane of reform strategy, 1993 was a year in which reform was pushed forward and the move to a new stage was effected. It also was a year in which theory was systemized and plans were worked out for the upcoming comprehensive, coordinated reform. In the meantime, some reform measures in conformity with market economy development were introduced at a new level during the year. As reform at this new stage has a higher degree of comprehensiveness and continuity, we must not demand that prominent results be scored in a certain single year, but must base ourselves on an overall and long-term assessment. What is more, the problems existing in the course of economic operation at present stem primarily from the frictions of the double-track system, which was the inevitable result of the deep-rooted conflicts of the old structure in the transition from the commodity economy to the market economy. Although the "intensified macroeconomic regulation and control" measures taken in the summer and fall of 1993, and the parameter regulation mechanism [canshu tiaojie jizhi 0639 2422 6148 4634 2623 0455] introduced in parallel with them could not completely break away from the regulative mode of the traditional planned economy, yet the practice of flexibly applying "fine tuning" and intensifying the pivotal macromanagement role of finance -- particularly banking -- definitely has seized hold of the basic elements of macroeconomic regulative mechanism to converge with the market economy. Certainly, in face of current problems, we should analyze their prominent causes and discover ways to solve them. To accelerate the pace of reform in the new stage, and particularly in 1994, we should put forward pragmatic countermeasures. These are the obligations and duties of all economists, and are the basic starting points of this research paper. Reform Achievements Attained During the Juncture In 1993, the central authorities concentrated forces from various quarters on the design of a blueprint for comprehensive reform, and put forward coordinated reform plans starting from five areas: Finance, taxation, investment, enterprises, and social insurance. This was a tremendous achievement, as it defined the action items for reform in the new stage, after having summarized the economic reform experience over the past 15 years. Without doubt, since 1984, whenever a more broad scale reform measure has been introduced, a program has been worked out, but this program has been either a rough outline or the sudden advance of a single item, and has not called for comprehensive coordination in accordance with the market economy. The reform program made in 1993, however, was a major coordinated one, based on the market, which made proper preparations for comprehensive structural reform in the second stage. In the sequence of the reform process, the substance and intensity of reform cannot be even or with equal value, so they may be large one year and small another. Generally speaking, in a year when reform has less content, we will have our eyes on the rectification of economic order and the solution of new contradictions that have become conspicuous so as to create a fine environment for reform in the next step. The 1989-91 campaign to "improve economic environment and rectify economic order," and the "macroeconomic regulation and control" exercised from July to October 1993 all belonged to this category. The previous retrenchment of the economy, however, while a comprehensive one, had an excessively large intensity and lasted for an excessively long time. Moreover, it depended mainly on administrative fiats to reduce projects, cut investments, and control the growth of demand with targets set at a low pace in order to achieve a man-made "equilibrium of demand and supply." As a result, the market was sluggish for two and a half years, which was an aftermath of the three-year economic improvement and rectification. In addition, when a favorable environment for reform emerged, we failed to seize the opportunity to increase the content of reform, thus missing an excellent chance to bring about the move from the first stage to the second at the earliest possible date. In contrast with the former economic retrenchment, the one in 1993 was not comprehensive. It lasted for only some six months, and its intensity was comparatively less. Moreover, traditional target controls were replaced by parametric controls. On the one hand, we regulated residents' and enterprises' action on money by flexibly readjusting exchange rates so as to stabilize them and ensure the renminbi's reputation and position. In particular, the exchange-rate unification efforts have provided experience and lessons for the monetary reform which certainly will be carried out in the future. On the other hand, although interest rates were readjusted by a narrower margin, the move basically halted over-expanded investment, promoted residents' inclination to save, curbed overly dynamic consumption, stabilized the market, and acted to bring about a "soft landing." Without doubt, this parametric control was achieved through the government's direct intervention, which is still a certain distance away from the parametric management of a developed market economy. The problem is that under a structure in which banks are not separate from the government, "independence of banks" and "commercialization of specialized banks" are only theories and not realities, the central bank does not possess independent and stable economic functions and power, and "bank presidents take orders from government officials," nothing can be accomplished in macroeconomic regulation and control without direct government intervention. In the transition from the traditional planned economy to a socialist market economy and from direct control to indirect regulation and control, more often than not there are circumstances in which people have no way of talking about the new structure and cannot help but draw support from the old one. Here, the self-innovation of the old structure is meaningful because it provides suitable space for the gradual growth of the new structure. The macroeconomic regulation and control during the summer and fall of 1993 was an example. As for the cooling down of the property market, its principal target was to restrict the development of the "bubble economy" and to avoid having already- tight funds flow into real estate in excessive amounts, lest the bottleneck constraints in basic industries -- including transport, communications, and so on -- be aggravated. Moreover, most of the funds presently used in stock and property speculation are public funds, so if this a practice is not controlled before the establishment of a new structure, people can hardly bear to imagine the consequences of the total explosion of accumulated contradictions. Meanwhile, it is very difficult to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development as well. The operation of economic policies in 1993 can be summarized as "grasping with two hands simultaneously." On one hand, we grasped macroeconomic regulation and control so as to avoid economic decline and maintain a high growth rate while reigning in the excessively heated economy. On the other, we grasped system innovation so as to accelerate the pace of national economic operation and market regulative mechanisms, while drawing up plans for comprehensive reform. Apart from these achievements, remarkable advances made by reform in 1993 also were manifested in the following aspects: 1. Tackling the key points of price reform. Tremendous achievements in price reform had been attained during the first 13 years of reform in China. By 1992, the proportions of prices fixed by the market in agricultural and sideline products, in the total retail sales volume of social commodities, and in means of production were 78.5, 79.6, and 64.2 percent, respectively. The shares of goods value regulated by the market in agricultural and sideline products and consumer goods were 77.8 and 83.4 percent, respectively, of which industrial consumer goods were 78.1 percent, and means of production were 61.8 percent. In 1993, the prices of grain and other items regarded as having a bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood were totally freed and were fixed chiefly by the market. Grain coupons were abolished entirely, and the original practice of rationing was replaced by free purchases in markets. Although grain trading between peasants and the state, and the fixing of commodity prices had to be conducted with government participation, yet this participation had to act according to the laws governing supply and demand. Under conditions in which the grain supply was relatively sufficient, a buyer's market emerged with regard to certain commodities, the proportion of expenditure in grain consumption dropped, and price rises caused by the lifting of price controls did not exert a considerable pressure and impact on residents' lives. So this move to cast away traditional concepts and lift controls over grain distribution and prices was a timely and successful one, thus adding new experience to the "endeavor to win opportunities for reform." The change from grain-rationing to market regulation and the fixing of prices on the basis of supply and demand shows that China has tackled the price-reform problem. This has strengthened our confidence in pushing forward the reforms in rent and commercialized residential housing. 2. Placing the establishment of a modern enterprise system on the agenda. The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a basic item of the reform package program. It has broadened the field of vision for enterprise reform, for it shows that in-depth enterprise reform does not involve the mere delegation of management rights to lower levels and the explicit definition of property rights, but is a combination of the two. Therefore, we must select and rebuild an operational mechanism for enterprises in light of the requirements of fair competition and optimum efficiency. There are two basic meanings in this: 1) In speeding up the transformation of mechanisms in state-owned enterprises, the questions of whether we should take the road of practicing a company system in these enterprises, and of how many such enterprises should be run by local people, how many formed into joint-stock companies, and how many should remain unitary state-owned and community-run enterprises, cannot be decided artificially by prestipulated targets, but must be determined in accordance with the requirements of market development. 2) The operational mechanism should be applicable to all sorts of enterprises -- including state-owned, collective, and private enterprises -- and in order to provide conditions for equal competition for all enterprises, it is necessary to practice a unified tax system, and to allow funds and labor to flow freely. 3. The initial progress in the establishment of production factor markets. Taking the establishment of a modern enterprise system as a basic task of microscopic reform, people logically put forward the issue of building factor markets. In 1993, the financing channels in China tended to become diversified, the volume of free trade in money markets increased to some extent, and in foreign exchange swap markets, in particular, the government reduced restrictions on quotas and widened the range for automatic regulation of market supply and demand. Under the dangerous situation of uncommon depreciation of the yuan, instead of artificially restricting its exchange rate, we raised interest rates on one hand, while on the other, we sold government gold and foreign exchange reserves in large quantities to narrow the supply-and-demand gap in foreign exchange. In addition, we changed the methods by which residents and enterprises anticipated currency value fluctuations so as to stabilize money markets. By so doing, we not only avoided posting obstacles for future in-depth monetary reform, but demonstrated the possibility and feasibility of establishing a unified exchange rate system in China. In a country like China which has an almost unlimited supply of labor, the growth of labor markets, and particularly the formation of labor markets in the state-owned economic sphere, will be a major reform project. In 1993, initial progress was made in two aspects with regard to the growth of labor markets in the state-owned economy: 1) Internal labor markets came into being, and the practice of "one factory, two systems" regarding arrangements for positions increased the flexibility of capital and labor reorganization in enterprises; 2) Second-occupation markets took shape which smashed the previous convention that labor was not allowed to flow between state and nonstate enterprises. 4. The accelerated development of the private economy. Another major reform achievement in 1993 was the accelerated development of the private and individual economies with the following characteristics: 1) The number of newly registered units grew rapidly. Taking the first quarter of 1993 as an example, on the basis of 15.53 million individual industrial and commercial units having been registered across the country in 1992, a total of 153,000 units was newly added, representing an increase of 10 percent or so. In Shanghai, the net increase in the first half of last year reached 2,000 units, with an average of 10 units going into operation each day, and in Dalian, the registered units in the first half of 1993 came to 1,284, a growth of 540 percent. 2) Private sectors held stocks in state-owned enterprises, which was particularly conspicuous in rural areas and the southeastern coastal region. In the city of Huzhou, in Zhejiang Province, all the 34 state-owned or town-and-township collectively owned silk industry enterprises succeeded in operating as joint ventures, with individuals holding 60 to 80 percent of the shares. At present, individual and private owners are trying to gain access to large cities, as well as to state-owned and collective economies with a promising development momentum. Although this was not brought about by the obvious introduction of reform measures, and although -- in a certain sense -- they can be regarded as "spontaneous reform," yet they are closely related to the government's policy on the relaxation of the ownership structure. 5. Initial achievements in reform of the social insurance system. Since the beginning of the 1990's, the nationwide reforms in the areas of medical care, housing, retirement, and provision for old age have been placed in an important position. However, it was not until the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his south China tour that the reform process was expedited, and 1993 was the year in which these reforms were noticeably precipitated. Take the reform in publicly owned residential premises as an example. The method of "walking on two legs," which meant "raising rents while making allowances" or selling at preferential prices, was employed in various localities. In the practice of raising rents while making allowances, the aim was achieved in either one or three steps. Although rents and sales prices were generally on the low side and a relatively great difference existed between them and market prices, so that consideration of thoroughgoing reform measures was necessary, yet it was very important to take the first step. Similarly, it was unrealistic to reform the welfare system at one go. In addition to the efforts made in 1993, other reform actions also were taken in the areas of government administrative bodies, security of tax distribution, enterprise external environment, and so on. However, reforms in these areas generally did not extricate themselves from the framework of the traditional planned economy. Judging from the requirements for the overall growth of a new economic structure, they obviously lagged behind, which was precisely the essential root cause of conflicts and problems existing in the current dual-track system. The Background of the New Structure: Contradictions and Difficulties Reform has entered a new stage. Previously, it was advancing on a superficial level, at a low speed, and by partial coordination; now it is advancing on a profound level, with a higher speed, and by overall coordination. Hence, reform cannot be plain sailing, and will be confronted with a number of contradictions and difficulties. If we say that what reform faced in the 1980's was the unitary structure of the traditional planned economy, under which all neglected things waited to be done and people longed for change so that something could be accomplished, even though reform was being conducted on a superficial level, then in the 1990's, when reform is faced with the frictions caused by the dual-track system, it is even more difficult to carry out reform in an overall and coordinated way and to make further advances on a profound level. Moreover, reform in the areas of property right structure, reorganization of employment, the transformation from welfare on ration to welfare entirely on the basis of the market, a remolded financial system of competitive banks, the rebuilding of government functions in line with the requirements of a market economy, and so on -- which are the primary tasks for reform at the new stage -- may be confronted with challenges from vested interests in various quarters, so that there probably will be new contradictions and difficulties in the economic reality and reform process. First, although the transformation of operational mechanisms in enterprises--particularly in state-owned enterprises -- was proposed several years ago, and the establishment of a modern enterprise system was put forward in 1993, it was very difficult to effect a fundamental breakthrough in reality. A few years ago, quite a few people were accustomed to attributing this to our failing to emancipate our minds and to our outmoded theoretical understanding, but in fact the issue is not as simple as that. If we say that before the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee there really was a task of breaking down traditional concepts on the reform of state-owned property rights, then since the ideas of "explicitly defining property rights" and accelerating property rights reform were written in the plenum's "Decisions," people have acquired common understanding now. So will the transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system be achieved because of this? No, they will not. The transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system mean accelerating the reorganization of employment, which definitely calls for staff reductions, so that quite a number of the existing staff and workers will face reductions in force. Once the command [jun ling zhuang 6511 0109 3692] to develop a market economy and foster fair competition is issued, it is necessary to establish and promote a labor market without hesitation. As a result of emphasizing efficiency and competition, unemployment is inevitable. This was why we proposed the tentative idea of "setting up job markets while bringing unemployment into the open" when we were drawing up the 1987-88 reform program. It is inconceivable to practice a market economy without unemployment and without labor markets. As far as state-owned enterprises are concerned, the difficulty in putting this idea into effect does not lie in the fact that workers cannot adapt themselves to such a concept, but in the lack of a suitable external environment. Under the present circumstances in which publicly owned residences, pensions, price allowances, various subsidies, and health insurance premiums all are handled by work units, and in which the system of government unemployment relief has not been set up, if large numbers of staff are laid off and pushed into society, how can they get along without wages, residences, and other material benefits? Among the current 150 million staff and workers, there are 110 million working in state-owned enterprises, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total. Even if one-tenth of them are laid off, these will number more than 10 million, and calculated with a dependency coefficient of 1.72, this means that more than 27.2 million people may be empty-handed and homeless. Moreover, there now are some 100 million surplus rural laborers in China who have to be transferred to work in nonagricultural sectors. An average of 13 million among the population reach working age and join the ranks of laborers every year, and there are 10 to 30 million people who may be laid off from collective enterprises. These people will constitute enormous competitive pressure on the surplus laborers in state-owned units in their efforts toward re-employment. It is necessary to resolve the problem of personnel in state-owned units who have job titles but actually have no work to do, through the mechanisms of bankruptcy, the survival of the strong and the elimination of the weak, while simultaneously overcoming the difficulty of the surplus personnel available for reemployment and ensuring the lives of their families. These are the knotty problems of reform for the next two years, and also the major contradictions and difficulties reform will face throughout the second stage. In addition, the 15 years of reform basically have smashed the excessively concentrated centralization system of the past, and by delegating power to enterprises and local governments, some of the central government's controlling power has been shifted to markets and local governments. However, the phenomenon of local governments having excessive power also exists. At present, there are three problems in the actions of local governments: 1) Turning back regulation [ni xiang tiao jie 6627 0686 6148 4634] by higher authorities; 2) directly intervening in lower authorities; and 3) blockading neighboring localities. The aim of all this is to safeguard their local interests. Proceeding from the requirements for developing a socialist market economy, China must establish a unified market and maintain fair competition among various localities, so that enterprises will be able to free themselves from the administrative control of the central government, as well as direct intervention by local governments, whereas governments at all levels may act only as providers of services, and their actions -- particularly those of local governments -- can be regulated by markets, just like all microeconomic main bodies. There is still a very long way to go, judging from the present situation. Local governments' turning away regulation by the higher levels and their actions against control are manifested chiefly in the economic readjustment period. Every time the central policies regarding structure or total supply and demand were not put into effect, the cause did not rest primarily with enterprises, but with local governments because when the central authorities intended to reduce speed appropriately and rein in the heated economy, the localities where the economy was already excessively heated would comply publicly, but oppose privately. Even though the statistics in their reports showed that they had slowed the pace, in fact they still persisted in resolving the local employment problem at a high speed and in raising their development level. In the area of readjusting structure, despite the central authorities' repeated emphasis on accelerating the development of transport, communications, and other bottleneck industries by cooling down the growth of the manufacturing industry, local governments usually defied central instructions and put their manpower, material, and financial resources into the manufacturing industry because of the high added value and enormous profits in this industry and the long cycle of basic industries. Consequently, structural readjustment was always unsatisfactory, and the obstacles to readjustment of the structure and of total supply and demand did not rest with enterprises, but with local governments. Local governments' direct intervention in the affairs of lower levels is increasingly intense, along with the expansion of the scope of reform through the delegation of power to lower levels and permission for them to retain some profits. The main objects of their invention are enterprises, banks, and peasants. They all complain of the numerous kinds of apportionments for manpower, money, articles, and charges, and of the "great numbers of mothers- in-law." In fact, this was done mostly by local government organs at various levels. Direct intervention in the main bodies of the market -- banks, in particular -- seriously hindered the normal growth of a market economy. Local protectionism or regional economic blockades not only led to redundant construction and identical choices of products and techniques among localities, but also hampered the formation of a nationwide unified market. The non-market behaviors of local governments toward the higher, lower, and lateral authorities have become the principal contradiction in economic operations and reform at present. Owing to the considerable power and great economic strength in the hands of local governments, the complicated circumstances of uneven economic conditions and interests, and the lack of appropriate regulations to restrain the conduct of local governments following the reduction of central power, the transformation of functions of local governments will become a tough problem in the new stage. The pure revenue-sharing system can only solve the tax distribution between the central and local governments, but cannot achieve the aim of redefining the functions of local governments in line with the requirements of a market economy. Second, there is the problem that reform of the banking system has lagged behind. After 15 years of reform, China has begun the diversified development of its financing channels. Apart from the channels of taking deposits and extending credits, there are other forms of fund-raising, such as government or enterprise bonds, stocks, and so on. The distribution of funds, however, is still considerably affected by the supply system, and in a certain sense, funds have more market factors in "external circulation" than in the "internal circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more non-market factors can be attributed primarily to the integration of banks with the government. The People's Bank of China is not an independent and unified body with the right to issue currency because it cannot make independent decisions concerning money supply and price regulation, and is controlled by the administrative officials of the central government. Moreover, the placement of loans by various specialized banks, particularly by their branches, is restrained by local governments, so that they are subordinated to local administrative officials rather than to the market. Meanwhile, banks continue to maintain state monopoly, reject the mechanism of eliminating the weak, and lack competition, so that internal circulation funds are controlled too rigidly, the direction of their utilization is unreasonable, and their efficiency is very low. Under market economy conditions, banking is the axis of national economic activities, banks are regulating centers, and interest rates are determined by market supply and demand. In China, however, banking, banks, and interest rates currently remain under the direct manipulation of the government. Changing this pattern and molding a new, independent, diversified, competitive, and effective banking system naturally has become the third theme and tough problem in the new stage of reform. The crux here also lies in the solution of contradictions between governments and enterprises and between the central and local governments in terms of interests and power distribution. The Key Selections in the Process of Expediting Market Growth In the past 15 years, an outstanding achievement attained by China in transforming economic mechanisms is the establishment of a competitive price system, which represents a change from the previous practice of fixing prices in a planned, unitary way to one of prices being fixed by the market under the guidance of the government. The focal point of reform in 1994 and of the entire new stage is the transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises. Focusing on this point, reform will be carried out and breakthroughs made in the following aspects: 1.The establishment of a modern enterprise system. The main battlefield of economic reform in 1994 and the next period is the state-owned enterprise, and the transformation from the existing state-owned enterprise structure to a modern enterprise system. To this end, it is necessary to achieve system innovation both within state-owned enterprises and without. The theme of internal reform remains the change of property rights, while that of external reform includes the following three basic aspects: The welfare structure, government functions, and the banking structure. In the transformation of the state-owned property rights management mechanism, the loudest voice from theoretical circles is the establishment of limited-liability companies and joint-stock limited companies. It seems that this is an inevitable move for the establishment of modern enterprise and market systems. There is a wide range of choices for practicing a joint-stock system. The numbers of shares can be great or small, according to the size of the companies, and both organizations representing state interests and residents are free to join or to buy stocks. This organizational pattern for property rights can go beyond a village, city, region, or country, and so is conducive to the circulation, concentration, and breakdown of funds. However, in light of the current huge scale of state-owned assets and property rights, it may not be practicable to set up purely joint-stock limited companies, so we must consider a wider variety of choices. Apart from developing joint-stock limited companies, we also should develop other appropriate organizational patterns, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, and should carry out the change into these types of companies through auctions, leases, contracts, sales, and so on. In the course of reorganizing property rights, without doubt, it is necessary to assimilate the "company culture" of European and U.S. enterprises, while preserving the "individual and family culture" retained by China itself. The economic prosperity of the Chinese communities in Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia has proven that the latter also can be combined ingeniously with the modern market economy. To develop these two types of property rights organizational patterns, we can sell small state-owned enterprises to individuals or families, or sell some factory branches to them and allow them free choice of organizational pattern. While reforming the enterprise system, no matter what methods we adopt, we must strictly reappraise the properties, funds, and assets of enterprises so as to avoid the loss of state-owned assets. Enterprise reform must be carried out both internally and externally. A few years ago, no prominent results were achieved in the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. This was due primarily to the lack of a good external environment. Those that should have gone bankrupt and been eliminated failed to do so, and the surplus personnel who should have been reduced still held onto their posts. This was due to the difficulties in re-employment and the immobility of a welfare system based on the work unit, so that the dismissal of staff and workers meant the loss of various material benefits provided by the units, including residential quarters, medical care, pensions, and others. As the first step toward accelerating the transformation of enterprise mechanisms in the next few years, we must accelerate welfare distribution on a socialized and market basis. The measures for this are as follows: 1. We should institute a socialized insurance system for unemployment, old age, and medical care; establish a national social insurance bureau; and allow people to set up various kinds of insurance companies that assume sole responsibility for their own profits and losses. These measures will serve to free laborers and their families from worrying about their health, medical treatment, retirement, old age, and unemployment, and from relying on their work units. 2. We should change the current system of residential quarters being provided by work units, and let companies operating as enterprises attend to the management of all publicly owned houses. In the housing reform a few years ago, we focused our attention on raising property prices in order to reduce the financial burdens on governments and enterprises brought about by housing construction. To do so, we implemented the method of readjusting prices and selling some housing on favorable terms. Still we failed to commercialize housing. Here, the difficulty did not rest with residents' insufficient tolerance for the increased rents and prices, nor with the complicated nature of operations, but in the fact that the socialization of publicly owned housing must be achieved prior to their commercialization, and that the distribution of housing must be controlled by socialized companies rather than by different units. It is only after houses are socialized that laborers are able to flow freely among different enterprises. 3. With regard to enterprise reform, a good external environment also contains a flexible capital-rebuilding [zi ben chong jian 6327 2609 6850 1696] system. At present, China's enterprise system is one under which "workers are always workers, while managers are always managers." The administrative restrictions on capital rebuilding are multifarious, with excessively high "thresholds" and an inordinate number of conventions for the registration of new companies because their establishment must be subjected to examination and approval by several departments, with many public seals affixed to their applications. Once they are registered, it is very difficult for them to go bankrupt. Under a developed market economy, however, things are just the opposite. The "threshold for registration is low, while the maintenance of their operations is difficult." If the above-mentioned abnormal phenomenon is not changed, it will have a detrimental effect on the formation of bankruptcy and unemployment mechanisms in enterprises. Under the new system, when workers are out of jobs and cannot find work in other units, they can either pool funds or borrow money to set up firms or factories and become bosses themselves. As small enterprises grow in multitude, more laborers will be absorbed, and more outlets will be opened for surplus personnel in state-owned units. 2. The transformation of government functions at two levels. The basic requirement for the establishment of a modern enterprise system is to eliminate direct government intervention. This calls for the thorough transformation of government functions, those of the local governments in particular. First, we should separate government functions from those of enterprises, run "enterprises without mothers-in-law" on a grand scale, and prohibit government administrative departments from directly meddling in enterprise activities. Governments will be responsible only for legislation, the formulation of rules, and the collection of taxes, whereas the adoption of stimulatory or retrenching economic policies and the coordination of enterprise behavior should be effected entirely by market parameters. As for direct government investment projects, their development also should be entrusted to enterprises operating as companies, rather than being undertaken by government administrative organs. Governments will take charge of public undertakings only, including the formulation and implementation of local tax regulations according to the practice of the revenue-sharing system, the management of the ecological environment, public investment in local infrastructure facilities, and so on. The realization of transforming government functions covers the following two aspects: The functions of the central government (here, only its economic functions are referred to), and those of the local governments. In principle, the functions of the central government can be defined as: 1) Exercising macroeconomic regulation and control over the national economy, which means managing and balancing macroscopic employment, inflation, money supply, interest rate level, national tax level, and economic growth; 2) making arrangements for social insurance at the state level, which means providing relief for poor and jobless people, arranging the lives of retired and senior citizens, granting allowances to ex-servicemen, and so on; 3) undertaking interprovincial capital construction projects; and 4) engaging in research and development of monopolized natural resources, extra large-sized scientific and high-technology projects, and national education. Local governments will administer public affairs only within their own localities. The fundamental differences in administrative functions between the central and local governments are manifested chiefly in: 1) The scope of division of work, that is, the central government administers overall affairs, while local governments handle partial ones; and 2) local governments have not the power of macroeconomic regulation and control with regard to the issuance and operation of currency. The direct relation of governments at these two levels to all enterprises is through tax revenue only; other regulatory actions must be performed with the aid of those two intermediaries: The law and the market. 3. The molding of an independent, diversified, and competitive banking system. The establishment of a modern enterprise system calls for the coordination of a modern banking system. At present, in addition to excessive government intervention with respect to commodity supply, sales, and prices, as well as employment, enterprises still have no freedom in the use of funds, as they are still affected by the fund ration system. This is not purely an issue concerning the management standards of banks because it is due mainly to the intervention of government officials in the banking business, the root cause of which lies in the fact that specialized banks are not operating as enterprises and have not severed their links with the government. In developed countries that practice a market economy, both the commercial banks -- which operate as enterprises -- and the central bank -- which implements monetary policy -- maintains the balance of money supply and demand, and regulates and controls interest rates at a macro level, are independent; direct intervention by any government administrative body is against the law. This shows a high degree of operational independence in their banking system because the banks are held responsible for macroeconomic equilibrium. The U.S. banking system is the most developed in the world, with the highest degree of independence, whereas Japanese and German banks have more intervention from the governments. This is not direct intervention, however, and it usually is exercised through the law. In designing and establishing a new banking system, China can use the experience of Japan and Germany as reference, and emulate the U.S. model. Like enterprise reform, there is also an issue of introducing a mechanism of competition in banking structural reform. At present, banks in China are run exclusively by the state, so there is no competition among them. Can we not try to set up joint-stock banks? People are more wary of this because it is more difficult to control banking than it is to control such tangible assets as land, properties, and enterprises. If there is something wrong with the reform of material assets, it is easier to put it right, but if the reform of banking assets goes wrong, it will be very difficult to smooth things over. Besides, a trade that deals with money easily can make exorbitant profits. If the government has no distinct bank management regulations, there will be a great disparity in their policy-related income. It is necessary to handle appropriately banks' tax payments for their profits earned from the spread between interest paid on deposits and interest received from loans, and the conduct of banks also should be standardized by a set of corresponding legal provisions. All this should be considered in a meticulous and strict manner. Therefore, we should have a preparatory process of legislation and system design before selecting a new banking system that takes state ownership as a main body with the coexistence of multiple ownership forms. When the conditions are not ripe, it is inappropriate to set up joint-stock, private, or exclusively-owned banks in a hasty manner. From a long-term perspective, however, we should take them into consideration. Molding an independent, diversified, and competitive banking system is the only way to develop a socialist market economy. 4. The institution of a public financial system, under which every citizen has the obligation to pay taxes. Enterprises are the main bodies of the market, so the growth of a market economy depends primarily on the formation of these main bodies. However, the socialist market economy is not laissez-faire; in addition to a greater extent and broader range of government intervention than in the Western market economy, there is another important characteristic, which is that redistribution means should be employed to achieve a higher degree of equality. Hence, this involves the issues of state taxes and of distributive relations between the "state" and the "people." The major means to properly handle the distributive relations between the "state" and the "people" is taxation. When there are more taxes, the state benefits, and when there are fewer taxes, the people benefit. Before reform, China's tax system was very simple, with few categories of taxes and low tariff rates, which changed very little. The principal reasons for this situation were: 1) There were no private enterprises, and state-owned enterprises handed over their profits in lieu of taxes; 2) the income of urban and rural residents was generally low, so they did not have to pay income taxes; and 3) peasants handed over grain to the state as taxes. Some changes have taken place since reform, which include: State-owned enterprises pay taxes instead of profits; private and other enterprises have become more and more important as taxpayers; urban and rural residents pay personal income taxes because they earn more money; and peasants' payment of taxes in kind has been changed to payment of taxes in cash. Along with these changes in the tax system, tax regulations should undergo reform, and tax categories and rates also should be readjusted appropriately through the enactment of powerful tax laws so as to prevent the state treasury from being drained off. We failed to do this in previous years, and there were some errors in our policies in this area because the old tax system was increasingly out of keeping with the new economic situation. Therefore, it is a top-priority task to accelerate reform of the tax system. Recently, reform of the tax system has been fixed as one of the five major reforms. This shows that the central authorities have taken the issue of the tax system very seriously. Judging from the momentum of propaganda and policy implementation, however, it seems that greater emphasis has been placed on solving the issue of the revenue-sharing system with regard to the financial-revenue relationship between the central and local authorities. Without doubt, the implementation of the revenue-sharing system is very important because it can bring about the distribution of tax revenues among the central and local authorities through distinct powers, responsibilities, and interests, and thus lay a foundation for breaking with the highly centralized financial structure. In the future, wrangling between the central government and localities and among various localities can be reduced, so that governments at all levels can concentrate their efforts on day-to-day work and enhance their efficiency. Of course, a new tax system suited to the development of a socialist market economy is not simply this, and the institution of a unified system under which all the people are obliged to pay taxes is extremely urgent. Nowadays, tax evasion has become almost a habit among business firms, with those that earn more evading more, and those that earn less evading less. If we do not speedily intensify the building of a system of legal restraints, we probably will go down the road of being a poor nation with rich people. The basic starting point of the taxation structural reform China is about to implement should be the levy of taxes rather than tax increases or reductions. In other words, we should collect all taxes that should be collected. We may consider instituting a unified tax system under which all the people assume the obligation to pay taxes from the following three aspects: 1) Formulating meticulous and well-conceived tax regulations, including the differentiation of national and local taxes, categories of taxes, tariff rates, period, range, penalties, and so on. With regard to tax laws, the more concrete and detailed, the better. 2) Instituting a strict tax report system with a legally defined time limit for reporting taxes for a certain fiscal year, under which an individual or business owner must file his taxes with the government revenue department before a certain deadline every year. If tax evasion is discovered, it should be traced using all the records of his revenues and tax reports for the past few years, and severe punishments should be meted out to tax evaders so that individuals and business owners will form the habit of filing their taxes honestly. 3) Establishing a tax structure under the independent jurisdiction of state tax bureaus at the central and provincial levels, and vesting tax personnel with full power to enforce state tax laws. No government official is allowed to place himself above tax personnel or to reduce or remit taxes to any individual or business owner under any pretext. 4) Every person --regardless of his capacity, nationality, age, and sex -- should pay taxes according to the same law. Consideration can be given to practicing a work certificate system, whereby a job applicant must possess a work certificate and must show it to his employer together with his tax payment receipts. This way, the government maintains control over employers, while in turn, employers keep control over employees. When a person opens a savings account with a bank or an account with a money-dealing institution, he also must produce his identity card, together with his tax payment receipts. The socialist market economy should operate on the basis of an extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundamental laws for the national economy. Therefore, accelerating comprehensive reform of the tax system is an extremely urgent component of accelerating economic structural reform as a whole. As a matter of fact, taxation structural reform is reform of the state's financial revenue structure. Once we initiate equal competition, state-owned enterprises will implement the same tax laws as other enterprises, so that state tax revenues may decrease in size, and the government will have to cut its spending accordingly. This will call for readjusting government financial functions. At present, our government finance belongs to the comprehensive finance type. Under the original financial model of unified state control, the diminution of the relative size of revenues is faster than that of expenditures after delegating power to lower levels and letting them retain a portion of profits, which has led to the increase of financial deficits year after year. In 1989, we had financial surplus amounting to 2.16 billion yuan, but in 1992, we had a deficit of 23.66 billion yuan. If we do not adjust the expenditure pattern, the deficit will continue to grow, even if we squeeze education funds. The fundamental outlet for surmounting the present financial predicament is not to increase taxes in order to broaden the sources of income, and still less to reduce outlays for scientific research and education in order to decrease expenditure, but to fundamentally reform the financial spending structure. For this purpose, we should move over from the present comprehensive finance to a public finance. Except for investments in natural monopolies, exceptionally large-sized, national defense projects, and some basic industries -- all of which will continue to be paid for by the government -- funds under government control should used mainly for social insurance and other public undertakings. Therefore, the institution of a public financial system will be one of the basic tasks of reform from 1994 onward.
