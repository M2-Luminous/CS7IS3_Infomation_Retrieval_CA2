[Tosovsky] The relatively stable purchasing power of our currency is the central bank's good result, and so is the creation of the new currency. In less than 10 months, we have completely replaced all of the currency in circulation. Greatest failure? Maybe the problems in the banking system. Specifically, problems in some smaller commercial banks that still do not have the skills to be able to evaluate risks cautiously. [Frydl] In its projects up to 2000, the government foresees the growth of the GDP by 3.5 percent a year. According to some experts, this is too little to catch up with developed countries. Will it be necessary to "fuel" the Czech economy, now or in the future, by incurring a reasonable amount of deficits, for example? [Tosovsky] This cannot be ruled out. At present, however, I would not evaluate the economic development by looking at one figure, albeit an important figure, such as the growth of the GDP. Our economy is undergoing principal transformation today. We are witnessing a decline in output, mainly in the primary sector, and growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Large enterprises are gradually giving up activities that have no prospects. These giants are undergoing a reduction diet. Look at the numbers of employees. Tens of thousands of people have left the industry and agriculture sectors and began working in services, trade, and private enterprises. Many people began working in banks. GNP growth is around zero, or slightly under zero this year. This represents the same sum of values as last year, or slightly less, but the quality of products and services is substantially different. [Frydl] What would a budget deficit do to the economy, and when would it be possible to take such a step? [Tosovsky] Budget deficits provide a possibility to stimulate demand in the economy and give the supplying side the opportunity to develop. Depending on the type of spending, deficits may have a multiplicative effect, however. In our current conditions, it would not be a step in the correct direction. Most likely it would have an impact on the price index and the growth of inflation. We do not believe that there is little liquidity or shortage of cash in the economy. A certain surplus has been caused by the influx of foreign capital in recent months. Aggregate demand is quite sufficient, but its weight is in private consumption rather than in investments. We would like to see more investments. [Frydl] It seems that, instead of direct investments, portfolio investments are being preferred. Does such foreign capital bring what we need--that is, technology, markets, etc.? [Tosovsky] We are not monitoring the utilization of foreign capital, only overall figures. It ensues from these figures that direct investments are actually declining. In previous periods, every year there were large projects, such as the Skoda-Volkswagen, or Philip Morris this spring. Such cases do not happen anymore, which has reduced the amount of direct investments. However, the number of investors has not declined. Direct credits from abroad--that is, credits from a foreign bank directly to our enterprises--are growing strongly. Very often our enterprise has a partner abroad, possibly a buyer of its goods, who provides guarantees to the bank, and the credit can be granted that way. Our entrepreneur is on his own; he does not have to establish a joint venture, but he accepts credits instead. For the money he receives, he buys new machines and improves his ability to export. The fact is that overall imports are growing, and machines and equipment, bought either directly or on lease, are a very important item in imports. According to an estimate, the portfolio investments--that is, the purchase of securities--reached between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000. This is only the beginning. [Frydl] The stability of the portfolio investments is a problem, however. Are you not afraid of the movement of capital on our market while there is low liquidity? Does the money flowing to our country represent really well-considered and long-term investments, or is it "money adventurers" who are investing here? [Tosovsky] Small and large investors have shown an interest. Recently, we noticed the interest of larger investors--institutional investors--such as pension funds and similar institutions. Of course, large sums can be moved quickly like that. However, the liquidity on our capital market is high enough not to pose a substantial danger. [Frydl] Do you agree with the opinion that banks should initiate bankruptcies? If the banks initiated bankruptcies, what effect would ait have on the economic situation of the banks? [Tosovsky] Bankruptcies in the neighboring countries, particularly in Hungary, are essentially solutions to some problems of the past. We have already dealt with these problems in a certain way. We have balanced the bank's accounts, written off the debt of certain enterprises, established the Consolidation Bank, and provided new capital to commercial banks. That is, we have already worked on the old debt problem; therefore, we do not have to initiate bankruptcies on such a scale as elsewhere. It is not necessary to throw away the names of the companies that still have a good reputation, or traditions that still have some value. Of course, the banks are considering every individual case and behave in such a manner so as not to cause damage to themselves. According to information provided to us, some bankruptcy proceedings have been launched, but the courts' capacity is insufficient. [Frydl] What are the Czech National Bank's monetary goals this year? [Tosovsky] Our principal objective is to keep control over the price development. We want to keep the inflation rate under 10 percent. The government will take more deregulating steps this year and will increase certain prices, those that are still in the government's jurisdiction. This should increase the price index by some 2 percent next year. We are anticipating a monthly price growth of 0.5 percent. However, there are more factors influencing prices--wages, the state budget, just to mention the most important ones. To apply our monetary policy with the aim of lowering the interest rates is another main objective. We are getting prepared for the koruna's full convertibility, and we want to make our interest rates commensurate with those abroad. We cannot have the convertible koruna and interest rates several points higher than in the neighboring countries. Our goal will be to cut the interest rates, particularly interest on credit. [Frydl] What should the money supply and the credit expansion look like this year? [Tosovsky] The applicable figures have been published. We are anticipating an increase in money supply of 12-15 percent, approximately 10 percent inflation, and 2 percent growth of the GDP. In the beginning, we will be achieving the lower numbers. The monetary policy will be neutral. We still have a certain capacity for slight expansion. [Frydl] Can you tell your opinion on cooperation between the Czech National Bank and the Finance Ministry? These institutions usually have contradictory objectives and roles. [Tosovsky] At the most recent meeting of the Banking Council, the finance minister was also present, to which is he entitled by law, and we are quite happy that he uses this right from time to time. We discussed better harmonization between the fiscal and the monetary policy, which will become our key to success this year. As I said, the state budget is one of the independent factors in the money supply situation, which the central bank cannot influence directly. It is therefore necessary to know the trends of budgetary developments and the government's intentions and to closely cooperate. It seems that both sides are prepared for that. [Frydl] The Czech National Bank is working on the introduction of the koruna's full convertibility. Could you tell us how far you want to go in liberalizing the capital account? [Tosovsky] It may seem improbable, but our system is quite close to full convertibility. In principle, three things are involved. The limit on foreign currency purchases by the population will be abolished, the obligation of the exporter to offer foreign currency to the bank for purchase will be abolished, and the export of capital will be liberalized. When this happens, we only have to address foreign banks, open an account in our currency, and make foreign payments in korunas. We want to achieve this situation--that is, full liberalization--also on the capital account of the balance of payments [sentence as published]. [Frydl] How do you view the Czech Republic's position in the world economic organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank? [Tosovsky] Our position remains the same. In the International Monetary Fund we have the position of the countries that are providing assistance to other countries. In 1990, we renewed our membership as a country that needed assistance. This is quite a good result, which we achieved in such a short time. [Frydl] Do we have enough commercial banks? What should be their optimum number? [Tosovsky] The number of banks is essentially an uninteresting number. We do not judge the situation according to that number. There should be as many banks as required to provide all of the needed services on the standard level. This is not the case in our country, not yet. Nevertheless, it seems that all those banks on the market are an unhealthy situation. We expect that their number will be reduced, some of them will merge, and the banking services provided to clients will improve and become of better quality. [Frydl] The "retail banking" system--that is, really complex services for regular clients--is closely linked to this issue. [Tosovsky] We have enough branches, but the quality of services must improve and their variety increase. [Frydl] In your opinion, why have the foreign banks not engaged themselves in this sphere? [Tosovsky] I cannot say that they would completely avoid this market, but it would mean for them to build a network of branches, which is expensive and slow.
