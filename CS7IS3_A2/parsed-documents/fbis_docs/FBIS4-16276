These are planned exercises and they are in no way linked with the latest events in odessa, ITAR-TASS was told by telephone by officials of the Navy's press centre on Friday. According to the same source, three other ships of the Black Sea Navy had put out for planned exercises on Thursday. Therefore, taking part in the planned training mission in the open sea are fifteen ships of the Black Sea Navy. According to information received from the press centre, a large landing ship left the Sevastopol base on Thursday to evacuate Black Sea Navy personnel, their families and property from Odessa. However, on the same day Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaly Radetsky addressed a telegram to the commander of the Black Sea Navy, informing him that calls of Russian warships to Nikolayev, Ochakov, Ismail and Odessa were undesirable. The large landing craft was ordered to return to the base. Reports from Sevastopol indicate that three ships of the Ukrainian Navy, anchored in the Navy's chief base, have been cut off from their shore power sources for the fourth day running. Now they have to consume their own fuel resources to remain operational. According to the official version of Black Sea Navy officials, who had cut off the power supply, this was done because the Ukrainian side had not paid its debts for the already consumed electricity. However, chief of the Ukrainian Navy's financial service Colonel Viktor Kobernik claims that the debt for the electricity was settled.
