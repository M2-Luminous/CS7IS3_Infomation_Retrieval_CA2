FBIS4-59431 "drnes093_j_94003" FBIS-NES-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-Bid Holds News Conference, Comments on Salih Al-Bid Holds News Conference, Comments on Salih LD1205112294 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 12 May 94 LD1205112294 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], stressed the illegitimacy of A'li 'Abdallah Salih as chairman of the Presidential Council, the illegitimacy of [words indistinct] in the Presidential Council, the illegitimacy of the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the illegitimacy of the Yemeni Reform Alliance group in the House of Representatives. At a news conference in Aden yesterday evening, attended by representatives of local, Arab, and international press, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid explained that legitimacy and constitution complement each other. He said that the constitution specifies that the Presidential Council will consist of five elected members; the five members of the Council should then elect their chairman after they have taken the constitutional oath. However, that did not happen because al-Bid has not yet taken the oath. Therefore, the chairman has been illegally appointed and has not been elected by a complete council as the constitution specifies. As for 'Abd al-Majid al-Zandani, his membership of the Presidential council is illegitimate because he took an oath contradictory to the oath specified by the Constitution. The same applies to the speaker of the House of Representatives and those members of the Yemeni Reform Alliance parliamentary group, who took an oath contradictory to the one specified by the Constitution. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid condemned the declaration of the state of emergency by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, whom he described as a dictator. Brother al-Bid pointed out that the Constitution specifies that a state of emergency may only be declared following a resolution by the National Defense Council, which met only once three years ago. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid added that all the resolutions adopted by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are illegal because they were issued in the name of an illegitimate chairman. He said: Legitimacy today is the legitimacy of national unanimity, represented by the document of pledge and accord, and we take our legitimacy from our people, national unanimity, and the higher interests of the homeland and their balance in society. He explained that there are many details which could be specified to emphasize the illegitimacy of many of the existing institutions. He said: We will soon present [word indistinct] our opinion of the legitimacy. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We are approaching the 21st century, but there are those who refuse to recognize human rights, who try to limit civilian life, and who work toward consecrating armament, and pulling us back to the middle ages. That is why these people have rejected the course of the document of pledge and accord and have imposed this war on us, by which they direct strikes and stab at Yemen, its unity, people, and national [word indistinct]. In his replies to questions from the correspondents about the military situation, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the forces of the Al al-Ahmar gang are deployed along the past division lines in order to renew the secession. He also emphasized that the al-Amaliqah units stationed in Abyan did not enter it during the war but were stationed in that governorate for four years, where they have their own camps. On the other hand, our units deployed in the Northern governorates were placed either in the same camps or neighboring ones. These camps were hit and destroyed. He pointed out: When we approached unity we did not think of the military tactics of attacking it. We entered the union peacefully. Our aim is to construct our state in a peaceful and democratic way. We believed that the democratic forces and civilian life would influence and contain these military forces. However, in the end the military forces have disregarded everything, usurped freedom, opened detention camps, killed women and children, militarized the country, and spread terror and terrorism everywhere. This is the proof of their aggressive spirit and the inherited mentality of invasion in order to spread hegemony and [word indistinct]. The brother secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party reiterated that the aggressive way chosen by the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his gang will not succeed. He pointed out that a new situation has been created among our people, and that many units led by the Al al-Ahmar gang have been forced to fight their brothers, shell the cities and villages, and to kill and shed the blood of the innocent. Therefore, they are working toward severing the ties of fraternity, friendship, and unity among the sons of the Yemeni people, and they are destroying the union with their actions, which stem from a mentality of invasion, occupation and looting. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We have exhausted all the means of [words indistinct] and accepted all solutions, but unfortunately we are today forced to defend ourselves in a war which is imposed on us. We consider ourselves (?bound) by the document of pledge and accord [words indistinct] this document. He stressed: We stand by all the honorable patriots and all the good-intentioned forces in order to build a democratic Yemen, as a country on whose basis we agreed unanimously in the document of pledge and accord. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on all the soldiers and officers, whom the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih throws in the fire of death, to resort to reason and patriotism and to abandon that unpatriotic and inhuman course. He emphasized loudly: Rest assured that Aden will be impregnable to the invaders.
