In his speech during the debate on Bonsia, which began at the UN Security Council last night, Pakistan's deputy ambassador at the United Nations, Sher Afghan, said in effective terms that those who do not fulfill their responsibility to prevent the aggression against Bosnia will be remembered in history as supporters of the aggressive Serb forces. He said only by complete use of force, especially by air strikes, can the Serbs be forced to implement the Security Council resolutions. In this regard, significant moral, political, and legal responsibility rest with those powers, who have the necessary resources to get the relevant Security Council resolutions implemented. Sher Afghan said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller visited Sarajevo on 2 February, which reflects their concern about the struggle of the people and the government in Bosnia. On this occasion, both the prime ministers urged the international community to protect the sovereignty, solidarity, regional security, and political independence of Bosnia and to take effective steps to prevent genocide. He said Pakistan strongly believes that inaction against the aggressors is tantamount to justifying aggression and hence in Pakistan's view, the establishment of peace in the besieged country is the combined responsibility of the entire international community. The Pakistani representative said the massacres and annihilation, along with the destruction and devastation committed by the Serbian forces in Bosnia has reached such an extent that now, there is no other choice than to take joint action at a global level. The Pakistani representative added that the arms embargo against Bosnia is against the UN Charter which has deprived the country, which has been the victim of aggression, of its legitimate right to its own defense. Sher Afghan expressed the hope that the international tribunal will soon begin its hearing on the cases against the perpetrators of brutal crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Pakistan's Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has already pledged $1 million for the expenses of the tribunal. Sher Afghan said the international community should pay similar attention to the security of the civilian population in all the safe havens declared by the United Nations and other cities and towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Voicing full support once again for the principled stand of the Bosnian Government, the Pakistani representative said its constructive and flexible tendency at the talks are praiseworthy.
