Chemical enzymatic synthesis of the human hIL4 gene at the Bioorganic Chemistry Institute lab is reported and this gene's expression in E. coli cells is described. The pKK223-3 commercial plasmid (by Pharmacia) containing a strong controlled tac-promotor, a binding segment with ribosomes of the lacZ gene, EcoRI-HindIII polylinker of the pUC18 plasmid, and a strong transcription terminator of the rrnB gene is used as the expression vector while the EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the hIL4 gene is cloned into the pKKhIL4-12 polylinker segment. The factors which affect the gene expression are examined, and it is noted that the expression level depends on the distance between the ribosome binding segment (RBS) and the starting ATG codon. The resulting TG1/pKKhIL4-9 strain was used to isolate hIL4 which is produced in the E. coli bacterial cells in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. The highest production level is observed in the structure where the RBS distance corresponds to nine nucleotide pairs. The hIL4 was solubilized, renatured, and purified in a biologically active state with a yield of 2 mg per 1 g of moist cells. According to amino acid sequencing data, the resulting hIL4 has an N-terminal Met-His-Lys-Asp-He-Thr-Leu sequence which is consistent with the human interleukin-4 sequence with an additional Met.
