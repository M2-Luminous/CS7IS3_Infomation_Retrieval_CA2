It highlights the differences between the 1989-94 legislature and the one that will sit from 1994 to 1999. Although a few details remain to be worked out concerning proportional representation and the inclusion of other minigroups or personalities, the character of the new congress can now be discerned. A reader offended by the way the table treats one group or another may safely change some names. This, it seems to me, will do little harm since, from a structural standpoint, the results will remain the same. The congress will still be made up of four major blocks. The largest will hold 30 percent of the seats and the others around 20 percent each. This means that for the time being it will take an agreement among at least three blocks to get a quorum in the Chamber of Deputies. The MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] block becomes decisive. To gain a quorum or develop any sort of legislative program, the other two coalitions will have to court MAS and win it over. This situation resembles the previous session in both the Chamber and the Senate with one very important exception. Before, only one group needed the socialists, and the socialists, for their part, were in competition with New Democratic Generation [NGD]. In practice this resulted in a dominant coalition made up of AD and the group led by Wladimir Gessen, who has now retired to the practice of psychology. For its part, COPEI's [Social Christian Party] alliance with MAS could not proceed on its own. COPEI had to seek more support elsewhere, and help was hard to come by. This meant the congress tended to follow the lead of AD with support from NGD. By contrast, in the new Senate, if the two largest groups act as a block, they will not have to look to a third group for support. If this happens, then the block composed of the next two largest groups will be obliged to seek support from a third group. In addition, as the table shows, a three-way accord among Convergence, Causa R, and MAS will not produce a majority. It is possible to speculate about other combinations, too, but the point remains that agreements will be hard to reach and maintaining a smooth flow of legislative business in the new session will not be easy. This outlook, although it may seem a bit alarming, is also rather static. We are assuming there will be no breaking of ranks within the parties that have won seats. However, there are reasons to believe this is not very likely. Take COPEI, for example. It will be under pressure from Convergence, and some of its followers may decide to leave the fold rather than oppose a "social christian" government headed by the founder of their own party. However, this is a two-way street. In the long run, COPEI could pick up defectors from Convergence as some lawmakers grow disenchanted with the government or find other reasons to shift allegiances. Causa R has undergone explosive growth, and it remains to be seen if new members assimilate and toe the line. Experience indicates that this sort of movement that sweeps into existence with no clear ideology is prone to division. Given the likelihood of a fluid situation, the party with the most to gain is clearly AD since it is less susceptible to erosion either from within or without. Stability gives AD lots of resources and plenty of bargaining chips. But that is not all. A new factor that must be considered is that half the members of the new Chamber represent single-member districts, and this poses a threat to parliamentary cohesion. Representatives of single-member districts regard themselves as first-class lawmakers who won office on their own merits and by forging personal ties to those who elected them. This gives them a great deal of liberty in the face of pressure to toe the party line. All these factors presage a Congress that is highly unpredictable and hard to rule. Paradoxically, however, this could offer a way out of some of the problems of governing and legislative relations that are bound to arise in the coming year. Despite the prospect of some ugly spectacles, there is reason to hope that defection, restructuring, and realignment will combine to produce a pro-government alliance or an opposition open to constructive agreement on certain basic issues. There is, however, another scenario to be considered. The president-elect has reserves of prestige, ability, and tenacity that transcend the election results. Intensive use of this political capital could put Congress on the defensive in the eyes of public opinion and force the creation of blocks and coalitions that seem unimaginable at present. Or the president could use his political capital to promote constitutional reforms and press for the innovations of which he seems fondest. These include referendums and the possibility of being able to dissolve legislatures. Changes such as these would alter completely the picture painted here. For a task of such magnitude, the first months of the new administration will be decisive. For any of these developments to take place, there will have to be an arduous process of negotiations of all sorts. The costs of these transactions will, as the economists say, be enormous. It would be nice if the president had at his side someone like Richelieu to keep him from being consumed by such an engrossing task. The president badly needs someone who would let him concentrate on problem-solving and substantive matters of policy. However, he has no such partner anywhere in sight. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chamber of Deputies | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Party |1989-94 |1994-99 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AD |97(48.3%) |44(23.%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |COPEI |67(33.3%) |49(25.9%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MAS |18(9%) |14(7.1%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Convergence |0 |43(22.8%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Causa R |0 |14(7.4%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |19(9.5%) |0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |201 |189 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Senate | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AD |23(48%) |13(27.7%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |COPEI |20(41.8%) |12(25.5%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MAS |3(6.3%) |3(6.4%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Convergence |0 |11(23.4%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Causa R |0 |8(17%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other |2(4.17%) |0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |48 |47 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
