The representatives held three rounds of talks on and off throughout Monday in a bid to revise Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's tax program that is still threatening to split his coalition. They agreed to meet at 10:30 A.M. [0130 GMT] Tuesday, the sources said. The third round, which started at around 7:00 P.M. after the previous two rounds broke down, lasted only one hour, because of persistent opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is demanding a major revision to the program, the sources said. In an eleventh-hour bid to placate the SDP, Hosokawa instructed his colleague, Hiroyuki Sonoda, to sketch out a compromise version of the program combining a new indirect tax with a tax cut. Sonoda, leader of the alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party, immediately devised and presented the compromise version at a meeting of representatives of the coalition parties, only to find the SDP remaining unconvinced. The SDP threatened last Thursday to quit the coalition unless Hosokawa agrees to accept its demands to revise the core aspects of the tax proposal, including a demand to insert a clause obliging all revenue from the new tax to be used for welfare-related outlays. Hosokawa, however, has remained reluctant to completely redesign his national welfare tax program, making it difficult to narrow the gulf with the SDP, they said. The SDP is the biggest force in the coalition. Its withdrawal would lead to the breakup of the coalition. Hosokawa wants the issue settled before his departure on Thursday for the United States for a summit with President Bill Clinton. In the morning meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told his coalition counterparts that the party will not agree to further talks unless Hosokawa agrees to revise core aspects of the tax plan. The SDP also demanded that the coalition not specify the rate of tax when introducing the text of the proposed legislation onto the Diet floor, they said. Kubo told the coalition leaders during the morning session, "if this parley is merely designed to convince us to accept the original tax proposal, we cannot help but turn it down." However, Kubo said that if the coalition devised satisfactory revision proposals, the party would agree to further negotiations. The Clinton administration has called on Tokyo to take steps to implement tax cuts as a way of reviving stagnant consumer spending and to whittle down Japan's huge trade surplus.
