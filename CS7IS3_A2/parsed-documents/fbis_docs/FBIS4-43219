Iliadhis, who will be accompanied by General D. Vorvolakos, commander of the Greek Cypriot National Guard, will hold talks on Tuesday [14 June] with Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis; Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris; General Khristos Limberis, chief of the Greek General Staff; and the force commanders. Although no official disclosure has been made on the joint defense doctrine, the increasing reports in Athens that Greece and south Cyprus have abandoned the concept because of foreign pressure and legal and military reasons have drawn attention. Sources close to the Greek Defense Ministry have said that the two sides will not be able to broaden their cooperation beyond the coordination of their rearmament programs. Regarding the legal reasons that have obstructed the realization of the agreement Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Greek Cypriot Leader Glavkos Kliridhis reached on the joint defense doctrine, the same sources said: "According to the Zurich Agreement, Greece is one of the guarantor powers of Cyprus. The implementation of the joint defense doctrine would violate the Zurich Agreement. Furthermore, as a member of NATO and the Western European Union [WEU], Greece does not have the right to conclude a joint defense agreement with a foreign country. Such an agreement would make south Cyprus look like a member of NATO and the WEU." Regarding the military reasons for the abandonment of the doctrine, the sources said: "The joint defense doctrine will require the deployment of Greek troops, military aircraft, and arms in Cyprus. That is impossible under the existing conditions." Meanwhile, the sources recalled the strong pressure the United States, NATO, and the European Union have put on Greece in connection with the joint defense doctrine. Regarding the future of military cooperation between Greece and south Cyprus, the sources stressed the following: "What is left is the coordination of the rearmament programs and the plans that will be put into effect in the event of a war with Turkey. That process has been in effect for the past five years. Much of the arms of the Greek Armed Forces and the Greek Cypriot National Guard are similar. Meanwhile, Greece will probably supply the Greek Cypriots with the AMX-30 B-2 tanks and Leonidas armored personnel carriers it will decommission and with some Milan antitank missiles. Joint military exercises may also be held in Greece. It is essential for the Greek Cypriots to establish their own air force units. Used Mirage F-1 and MiG-21 aircraft are available in the markets. They are in good condition and relatively inexpensive."
