Notes on the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Moscow Organization's Conference"] [Text] In the past, everything that belonged to the capital was called excellent. Now this is no longer the case. And you cannot say this about the work of the party organization either. The city party conference of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] was held last Saturday. Committee Chairman A. Shabanov gave a very sharp and clear-cut description of the situation in the country. He compared the city's Communists with the home guard thrown into the very hell of combat operations. Hard as it has been, a lot has been done. Primary party associations have appeared and have at least started working, councils are operating -- the intervuz [higher educational establishment] council and the council of leaders of enterprises; a discussion club is holding meetings, and scientific-practical conferences have been held. Of course there are the elections to the Duma. However, the party organization is not in the vanguard of events, it has not seized the initiative, it has not been able to act as the organizer of a mass movement. That, presumably, is one reason why it has lost around one-third of the Communists. But here is the opinion of worker V. Sokolov, now a former member of the gorkom [city party committee]. "I have received 50,000 rubles since January, and I have four kids. The youngest is three months old, and my eldest daughter is 13. If we all perished, the party would not notice. An ordinary mortal does not exist for it" -- these are harsh words. But it is not an unfair complaint. The organization starts with comradeship. Now that enterprises are stopping and unemployment is growing, the need arises to create special funds for assistance to the needy, and the new gorkom should think about this. V. Denisov, a representative of the Krasnopresnenskiy organization, tried to analyze the party's problems theoretically. "We have lost Communists because certain party leaders have noticeably moved to the right," is his viewpoint. "This has manifested itself in the negation of the theory of class war, instead of which they are putting forward `state patriotism.'" There is a big difference between the slogans of national liberation on the basis of a broad patriotic front, and state patriotism. The former is a struggle, while the latter is time-serving. It must not be forgotten that the memorandum on accord, composed by the presidential team, also takes refuge in the idea of state patriotism. The speakers were unanimous that the prevalence of debate in the life of party organizations is generated by the delay in adopting a party ideological program. The Russian conference must finalize things. The ideological turmoil is rooted in the party's lack of an adequate social base. For example, over one-third of the Moscow organization is made up of employees of higher educational establishments, and the rest are engineering and technical personnel, and veterans. There are few workers. A social base cannot be found unless it is not fought for. The party is unfortunately conducting very poor work in production labor collectives. There were 18 workers in the previous gorkom, and now there are 10. One was elected to the Russian conference. This too is an indicator. It is characteristic that the discussion of the working movement seemed to be conducted only at odd moments. The most important result of the conference is the decision to strive for the unity of Communists and to join the SKP-CPSU [Union of Communist Parties--CPSU].
