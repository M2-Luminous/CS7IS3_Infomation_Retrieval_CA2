In his speech to the opening session of the Arab League Council's conference, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that Israel must implement the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, particularly in connection with protecting people living under occupation. He urged that an effective international presence be expeditiously established in the occupied territories. He declared that the Arab countries are committed to a comprehensive and just peace in line with UN and Arab resolutions. 'Abd-al-Majid said that Israeli procrastinations and inhuman practices have encouraged the settlers' criminal propensities, resulted in greater violence, and created real obstacles to the peace process, which, he noted, cannot continue unless the minimal conditions for restoring trust are met and Israel stops evading its commitments. He announced that the Arab group at the United Nations has decided to form a troika representing the Arab ambassadors to the United Nations and the heads of the Arab group for the months of February, March, and April. This troika, he said, will hold a meeting with the U.S. permanent delegate to the United Nations. The Arab group also instructed the Egyptian delegation to prepare a draft message on behalf of all Arab countries that expresses a united position on Jerusalem. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this message will be approved by the Arab group and sent to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali and to the president of the UN Security Council to be distributed as an official document. Regarding inter-Arab solidarity, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained that the closing of Arab ranks will enable the Arab countries to revise some of the principles and charters governing collective Arab action and set them forth in a new form that is more in line with contemporary Arab wishes. He pointed out that this requires a discussion on amending the Arab League charter and the establishment of an Arab court of justice as a mechanism to solve inter-Arab disputes peacefully and prevent their escalation. 'Abd-al-Majid said that within the context of a comprehensive Arab reconciliation, the Arab League seeks to resolve the problem of the Kuwaiti detainees and those who are missing. He added that this will be a positive factor in allaying the current tensions, both for the families of the Kuwaiti detainees and the missing and in regard to the efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, in whose territorial integrity we are concerned and interested. Discussing pan-Arab security, he said: Security, in our view, now means one thing--to be or not to be. He noted that pan-Arab security now has many sides covering most aspects of joint Arab action, both economic and political, as they are two sides of the same coin. He urged the Arab League Council to work quickly and seriously to restructure the Arab economic situation to help us avoid any negative repercussions, especially from the GATT. He expressed regret over the continuing crisis between Libya and some Western countries despite Libya's flexible stand and eagerness to settle the crisis in the context of international legitimacy. He called on the three Western parties to be responsive to the efforts by several parties to reach a solution that respects Libya's territorial integrity and is in line with Article 33 of the UN Charter, which calls for resolving differences between states through dialogue and peaceful means. He reiterated the Arab League's support for the United Arab Emirates' efforts to regain all its legitimate rights and its sovereignty over its three islands in the Gulf. He also expressed his support for the United Arab Emirates' measures to recover these rights and hoped that Iran will respond by handling the issue peacefully and with wisdom. Speaking about the situation in Somalia, 'Abd-al-Majid praised President Husni Mubarak's initiative that contributed to achieving national reconciliation in Somalia. He said it was time that the fraternal Somali people directed their efforts toward reconstructing their country so that Somalia can resume its role in the Arab arena. Discussing the situation in Yemen and Sudan, the Arab League secretary general expressed confidence that the Yemeni leaders' wisdom will help overcome this crisis and enhance ties among the people in that nation. He said we are following the situation in Sudan with extreme concern, and expressed his hope that the Arab League Council will adopt a resolution asserting its clear commitment to Sudan's unity and its opposition to any attempt to separate the south.
