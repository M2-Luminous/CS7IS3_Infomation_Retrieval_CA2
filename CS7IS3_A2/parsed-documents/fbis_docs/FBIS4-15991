Three UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] members were elected to Ukraine's Supreme Council: Yurko Tyma, chairman of the UNA Ternopol Oblast committee, Oleh Vitovych, commander of the Lvov UNSO Oblast command, and Yaroslav Ilyasevych, chief of staff of the Lvov UNSO branch. We consider that we could form a faction of 20 or 30 people in the parliament who will support the UNA platform. We assess this as our victory despite the fact that enormous pressure was put on UNA-UNSO members and parliamentary candidates both by the power bodies and by representatives of the communist and democratic blocs with the aim of not allowing them to take part in the elections. The pre-election campaign was conducted in an atmosphere of fierce fighting, slanders against UNA-UNSO, arrests, searches of its members and confiscation of documents. There were incidents of physical violence against parliamentary candidates. For example, a parliamentary candidate in Ternopol Oblast was seriously wounded in the head and several UNA-UNSO election observers were arrested.
