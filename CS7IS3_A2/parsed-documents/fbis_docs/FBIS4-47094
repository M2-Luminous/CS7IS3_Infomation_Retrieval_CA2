The president appoints the one who forms the government, but if the first two candidates are not approved by the Riigikogu [parliament], it is parliament itself that appoints a candidate for prime minister. The president can only dissolve parliament and announce new elections under certain conditions. It says expressly in the Constitution that the government takes care of foreign policy, while in Finland it is the president. The first president elected according to the new Constitution, Lennart Meri, has shown that he wants to exercise power. It has been said that in his exercise of power he is approaching the limits of legality. The most spectacular conflict with the government occurred last winter, when Mart Laar proposed a replacement of four ministers. Meri opposed mainly the firing of the minister of economics, Toomas Sildmae. Initially, he refused to agree to the change in ministers and delayed the decision. Finally, he gave in. There was talk about a constitutional crisis. According to the government's interpretation, it is the prime minister who decides about the ministers. The president's task is only to confirm the government's decision. President Meri's legal advisor Vahus Glaase is of a different opinion and denies that it could have been a matter of a constitutional crisis. He refers to the fact that the Constitution expressly says that changes in the government's composition "must be made by the president of the Republic at the request of the prime minister." It is thus the president who has the last word. If it were the prime minister, why would the matter still be referred to the president, he wonders. When HUFVUDSTADSBLADET visits Vahus Glaase at the appointed time in his official room in Kadriorg, he is not yet there. He is with the president, we are told. After 25 minutes he arrives in the company of a man. "Pardon the delay, but 20 minutes ago the president appointed this man to be the new minister of justice, and I was forced to be present," says Glaase. The man is named Urmas Arumae, the successor to Kaido Kama, who stepped down a few weeks ago. This time, President Meri thus decided immediately to agree to the prime minister's proposal for a new minister. Minute Scrutiny The president also has greater influence over legislation than is evident from a superficial reading of the Constitution. Glaase quotes Article 107, which says that the president is to sanction the laws and that he may refuse to sanction a law and within two weeks send it back to parliament. If parliament still refuses to change the law, the president must sanction it or ask the constitutional court to declare that it violates the Constitution. President Meri appears to have taken this article seriously. He and his legal advisor very carefully scrutinize every law. Vahur Glaase points out that it does not primarily involve exercising power but an obligation to see to it that the laws agree with the Constitution. Of the 300 laws that have been instituted during Meri's time the president objected to 11. In six of the cases parliament changed the laws in accordance with the president's wishes. In one case the president was satisfied, although parliament did not accede to his proposal for change. Three cases have gone to the constitutional court and a fourth is on the way. Of the three cases that have been decided, the president won two and parliament one. President Meri has been especially active in foreign policy, which was evident most recently in connection with President Martti Ahtisaari's state visit to Estonia. Nevertheless, the Constitution does not give the president any role in foreign policy. Glaase motivates the president's foreign policy activity with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, which grants the head of state a special position in handling international relations. He admits that the government should head the practical application of the foreign policy. However, there has not been any conflict with the government in these matters.
