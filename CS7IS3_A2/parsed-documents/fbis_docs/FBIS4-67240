This claim was made today by the state's attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios. He added that there was an obvious migration of individuals coming from Sinaloa, Michoacan, Tamaulipas, and Puebla, who have settled in Mexicali and appear to have large fortunes. He declared: "The `narcos' want to cool the atmosphere in Tijuana," because of the serious conflicts and problems posed, as well as the large concentration of police forces combating crimes against health that have arrived as a result of the assassination of Archbishop Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. The attorney reached the foregoing conclusion after having investigated several crimes, including a murder committed in Mexicali. He noted that the one presumed guilty "is a person with great economic potential, the owner of 40 ranches and a fleet of yachts." Franco Rios reiterated the statement made by Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel on the day of the signing of the Pact for Baja California, urging businessmen not to become associated with the drug trade. The leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution and councilman in the state's 14th town hall, Javier Gonzalez Monroy, for his part, commented: "The battle against the drug traffic obviously has failed to bring about the desired results, because there are political rivalries on the various levels of government responsible for that task: federal, state, and municipal authorities." He stressed that an impetus must be given to reforms of the Federal Penal Code that would enable the Baja California State Attorney's Office to take action aimed at solving the problems. He added that large numbers of "informers" have registered as candidates for the State Judicial Police Academy, noting that this should have been supervised by the local judicial branch. The secretary general of the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers in the state, Jose Maria Gonzalez Escobedo, declared: "There is a power vacuum in the state, but it is impossible for the citizens to remain at the mercy of criminals." Finally, he described the Pact for Baja California as "a signpost indicating that they want to improve security."
