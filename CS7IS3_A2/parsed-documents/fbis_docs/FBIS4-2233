After a 50-minute debate, the Council (upper house of parliament) rejected the president's suggestion by a vote of 61 to 57, with 4 abstentions. Kazannik, who had been an enthusiastic supporter of Yeltsin, was appointed procurator-general soon after the October 1993 confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament. On February 26, the State Duma (lower house of parliament) adopted a resolution to grant amnesty to organizers of the 1991 "August 19 event" and those leaders arrested after the October 1993 bloodshed. The amnesty question posed a dilemma for Kazannik. According to the state constitution, as procurator-general he was obligated to carry out the legislature's decision; at the same time the president tried to prevent him from doing so. Shortly after the amnesty was implemented, Kazannik tendered his resignation to Yeltsin and it was accepted. Yeltsin also asked parliament to approve his suggestion that Alexey Ilyushenko, director of the monitoring bureau of the presidential office, be named acting procurator-general before formal confirmation by parliament. However, the parliament did not want Kazannik to resign, while Yeltsin insisted that he go. After the veto, Presidential Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov stressed that the post of procurator-general should not be vacant and the existence of two procurators-general would not be allowed. Presidential Parliamentary Representative Alexandr Yakovlev today said that he expects the upper house to review its veto decision. Observers here believe that the ongoing controversy over a candidate for the position of procurator-general mirrors the complexity of current Russian politics.
