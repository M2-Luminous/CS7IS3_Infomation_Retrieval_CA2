According to a top government official Japan is closely watching moves by both North Korea and the United States. The government's basic understanding is that the DPRK does not recognize IAEA as a viable negotiating partner, and it wants to break the deadlock through negotiations with the United States. At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 1 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: "North Korea wants to give priority to talks with the United States. It is not responding to Japan's persuasion." He said that although Japan has been talking with the DPRK unofficially through its embassy in Beijing and its UN mission, such efforts had been unsuccessful. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee: "We are seriously concerned. We hope to somehow win [the DPRK's] understanding through dialogue." He stressed Japan's position of approaching this issue through dialogue. Kakizawa also said: "If the nuclear issue is resolved, we would like to go into negotiations to normalize diplomatic relations." The normalization of ties would include economic assistance to the DPRK. Kakizawa also talked about measures relating to possible UN sanctions, and indicated that the government was considering signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) to enable offering refuelling and other services to U.S. Forces. Apparently, while the government's basic position is to promote dialogue, but it is also dealing with the possibility of sanctions, adopting a carrot-and-stick strategy.
