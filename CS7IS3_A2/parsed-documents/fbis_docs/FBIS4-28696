That is, he said, because a request may have been made by the new Government of Cambodia, which is in the stage of national rehabilitation. The provision of assistance in the form of training courses or the supply of military uniforms, which is aimed at making Cambodian officials perfect soldiers, is acceptable. The practice is the same as Thailand's assistance to Cambodia in the field of public health and military uniforms, which were requested by the Cambodian Government. Therefore, there should be no problem. On the question of the Khmer Rouge opposing such assistance by the United States, the Thai foreign minister said the Khmer Rouge may have been incorrect in their opposition because the assistance was made in the form of training not arms supplies. The foreign minister also reiterated that ASEAN countries have maintained their stances supporting a solution to the Cambodian problem through compromise and not by supporting armed conflict. Regarding the news that Malaysia will provide weapons to Cambodia, Prasong said he had received no facts nor information about this and therefore does not want to comment on it. The foreign minister was asked about the Burmese dissident students at the Maniloi camp in Rat Buri Province, who are calling for the rights and freedom of Burmese people and who may wish to protest the presence of Burmese Government representatives attending the ASEAN ministerial meeting scheduled for July in Bangkok. The foreign minister said the Burmese students, who were placed in the camp provided by Thai authorities, have lived quite comfortably. Therefore, they should not make any political moves in Thailand. He thought that officials and agencies concerned, such as the Ministry of Interior, should prepare measures to prevent the Burmese students from using Thai territory to commit illegitimate acts. Regarding security measures for the ASEAN ministerial meeting which Thailand will host in July, authorities are believed to have worked on it and do not think there will be any problems.
