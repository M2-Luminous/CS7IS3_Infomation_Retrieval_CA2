The Russian ruble will freely circulate on the territory of Belarus. This agreement has been reached at the Russian-Belarusian negotiations conducted by Boris Yeltsin and the government leaders of both countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich. After almost three hours of talks, the prime ministers signed an agreement on the unification of monetary systems of the Russian Federation and Belarus. The document says that monetary systems of both countries will be merged after Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich sign in late January in Minsk more than 10 agreements regulating the mechanisms of this process. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vyacheslav Kebich said it was agreed that the one-to-one exchange rate for both currencies during the unification be established. Vyacheslav Kebich believes that Belarus' transition to the Russian ruble will be a continued process lasting for three to six months. This is caused by purely technical problems of Belarus [words indistinct].
