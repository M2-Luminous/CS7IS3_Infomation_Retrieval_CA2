FR940317-1-00197 FR940317-1-00017 Although implementation of T+3 does not create compliance problems with regard to Rule 10b-10, 6 the Commission requests comment on its effect on the confirmation's investor protection functions. If the confirmation is used less frequently as an invoice, should some of the confirmation's content be shifted to periodic account statements? 7 6 Some commentators suggested that substantive changes to Rule 10b-10 will be necessary as a result of the adoption of Rule 15c6&hyph;1 of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.15c6&hyph;1, which implemented T+3. Because Rule 10b-10 requires a broker-dealer to send a customer written confirmation ``at or before completion of the transaction,'' some have argued that a T+3 settlement period will make compliance with Rule 10b-10 impossible. The Commission notes, however, that broker-dealers can comply with Rule 10b-10 even under a T+3 settlement period. Rule 10b-10 requires only that the broker-dealer send written confirmation by settlement date, not that the customer actually receive it by settlement. In the current five days settlement period, broker-dealers typically send customer confirmations the day after trade date, which will satisfy Rule 10b-10 even under a T+3 settlement period. 7 Six of the exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') have rules requiring that such periodic statements be sent to customers. The Commission has proposed a rule requiring annual account statements in the payment for order flow context. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33026 (Oct. 7, 1993), 58 FR 52934 (Oct. 13, 1993). In this connection, the Commission solicits comment on the adequacy and readability of periodic statements of account generally and whether these account statements are read and relied upon by investors in monitoring their accounts. 1. Disclosure of Mark-Ups in Riskless Principal Transactions in Debt Securities Rule 10b-10 currently requires disclosures of broker-dealer compensation in agency and specified principal trades. In agency trades, the confirmation must disclose both the transaction price and the commission charged. 8 In principal trades involving ``Reported Securities,'' 9 the confirmation must disclose the trade price reported by the broker-dealer for that transaction and the mark-up calculated from the reported price. 10 In ``riskless'' principal trades in non-reported equity securities, 11 Rule 10b-10 requires brokers and dealers, other than market makers, to disclose the amount of any mark-up received. 12 The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 10b-10 to require the disclosure of mark-up information for riskless principal trades in debt securities, other than U.S. Savings Bonds and municipal securities. The Commission also is proposing Rule 15c2&hyph;13 to require disclosure of mark-up information in riskless principal trades in municipal securities. Rule 10b-10 currently requires confirmations for transactions in debt securities to disclose to the customer the net dollar price and yield, but not separate disclosure of compensation information. 13 The Commission believes that investors in debt securities, like investors in equity securities, should be informed of the costs in riskless principal trades because, despite the legal distinctions, these trades are the functional equivalent of transactions effected on an agency basis. 8 17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(2) and 17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(7)(ii). 9 Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(4), 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(4), defines ``Reported Security'' as any exchange-listed equity security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are made available on a real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan. An ``effective transaction reporting plan'' refers to a transaction reporting plan that the Commission has approved pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1. 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1(a)(3). Reported Securities presently include: 1. Nasdaq securities that meet standards set forth in the National Market System Securities Designation Plan (``Nasdaq/NMS securities''). 2. Certain securities listed on a national securities exchange that meet standards of the transaction reporting plan known as the Restated Consolidated Tape Association Plan (``CTA Plan''). This would include securities that are registered or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange, including securities listed on various regional exchanges, and that substantially meet New York Stock Exchange, Inc (``NYSE'') or American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') original listing criteria. A number of securities that are quoted on Nasdaq and listed on certain regional stock exchanges, however, are not subject to an effective transaction reporting plan. Approximately 1,600 securities traded on Nasdaq do not satisfy the criteria for designation as a Nasdaq/NMS security, and thus are not part of an effective transaction reporting plan. Similarly, a limited number of regional-exchange listed securities are not covered by the CTA Plan. 10 17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(8)(i)(B). 11 ''Riskless'' principal trades are transactions in which, after receiving an order to buy or sell from a customer, the broker-dealer purchases the security from another person to offset a contemporaneous purchase by the customer or sells the security to another person to offset a contemporaneous sale by the customer. Although these transactions are characterized as riskless, they still involve counterparty risk. See Exchange Act Rule 15c3&hyph;1(a)(2)(vi), 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1(a)(2)(vi), (relating to net capital requirements). Rule 10b-10 currently does not require that a broker-dealer acting as a principal, other than in a ``riskless'' principal capacity, disclose the amount of mark-up for transactions in non-reported securities. But see, infra Section 3 for a discussion of mark-up disclosure requirements for non-reported securities that are subject to last-sale reporting. For purposes of clarity and to conform to Rule 15g-4, 17 CFR 240.15g-4 (requiring riskless principal disclosure for trades involving penny stocks), the Commission proposes to replace the term ``amount of any mark-up, mark-down, or similar remuneration received,'' currently used in Rule 10b-10, with ``difference between the price to the customer and such contemporaneous purchase or sale price.'' 12 17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(8)(i)(A). For purposes of this release, references to mark-ups are equally applicable to mark-downs or commission equivalents. In determining the broker-dealer's mark-ups for antifraud disclosure purposes, the Commission advises broker-dealers to note that the framework set forth in Alstead, Dempsey & Company, Inc., 47 S.E.C. 1034 (1984), governs the appropriate method for determining the prevailing market price in active or dominated and controlled markets. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29093 (Apr. 17, 1991), 56 FR 19165, for further discussion of Alstead in connection with proposed penny stock rules which are adopted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30608 (Apr. 20, 1992), 57 FR 18004.

Cir.) appeal dismissed per stipulation (applying the Alstead framework to case involving excessive mark-ups in a dominated and controlled market).
