Karevski: "The Desire for Luxury Led Them Into Crime"] [Text] Well-informed people in the city claim that the jailed policemen were known for their easy and attractive life, and that they intended to invest their rapidly acquired profits in private business. Among those jailed is one policeman from Serbia, who coordinated things from the other side of the border. Were people from Customs also involved in the smuggling? Bitola, 10 Feb--The discovery and arrest of a group of smugglers of luxury automobiles a few days ago in Bitola, and the scandal that was caused immediately afterward by the still not officially confirmed but also still undenied reports that several policemen from the Bitola UVR [Internal Affairs Administration] (at least one of them with the rank of police inspector) were also active members of that group, will probably be a distinction by which the first part of February will be remembered in this city for quite a long time to come. And if (in the interests of the investigation) the embargo continues on any official statements and information for the public, it will only intensify the latter's curiosity and imagination: It is precisely that ordinary public that is analyzing by itself in detail the entire case, seeking an answer to the question of how and to what extent crime has taken root among people in uniform. The Bitola public, especially people who say that they are thoroughly informed about the entire case, is already skeptical about the question of whether it really will be completely cleared up, since allegedly this has to do with a network of organized criminals much broader than the chain that was "broken" in Bitola, and because after the breaking of the "Bitola connection" those who "operated" in several other Macedonian cities are allegedly still in hiding. Furthermore, "those in the know" claim that a broader circle of policemen knew about the activity of the "Bitola connection," that they kept it quiet for the sake of their friends and colleages, but that in the end they nevertheless informed their superiors in the UVR, avoiding the risk that their passive attitude might involve them as accomplices. In any case, trying to be more precise, the Bitola public is now insisting on the "assertion" that there are four (already former) police officers from the local UVR in jail, and that among the jailed foreign citizens there is likewise one policeman (from the Republic of Serbia), who coordinated things from the other side of the border, and came to Macedonia in order to see the results of his involvement. It is now being said of the jailed Bitola policemen that they are fairly young, that they were well known in the city for being in love with an expensive, easy, and attractive life, and reasons are being sought here for their going over to the other side of the law. "Working" then on intensive smuggling, exclusively of luxury automobiles (those involved were mostly of the Mercedes, BMW, Golf, and Ford makes, and only one Renault-5), they apparently succeeded in acquiring considerable amounts of foreign exchange. Allegedly, as much as 180,000 German marks [DM] was found on one of the people arrested and was confiscated from him, and they also had a certain number of unsold cars "in stock." "Those in the know" say that the former policemen intended to invest their quickly acquired profits in opening private enterprises, and that the world of private business was their main vision, and thus, even without the police action, the Bitola smuggling chain would have collapsed on its own. That the ex-policemen really did intend to resign not only from smuggling but also from the police profession, according to the "information" of the Bitola public, is also confirmed by the (allegedly) regularly performed procedures for the registration of private enterprises. The problem arose, however, when the people simply forget to stop when faced with the magical rustling of green banknotes. In any case, spurred by the statements that the investigation is constantly encountering new elements, the Bitola public is now also talking about new arrests and jailings. Solely on the basis of the "logical assumption" that the entry of the smuggled automobiles into Macedonia would have been impossible without the involvement of people from Customs as well, they are manipulating the "facts" that several people are "losing" their careers there as well, and the list of accomplices among ordinary citizens who allegedly also had vital functions in the criminal chain through their own occupations is expanding greatly. In any case, however, the investigation is under way.
