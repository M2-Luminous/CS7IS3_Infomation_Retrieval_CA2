But one area where the Dunkel draft failed was textiles. Specifically it failed to put the slow death of the Multifibre Arrangement on the fast track. This was a triumph of Northern vested interest politics over economic sense and Southern demands. The MFA was a protectionist intruder in GATT. Put together in 1973 the MFA was supposed to provide a temporary breathing space for a Western textile industry about to be inundated by a flood of Third World imports. But it was renewed repeatedly. One of the main points of the Dunkel draft was to kill the MFA by incorporating textiles into GATT. That absorption would mean the textile trade would be hampered only by low tariff barriers rather than the MFA's arbitrary and restrictive quota system. The key question was the schedule under which MFA would be withdrawn--how long would the entire process take and what percentage of textiles would be shifted from MFA to GATT during each phase. Third World exporters like India and Pakistan went to GATT urging the phase-out period end in 1997. The US domestic textile industry preferred AD 2008. The European Union wanted 2001. In the end the Western nations negotiated among themselves and came up with 2003. In addition, they were able to force a three-year "transition" period on top of this making the MFA's actual death date 2006. The South was forced to swallow this bitter pill. Equally unbalanced was the percentage of textiles affected during each of the three phases. The third world had wanted 20 per cent in the first phase, 25 in the second and 30 in the last--over 10 years. Instead the GATT treaty provides 16, 17 and 18 per cent. This means that all the way until 2006, at least 49 per cent of textile exports will be governed by nation-by-nation quotas. Again there was little choice. The Asian cloth kings have grumbled loudly at this act of hypocrisy by a West that preaches the benefits of a free market to them. But threatening the US with homemade versions of Super 301 would be the subject of good comedy, not good economic policy. India accomplished none of its set goals, in particular an accelerated phase-out schedule. Much of the supposed "successes" New Delhi is touting such as an increased US textile import quota are little more than token sops. However, it is right when it says granting market access to US textile exports will have no impact on India's domestic industry. The US has had such access under the 1992-97 Indian import policy, but sold almost nothing. Its makers cannot compete with India's except in brand name designer labels like "Arrow" or "Lacoste." In addition, Mr Bill Clinton had made a Faustian pact with US domestic textile makers. In order to get the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through Congress, he promised them that demands for a fore-shortening of the MFA's lifespan would be resisted. Though he failed to get 15 years he was able to get 13, which was almost as good. He quite ignored the fact that the MFA by 1986 alone was estimated to have cost the US consumer $40 billion through artificially high prices. One reason the North had its way was the complete inability of the South to put up a united front. Sri Lanka, for example, preferred the MFA because its quota system guaranteed it exports. Under a free trade GATT regime it would have to compete with more efficient producers like India. The unspoken truth, US and Indian industry analysts say, is that if the MFA were banned overnight it would not necessarily be India that would benefit the most. Compared to the state-of-the-art textile makers of Hong Kong and southeast Asia, Indian industry is still a few steps behind. Though 13 years is too long, India needs a breathing space as well.
