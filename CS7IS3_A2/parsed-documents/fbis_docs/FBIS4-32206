Taking into account what is currently happening in Europe, in certain countries that are in our immediate neighborhood, and our geopolitical position, it is only natural to try and find out whether we are safe, if we can or cannot ensure our national security, and also, what domestic and external factors might threaten our country. Therefore, we turned to Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state with the Ministry of National Defense, who granted us an interview on this issue: [Filip] Recently, two documents have been issued: "The Integrated Concept for Romania's National Security" and "Romania's Defense Military Doctrine." What can you tell us about these two documents? [Pascu] The first draft of "The Integrated Concept for Romania's National Security" was compiled by experts representing all institutions that have responsibility in ensuring national security, in accordance with a modern and multidimensional understanding of the concept of security. This first draft was submitted to the Supreme Council of the Country's Defense [CSAT] and was reviewed after the establishment of the Partnership for Peace and the statute of associate partner offered to Romania by the Western European Union. It is the duty of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to finalize the document. As far as the "Military Doctrine on Romania's Defense" is concerned, it was drafted by a group of experts in the Ministry of National Defense and discussed later within the CSAT, a council in which other institutions that have a role in ensuring the military defense of the country are also represented. [Filip] What was the starting point for the integrated concept for national security and on what is this concept based? [Pascu] The concept is based on a careful examination both of the international situation, in areas that are farther from or closer to Romania, on the profound transformations that have taken place and continue to take place in the respective areas and at home. The major conclusion of this examination, which is also the fundamental requirement of the efforts to ensure national security, is that currently and for quite a long time to come Romania has no allies and no dependable security guarantees. In addition to this, being in the middle of a process of domestic transition, this process has inevitably reduced the capability to ensure our own security alone, in a situation in which we are located in an area characterized by a high degree of potential conflict. [Filip] What are the major reasons for Romania's lack of security? [Pascu] I believe that the most important reason is the fact that, if until 1989 the threats against Romania's security, as a member of the Warsaw Pact, were clearly outlined and were mainly external, today they have lost their distinctness and the major danger is the possibility that internal weaknesses might be exploited. The "Integrated Concept..." assesses the internal high risk factors among which we can mention Romania's economic situation, the social costs of transition, the decline in the society's cohesion, the emergence and increase of new unconventional risks (misappropriation and smuggling of weapons and ammunition, drugs, illegal migration, smuggling of all kinds of products, group violence, and all kinds of terrorist actions, and so forth) as well as the deterioration in the quality of the environment.... [Filip] Excuse me for interrupting, but what is the connection between the environment and national security? [Pascu] This is the first time that this element has been included in the concept of national security. The quality of the environment can affect our security by damaging over the long term people's health and their natural living conditions. How? Through toxic wastes, disturbance of the ecological balance, accidents, and sabotage in important economic facilities, including the nuclear one. [Filip] What measures are envisaged to cope with all the domestic risk factors? [Pascu] In general, we need the concerted action of all political and social forces to ensure the consolidation of the country. The national interest is above the interest of political parties or other types of social groups. We need a structural and functional consolidation in the democratic and constitutional framework of the state, of the central and local public authorities, of public institutions, and political and social pluralism. I am referring to the need to ensure efficiency and the continuity of the process of economic-structural reform, to introduce the market economy, and to ensure the proper functioning of the national economy, also in special situations (war, natural disasters, or nuclear accidents). In conclusion, one can say that there is a direct connection between the reform process and national security. The success of reform cannot be ensured without national security and in order to ensure security we definitely need to bring the reform to a successful conclusion. [Filip] What are the major external risk factors? [Pascu] As has already been mentioned, the danger of armed aggression from the outside has been considerably reduced, however, the danger generated by foreign interference and pressures on Romania continues to prevail. I would like to repeat, the exploitation of the domestic situation is the major risk. That is why the "Military Doctrine for Romania's Defense" clearly states that "combined aggressive actions, that is, the organization and deployment of foreign military forces on the grounds of potential domestic aggressive actions, represents the most dangerous type of actions." [Filip] Nevertheless, would you please enumerate a few external risk factors? [Pascu] The emergence and intensification of certain conflicts or other forms of tension and the presence of certain areas with a higher level of political and military instability in Romania's proximity also increase our risks of insecurity. The state of tension and major crises in areas neighboring Romania can endanger internal stability through the emergence of massive waves of refugees, through the economic consequences of the act of suspending economic relations with certain countries, as a result of the conflict, or through losses provoked by the observance of certain decisions of international bodies to which we also belong. [Filip] Does not the stability plan adopted recently in Paris reduce the number of external risk factors? [Pascu] The stability plan, according to the intention of its initiators, is a process of preventive diplomacy. Except that I personally believe that to qualify this plan as "preventive" also indicates that attempts are made to anticipate certain negative states of affair. However, if they have not occurred so far, it means that this is due to the action of certain factors that might be perturbed precisely by this attempt to anticipate them. There is a saying in German: Better is the enemy of good. In other words, let us try not to provoke certain situations by attempts to prevent them.... [Filip] But what about the agreement on the reduction of conventional weapons and troops in Europe? Is it a risk factor or a guarantee for Romania's national security? [Pascu] In connection with this accord, one can say that, even at the time when it was concluded, it no longer reflected the situation that generated it. For example, in the NATO-Warsaw Pact military balance, Romania was considered a country of secondary importance and the limits established for our country reflected this statute. But now, one can say that all the countries that were members of the Warsaw Pact have become countries of major importance, considering the increased degree of insecurity in the common area where they are situated. [Filip] And does it affect us? [Pascu] The accord represents the basis for military security on our continent, at least for the time being. There has already been pressure from some signatory countries (Russia for example) to modify certain stipulations regarding deployment. I believe that in spite of the aforementioned shortcomings, the act of abandoning the accord would result in unforeseeable negative consequences for European security and for each country respectively. [Filip] There are some who believe that the Partnership for Peace as well as the Paris Accord in reality would aim at achieving Romania's disarmament, the dismantling of our military industry, and placing Romania clearly in a position of inferiority. What is your opinion of all this? [Pascu] I am glad that you use the expression "there are some who believe" because a great number of "stories," some more interesting than others, have been circulating and will continue to circulate about Partnership for Peace. This is also happening in other former Warsaw Pact member countries. I do not doubt that the military industry in developed countries has a certain interest in attempting to overcome current difficulties by delivering weapons to the Eastern markets. However, at the same time, I would like to stress that the Partnership for Peace is a competition in which all of the competitors' security factors, including the military industry, are being maximally used. Moreover, at least as far as Romania is concerned, the position adopted -- which reflects a strategy in this area -- is to maintain the capacity of military production in spite of participation in the Partnership for Peace. [Filip] Taking into account the competition that has been created, Romania's position, and the military production capacity, how do you regard the budget allotted to the Army? Is it a risk factor against national security? [Pascu] Yes and no. Yes, because it cannot be increased to the level of our requirements at the moment for tangible reasons. No, because it is designated precisely to counteract risks against security. [Filip] Romania's geopolitical position raises problems. Some nations are afraid of a possible invasion from the direction in which Romania is situated, others regard positively Romania's geographic location. It is certain that the chance to play a military and political role in the area brings us both advantages but also disadvantages. What do you think about that? [Pascu] I would proceed from the assessment made by General Joulwan, commander of NATO forces, when he visited Romania. He said that Romania "is an important country in a strategic area." Certainly, this is a double-edged situation, as you very well remarked. However, I believe that, if there is enough political maturity and political skill -- which Romania in general has never lacked -- the positive part will prevail over the negative part. [Filip] The visit paid by General Grachev generated various reactions, some affirming that Russia is trying to maintain its influence over Romania. In general, our political leaders are reserved when it comes to our relations with Moscow. Why? [Pascu] General Grachev's visit also emphasizes in a way the same thing that General Joulwan said, namely that Romania is an important country in a strategic area. If we were to evaluate things strictly from a technical viewpoint, than it becomes clear why Russia does not wish to completely lose its influence over its former allies. However, at the same time, the reservations that you are talking about reflect a certain need for serious and credible proof from Russia that the efforts it is making so as not to lose completely its influence over its former allies does not mean the old Soviet behavior. In general, not only in the case of Romania, Russia's behavior is carefully observed and examined, precisely in order to be able to distinguish those changes for the better that the Russian political factors are emphasizing in their dialogue with us, former allies. [Filip] Will we join NATO regardless of Moscow's position? [Pascu] A first aspect that I would like to stress here is that this move of Romania's has no greater or lesser importance for Russia than in the case of other countries. The second aspect would be that the problem of including all former Warsaw Pact countries in NATO is subordinate to another goal, which I believe is more important for Russia, namely that of obtaining relations of strategic partnership with the Atlantic Alliance. That is the reason, at least in theoretical terms, why Russia could give in as far as the association of certain former allied countries to NATO structures is concerned, if, by paying this "price" it could obtain more easily the statute of "strategic partner." As a matter of fact, NATO is also engaged in discussions with Russia on this issue, trying to achieve a weakening of Russia's resistance on the issue of the association of certain Eastern and Central European countries to its structures. [Filip] Given your position and the information that you possess, do you believe that we can set our minds at rest as far as the future of Romania's national security is concerned? [Pascu] Apart from unforeseeable events, which unfortunately will continue to appear in the near or more distant future, I believe that, even if we talk about the medium and long term, we can set our minds at rest on this issue and also on Romania's integration in European and Euro-Atlantic security structures.
