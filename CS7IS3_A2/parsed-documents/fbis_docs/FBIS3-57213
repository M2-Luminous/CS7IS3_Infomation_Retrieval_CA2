Due to a lack of applications only five plots of land were auctioned, all of them with the right to be leased for enterprises, instead of the proposed 16, eight of which were granted planning permission to build individual houses and eight to build market infrastructure facilities. A UNIAN correspondent was informed at the Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange that only two plots were sold at the auction, 1,500 and 2,500 square meters in the city center for 700 and 800 million karbovantsi respectively. They were sold at three times the starting price. It is envisaged that in future such auctions will be held regularly. Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the course of the auction, the head of the regional state administration, People's Deputy Yevhen Kushnaryov, stated that privatizing land by auctioning was quite ineffective because privatization processes were "hounded out" to become a shadow phenomenon, and were being carried out with official channels by semi-criminal or openly criminal methods. In an exclusive interview with another UNIAN correspondent, Leonid Vasylchenko, the president of the United Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange, noted that the auction was held in accordance with the legislation and no violation of it was recorded.
