FR940304-2-00166 FR940304-2-00087 [Release No. 34&hyph;33692; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Amending the Net Capital Requirements in Rule 703 February 28, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on January 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx proposes to amend Rule 703 (Financial Responsibility and Reporting) to correspond to recent Commission amendments to SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;1 (``SEC Net Capital Rule''). 1 Pursuant to these amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, all specialists, except options market makers, who are currently exempt from the net capital requirements of Rule 703, will be subject to a minimum net capital requirement of $100,000. 2 As a result, the Exchange believes that the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule require the deletion of Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v). Currently Rule 703 (a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset 3 requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are both equity and options specialists. 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737 (August 11, 1993), 58 FR 43555 (August 17, 1993). 2 In addition, for certain purposes under the SEC Net Capital Rule, certain specialists will be exempt from the application of the rules haircut and undue concentration charges with respect to their specialty securities. Id. 3 ``Net liquid assets'' is defined in Phlx Rule 703(b). The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 703 to require each member organization and participant organization to notify the Exchange if it fails to maintain the minimum net capital required by the SEC Net Capital rule or it fails to maintain liquid assets in accordance with Phlx Rule 703. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to add a new paragraph (v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or participant organization to promptly notify the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii) or (iv) ( i.e., former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)). Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried in the account. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Phlx, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments to received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On August 11, 1993, the Commission adopted amendments to its rules regarding minimum net capital requirements for broker-dealers. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market makers, that previously were exempt from this rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule will become effective on April 1, 1994. The Phlx represents that the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule will have the following effects on Phlx specialists: instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as both equity and options specialists, the SEC's minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply. As a result, existing paragraphs (iii)&hyph;(v) of Phlx Rule 703(a) are proposed to be deleted. Certain aspects of both the SEC Net Capital Rule and Rule 703 remain unchanged. Options market makers, who remain exempt from the net capital rule, continue to be subject to the financial requirements of Phlx Rule 703. New paragraph (a)(iii), which was previously paragraph (a)(vi), requires $25,000 in net liquid assets for market makers without a letter of guarantee; and new paragraph (a)(iv), which was previously paragraph (a)(vii), requires market makers with a letter of guarantee issued by a clearing member organization to maintain positive equity. In addition, Rule 703(a)(ii) continues to require net liquid assets of $25,000 upon admission.
