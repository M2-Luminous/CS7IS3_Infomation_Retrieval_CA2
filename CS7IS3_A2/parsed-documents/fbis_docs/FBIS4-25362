Gao Junyue, general manager of the airline, said it was impossible to figure out the cause of the accident before all the data in the black box flight recorder, which was found largely intact at the crash site, was analyzed. This could not be completed in just a few days. Gao said the Russian producer of the Tupolev-154 jet will send investigators to China soon, at the invitation of the Chinese Government. The general manager said the airline will compensate each domestic victim 70,000 yuan ($8,090), as stipulated by a 1993 regulation issued by the State Council. Families of victims from outside the Chinese mainland will receive $40,000. The People's Insurance Company of China will pay another 100,000 yuan ($11,500) to each victim who had bought insurance from them before boarding the flight. It was not known how many of them had done so. Gao said the crew reported, just two minutes after the plane's 8:12 am take-off from Xian to Guangzhou, that the plane was swaying uncontrollably. At 8:19, the crew said the shaking became more violent at an altitude of 3,600 m and they demanded to return to the airport. The authorities granted their request and opened the runway and nearby airports for a possible emergency landing. Gao said witnesses reported one or two thunder-like explosions in the clouds and saw the plane hitting the ground in three large pieces: The nose, part of the fuselage and the tail. Debris was later found scattered across a 2-square-km area. He said it was the first time in China's aviation history that a passenger airliner had blown up in midair. Gao said the plane underwent a major overhaul in 1992 and had flown 2,857 hours since then. It had flown a total of 10,000 hours. The Russian producer said the plane was considered to be still new, as it was designed to fly 30,000 hours. On June 3, the plane was reported to have some malfunctions. It was soon repaired and was determined in test flying to be satisfactory. Monday's fatal trip was its first formal flight since then. Gao said the unidentified foreign passenger on Monday was an Australian instead of a Swiss as previously reported.
