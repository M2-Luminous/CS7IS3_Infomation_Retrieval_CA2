Yegor Gaydar, speaking at the opening of the congress, said that the party's fundamental task was to create the prerequisites for stable economic development. In his words, present economic policy could place Russia in the position of a country under colonial rule within five years. At the same time, Gaydar stressed that the new party will not join the opposition to the government, although it does not support it completely. [Begin Gaydar recording] Our position toward the government was formulated a long time ago. We support a coalition government: The government is fragmentary. We support individual areas of the government's work, including those in which members of our faction are working, some of whom are involved in the creation of our party. Privatization policy is just one obvious example. But we are not prepared to take responsibility for the essence and content of official economic policy. On the whole we do not support it. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Announcer] As for relations with other parties, answering a question from Ekho Moskvy, Yegor Gaydar said the following: [Begin Gaydar recording] Of course our party's allies, in the Duma at least, are the 12 December faction and, on the whole, the Yabloko faction. Neither of these parties yet has its own developed political structure, but nevertheless, we regard them as our allies. As for the Democratic Party of Russia and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, these are not our allies. They are parties defending essentially different plans for Russia's future. In the Democratic Party there is undoubtedly a very strong element of playing on great-power sentiments. There are many points on which we disagree with the Party of Russia and Accord. But of course we are ready for dialogue with them. [end recording] [passage omitted]
