A portion of the circle that has been, until now, well disposed toward Labuda, criticized her for the statement that those who put the concordat together "must have been convinced that the church is the lord of the state." In her opinion, there is no trace of a partnership between Poland and the Vatican in the document. Barbara Labuda is 48 years old. She completed the Department of Romance Philology at Wroclaw University and studied literary history, sociology, and political science in France for three years. After her return to Poland, she worked as an assistant at her alma mater. In 1984, following her earlier forced dismissal from work, she defended her doctoral dissertation. Beginning in 1976, she was active in KOR [Committee for the Defense of the Workers], whose ideas she propagated during her stay in France. She was the organizer of the Workers University [Wszechnica Pracownicza] and the "Tygiel" discussion club. She also organized the political club "Freedom, Justice, Independence." She participated in the work of the NSZZ Solidarity Regional Strike Committee of Lower Silesia and the TKK (Provisional Coordinating Committee [part of the Solidarity underground]) throughout Poland. As adviser to the Lower Silesia Solidarity, she had to go into hiding when martial law was declared. She was arrested together with Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and was sentenced to prison for one and a half years. After her release, she continued to be active in the Solidarity underground. She was one of the leaders of ROAD [Citizens Movement-Democratic Action, founded in early 1990, forerunner to the Democratic Union (UD)]. While heading the Parliamentary Women's Group, she initiated the resolution governing the draft referendum allowing for abortions. Labuda is married and has one son.
