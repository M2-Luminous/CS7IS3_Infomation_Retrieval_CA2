The judgment of first instance was made earlier today by the intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city in east China's Zhejiang Province. The court ruled that the facts of the crimes were clear and the evidence was complete. The court verdict, read out by Yang Gang, president of the intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city, said that Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun had committed robbery and murder in the boat-fire tragedy, which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, a major tourist attraction in Zhejiang Province. It said that the three men seized large quantities of the tourists' property by threatening them with violence and then murdered the victims by blowing up the boat and setting fire to it to cover up the crime, and the punishment was for both robbery and murder. The court turned down the defence lawyers' appeal for lenient punishment, because the crimes were very serious, cruel and caused great harm to the society. The court also ordered that the robbed goods and money be returned to relatives of the victims, and the motor boat used by the criminals be confiscated and turned over to the state. According to law, the three accused can appeal, either through the intermediate court of Hangzhou city or directly, to the higher people's court of Zhejiang Province within three days after they received the verdicts, which had already been handed to them today. More than 200 people were present to hear the judgment at the court today, including local residents, relatives of victims from the mainland, and representatives of the Soaring Travel Service of Taiwan.
