The decision due on March 21 will determine whether the international community continues to pursue peaceful dialogue with North Korea or seeks punitive measures through the UN Security Council. While the likelihood of the latter option is higher now, the inclination in Seoul is still toward dialogue. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wasted no time in briefing its board of governors on the status of two-week inspections in North Korea that ended Tuesday. IAEA inspectors hurried back to Vienna and reported directly to Director-General Hans Blix, who immediately briefed the governor states. A statement issued after the briefing said "important measures " agreed between the agency and North Korea had not been carried out at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, widely regarded as a reprocessing plant and the core of Pyongyang's suspected nuclear program. The IAEA went to North Korea to verify that the stalinist state had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses since the last visit in August, but after the fortnight of inspections, the agency ruled it "was not in a position to verify." In a wild twist, the North Korean nuclear situation has gone back beyond the starting point -- March 12 last year when Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Before then, at least, the seals on equipment at the radiochemical laboratory were intact and the IAEA had full access to all of North Korea's seven declared sites including this lab. It's becoming clearer by the day that Pyongyang is pressing Washington to hold the promised third round of high-level dialogue while giving the bare minimum in return. Seoul officials say this is why North Korea allowed something approaching -- but not quite -- full IAEA inspections and why Pyongyang keeps alive the inter-Korean dialogue while blocking progress on an envoy exchange, one precondition to the high-level talks. The IAEA convenes a special board of governors meeting next Monday. The likelihood of the agency declaring a break in North Korean safeguards is low because the political consequences would be too heavy. Such a declaration would automatically send the issue to the UN Security Council and start a process leading up to gradual economic sanctions. Officials here say the decision is entirely up to the IAEA, but the agency won't be able to ignore the views of Seoul and Washington, which still see room for negotiation. Seoul is expected to continue working-level dialogue with Pyongyang on exchanging envoys, helping fulfill this precondition. Washington is likely to contact Pyongyang and press for further IAEA negotiations on checking the restricted installations so that they can go ahead with the high-level meeting, even if it is postponed to after March 21.
