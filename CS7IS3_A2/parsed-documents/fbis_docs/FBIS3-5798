Last week the VP helped to elect Jean-Marie Leye, candidate of the main ruling party, the Union of Moderate Parties, president of Vanuatu after two earlier attempts had failed. In return for this help in the electoral college vote, the VP asked for four ministries in the government, including the finance and lands portfolios. Later Prime Minister Maxime Carlot said the opposition party would get "at least two" ministerial portfolios. But government sources said the offer made in writing Friday by Carlot contained only one ministerial portfolio, labour and training -- which was to be created -- and two parliamentary posts, leader of government business and first deputy speaker. VP coordinator Peter Taurakoto told AFP Tuesday that his party had refused the offer because it was not in line with the verbal "gentleman's agreement" between Kalpokas and Carlot. "The door is not closed and we're still ready to help if the government sees there is a need," Taurakoto said. The ruling coalition government has 24 members in the 46-seat house where the VP has nine members. Leye was elected March 2 by 41 of the 55-member electoral college.
