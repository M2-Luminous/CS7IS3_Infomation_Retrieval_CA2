"We are in the South-East Asia arms market for the first time after 30 years' absence, having cut it all back after the events in Indonesia in 1965," he said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. According to Anatoliy Khmelnitskiy, deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Second Department for Asia, the contract was finally agreed "literally just a few hours ago" and there are no outstanding issues. It remains only to sign the document, which will happen on 7 June. The first Russian fighter will be supplied in April next year. Full implementation of the project is calculated to take 25 years, as it concerns creating a broad infrastructure in Malaysia. There has been a fierce struggle since 1992 among major foreign arms producing companies for the Malaysia contract, which Russia has won. Now, after Malaysia, there are specific proposals coming from other countries in the region, Anatoliy Khmelnitskiy said. We need to be quick, the market is full of offers, the Russian diplomat stressed.
