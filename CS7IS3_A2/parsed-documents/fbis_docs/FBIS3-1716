This has pushed the Sino-British talks to a state in which it cannot be saved [wu fa wan hui di jing di]. The following is a roundup prepared by our station reporter: "The Hong Kong Issue Has Become a Focus of Attention in Beijing." On the same day the British Government published the white paper and the Legco adopted the partial political reform package, the spokesmen of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office separately issued statements, pointing out that the British side has closed the door to the Sino-British talks. The spokesmen said: Prior to the opening of the talks, both China and Hong Kong had reached an understanding of not disclosing the contents of the talks. The British Government in Hong Kong has acted in disregard of the repeated advice from the Chinese side and the wishes of all circles of Hong Kong that China and Britain resolve the question on the arrangements for the 1994-95 election through negotiations. This has fully demonstrated that the British side is not sincere about cooperating with the Chinese side to resolve the Hong Kong issue. On 24 and 25 February, the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee held a special group meeting in Beijing. The meeting attracted numerous reporters from Mainland China and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The special meeting, held by the Political Affairs Group, mainly discussed and studied the relationship between the administrative and legislative organs in Hong Kong after 1997, the measures for the creation of the first government, and other issues. Under the current circumstance, the Political Affairs Group, which was established by the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] to study the future of Hong Kong, is playing an increasingly noticeable role. Xiao Weiyun, head of the Political Affairs Group, told reporters that Chris Patten's political reform program violates the Sino-British declaration, the HKSAR Basic Law, and agreements reached between China and Britain. In the face of the fact that his political reform program has been approved, there is no doubt that the Chinese Government will set up a separate kitchen [ling qi lu zao] based on the basic law. For this purpose, the PWC will step up its preparatory work in a concrete way to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and its long-term stability and prosperity. On the evening of 25 February, Chinese Premier Li Peng, Vice Chairmen Li Lanqing, and Zou Jiahua, as well as other state leaders attended a soiree sponsored by the PWC to celebrate the arrival of spring. Premier Li Peng made an impromptu speech at the soiree. Speaking of Hong Kong's situation, he said that China today is no longer what it was 150 years ago. At present, China has a growing economy and enjoys political stability. We are full of confidence in China's future. In his speech, the premier once again emphasized that no matter what happens, the Chinese Government will not change its determination to resume Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong will definitely achieve a smooth transition and long-term stability and prosperity.
