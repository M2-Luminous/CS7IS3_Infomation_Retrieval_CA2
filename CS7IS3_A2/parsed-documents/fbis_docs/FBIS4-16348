The first round did not produce a large number of new parliamentarians (only 49), and it would have been risky to predict the composition of the new Supreme Council on the basis of these results. However, it is worthwhile to recall who the first winners were. Two well-known democrats were elected in Kiev in the first round --Volodymyr Lanovyy and Serhiy Holovatyy. To everyone's surprise, the only outright winner in Crimea, Valentyn Horbatov, the chairman of an agrofirm (i.e., collective farm), was appointed the presidential representative to the restive peninsula, provoking a stormy reaction from the Republican Movement of Crimea [RDK]. The winners in the first round in Luhansk Oblast were six Communists and one private businessman, and in Donetsk Oblast, five Socialists/Communists (including Petro Symonenko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the CPU), a representative of the Liberal Party [LPU], and the well-known independent incumbent deputy to the Supreme Council of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shekhovtsov. The Communists won one seat each in Odessa and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, and Volodymyr Marchenko, a leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU], won a seat in Sumy Oblast. A candidate from yet another "leftist" party, the so-called Peasants' Party of Ukraine [SelPU], won a seat in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In Chernihiv Oblast, the first round brought victories to the well-known Leonid Kuchma and Ivan Plyushch, in Zhytomyr Oblast, to Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko, and in Zakarpattya Oblast, to Transport Minister Orest Klimpush. In Kiev Oblast, fate smiled on two collective farm chairmen. Voters in the western part of the country painted an entirely different picture. In Lviv Oblast, seats were won in the first round by four representatives of the New Wave alliance (including Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk), two Rukh members (one of them, Les Tanyuk), one representative of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN], one independent candidate, and Stepan Khmara, the leader of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. In Ternopil Oblast, seats were won by Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil and by one representative each from the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP], KUN, and the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA] (a few days before the election in Ternopil Oblast, a candidate who was a sympathizer of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense Force [UNA-UNSO] was seriously injured by a shot to the head). The winners in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast included the leader of the local KUN, as well as a whole group of prominent political figures, headed by People's Deputy of Ukraine Stepan Volkovetskyy, the chairman of the oblast council (it was he who invited Volodymyr Pylypchuk, the distinguished economist, Pavlo Movchan, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Prosvita [Enlightenment] Society, Volodymyr Mulyava, hetman of the Ukrainian Cossacks, and Yevhen Pronyuk, chairman of the Union of Former Victims of Repression in kraine, to run for office in this oblast to spite Vyacheslav Chornovil). These newly elected people's deputies were supported by the Ukraine Bloc, headed by Levko Lukyanenko. In Bukovyna [i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], Heorhiy Filipchuk, a democrat who heads the oblast administration of education, won a seat in the first round, while Oleksandr Skipalsky, chief of the Main Directorate of Military Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, who had the support of KUN and URP, won in Volyn Oblast. The clearly defined division between west and east was disturbed by another democrat -- Hryhoriy Omelchenko, the chief of the Ukrainian Security Service's Directorate for Combatting Corruption and Organized Crime, who was elected in industrial Kremenchuk (Poltava Oblast). Nor was there a shortage of distinguished losers in the first round. Those who will not sit in the new parliament include the well-known Socialists/Communists Oleksandr Kotsyuba (defeated in Vinnytsya) and Serhiy Dorohuntsov (defeated in Kiev), as well as the equally well-known Ukrainophobe, Oleksandr Charodyeyev (Donetsk). Another Ukrainophobe, Valeriy Meshcheryakov, the leader of the chauvinistic Civic Congress of Ukraine (GKU) (he conducted his campaign in Kharkiv under the slogan: "Valera [Valeriy] -- yes! Bandera -- no!), advanced to the second round together with Volodymyr Hrynyov, the well-known cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR], but then took fright and quit the race. Also among the losers in Kharkiv were the once popular Henrikh Altunyan and Andriy Sukhorukov, as well as Yuriy Haysynskyy, the former deputy procurator general, notorious for his shady deals. Valeriy Ivasyuk, the well-known Rukh activist, was defeated in Poltava Oblast, and Dmytro Pavlychko was eliminated in Cherkasy Oblast (incidentally, he was but one of eight chairmen of the old Supreme Council's standing commissions who failed to advance past the first round of voting). In Zakarpattya, both the leader of the post-Communists, Mykhaylo Voloshchuk (former first secretary of the oblast committee of the CPU and former chairman of the oblast council), and the leader of the democrats, Viktor Bed, were defeated. In Lviv, Mykhaylo Horyn, the leader of the URP, lost to Stepan Khmara. Other deputies to the old Supreme Council who failed to advance past the first round of voting in Lviv Oblast were Ihor Derkach, Ihor Hryniv, Ivan Makar, Mykhaylo Shvayka, Lyubomyra Boychyshyn, the wife of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn and the hope of Rukh, Yuriy Shukhevych, the leader of the UNA, Academician Volodymyr Chernyak, the well-known Rukh economist, and the equally well-known former political prisoner and champion of the rights of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Ivan Hel. Four deputies to the old parliament were defeated in Ternopil Oblast, and the same number lost in Ivano-Frankivsk. Five former deputies lost their seats in Volyn Oblast, where the leaders of the local Rukh and URP battled each other furiously in one district and were both defeated (the seat was won by Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy). Among those failing to advance to the second round in Western Ukraine were the minister of forestry, the deputy minister of energy, the former deputy minister of finance, and the distinguished economist, Mykola Syvulskyy. In Rivne, the much anticipated victory did not materialize for Valeriy Korotkov, the very rich but not very well-disposed to Ukraine Russian businessman with a criminal past (as was later revealed, the money that he spent so lavishly on his campaign came from the $300,000 that he had misappropriated from funds received for a different purpose from the American company, Communications and Computer Services of Nevada). With respect to the contingent that advanced to the second round, both P. Symonenko, the leader of the CPU, and V. Chornovil, leader of Rukh, could be happy about the results. Of the more than 200 candidates that the Central Leaderhip of Rukh supported, 91 made it through the first round (this number does not include the democratic candidates that were not on this list). The picture in Kiev was particularly heartening (despite the overall apathy of the capital's electorate). Here, the candidates from the list described above advanced past the first obstacle in 20 of 23 districts. Four candidates from the URP and the Congress of National Democratic Forces [KNDS] also advanced to the second round in the capital, and the same number from the UNA. The Communists stood a chance to win in only four districts. In Donetsk Oblast, however, there were only four electoral districts in which candidates from the openly "leftist" parties (CPU, SPU, SelPU) failed to advance to the second round. In four districts, both the candidates who advanced to the second round were "leftists." In the rest of the districts, they were opposed either by candidates from the "Party of Power," or the "Red" directors' Party of Labor, or the Movement for the Restoration of the USSR, and only here and there, by individual businessmen. In Luhansk Oblast, true "Reds" failed to advance in only one district. In four districts, both candidates were "Reds," and in the rest, their opponents were for the most part people from the "Party of Power," the chauvinistic GKU, or the Russian "Don Cossacks." The Communists advanced to the second round in 13 of Crimea's 23 districts (in two districts, their victory s guaranteed), and candidates from Meshkov's Republican Movement of Crimea advanced in three other districts. There were, to be sure, also three candidates from Ukrainian organizations and two from the Crimean-Tatar Mejiles. Competing in the second round of voting in Kharkiv's 14 electoral district, were 12 candidates from Hrynyov-Kuchma's MBR and their allies, nine Socialists/Communists, two chauvinists from the GKU, and two national-democrats (interestingly, on 27 March, immediately following the election, Kharkiv's "Reds" held a press conference, at which they promised that as soon as they came to power they would "put up against the wall [i.e., execute] first Khmara and Chornovil, followed by Kravchuk and Plyushch and all speculators, businessmen, and journalists"). In Odessa, in addition to three Communists, one member of the GKU, and numerous "independents," the candidates included Viktor Shyshkin, the former procurator general, Valentyn Symonenko, counsellor to the president (leader of one of the local clans), Pavlo Kudyukin, the notorious president of the Blasko Shipping Company (which swallowed up the Black Sea Shipping Company), two local political and commercial authorities who are fierce rivals -- Eduard Hurvits, a Jew, and Oleksiy Kostusyev, a Russian -- and Anatoliy Vasserman, an aggressive supporter of an independent "Novorosiya." The picture in the west was quite different. The first round of voting in Galicia showed clearly that the Communists had lost. Although their andidate received 20 percent of the vote in one electoral district of Ivano-Frankivsk, and another in Lviv got close to 15 percent, they were opposed by such "big guns" as V. Pylypchuk and V. Pynzenyk, who deprived them of any chance of victory. The candidates of the newly created party of Social-Nationalists also lost in all 21 districts of Lviv Oblast. Clad in their black shirts bearing an emblem resembling a swastika, they also failed to win the voters' confidence. In Lviv Oblast, six candidates from Rukh, six from KUN, four from URP, two from UNA, one New Wave candidate, and several representatives of smaller parties advanced to the second round. The situation in Ternopil Oblast was as follows: Rukh -- four candidates, URP -- four, UKRP -- one, and three "independents." In Forecarpathia [i.e., Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast], where parties do not wield much influence for some reason, there were seven "independent" candidates, one from KUN, two supported by Rukh, one member of the Democratic Party of Ukraine [DemPU], and one from the so-called Nationalistic Rukh. In Zakarpattya Oblast, not a single openly "Red" candidate made it through the first round, and only three democrats advanced to the second round. Instead, there were five representatives of the "Party of Power," five businessmen, and three representatives of the Hungarian community. In Bukovyna [i.e. Chernivtsi Oblast], one Communist was offset by five national-democrats, six members of the "Party of Power," one member of New Ukraine, and one representative of the Rumanians. In Volyn and Rivne oblasts, of the candidates who advanced to the second round, nine were from leftist parties (or supported by them), 11 were representatives of the "Party of Power," six were Rukh members, five were Republicans, and one was a member of KUN. In the rest of of Ukraine, the picture (not counting individual businessmen and the "independent" candidates of small liberal and left-centrist parties) that emerged was: for one representative of the MBR, there were approximately eight national-democrats, 10 "Reds," and 15 candidates from the "Party of Power" (the latter included Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council Vasyl Durdynets, Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov, Industry Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko, Labor Minister Mykhaylo Kaskevych, the former and current ministers of agriculture, Oleksandr Tkachenko and Yuriy Karasyk, Deputy Agriculture Minister Mykhaylo Parasunko, Mykola Kovalko, chairman of the State Oil and Gas Committee, Oleksandr Stoyan, leader of the state trade unions, and former prime ministers, Vitold Fokin and Vitaliy Masol). A unique situation emerged in Kirovohrad Oblast, where 14 Communists, six democrats (including Volodymyr Yavorivskyy), and only two unaffiliated representatives of governing structures advanced to the second round. And so, the second round of voting would decide everything. Even Vyacheslav Chornovil waited for the results of this round to make his decision regarding whether to aim for the presidency or for the parliamentary speaker's job. The voting that was held in some districts on 3 April produced alarming results for the democrats. Although two more of their candidates won in two districts in Galicia (who else could have won?), in Kiev Oblast, Oles Shevchenko, a leading member of the URP, was defeated by Oleksandr Moroz, the leader of the SPU. In Cherkasy Oblast, a Communist and a minister defeated two Rukh members, and in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, the head of Ukrahrotekhservis [Ukrainian State Concern for Providing Material and Technical Supplies and Services to the Agroindustrial Complex] routed yet another URP member. The seats in the rural districts of Kharkiv Oblast were won by six "Reds," seven people from the "Party of Power," and one independent lawyer. The national-democrats had to be satisfied with the victory of three collective farm chairmen whom they had supported (lacking any other choice) against openly Communist candidates. In Zhytomyr Oblast, all the national-democratic candidates lost (including Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, the leader of the Christian-Democrats), while the winners were two Communists, an independent businessman, a deputy minister, a general, a director of a production association, and two members of the "Party of Power." In Bershad (Vinnytsya Oblast) both candidates lost (a Rukh member and Anatoliy Matviyenko, the chairman of the Workers' Congress who had formerly headed the Ukrainian Komsomol) -- neither obtaining the qualifying 50 percent of the vote. The same happened in four other districts in the voting held on 3 April. The days between 3 and 9 April passed in fierce battles. The State Television Company and the yellow rag Kiyevskiye vedomosti launched a campaign against Kostyantyn Morozov (who ran in Kiev) --there were many who wanted to eliminate a powerful rival from the upcoming presidential election. In Kharkiv, MBR members claimed that the Communists had used up their reserves of votes and would not win any more seats. In Odessa, two journalists from opposing camps were beaten up at the same time. In Cherkasy, the Socialist/Communists stuffed mail boxes with proclamations urging voters in the Prydniprovskyy electoral district to vote against both candidates, because, allegedly, one was a "democrat-Rukh member" and the other, a "liberal-nationalist." In neighboring Shpola, Chornovil himself campaigned on behalf of Yuriy Boyko, a priest of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In Lviv Oblast, Mykola Horyn, the chairman of the oblast council, with the help of people's deputies M. Kosiv and Ya. Kendzyor, launched a campaign to discredit his rivals from the UNA-UNSO (this was the first time they were openly called "fascists") and their patron Stepan Khmara. Meanwhile, inspired by its victory on 27 March, the New Wave announced its intention to transform itself from a preelection alliance into a public organization and to create a powerful centrist bloc with Rukh, the Ukrainian Republican Party, and possibly the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists as a counterbalance to the ultra-rightists. Finally, the decisive weekend of 9-10 April arrived. Voting was held on Saturday in Kharkiv and in two electoral districts in Luhansk. In Luhansk Oblast, a Communist defeated a Socialist, and the pro-Communist chief of the local Security Service of Ukraine defeated a Communist. In Kharkiv, seats were won by two Communists (one defeated Volodymyr Filenko, the leader of the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine [PDVU], who finally got his deserts after switching back and forth between the "nationalists" and the "Hrynyovites"), I. Mukhin, the leader of the local SPU, V. Aleksyeyev, member of the chauvinistic GKU, as well as Volodymyr Hrynyov and five of his supporters. The elections in three districts were invalid because voter turnout was lower than required by law, and in one district, no candidate received the qualifying percentage of votes. Results from Sunday's vote began coming in on the morning of 11 April. Kiev presented the saddest picture -- it was officially announced that elections in 13 of the city's 21 electoral districts (including the district in which K. Morozov had run) were invalid owing to voter turnout that fell below the legally required percentage. And in those districts, in which the election was valid, preliminary results showed that deputies had been elected in only three districts. In view of the high voter turnout throughout most of Ukraine and the government's great unwillingness to see Kiev's democrats in parliament, the results in Kiev appear quite suspicious. In Donetsk, seats were won on 10 April by Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk, Derzhvuhleprom [State Coal Industry Committee] Chairman Mykola Surhay and two other representatives of the "Party of Power," 22 Socialists/Communists, two members of the directors' Party of Labor, Yuriy Boldyrev, a vehement supporter of the GKU, and five independent candidates (unfortunately, Petro Tsekhmister, the director of the first private mine in the Donbas and a sincere Ukrainian patriot, was defeated). Thirteen deputies were not elected in Crimea because they failed to receive the qualifying number of votes, and of the ten who were elected, half were Communists. The preliminary results of the election on 10 April on the territories of some oblasts in Central and Southern Ukraine (Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Mykolayiv, and Khmelnytskyy) present the following picture: seats were won by 37 "Reds," two members of the Party of Labor, six members of the MBR, three dozen representatives of the "Party of Power," four members of the URP, three Rukh members, four PDVU members, one member of DemPU (Volodymyr Yavorivskyy), two members of the Union of Officers of Ukraine, and 12 "independents" (who might also turn out to be Communists). Poltava Oblast proved to be the most "anti-Communist" --not a single true "Red" won here. In each of these oblasts, there were two or three districts in which the elections were invalid because of insufficient voter turnout or no deputy was elected owing to a failure of both candidates in a district to receive the qualifying number of votes. The exception was Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, where a total of ten districts suffered from "abstinence." Vitold Fokin and Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov failed to win parliamentary seats in these districts. However, the winners included Valeriy Babych, the president of the powerful Ukrainian Financial Group Joint-Stock Company, Industry Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko, the Communist poet Borys Oliynyk (who was reelected), and democrats Viktor Nosov and Yuriy Sobolyev. In Western Ukraine (except for Zakarpattya Oblast), not a single Communist won a parliamentary seat on 10 April. In contrast, another 11 people on the Rukh list were elected here (including Borys Kozhyn and Vasyl Chervoniy). Seats were also won by five URP members, four KUN members, two UNA members (in Lviv Oblast), and one candidate each from the DemPU and New Ukraine. Taras Stetskiv, a member of the New Wave, defeated Iryna Kalynets, who ran from KUN (both had been deputies to the old Supreme Council). Five members of the "Party of Power" were elected (including Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy, Economy Minister Roman Shpek, and Anton Buteyko, head of the president's foreign affairs service). Mykola Horyn, chairman of the Lviv Oblast Council, was defeated, however. No deputies were elected in 14 districts of Western Ukraine due to the failure of either candidate in the district to obtain the qualifying number of votes (the only exception was Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast). Zakarpattya stands somewhat apart. Here seats were won by two representatives of the local "Party of Power," one Christian-Democrat, and one independent democrat -- docent of Uzhhorod University and father of the well-known popular singer, Anzhelika Korshynska. Will the prevalence of "leftists" in the east and the complete rejection of them in the west split Ukraine along the Zbruch River? Only time will tell...
