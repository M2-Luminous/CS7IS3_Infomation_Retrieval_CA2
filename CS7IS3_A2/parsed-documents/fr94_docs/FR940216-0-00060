FR940216-0-00060 FR940216-0-00010 Second, preliminary models for higher emitting vehicles were constructed based solely on data from such vehicles. Only those terms that satisfied EPA's statistical criteria (discussed at length in the RIA) were retained. These criteria included measures to balance overfitting (introducing too many terms to explain the observed data) and underfitting (not including terms necessary to explain the observed data). The NPRM model did not include measures to prevent overfitting. Third, the entire database was analyzed using the unified approach. The effects of each term on emissions was divided into two parts: an average effect across all vehicles, and a series of adjustment terms for each technology group and for higher emitters. Only those terms that satisfied EPA's statistical criteria were retained, with two exceptions. Higher emitter adjustment terms were retained regardless of statistical significance since they had been found to be statistically significant when examining the higher emitter data separately. EPA was concerned that failure to do so might cause genuine higher emitter effects to be ``washed out'' by the greater number of data for normal emitters. In addition, some overall terms were retained for hierarchy reasons despite low statistical significance. For example, a linear term for a given fuel parameter (e.g., E300) might not be significant while a squared term for the same parameter (e.g., E3002) might be significant. Since the mathematical form of the squared terms includes the corresponding linear effects, the linear term would be retained regardless of significance to preserve the model's hierarchical structure. The importance of hierarchy was emphasized by a number of workshop participants and commenters, as discussed in the RIA. The NPRM model included separate terms for each technology group and emitter class and hence did not include terms to represent the average effect of a fuel parameter across all vehicles. The NPRM model also did not incorporate hierarchy considerations. Fourth, outlying and overly influential data were dropped from the database and the model was re-estimated based on the remaining data. Outlying data consist of observations that differ from the average observed effect by so large a margin that they are more likely to represent observational error, reporting error, or other measurement artifacts than genuine phenomena. Outlying data can obscure genuine emissions effects. Influential data consist of observations that by themselves materially affect the resulting model, i.e., the model would differ materially if they were excluded. In a database the size of the Complex Model database, individual data points should not have such unusually large effects. Excluding outlying and influential observations is standard statistical practice. The NPRM model did not exclude either type of observation. Fifth, terms were deleted from the resulting model to avoid overfitting and collinearity problems. Overfitting occurs when so many terms are included in a regression model that the expected error due to the erroneous inclusion of a term exceeds the expected error due to not including the term. Collinearity problems occur when the fuel parameters included in the model are correlated with one another in the fuels tested. For example, the addition of oxygenate to gasoline causes E200 to increase. The oxygenate-containing fuels in the complex model database tend to have higher E200 values than fuels without oxygenate. In a sense, one can predict the E200 value of a fuel by knowing its oxygen content. Hence these two parameters would be considered to be highly collinear. Since regression models are developed under the assumption that terms are not collinear, the presence of strong collinearities can introduce error into the regression. Today's complex model takes both collinearity and overfitting into account by using a standard statistical criterion called Mallow's C p criterion to remove terms which introduce large overfitting and collinearity problems. This approach resulted in a simpler, more reasonable, and statistically more sound model than had been proposed in the February 1993 NPRM. It should be noted that high emitter terms forced into the model earlier in the process could be dropped at this stage of the analysis. Measures were taken to limit collinearity problems in the NPRM model, but overfitting concerns and the C p criterion were not addressed.
