The rising waves of the Palestinians' intifadah, which have unprecedentedly intensified as a result of this soul rending incident, have extended to include the Arab countries of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and have sparked off unprecedented and extensive demonstrations and protest marches. The leaders of Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, have suspended the compromise talks in Washington in answer to the people's demands and in protest of the massacre of the Palestinians. This is considered a major political defeat for the United States, which tried to mitigate the impact of this incident on the compromise talks since the incident at the Abrahamite mosque become known. After the massacre U.S. President Bill Clinton personally invited Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist regime, and Yasir 'Arafat, the PLO chief, to go to Washington immediately to continue the compromise talks until a definite conclusion is achieved. The Zionist regime and 'Arafat, who opportunistically and quickly gave a positive reply to the invitation, are now facing a political impasse with the suspension of the talks by Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Thus, Yasir 'Arafat, who claims the leadership of the Palestinians, is facing a new political defeat because of his haste and his over eagerness to go to Washington. Political experts believe that possibly within the next few hours, 'Arafat too will announce his decision to dispense with going to Washington for talks with Rabin. Meanwhile, the growing impact of the incident at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the international level has placed the UN Security Council under pressure to adopt a resolution against the Zionist regime. During its previous session, which was held after the incident, the Security Council was unable to reach a decision on a resolution because of pressures by the United States, which wanted them to be content with a mere statement on the incident. However, with the growing impact of the Zionist regime's crimes and the extensive reactions to it in various countries of the world, as well as protests by regional and international organizations, the Security Council has now agreed to consider a resolution condemning the massacre of the Palestinian worshipers. The current developments in occupied Palestine and on the regional and international levels during the past few days show that the Zionist regime and its Western mentors who were behind the recent crime have now lost the initiative despite all their efforts and that they lack the power to confront the repercussions stemming from this incident. This impotence is seen especially in some Arab regimes such as Egypt which, by suppressing the Muslims' demonstrations protesting the Zionist regime and by continuing political links with the regime, has come into confrontation with the popular movement. But with the extensive wave of Islamic awakening in the region and in the world, the policy of suppression definitely will not only be unable to stop the raging wave of developments, but will also further expand this wave.
