It advocates the movements' aims and complies with its struggle and political programs. However, its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our people, regardless of their political affiliations." This came in a statement issued yesterday by Haftar. It includes an affirmation that the opposition army is "an integral part of our national Armed Forces inside the country, and it considers itself a vanguard force for all honorable oppositionists, regardless of their political affiliations.... It is an army for all Libyans in order to achieve the aims of national struggle." The statement adds: "The Libyan National Army, which has decided to split from the National Front for the Salvation of Libya to look for a new struggle formula through which to carry out its national tasks, considers itself a partner in the establishment of the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform..., but its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our heroic people who are prepared to offer their lives and contribute on the field for the sake of their country's cause, regardless of their political affiliations and as long as they are committed to the basic aims of national struggle and the army's laws, rules, and practical programs." It also stresses the army's commitment to "the national character of the battle" against the Libyan regime, and its "belief that this battle should rely entirely on national material and human energies and capabilities inside and outside the country and through a comprehensive plan in which all efforts and capabilities should be united for the sake of serving and achieving the major strategic aims of our heroic people's struggle." The statement also stresses "commitment to the constitutional legitimacy represented in the affirmation of the noble people's right to be in charge of decisionmaking with regard to all that concerns the system of government and to choose their own institutions." The army's implementation of "its practical struggle program will be parallel with the political struggle espoused by the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, aimed at achieving legitimate national demands through the programs of political and military action." It then appeals to "all the sincere sons of the homeland who are seeking salvation and freedom...to take a strong, courageous, and unified stand and rise up to close ranks, unite their efforts, and channel their energies and capabilities to achieve the strategic national aims represented in our people's aspiration to a life of pride, dignity, freedom, and democracy." The statement welcomes "the joining of the army by the honorable brothers Staff Brigadier General Salim al-Hajjaji, Major Ahmad al-Fituri, and Captain Anwar Abu-Ghaliyah, who have joined the army," hoping that their position will be "a blessed start for this new phase in the march of Libyan national struggle."
