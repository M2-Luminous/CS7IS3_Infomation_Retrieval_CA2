Last month Hofbauer decided to cancel a 1990 agreement between RFE and Czechoslovakia which granted the station the right to broadcast on a medium wavelength until 1996. As a legal successor to Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic is bound by the agreement. Asked for a response to a U.S. State Department spokesman who said America hoped Slovakia would reverse its decision, Hofbauer said he was unaware of any such statement. Talks between Slovakia and RFE on continuing broadcasts, possibly on a shortwave frequency, are scheduled for January 20.
