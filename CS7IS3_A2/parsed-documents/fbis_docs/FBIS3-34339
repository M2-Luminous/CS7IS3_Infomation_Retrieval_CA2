In a message last night, she said that observance of the strike from the coastal regions of Karachi and Gwadar to the blood-soaked Anantnag in occupied Kashmir was aimed as a reminder of the Kashmiris' basic right and to assert that the Kashmiris are not alone in their just struggle. She expressed confidence that the strike will force world public opinion to realize once again that it will not be in the interests of the world community to ignore the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Referring to the struggle of the Kashmiri people, the prime minister said that the strike was a part of the government's policy to get the Kashmir issue resolved in accordance with UN resolutions. She said that this was the strategy under which she traveled to Geneva to address the UN Human Rights Commission where she raised the Kashmir issue. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the strike and her address to the UN Human Rights Commission have helped highlight the Kashmir issue at the global level. She said that the peaceful proposals presented by Pakistan in accordance with international law are responded to with threats of war. We cannot be browbeaten by these threats, she added. The prime minister said that some Indian leaders have started criticizing her personal life. She does not care for this criticism because she prefers the Kashmiris' right to self-determination over anything else, she added. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that all such activities point to India's bewilderment. She said that we still favor a peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue and believe that peace cannot be achieved without providing justice. The prime minister said that Pakistan still wishes India to hold talks to resolve the Kashmir issue. She urged India to take steps to peacefully resolve the Kashmir problem in accordance with international law. Prime Minister Bhutto said Pakistan will continue to extend diplomatic, moral, and political support to the Kashmiri brethren until India holds talks with Pakistan. She said that by showing solidarity with the Kashmiris, Pakistan has proven that Pakistanis and Kashmiris have the same soul. She said that world public opinion has started taking note of Indian brutal atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Indian propaganda that the freedom struggle in Kashmir depends on Pakistan has been exposed, she added.
