"The American Defense Secretary William Perry contacted me on Wednesday. I think we can handle this mission," said Bjoerck during a military conference in Halmstad, southern Sweden. No details were released on when the redeployment could take place. "We're still working on how this will exactly happen," he underlined. But a decision could be made quickly, without a parliamentary discussion, Bjoerck added. "Parliament has given permission to send a maximum of 1,000 men to Bosnia. There are just over 800 there now, so there is room to manoeuvre," he said. Nordic defense ministers could meet to discuss the issue in the next few days, Bjoerck hinted. Meanwhile Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a meeting of political party leaders in Stockholm, said the issue would be further examined at a meeting of the advisory council on foreign affairs next week.
