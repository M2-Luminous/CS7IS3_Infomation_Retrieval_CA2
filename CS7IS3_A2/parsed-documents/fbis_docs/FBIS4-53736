FBIS4-53736 "dreas099_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Thailand New Aviation Agreement Concluded With Vietnam New Aviation Agreement Concluded With Vietnam BK2305103094 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST in English 21 May 94 p 2 BK2305103094 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST English BFN [Text] Thailand and Vietnam have reached a new aviation agreement which allows more destinations and higher seating capacities, according to Civil Aviation Department director-general Sisuk Chantharangsu. Mr Sisuk led a Thai delegation to negotiate the agreement with the Vietnamese Civil Aviation Department in Hanoi from Monday to Wednesday. The agreement signed on Wednesday would allow Thai Airways International's [THAI] aircraft to land in Danang apart from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh as now, he said. With an old airport built by the U.S. and lots of new hotels, the seaside town of Danang was a potential spot for tourism as it was only 100 kilometers from the ancient town of Hue, Mr Sisuk said. THAI would be asked to study feasibility of traffic to Danang. The route between Bangkok and Danang should be realized as Bangkok International Airport was the hub for as many as 72 airlines and tourists would take only about an hour and a quarter to continue to Danang, he said. It would take about six months for THAI and Vietnam Airline to study the air traffic demand between Bangkok and Danang so direct flights for the route could begin next year, he said. The new aviation agreement also increased seating capacity for both countries from 2,350 seats per week by 620. The increase was prompted by "high yield" traffic demand between Thailand and Vietnam, he said, citing as many as 200,000 passengers travelling between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh last year 12.3 per cent more than the previous year. Of the 620-seat increase, national airlines of the two countries could have an immediate increase of 120, he said. THAI flew seven times a week to Ho Chi Minh and three times a week to Hanoi, he said. Vietnam operated sever flights each on the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.
