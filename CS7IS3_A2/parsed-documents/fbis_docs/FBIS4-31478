The main reason of the decision was that, according to the proposed law, a lump money would be paid to deputies and senators after the expiry of their terms of office if they were running in the next elections, throughout the entire period between terms. The president contends that this would actually be a privilege jeopardizing those who run for the first time and must continue their jobs. The second reason was that the proposed law converted social allowances paid to MPs into their regular lump payment and on top of that, this article would have been retroactive to June 1, 1993, if not vetoed.
