These remarks have caused manifestations of hatred and abhorrence on the part of the Palestinian political groups that have broken away from the PLO. These allegations are the political stance of a government that is seeking to project itself as a "neutral mediator" to create conditions for what it terms "Arab-Israeli peace." These remarks were made when Israel's domination of Jerusalem and, in fact, the usurpation of Jordan's West Bank have not been officially recognized by the United Nations. Thus, the city of Jerusalem-- which is revered by followers of all divine religions and has a special sanctity and importance--has been described as the indivisible capital of the despotic Zionist tyrants. This opinion clearly indicates the dimensions of U.S. support for the occupationist regime of Palestine and depicts the position of Israel as the progeny of the United States. It is certain that the Zionists have laid great premium on U.S. support for the attainment of their objectives and the materialization of their expansionist policies, Therefore, if the Zionists covet the territory of their neighboring countries; ensure their existence by the policy of terrorism, intimidation, and repression; perpetrate atrocities such as the massacre of fasting worshipers in al-Khalil [Hebron] without any pretext; and constantly speak from a position of superiority and strength in the rounds of talks with the spineless Arab regimes, it is because their actions are based on the overt support of the Americans. Since the dawn of history, holy Jerusalem has suffered numerous incidents of tyranny and suppression by Europeans, Americans, and then the Israelis. Today at the height of the treasonous indifference of the regional Arab rulers, it is on its way to becoming the main power base of the murderers of the Palestinian nation. The fact is that Arab governments have played a considerable role in paving the way for the current situation. The crisis of the oil war and the synchronized stances of the Arabs and Zionists during that crisis created the psychological circumstances for subsequent sessions aimed at a compromise between the Arabs and the Israeli despots. This provided a conducive background for the overt and covert closeness between the Zionists and Arab echelons and proved to be an important weapon for neutralizing the struggles of the Muslim Palestinian nation for the liberation of their country from the clutches of the despots. Unfortunately, the Islamic world today is riddled by dissent, discord, and disharmony more than it ever has been. The governments ruling over the Islamic countries have been alienated from Islam and Islamic values on the one hand, and from their own people on the other. This alienation--coupled with the phenomena of an inferiority complex, underestimating themselves, and bartering themselves away-- on the part of the Islamic countries before the Zionists has constantly been one of the basic factors for the gradual growth of Zionism and the expansion of its political influence and domain in the heartland of Islamic territories. The consolidation of the Zionist strategy in occupied Palestine and their gradual infiltration into the neighboring countries, which was a culmination of the traitorous conferences of compromise between Arabs and Israel in the region in the past one or two years, is to a large extent the result of this very defensiveness, laxity, self-bartering, and erroneous perceptions on the part of the rulers and shaykhs of the region. It is certain that for every step the Arab governments take backward in the face of the extortionist demands of the United States and the government it has spawned in occupied Palestine, the Americans and Zionists rush two steps forward in a more exacting and audacious manner for greater privileges, and describe this policy as "peace." The events of the past two decades in occupied Palestine and its borders with all the Islamic countries, which were marked by numerous fluctuations, should drive home to the Arab governments that the Zionist regime is not to be satisfied with what it can grab with its talons. Naturally, dealing with such a wanton government can never be a source of peace and stability for the zealous Middle East region. The best and most logical stance has been adopted today by those inside occupied Palestine and in south Lebanon who--in parallel with the proliferation of their Islamic and cultural activities--have pitched themselves against the criminal Israeli regime. They are the ones who have kept the flame of the intifadah alight for so many years under the worst possible conditions.
