FR940819-2-00032 FR940819-2-00011 Comment 33: RIMA argues that it is unfair for the Department to penalize the company for having a cost accounting system that does not tie to its financial accounting system. RIMA contends that its former cost accounting system was not designed to tie into its financial accounting system, and argues that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for providing accurate data. Department's Position: The Department is not penalizing RIMA for having any particular type of accounting system. RIMA's cost information was rejected for the specific reasons which are outlined in the public version of the cost verification report and the calculation memorandum. We found that these problems were so extensive that major areas of the response could not be tested. For those areas which were tested we found significant discrepancies in the amounts reported, in addition to a lack of sufficient data to corroborate the response. Finally, we are unable to understand RIMA's argument that rejection of its response is equivalent to a penalty for providing accurate data. The record does not begin to establish that the information provided by RIMA is accurate in any way. Comment 34: RIMA argues that the Department's COP/CV verification report erroneously characterized the reported labor hours as ``theoretical'' rather than ``actual''. RIMA states that it used its statistical process control reports to calculate labor expense, and asserts that this constitutes a more accurate way of reporting this expense than would have been reflected in RIMA's ``managerial'' costing system. Department's Position: We disagree that the cost verification report provides an erroneous characterization. The Department's cost verification report outlines the findings at verification. As the report indicates, the analysis upon which the reported labor cost was based is no longer performed by RIMA and was never used for any purpose other than the company's submission. Based upon the company's inability to relate this analysis to any other recorded measure of costs, we cannot conclude that the information provided reflected a ``more accurate'' measure of the costs. Comment 35: RIMA argues that it properly did not report several of the home market transactions characterized as ``unreported sales'' in the Department's December 20, 1993 sales verification report. RIMA contends that commercial samples and intracompany transfers are not ``sales'' and should not have been reported. Department's Position: We agree with RIMA that several of the home market transactions which are characterized as unreported sales in our December 23, 1993 verification report were in fact commercial samples or intracompany transfers. We note, however, that our determination to use BIA for RIMA was based upon RIMA's inability to provide reliable cost data. The commercial samples and intracompany transfers referenced in the December 23, 1993 sales verification report were not factors in our decision to use BIA for RIMA. Comment 36: RIMA argues that the home market sales that it did not report made no difference in the determination of market viability or foreign market value. Department's Position: As noted in our response to comment 24 we used BIA for RIMA because RIMA was unable to provide reliable cost data. Thus, the question of whether these unreported sales would have made a difference in the determination of foreign market value is moot. Addendum We have made an additional change in our analysis for these final results: We have amended our COP calculations to adjust for the amount of the Brazilian inflation that was factored into the home market selling price. To make this adjustment, we compared Minasligas's and Eletrosilex's selling prices to their respective COPs in effect as of the date of payment rather than the date of sale.
