From 11 to 15 June, Wen Jiabao conducted investigations and studies in Suzhou's Wujiang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Zhangjiagang, and Taicang Counties (cities) to become acquainted with the development of agriculture and the rural economy there. Suzhou made an early start in building town and township enterprises, and they have been developing rapidly. By the end of 1993, the city's town and township enterprises, whose output value accounted for 75 percent of the city's total industrial output value, employed 45 percent of the rural labor force. While rapidly expanding town and township enterprises, the city authorities have not slackened agriculture, investing more than 300 million yuan in agriculture each year. All throughout the countryside, the rural economy is flourishing; production is expanding; and there is social stability. After fully affirming Suzhou city's marked achievements in economic and social development, Wen Jiabao said: Town and township enterprises are a great invention of China's peasants and are also the pillar for economic development in the countryside. From the very start, town and township enterprises have been closely linked to the rural economy, to agricultural modernization, and to efforts by peasants to strive for a prosperous standard of living. Vigorously developing town and township enterprises is an important mission for rural economic work. Areas with comparatively developed town and township enterprises should, through supplementing agriculture with industry and developing agricultural with support from industry, make further efforts to strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy and comprehensively invigorate the rural economy by ensuring that grain production, diversified undertakings, and town and township enterprises develop in a coordinated way. Visiting a number of township-established high-standard farms and vegetable growing bases, Wen Jiabao asked many relevant questions. He said: Establishment of high-standard capital farms and vegetable growing bases will spur the construction of agricultural infrastructural facilities and the construction of agricultural service systems, and the application of modern agricultural science and technology will also help in protecting arable land. Areas with a comparatively developed economy should strengthen the coonstruction of high-standard agricultural farms and protected zones for vegetable gardens. When conditions permit, all areas should develop diversified undertakings of an appropriate scale in line with local conditions and strive to increase the level of intensive farming. While seizing the opportunity to accelerate economic development, Suzhou has also paid attention to the building of a spiritual civilization in rural areas. Education, culture, and health services have developed fairly rapidly there, and public order has been relatively good. After commending the local authorities for what they had done, Wen Jiabao stressed: What we want to build is a new socialist countryside with developed material and spiritual civilizations. While we should strive to enable the peasants to have ample food and clothing and enjoy a fairly prosperous material life, we should also strive to enable them to work and live in peace and contentment and to enjoy a relatively abundant spiritual life. In rural work, we should adhere to the principle that both material progress and cultural and ideological progress should be promoted, and concentrate on the objectives of developing the rural productive forces and achieving a comfortable standard of living. While deepening reform and developing the economy, we should effectively strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization in rural areas, bring about all-around progress there, and strive to build a prosperous and civilized new socialist countryside. Accompanying Wen Jiabao on the inspection tour were Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee; Wang Minsheng, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee secretary of the Suzhou City party committee; and others.
