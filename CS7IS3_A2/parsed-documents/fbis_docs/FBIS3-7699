FBIS3-7699 "dreas062__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-062-A Document Type:Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan New Steel Standards May Form Import Barrier OW3103082994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3103082994 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Construction decided to set new JIS (Japan Industrial Standards) for high-quality steel products for construction use from June this year, and to instruct the steel and construction industries to use these steel products. This decision was made in view of reported cases of welded parts of construction-use steel breaking, which have become a social problem. A new set of JIS will be designated specifically for steel products for construction use--standards used to be uniform for all steel products used in the automobile, construction, and other industries. Nippon Steel Corporation and other steel manufacturers will start making products under the new JIS, and shipment of such products will start toward the end of 1994. As a result of this decision, foreign steelmakers will have to obtain certification under the new stricter JIS in their attempts to enter the Japanese market for construction materials used in public work projects. This may give rise to the criticism that the new JIS constitute a nontariff barrier. The introduction of the new JIS was a result of the incident in 1991 where JIS-certified steel sheets sold in the domestic market broke at the welded portions, and the involved manufacturers were penalized. The main point of the new standards is that by reducing the sulfur and phosphorus content in steel products, faulty welding and inadequate strength can be prevented. In terms of product shapes, maximum permissible size differences will be reduced to increase precision in welding. The new JIS will apply to steel sheets, shape steel, flat steel and other products used as construction materials. Along with the MITI's setting of new JIS in June, the Construction Ministry will amend its guidelines based on the Construction Standards Law, and issue directives encouraging the use of new JIS products. However, the depression in demand for steel products has caused an increase in the inventory of products certified under the old JIS. To prevent confusion in the market due to a sudden switch over, the old standards will still be retained beyond June. A transition period of one to two years will be set, after which old JIS only for steel for construction use will be abolished. Regarding the purpose of its efforts to popularize the new JIS, the Construction Ministry says, "This is to improve the safety of architectural structures in response to demands from the related industries and the people" (according to the Building Guidance Division). Since new JIS products will require the meticulous removal of impurities, and other additional procedures in the production process, "production cost will be about 10 percent higher than existing products" (according to Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Company, Ltd.). The current market price for H-shape steel is from 30,000 to 40,000 yen per ton. A price increase is being considered for the new JIS products. On the other hand, it is believed that foreign companies selling steel products used in construction and public work projects will also require the new JIS certification. Many industry sources think that this will make foreign participation even more difficult.
