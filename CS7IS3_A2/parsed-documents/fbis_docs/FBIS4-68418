What do you think about that, and can we say that the Head of State's Apparatus does constitute a team? [Lordkipanidze] At first we didn't even know the concept of team and we paid no attention to that factor. Now we are swinging to the other extreme and link the solution to any more or less important problem to the existence of a team. First we ought to figure out what we mean by "team." If we think of it as a group of persons who work for just one man and have assigned functions--someone creates the image, someone does the biography, someone writes up the conception, and so on--Shevardnadze couldn't even have such a team, for it would take considerable time, traditions, and the right circumstances. If, however, we mean the people who think like Shevardnadze and are his comrades-in-arms, whom he asks for advice and uses it to make decisions, and through whom he tries to implement those decisions, then he has always had that team and it is numerically strong right now. In my opinion, this fuss over whether Shevardnadze does or does not have a team comes from two causes: the first is the extreme that I already mentioned, the second is a more serious one. The fuss is a deliberate one, because if Shevardnadze does not have people who think like him, with whom he can assess the situation, if he doesn't have a laboratory where he can think through programs, strategies, and tools of implementation, in that case, of course, the Head of State will look powerless, there will be no government or even a state. Certainly the staffers of the Apparatus, along with other political and state figures, scientists, and specialists who surround the Head of State, do make up his team. The Head of State's Apparatus is a part of his team. One of the main principles governing the structure of the Apparatus derived exactly from that. When creating the Apparatus on the basis of the law passed by the Parliament we studied practically every country's experience and created the structure of the Apparatus on that basis. When we put it together we received advice from German and American colleagues and experts from the Euro-Association. They are still working in the Apparatus and helping us. Just as there is nothing exactly like the institution of the Head of State, the Apparatus as well is a vehicle of new content. It is a structure that serves analytical rather than executive functions. Its duties are defined such that there is no way it can take over the functions of the Cabinet of Ministers, much less the Parliament. It cannot be compared to any old structure of centralized administration; in the context of the necessity of carrying out a rigorous policy of decentralization, such centralization would be wholly unacceptable. The Apparatus's job is to help the Head of State work out his position with respect to the development of various spheres, sectors, and processes. This also entails the formulation of long-term conceptions and program documents, also local issues. However, our activity is in no way linked to the executive branch. I can state confidently that there has never been a single instance of interference in the old or the new Cabinet of Ministers or any ministry or their functions. We have never had a single quarrel with the executive branch, let alone a conflict. This is natural. Our jurisdictions don't intersect, nor could they. The guarantees of this are built into the structure of the Apparatus's task. No attempt by any private person can violate that. [Correspondent] Does the Apparatus take part in cadre selection and appointments? For example, ministers and their deputies, factory directors, and so on? [Lordkipanidze] The Apparatus only takes part in the selection and appointment of leadership cadres for bodies of local administration. The Parliament granted this right to the Head of State. In the Apparatus, essentially a specially created service performs this function. The final decision is made by the Head of State after consulting with leaders of the Cabinet of Ministers and taking account of recommendations by parliamentary commissions and factions. As for the selection of ministry leadership and other cadres, the Apparatus is not involved; that is not its function. [Correspondent] By what principle do you choose members of the Apparatus? [Lordkipanidze] We have posts of adviser, state adviser, and consultant; this in itself defines the criterion--high professionalism and high moral qualities. You often hear, to be sure, that the Apparatus is bloated, but compared to similar institutions in other countries the number of our staffers is modest; it is only a third as large as even the smallest apparatuses of heads of state anywhere in the world. We include academicians, professors and holders of the doctorate, candidates of science, and representatives of 16 parties and movements. Any work with us goes essentially by the principle of agreement; on the one hand this enables us to avoid creating an entrenched bureaucracy, and on the other hand it enlarges the circle of membership. We work with all the scientific research institutions of the Academy of Sciences, the Tbilisi State University and its departments, almost all the sociological survey centers in Tbilisi, and representatives of both the traditional and modern schools of psychology. [Correspondent] And does all this material come to the attention of the Head of State? [Lordkipanidze] Shevardnadze's energetic industriousness is well known. This means that he himself works with all the services in the Apparatus. There are no hierarchical levels in business dealings with him. He is in direct contact with practically all the Apparatus's top officials, meeting with them regularly and listening to them. He has the same direct contacts with ministry and department officials, mayors, and local administrators. These contacts are basically made outside the Apparatus. You can argue with the Head of State and express your opinion. That is the main criterion of his demands--rigorous thinking, innovation, the creative and systematic approach to problems. He is a very good and courteous listener. He listens carefully to his advisers and correlates their opinions, but he always makes the decision himself. There is nobody who can force a decision on Shevardnadze. I don't mean cases where someone has confronted the Head of State with a short-sighted and thoughtless action and created serious problems for the country. Nor am I referring to compromise decisions dictated by some untenable predicament. I flatly disagree with the notion that the Head of State places the Apparatus before Parliament. The Head of State, like every Apparatus staffer, understands the Parliament's crucial importance very well in its capacity as one of the chief and essential institutions and guarantors of independent statehood and democracy. [Correspondent] We often hear charges that Shevardnadze has not figured out what kind of Georgia he is building. There are some who accuse him of trying to return to socialism, while others accuse him of wanting to build a Chinese-style socialism. What does Shevardnadze really want? [Lordkipanidze] I don't agree with the notion that Shevardnadze has not worked out a program; he has, and he has announced it publicly many times. Some people also accuse Shevardnadze of not even having a conception or orientation of a foreign policy. This charge is convincingly refuted by the Head of State's calculated system of official visits abroad in the past year. The past year and a half has been an active period of foreign policy formulation for Georgia. I believe this process is certainly continuing today, and I'm certain that the results of his official visit to the U.S. will constitute clear proof of that. Is it mere chance that Georgia is the chair country of the Black Sea Basin Countries Commonwealth, entailing new forms of integration of relations? That Georgia is a member of the Euro-Association and Euroconference? That we have representation in NATO? Isn't our orientation reflected in the formula "a commonwealth of commonwealths," which Shevardnadze suggested some time ago and which the world community has already accepted and confirmed? Surely that was not said just for the sake of the phrase; rather, it embodies processes that are favorable to us, very specific and promising. In my opinion, that represents a global orientation. Hence, on the one hand we are pursuing a Westward orientation, and I personally am in favor of that. On the other hand, certain vehicles of that orientation pay no attention to the opinion of the West and its political leaders specifically regarding Georgia, our state and our Head of State. The West has never had any doubt about Shevardnadze's policy course and its orientation. How could anyone assume that the West, the U.S., doesn't know where Georgia is heading and what its orientation is and still offer support and trust to Shevardnadze? The charge of trying to turn back the clock is absurd, because the very process of turning back is absurd and inconceivable. It is impossible to stop historical development, progress, and civilization, to turn back the clock. It is entirely natural and logical, then, that Shevardnadze cannot be nostalgic for the past, unlike certain opposition politicians who define the present by a Georgia of the late Middle Ages and are more inclined to embrace the concepts and orientations of that period than of a Georgia of the 21st century. [Correspondent] Nevertheless, reforms in Georgia are going very slowly to say the least. Not only that but there are increasingly louder calls for restoring the old structures before creating new ones.... [Lordkipanidze] It may be true that we were in fact too hasty to dismantle certain structures, but there is no way we are going to correct that mistake with a bigger mistake. There is absolutely no way we can begin to restore the old structures and then transform them later, because that will cause even more destruction. I am in favor of carrying out reforms much more radically. I believe that the only realistic way out of our grave social-economic situation is to carry out radical economic reforms and establish market relations everywhere and in everything. But this will take a new system of thinking; everyone will have to understand the need for private property, development of the private sector, entrepreneurship and business. We have the chance to become a state having an independent economic system, and we must not pass up that chance. We already let it slip through our fingers. We must never repeat that mistake. Unfortunately, Georgia is not well endowed with highly qualified cadres of economists, so at the initial stage we will have to have help and advice from foreign specialists. The paradox of it is that the West is actively trying to help us in this, yet we keep on doing things our own way. No systematic work is being done in this regard. [Correspondent] In my opinion, those who oppose the formation of a market economy aren't willing to make concessions. When some minister or big enterprise executive gives a speech you get the impression that either he has no conception of market relations or he is deliberately playing the fool. [Lordkipanidze] Indeed, often they have only a hazy idea of the new relations. Let's keep in mind that we used to study economics in the Course of Political Economy. Some people really are fooling themselves, because market relations are in conflict with their personal interests. We also need to keep in mind that corruption still flourishes. Of course, the principles of the market economy will diminish the rights of the ministries. When market relations are in place, the ministries will no longer have the economic functions they did in the era of the centralized, planned economy. In my opinion, the ministries should retain the function of policy and strategy formulation and, for example, the implementation and monitoring of two or three federal programs. Moreover, the process of decentralization and destatization must not be done at one stroke but in well-thought-out phases. In the initial stage we need to formulate new, mutually beneficial relations and principles governing the ministry and its subordinate links. This could be done by agreement or some other specific form. [Correspondent] That makes all the more surprising the recently launched campaign against private structures.... [Lordkipanidze] A lot of honest men have gone into business these days, because they want to realize their potential, and business gives them plenty of opportunities. The only thing that can regulate the private sector, again, is economic levers. Of course we cannot permit the looting of the state, but we must be very careful not to smother business just as it is getting on its feet. Unfortunately, we see the danger of this everywhere. Unfortunately, we often make big mistakes which we then blame on other people's maliciousness. Instead of going through specific, phased periods, we dismantled everything that was old but failed to create anything new. In the late 1980s we faced specific economic problems which would have been much easier to find realistic and promising solutions to then, through joint efforts, than today. Instead of acting wisely, we are at each other's throats. All we do is yell, We'll tighten our belts and make it through.... Now that we have a ruined economy on our hands, we will have to start from scratch to find solutions, ways to restore the economy, essential and beneficial economic ties. It is probably due to excessive politicization that we have not yet appreciated Russia's economic market and its truly rich potential. At a time when the whole world was rushing to get in on Russia's market, we who were already there--at a time when we had more opportunities than ever before to take advantage of that market--we were in the process of abandoning it, and consciously or unconsciously we rejected everything--including things that objectively belonged to us. I think we didn't know then and possibly we haven't realized even today, that a totally new social-economic entity has taken shape in Russia itself: capitalism is developing vigorously in Russia. This opens prospects for completely new, mutually beneficial economic relations on a non-imperial basis. If we had realized this in time we wouldn't be in this predicament today. How would this benefit us today? Well, Russia and Georgia would be dotted with joint enterprises founded on mutually beneficial terms. Economic partnership would not be linked solely to political and state relations between us, and changing them would no longer depend on the will and desires of just a few political forces. Production would be revived. Goods would be produced, a sure guarantee against inflation. We would also gain much in political terms: a very strong and influential segment of people in Russia, the segment basically in charge, businessmen, would be interested in Georgia and good relations with it. They would oppose, for example, the reactionary mafia that defeated us in Abkhazia. Our relations with the West would also be different. In 1990, I used to receive five or six solid foreign businessmen every day in the Council of Ministers; they were interested in economic cooperation with Georgia on new principles. Naturally, they also wanted to use Georgia to enter the Russian market, but if we had taken advantage, Georgia would have all kinds of operating Western-Georgian joint enterprises right now, and we would be linked to the West with economic threads. Then there would be many more people in the West who cared about Georgia and its fate, and Western aid and support would go beyond mere moral support. We suffered very badly from the absence of such support during the tragic days of Sukhumi. And if we are to be objective, the West's moral support was due to the reputation and world authority of just one man--our Head of State. I am certain, though, that the most effective way to settle any regional conflict is to pursue a course of radical economic reform. I have no doubt that in the future, it is the activation of economic mechanisms that will prove to be the most effective and realistic way to finally settle the regional conflicts with Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.
