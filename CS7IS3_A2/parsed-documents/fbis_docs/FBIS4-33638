The president-elect made his statements following a meeting with recently elected PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] legislators and members of the future cabinet, who will take office as of 1 September. The meeting was designed to coordinate future government policies between the executive and judicial branches during the transition period. According to Perez Balladares, the government's announced budget cuts should not affect the incoming administration. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe it is unfair that our incoming administration should be the one to pay for the current administration's inability to meet its debt obligations. In this respect, it seems to me that the best approach would be to meet with the IFI's and agree on an adjustment and reform program that takes into account the nation's social needs. I am quite sure Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman is of the same opinion and will discuss the issue with the IFI's in due time. [end recording]
