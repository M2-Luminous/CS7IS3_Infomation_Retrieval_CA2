After meeting U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley, who conveyed condolences for the victims of the crime, Buwayz noted that he discussed the steps being taken by the United States toward Israel to control such extremist actions as the attack in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Buwayz said: [Begin recording] [Buwayz] Investigations are continuing into the church crime. At the cabinet meeting yesterday, several decisions were made to boost security agencies' interrogations and increase coordination among them to discover the perpetrators of this carnage. No doubt, resolving this issue will require great efforts, particularly because the perpetrators are professional and capable. [Unidentified reporter] Can you tell us about the content of the message you received from the U.S. ambassador? [Buwayz] The meeting had two goals: We received condolences from the U.S. ambassador on the martyrs of the Sayyidat al-Najat church carnage. He advised us on steps that the U.S. Government has taken with Israel to control extremism such as the attack in the Ibrahimi Mosque. [Reporter] After the incidents in the Ibrahimi Mosque and in Juniyah yesterday, do you believe that the fate of the peace talks is now threatened? [Buwayz] The negotiations encounter extremism from here and there. No doubt, the decision and responsibility for peace make it imperative for all countries and parties concerned to follow clear and firm line in dealing with the (?rejectionists). We believe that it is high time for the Israeli Government to put an end to continued provocations that impede the atmosphere of peace in the region. [Reporter] Will the church crime affect Pope John Paul's visit to Lebanon? [Buwayz] I do not think it will affect the pope's visit. The pope usually visits countries and peoples beset by difficulties, not prosperous and stable countries. He usually visits peoples suffering from problems. [Reporter] The Washington peace talks have been suspended. Do you think that they will stop forever? [Buwayz] Talks are under way with the U.S. to ensure the continuity of the peace talks.
