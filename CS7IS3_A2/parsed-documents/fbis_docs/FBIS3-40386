Criticism--failure to meet deadlines, overall lack of professionalism--added to difficulties in obtaining help account for their inconspicuous presence. What is it that drives to Asia French PMEs like Ilog, an SSII [data-processing services and engineering company] specialized in software engineering which just set up a subsidiary in Singapore, or Gemplus, the smart card leader which has been operating in Singapore for four years and is now opening an office in China? "We are aware of the French market limitations. International markets, especially the Asiatic market, are a matter of survival for us," Edouard Efira, the Ilog assistant general manager, assured. If they relocate, therefore, it is not to benefit from lower labor costs at the expense of French workers, but because they are determined to gain market shares in Asia. Actually, most countries in the region have the advantage not only of experiencing economic booms, but also of being perfectly solvent. Just a few figures will illustrate the existence of a sort of Asiatic El Dorado. Whereas, according to the OECD, the seven major western industrialized countries are expected to record 1993 growth rates in the +2.6 to -1.9 percent range, the World Bank reported 12-percent growth for Communist China in 1992; according to Chinese sources, growth should reach 13.5 percent in 1993. As for the other countries in the region (Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand), the World Bank stressed that no group of countries ever experienced such a high growth rate within 30 years: 5.5 percent on the average between 1960 and 1990. Yet, less than three percent of French foreign trade is with the "three Chinas" (Communist China, Taiwan, Hong Kong). Apart from the French giants in the electronics sector (Alcatel, Bull-Zenith, Thomson), French presence is limited to a few enterprising PMEs (Ilog, Gemplus, OST [Observatory of Science and Technology], Pact Group, Lisa Engineering, etc.), which are usually well positioned in their subsectors and quite determined to expand all over Asia. Thus Ilog, the leading European supplier of object-oriented development tools, which possesses a technological lead in constraint-oriented programming, has made a remarkable breakthrough in Singapore, especially in government offices. "We expect our sales in the region to increase from 4 million francs [Fr] now to Fr40 million in four to five years," Edouard Efira disclosed. As for Gemplus, it achieved Fr30 million in sales with significant projects such as the electronic wallet credit card it implemented jointly with a Japanese partner, a Singapore bank, Visa International, and the U.S. company Verifone. The price of success for the French company was that South Koreans and Taiwanese asked for licensing agreements, for which they are prepared to pay a high price... no doubt in order to be able to compete with Gemplus later on. The problem, therefore, consists in knowing how to manage what is transferable and what is not. "For the time being, we have not yet made any technology transfers," we were told by Eric Alzai, a former manager of Gemplus Technology Asia. The two French PMEs have one thing in common: They have practically no competitors on location, and their markets are buoyant. "The more sophisticated the PME's subsector, the greater its chances of success, because when it comes to standard products Asiatic countries are hard to beat," according to Eric Alzai. It is not by chance that they both chose Singapore as an operating base: the island offers a high technological level, international trade experience, and a very western-like culture, especially in legal matters. Moreover, the majority of its population is Chinese, which helps penetration into Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Communist China. "Actually, these markets are linked. For instance, Taiwan is the leading investor in Communist China," people at Ilog pointed out. A Certain Lack of Professionalism For all that, these successes may well be the exceptions that confirm the rule concerning the presence of French PMEs in Asia. "Last September, a Philippine mission came to Paris, looking for opportunities to work together with French companies in the software field. Since these companies did not respond, the Filipinos turned to the Germans and the British. It is a pity because, with the high-speed train in Korea, Ariane and the subway, France has a good technological image in these countries," people at the Paris Chamber of Commerce regretted. "Geographic and cultural distance, but also our companies' lack of professionalism account for this lack of a French presence in Asia," according to Elisabeth Landemaine of the Financial Company for Asia. Actually, French businessmen are often perceived as people who do not approach markets in a professional manner, who do not meet deadlines. Their lack of fluency in the English language can also prove a serious handicap. "If the only English-speaking individual in a PME happens to be out when the Asiatic partner faxes a letter, he will not get an answer until that individual is back, which is very detrimental," Nadia Gourievidis, head of the Asean department at the Paris Chamber of Commerce, observed. Besides, some French banks and organizations such as COFACE [French Foreign Trade Insurance Company] (State insurance against export-related risks) are said not to be very eager to help PMEs. "We had a lot of trouble obtaining prospection insurance from COFACE and discounting facilities on our invoices from our bank," the managers of an SSII told us. In spite of these obstacles, it is possible to succeed, like Ilog and Gemplus who received little or no help from the French government or from major French groups already on location. "You must not hesitate to go on location to study the market, to write your commercial documents in English, to project a very professional image, to provide thorough information on your products, and above all to find good partners because, in Asia, the more middlemen you have, the better your image," Eric Alzai confided. But the supreme quality to succeed is perseverance. "You must show that you are settling down for good," Edouard Efira concluded.
