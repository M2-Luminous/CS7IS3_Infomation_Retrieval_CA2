[Endara] Good morning to you Famania and to all your viewers. I would like to begin by thanking Professor Ruben Dario Carles for his remarks about me. I must reiterate that I have a very high opinion of him. At no time during this political campaign will I be able to speak ill of him because we have been and will continue to be friends for the rest of our lives. Moreover, I must say that as comptroller he always supported my presidency and I as president supported him as comptroller. I would like to begin by saying something that all of the news media have repeated and which you just announced on television. It has been said that on Saturday I said the members of Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] are traitors. I challenge your television station and the other news media which reported it, because everything I say in public is recorded. Bring me the recording in which I characterized the members of Molirena as traitors. I did not do that and I would like you to prove that I did without playing any tricks with the tapes. I said the members of Molirena had spurned the Arnulfists [PA]. I wanted to be a witness as to why an agreement could not be reached by the parties and that is why I called a meeting on Friday -- I believe it was Friday -- to find out what was happening with my administration. I did not want to meddle in politics, I only wanted to know what was happening with my administration. I reached the conclusion that the PA-Molirena conflict was solely that Molirena had taken it into their heads that they wanted a certain electoral circuit when the PA already had a candidate in that circuit. They felt that their candidate was deserving of some privilege or other. The PA then proposed that each party put forward its candidate and allow the people to make the decision. Molirena did not like this and in my opinion they spurned and humiliated us. It hurts me very much when the PA is humiliated or spurned. I know that for certain political parties we are scum [lumpen], the lowest sector of the people and they have always despised us. I had never seen Molirena behave this way and when I saw this it hurt me to the core; it hurt me very much. I had experienced this situation with the Christian Democratic Party but never with Molirena and it truly hurt me. However, I never characterized them as traitors because they have never been traitors. I challenge you to bring me the evidence that I characterized them as traitors. [Famania] Mr. President, we have asked our coordinator to play the recording of the incident on Saturday. We will be broadcasting it later so this situation will be clarified. This incident is also commented on in LA PRENSA's "As of Today" column but I will leave it at that.... [Endara, interrupting] Yes, but LA PRENSA's "As of Today" column is not infallible. That column has missed the target many times, so to speak. I would also like to explain something else. [Famania] Go ahead, Mr. President. [Endara] You have said, and it was announced a while ago on your television station, that I as president of the Republic supported Mireya [Mireya Gruber, PA's presidential candidate]. Yesterday I had distributed to all the newspapers the reasons why I did not attend the PA convention; it was precisely to avoid supporting any candidate, because I am president of the Republic. However, during a crisis within my party I must be with the party, not supporting it as president of the Republic but as a member. On Saturday night I was so hurt as an Arnulfist by the mistreatment, contempt, and humiliation we received from Molirena, that I had to be with the party; not to support it as president of the Republic or to give it the state's support, but because I wanted to be present. I have been and always will be an Arnulfist. However, as president, although I am an Arnulfist, I will remain neutral. I want everyone to know: I am and will remain an Arnulfist all of my life, but I will be neutral as president of the Republic. Therefore, you must not say that I made statements in support of Mireya Moscoso de Gruber or that the presidency is behind her. Furthermore, it is very likely -- I have not made up my mind yet -- that I will appoint new ministers from the PA. It is possible. This does not mean that I am supporting the PA politically because I am going to demand that those ministers behave the same way I behave. They must not offer to any political party or candidate their political support, state support, state property, or their influence. [Famania] Mr. President, the criticisms that are being leveled against this weekend's events as they pertain to you and to the presidency's role in all of this, is that a political meeting was held at the presidency of the Republic. Second, that you participated in the meeting, which was attended by the Arnulfist presidential ticket, and third, that certain presidential public relations officials even provided reporters with credentials to participate in the PA's 23 January convention. This is where doubts about your neutrality emerge, Mr. President. [Endara] Let us deal with each accusation separately. Friday's meeting. [coughs] I held Friday's meeting after office hours and for the sole purpose of finding out what was happening with my administration. I saw that the political parties that had supported my government were engaged in a fight and this was affecting my government's stability. You had been reporting this for weeks; for at least 15 days. The problem was affecting my government's stability and I wanted to meet with them to find out what was happening. This was the purpose of Friday night's meeting. I was concerned over my administration because I am president of the Republic and it is my duty to be concerned over my administration. [Famania] A brief question, Mr. President. If this was the case, why were Mision [National Unity Mission] and Solidaridad [Solidarity Party] invited? [Endara] They were invited because they were participants in the negotiations and I wanted to know who was causing the problem. I wanted to know what my government's situation was. How could I exclude them from the meeting when they were participating in the talks? On Saturday I visited [the PA headquarters] not to support the party but to be present at a time of crisis. My party had suffered a huge slight, it had been humiliated, and I wanted to share that difficult moment of humiliation; I wanted the party to have my support, not my political support but the support of a fellow party member who felt as spurned and humiliated as they did. Third, I think you were undoubtedly speaking about Presidential Press Secretary Rene Hernandez. Hernandez has been on vacation for approximately two months and I believe he still has another month to go. During his vacation he can do whatever he wants to; he could be at the beach but he prefers to do this. I have no proof that he distributed press [credentials] but while he is on vacation he can do as he pleases, just as you do. However, he was not working with the presidency because he is on vacation. [Famania] Mr. President can you confirm that changes will be made? Are you aware that by making these changes the same thing that happened when the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] was separated could happen again? Many Panamanians appointed by Molirena ministers may lose their jobs. [Endara] Molirena has spoken of resignations. Several Molirena employees have spoken of resigning and I must remind you that in the PDC's case, I would estimate that 99 percent of the separations resulted from resignations, not dismissals. I believe the same thing will happen with Molirena but they have not announced that. [Famania] When will you decide on cabinet changes? [Endara] I am thinking it over now and I will make the announcement in due time. [Famania] Will you appoint Arnulfists or independents? [Endara] I will make the announcement in due time. [Famania] These changes could affect your administration. [Endara] Affect it as a result of the changes? Well, of course, all changes affect an administration, but the effects can be favorable or unfavorable. I hope it will be favorable. [Famania] Mr. President, thank you very much for speaking with us this morning.
