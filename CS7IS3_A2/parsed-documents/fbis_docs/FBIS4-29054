"When a question arises and Japan cannot accept it at any cost, in order to reject it with all its might, it should be no problem for Japan to be a permanent member with veto," Kakizawa said in answer to questions at a House of Councillors Budget Committee session. The minister said Japan should act to reflect views of the Asian region and small countries if it wins permanent membership with veto power. Japan and Germany are now the only likely candidates for permanent seats should the Security Council expand the number from the current five, he said. The council now groups Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, which have veto power as the major victor nations of World War II, and 10 nonpermanent members selected from UN member nations for two-year terms. Other countries including Brazil, Egypt, India and Nigeria have been named as candidates, but they have failed to win majority support among UN members, the minister said. Earlier this month, Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to the UN, asked a UN panel to discuss reorganization of the Security Council given Japan's bid for a permanent seat, but he did not mention veto.
