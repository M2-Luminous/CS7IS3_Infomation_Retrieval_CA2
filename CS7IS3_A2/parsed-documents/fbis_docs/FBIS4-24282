In a general policy statement before the Assembly of People's Deputies, he recalled that the "immediate effects" of the devaluation of the CFA franc last January have strongly disturbed the country's economic balances. He said his goal is to reach a real growth rate of more than five percent a year by 1996, to limit the rise in prices of consumer goods, and to reduce deficits in public finances. On the political plane, he announced that municipal elections would be held "in the first half" of February 1995.
