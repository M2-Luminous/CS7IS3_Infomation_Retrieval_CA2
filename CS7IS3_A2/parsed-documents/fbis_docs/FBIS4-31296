Petocz, secretary of the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] for foreign relations, yesterday described as a belated April fools joke the Coexistence Movement's offer for the conclusion of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition without the participation of MOS leadership members on the common slate of candidates. "This cannot be a serious political gesture," he said. MOS Chairman L. Nagy assesses [Coexistence Chairman Miklos] Duray's movement's attitude as an attempt to eliminate a competitor. "It is like cutting off an athlete's arms and legs and putting him on the starting line," he said. At the same time, however, he conceded that, so far, MOS has not been informed through official channels of the conclusions of the Coexistence Republic Council's meeting [at Lucenec on 28 May], which it knows only from media reports. According to Petocz, Coexistence representatives should finally start behaving like politicians and stop acting like offended persons. Otherwise, he stressed, it might happen that the Hungarian minority will not be represented in parliament at all. "And that would mean an additional 20 deputies for Meciar and the Slovak National Party," he said. MOS Chairman Nagy observed in this context that not only the Hungarian minority would be placed at a disadvantage in that case but also the whole of Slovakia, which, owing to the irresponsibility of a handful of people, would acquire the reputation of a country that is intolerant toward ethnic minorities.
