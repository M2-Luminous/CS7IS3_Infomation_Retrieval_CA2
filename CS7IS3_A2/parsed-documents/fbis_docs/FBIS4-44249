Porfirio Mederos, deputy chief [vice president] of Cuba's Chamber of Commerce, speaking during a visit to ITO said Turkey should attend the Havana fair to open up to South American countries. But it was unclear whether Mederos was speaking solely about South American countries or Cuba -- Cuba is a North American island 90 miles (144 kms) south of the United States. Mederos called on Turkish businessmen to invest in Cuba. "With a trade and economic agreement," Mederos said, "Turkey and Cuba will reach the desired level of trade." The Cuban delegation will visit various installations in Istanbul before returning to their county.
