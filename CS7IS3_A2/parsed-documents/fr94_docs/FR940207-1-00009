ACTION: Proposed official staff interpretation. SUMMARY: The Board is publishing for comment a proposed official staff commentary to Regulation DD (Truth in Savings).

The proposed commentary incorporates much of the guidance provided when the regulation was adopted, and addresses additional questions that have been raised about the application of its requirements. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0824, and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20551. Comments also may be delivered to room B&hyph;2222 of the Eccles Building between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. weekdays, or to the guard station in the Eccles Building courtyard on 20th Street, NW. (between Constitution Avenue and C Street) at any time. Comments may be inspected in Room MP&hyph;500 of the Martin Building between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays, except as provided in 12 CFR 261.8 of the Board's rules regarding the availability of information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane Ahrens, Kyung Cho, Kurt Schumacher or Mary Jane Seebach, Staff Attorneys, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at (202) 452&hyph;3667 or 452&hyph;2412; for the hearing impaired only , Dorothea Thompson, Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, at (202) 452&hyph;3544. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: (1) Background The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq. ) is to assist consumers in comparing deposit accounts offered by depository institutions. The act requires institutions to disclose fees, the interest rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a consumer requests the information and before an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement the institution sends to the consumer. Rules are set forth for deposit account advertisements and advance notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms. The act restricts how institutions must determine the account balance on which interest is calculated. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective on June 21, 1993. The regulation authorizes the issuance of official staff interpretations of the regulation. (See Appendix D to Regulation DD.) The Board is publishing a proposed commentary to Regulation DD. The proposal is designed to provide guidance to depository institutions in applying the regulation to specific transactions and is a substitute for individual staff interpretations. The Board contemplates updating the commentary periodically to address significant questions that arise. It is expected that this commentary will be adopted in final form in June 1994 with a six-month time period for optional compliance until the effective date, estimated in December 1994. (2) Proposed Commentary The Federal Register documents containing the regulation that implemented the act and documents for subsequent amendments set forth a large amount of supplementary material interpreting the new regulation. (See final rule published on September 21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October 5, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March 19, 1993 (58 FR 15077).) In large measure, the proposed commentary incorporates the supplementary material from those rulemakings, and reflects the views expressed therein without substantive change. A number of issues that have arisen since the publication of the regulation have also been addressed. Proposed interpretations of new issues are noted below. On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal to amend the regulation's rules for calculating the annual percentage yield for accounts that pay interest prior to maturity (58 FR 64190). (See also the notice extending the comment period published on January 13, 1994, 59 FR 1921.) The Board has deferred proposing commentary on provisions of the regulation affected by the proposal, pending final action by the Board.
