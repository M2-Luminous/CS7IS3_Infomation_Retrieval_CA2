The protection of people and property was guaranteed. I would like to remind you that the curfew was introduced just after the elections, after the publication of the results of the presidential elections, because there was a serious threat of unrest, of violence, of the country spiralling into civil war. [Diop] Your announcement today was, nevertheless, accompanied by a warning to those threatening public order. Is this mainly addressed to the political parties who had contested the validity of the election results?
