FR940826-0-00116 FR940826-0-00019 (4) The name and phone number of an FAA security special agent involved in the investigation of the violation; (5) Information regarding informal procedures; and (6) Information on how to request a formal hearing before a DOT ALJ. In appropriate cases, the agency may extend to the respondent a settlement offer to resolve the case immediately with a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, on the condition that the penalty is paid or a commitment to pay is made within 30 days. In conjunction with the publication of this rule, the FAA will issue guidance on the exercise of its discretionary settlement authority in these cases as well as other similar cases not covered by the test and evaluation program. This guidance will be published in Appendix 1 of FAA Order 2150.3A, Compliance and Enforcement Program, and may be changed during the test program. The FAA believes that swifter notification of a violation, coupled, in most cases, with an immediate offer of settlement, may encourage quick resolution of simple cases while, at the same time, having no negative impact on the effectiveness of the enforcement process. The National Performance Review studied a similar program offered by the Federal Highway Administration and found that approximately 40 percent of proposed civil penalties were paid in this manner within 30 days. The provisions of this SFAR will not limit the respondent's rights in any way. An individual may choose to proceed under the current informal and formal procedures, including requesting an informal conference with an FAA attorney or formal hearing before a DOT ALJ. If the FAA and respondent are unable to resolve the case informally, or if the respondent fails to respond to the NOV within 30 days after receiving it, a final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (``final notice and order'') will be issued to the respondent. This document serves two purposes: (1) It provides a second opportunity for the respondent to request a hearing on the record before a DOT ALJ; and (2) It becomes an order assessing a civil penalty if the respondent pays the civil penalty proposed in the final notice and order, or the respondent does not request a hearing in accordance with the final notice and order and fails to pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty. This streamlined process dispenses with the current procedure requiring a separate order assessing civil penalty to be sent to the respondent when the respondent pays the amount of the civil penalty reflected in the final notice of proposed civil penalty, or when the respondent fails to request a hearing in accordance with the final notice of proposed civil penalty and fails to pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty. The final disposition of the assessment action results from the respondent's act or failure to act upon receipt of the final notice. Issuance of a separate document entitled ``order assessing civil penalty'' under the current procedures provides no additional rights or notice to the respondent that is not otherwise given in the final notice and order under these procedures. Accordingly, elimination of the issuance of a separate order assessing civil penalty under these circumstances will not alter the procedural protections afforded respondents. The final notice and order will be issued by an appropriate Assistant Chief Counsel. The final notice and order will result in either a civil penalty assessment or a formal hearing. Regulatory Evaluation Summary Changes to Federal regulations are required to undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. With respect to this rule, the FAA has determined that it: (1) is not ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. Therefore, a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule, has not been prepared. Instead, the agency has prepared a more concise analysis of this rule which is presented in the following paragraphs. The rule establishes a test program at three airports. The program covers certain civil penalty cases against individuals submitting dangerous or deadly weapons for screening at airport checkpoints or in checked baggage. The rule will apply only to those cases that facially appear to be simple and are factually straightforward, and that are uncomplicated to process. During the test period, the rule delegates authority to program office managers to initiate legal enforcement actions and reduces the number of documents issued in this action. The rule is intended to streamline the agency's civil penalty enforcement process of notifying individuals of certain violations by processing these actions within reduced time frames. Costs There will be no costs associated with this rule because it consists only of changes to agency rules of procedure or practice in part 13 of the FAA's regulations. The changes do not impose any new economic requirements on the affected parties. Benefits The streamlined procedures will reduce the number of documents to be served upon individuals. Additionally, this rule will likely reduce the time between the violation and the processing of the enforcement action.
