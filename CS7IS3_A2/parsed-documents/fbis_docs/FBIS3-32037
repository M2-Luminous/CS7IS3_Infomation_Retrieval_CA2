Here is a report on the plans of the new ministers, to whom we wish lots of success. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] First, we will interview Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. What are your first measures going to be? [Burelli] Work. [Reporter] What are your plans? [Burelli] Reinforce or restore Venezuela's image abroad, which has recently deteriorated. [Enzo del Buffalo, nominee for chief of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning of the Presidency] We will try to conduct profound reforms in the basic industries and oil sectors. We will try to complement those reforms with policies consonant with the current circumstances in order to stabilize the foreign exchange rate, control inflation, and reduce fiscal deficits through austerity measures already announced. [Rafael Angel Montero Revette, nominee for defense minister] We will review the Armed Forces plans and above all, we will reactivate and improve the Armed Forces social welfare plan. This includes the areas of health and housing, so our soldiers can live and work under better conditions. [Abdon Vivas Teran, nominee for president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund] We will strengthen the privatization process. We will try to promote it on the basis of solid, technical, conceptual, and at the same time participative plans. We believe that participation will serve to increase the state's efficiency, distribute wealth, and make the productive apparatus more efficient. [Ciro Anez Fonseca, nominee for agriculture and livestock minister] My priorities will be based on the president's interest to encourage productive sectors, particularly the agricultural sector, which has suffered difficulties during the past few years which we hope to resolve in the near future. [German Luis Soriano, nominee for tourism minister] One of the most important activities in the country's economic development in the next few years will be developing tourism as an activity that not only will create new jobs but will also help develop important regions in the country that have been neglected in the past. [Juan Nepomuceno Garrido, nominee for labor minister] The social welfare plan must be defined by the president of the Republic. So far we have not.... [pauses] I know his opinion and he knows mine, we both know what the country's current situation is. You can be sure that President Caldera will have in me a faithful, loyal minister, who is willing to work, follow his policies, and lead the country to a path of well-being. [Ruben Creixems, nominee for justice minister] What was not done in 20 years cannot be done overnight. We must, however, work hard to attain our goals. [Julio Sosa, nominee for finance minister] I believe balancing the budget is fundamental to curbing inflation, or at least reducing it to an acceptable level. [end recording]
