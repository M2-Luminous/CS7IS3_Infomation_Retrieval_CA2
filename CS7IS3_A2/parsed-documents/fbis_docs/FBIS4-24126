He said only 655 soldiers have been confined this week, a figure which he described as marginal considering that to comply with its plan the government should demobilize 1,500 soldiers per day until 1 July. Aldo Ajello said the government pledged to comply with the timetable, though he believes he ought to meet the president of the Republic to discuss the issue and find satisfactory and realistic solutions. The meeting should take place before Chissano leaves for Lisbon where Lusophone countries are scheduled to hold a conference. Aldo Ajello said 2,427 soldiers from both sides were demobilized this week. It has been estimated that 4,076 soldiers from both sides will be demobilized next week. He said the 13,776 government soldiers demobilized before the signing of the peace accord will receive demobilization allowances. As of 29 June, they should report to the Reintegration Commission [Core] to be registered. At a meeting yesterday, the Supervision and Control Commission ratified the plan to assist in the reintegration of demobilized soldiers. The plan provides for a minimum income for demobilized troops to encourage the latter to live in areas of their choice, thereby restricting migration into cities. The plan is also designed to supplement any other schemes adopted by Core to assist demobilized troops with means other than financial ones. The reintegration scheme includes a financial plan that provides for fixed monthly payments in local currency over a 18-month period. Payments will begin three months after demobilization and will cover 69,140 government and Renamo troops. The overall cost of the scheme has been estimated at $19,032,580. The governments of Denmark, FRG, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and of Switzerland have contributed to that fund. Ajello said he was pleased with the Mozambican Government's decision to pay pensions to Renamo troops maimed during the war, noting that that is a significant sign of national reconciliation. He said government teams, with UN Operations in Mozambique logistical assistance, have already begun operating in centers for war-maimed soldiers.
