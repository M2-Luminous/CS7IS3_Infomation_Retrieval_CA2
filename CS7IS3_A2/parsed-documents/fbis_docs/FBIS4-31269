Envoy Yasushi Akashi in Geneva on Tuesday evening that the Federation could only accept a four-week-long ceasefire for war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. Proceeding from a declaration adopted by the contact group on Bosnia on May 13 in Geneva, Akashi has been insisting on a four-month truce. In Ganic's view, everything else but a four-week ceasefire would imply retaining the status quo from which only the Serbs would benefit. He also reprimanded reporters at the Palais des Nations for ignoring his accusations of the Serbs. "I have seen all the papers and my statements are nowhere to be found. "Today I told (U.N. Secretary-General Butrus) Butrus-Ghali he is chiefly to blame for the spreading of the ethnic cleansing policy in the world," said Ganic aggressively. Regardless of his fervent anti-Serb campaign, Ganic is no longer able to hide from the reporters the simple truth that the conference is being undermined by the Moslem-Croat side. Early in the afternoon, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the Serbs were prepared to accept Akashi's suggestion for a four-month ceasefire and that some results conducive to peace would be achieved in Geneva after all. More bilateral talks will be held in the evening.
