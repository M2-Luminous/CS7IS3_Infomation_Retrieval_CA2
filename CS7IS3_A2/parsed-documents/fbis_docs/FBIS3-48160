Laying ahead of our people are major challenges and opportunities. These challenges are: -- The danger of being further left behind economically, compared with many countries in the region and the world due to the fact that we started from the lowest point, and that our growth rate is not high and steady enough, while having to struggle upward in a fiercely competitive environment. -- The danger of straying off the course of socialism if we fail to abide by implementation guidelines. -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills. -- Peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of hostile forces. Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages: -- Our party has a correct policy line and it is united and single-minded. -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic. They have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and believe in the party leadership. -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the revolutionary cause of our party and people. -- The successes obtained in the renovation process are creating our new posture and strengths. -- The development of the scientific and technological revolution and the trend toward broadening world and regional ties of cooperation and development have brought to us opportunities to obtain more important resources. The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress for the period until 1995 will consist of overcoming difficulties and ordeals, stabilizing and developing socioeconomic activities, strengthening political stability, dispelling negativism and social injustices, and basically tiding the country over the current crisis. Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a significant part of that target, especially the economic ones. For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind; to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden international relations; practice the motto of industry, thrift, integrity and righteousness; strive to exploit our advantages; dispel dangers; overcome ordeals; and successfully achieve the general targets cited above. We must quicken our pace to achieve the various aims of the strategy for socioeconomic stability and development until the year 2000, in a bid to build a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and civilized society. The following are essential tasks: 1. To press for changes in the economic structure in the direction of industrialization and modernization. Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and strengthening of development cooperation with various countries and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead by another step our national industrialization and modernization to create more jobs, speed up the pace of economic growth, and further renovate the people's material and spiritual life. This is a central task of foremost importance for the period ahead. Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid the danger of being further left behind, compared to nearby countries; to maintain political and social stability; to protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of socialist development. At present, we have not followed the old pattern of industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness, and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized. Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy. Rather, it is a process of structural changes linked with radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid growth and high and long- lasting efficiency for the entire national economy. Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with scientific and technological progress in the world. The orientation, scale, and steps of the process of industrialization and modernization must be carefully thought out through a complete understanding of the following important points: -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must go along with the broadening of international cooperation, building an open-door economy both at home and abroad, multilateralizing and diversifying relations with other countries, combining economic activities with national defense and security, and linking economic growth with social progress and social justice, and with cultural development and environmental protection. -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts at exports while replacing imports that can be produced locally. -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given period. -- Constantly improving the competitiveness in local, regional, and international markets. -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard for determining the course of development and for selecting investment and technological projects. -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country, of each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources for the various fields of activity and various key areas to promptly produce high results while paying attention to meeting essential requirements, working out practical policies, systems, and measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up development cooperation, and ensuring that various regions and strata of people can benefit from the results of economic growth. -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size projects that require small capital investments and capital that can be recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using short-term projects to finance long-term ones. -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects. -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. -- Combining traditional technologies with modern technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs. -- From now until the end of this decade, great attention must be paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities. -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively building infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas where development is being hindered. -- Selectively building heavy industries establishments in important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in which we have conditions in terms of capital, technologies, and marketplace to achieve rapid development and high results. -- Developing scientific and technological studies and application, education and training, public health, and environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term development requirements. While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor, resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read regional and world development trends, the strategies and policies of trading partners and rival competitors, and attempt to discover new opportunities and comparative advantages. We must foster and develop to the fullest our most decisive resource, namely the Vietnamese population, for long-term development and to prepare the necessary conditions for development along this course. To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign source of capital as important. To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with efforts to improve the efficiency of capital management. This requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in material production. Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest loans given by various governments and international financial and monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely manage, distribute and effectively use our existing public assets, and must guard against losses and wasteful spending. The state's capital investment is designed mainly for building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key, spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services. Part of this investment must also be reserved for financing employment projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare hills and expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities. The state will only allocate invested capital to socioeconomic infrastructure projects and to areas where the capital is not likely to be recovered. As for the credit loans invested by the government, it must be returned by users. We must renovate our managerial mechanism in capital construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation of state-owned capital, especially in planning activities. We must determine unit price in construction and must verify the results of the projects. We must use support services, verify product qualities, [words indistinct] of highly credible local and foreign companies in this area. Each project must have a supervisor. If it is a project where the capital must be recovered, then full amount must be recovered for the state and within schedule. We must find all ways to be thrifty and to invest in development projects of the people and in various firms belonging to various economic components under various forms. This must be done in such a way as to ensure that the potentialities are mobilized and every cent invested will yield profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this source of capital in the total capital investment of the entire society.
