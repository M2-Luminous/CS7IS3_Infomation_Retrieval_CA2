The president of the Russian Federation stated on the steps of the aircraft on arrival in Naberezhnyye Chelny: "I was beaten, severely criticized for this phrase, but I endured it all and was right." To confirm his words, Boris Yeltsin gave the example of Tatarstan, the bilateral treaty which showed that "the republic has taken on as much responsibilities as it can cope with. As for what is beyond its capabilities, it has delegated that to the federal authorities." According to the Russian president, the main thing for Russia at present is to implement the treaty. In the view of Emil Pain, a Russian president expert, both sides, Russia and Tatarstan, have so far been violating the agreement: the republic is sending four-five times less tax revenue to the federal budget than had been laid down in the agreement. In turn, Russia is not ensuring that a mechanism for the implementation of the treaty is being drawn up. Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev, when greeting Boris Yeltsin at Naberezhnyye Chelny airport, reaffirmed his adherence to the phrase "strong republics -- strong center." He said that the aim of the present meeting was "strengthening trust, finding a joint solution to economic problems, and discussing federal programs." Boris Yeltsin intends to begin his look at the course of reform in Tatarstan at the Kama automobile works, beginning with the production plant that was hit by fire, to decide what help can be given to the automobile manufacturers. In the view of Sergey Shakhray, which he expressed to an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of the visit to Tatarstan, the matter does not concern credits or subsidies for the Kama automobile works, but guarantees from the Russian Government for commercial and foreign investment in the joint-stock company.
