Basu, a member of the politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said in a statement that the reports that North Korean officials had asked him to arrange emergency shipments of rice from India were "absolutely baseless." "I had talks with several leaders of (North Korea), including the prime minister," said Basu, who visited North Korea from May 7-14. "But no one made such a request to me. "On the contrary, I was impressed by their economic development, construction work and their confidence to meet any situation," he said. "The news item is obviously intended to show (North Korea) in a bad light." Basu, who heads India's sole communist state government, has been in power in West Bengal for 17 years.
