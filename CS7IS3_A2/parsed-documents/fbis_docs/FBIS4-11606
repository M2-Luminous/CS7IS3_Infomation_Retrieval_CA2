These rules would go into effect in 1995, by which time the four countries will be exchanging products without charging customs fees. The current rules contemplate a minimum national content of 50 percent in each product, with the possibility that the tariff may be changed. Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative before the Latin American Integration Association [ALADI] in Montevideo, has said that Brazil proposes increasing this percentage to 75 percent and demands that product classifications be modified. He said that if it is not possible to enforce stricter rules, the trade of vehicles within the Mercosur would continue via import quotas, even after January 1995. The Brazilian Government may begin to negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement for the implementation of the South American Free Trade Area [SAFTA] without affecting its trade within Mercosur. Ambassador Nogueira Batista pointed out that the Asuncion Treaty, which created the Mercosur, allows this initiative. Interested countries can present exception lists on which certain products would be protected by higher tariffs. The remaining products would have zero tariffs for 10 years as of January 1995. Jorge Campbell, Argentine secretary for international economic relations, has reservations about the negotiation of accords to create SAFTA. He said: "The countries that negotiate these accords will have access to an agreement which took us a long time to negotiate."
