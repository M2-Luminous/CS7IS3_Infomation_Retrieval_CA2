Marcos is the main military strategist and spokesperson for the Zapatists, who took up arms in the southern state of Chiapas on 1 January. "If the electoral system is not revolutionized, regardless of whether the Zapatists exist or whether they annihilate us, the country will rise up," the mysterious rebel leader said in an interview published today by the newspaper LA JORNADA. During the interview held somewhere in the Lacandona Jungle, the EZLN spokesperson, whose identity is concealed by the classic ski cap worn by the Chiapas rebels, insisted on the need for guaranteeing democratic elections in Mexico. "They can negotiate peace in Chiapas in February, but by June the country will have another revolt," Marcos said, stressing the need for political reforms that will prevent the Mexican Government from controlling the presidential elections scheduled for 21 August. The rebel subcommander described the current moment on the eve of the first direct meeting between Manuel Camacho Solis, the government's peace commissioner, and the EZLN as being between a "monologue disguised as a dialogue" and a "potential war conflict." "The war is not actual but latent. It could break out at any moment," the EZLN leader said, explaining that this is why the EZLN cannot give up its arms. Marcos said the Mexican Government is handling the dialogue process as an ultimatum to the guerrillas because it "is preparing the political conditions for a large-scale military operation." In spite of this, Subcommander Marcos expressed his confidence that the guerrillas can achieve important political results in their negotiations with the government. He said that some 15 rebels of the EZLN and of the so-called Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command, the main organization of the EZLN, will attend the dialogue with Camacho Solis. The site of the meeting is not yet known, but the meeting is supposed to begin this week. The guerrilla leader said the role of the media was decisive in making the quick transition from the 12-day war to the dialogue, for which he admitted the EZLN was unprepared. "We were prepared for a long war of attrition, of military clashes, of political disputes over towns, of ideological struggle, and for a possible dialogue later, once the government agreed," Marcos stated.
