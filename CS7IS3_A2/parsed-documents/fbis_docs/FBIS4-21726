FBIS4-21726 "jptot014__l94026" JPRS-TOT-94-014-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 26 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Update on Colosio Assassination Update on Colosio Assassination Official Describes Suspects' Interrogation PA2603035594 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0014 GMT 26 Mar 94 PA2603035594 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report by Francisco Mendoza from Tijuana, Baja California; from the ``ACIR Radio News'' newscast] [Text] The possibility that more than one person took part in the attack against Luis Donaldo Colosio was strongly suggested today by Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the Baja California human rights attorney general, who was present when Mario Aburto Martinez was interrogated for approximately two hours. The local ZETA weekly magazine has reported that the FBI believes that Aburto could be part of a left-wing political group. The publication added that someone had shouted ``kill him!'' just seconds before the first shot rang out. If this is true, it confirms Perez Canchola's statements that another person was in on the crime and was at the site of the assassination. The Attorney General's Office has confirmed that the DEA and FBI are helping with the criminal investigation and have started to check on several of Aburto's relatives in California. I will now play the tape [previous word in English] with Perez Canchola's statements. Here it is: [Begin recording] Perez: We were all present and heard this man's statements [words indistinct] so calmly and with an complete control of his nerves. He spoke with a firm voice when he answered [words indistinct]. Furthermore, he was extremely adamant in his refusal to answer most of the questions that were asked. Because of the gravity of this event, the strong supposition has emerged that this was an act organized by more than one person. It would have taken a very extraordinary person to carry out this action single-handedly. It had to be carried out by someone with a great deal of education and training, as he himself has stated. It is evident from his statements that he organized the act. He bought a weapon with which, over a period of time, he conducted target practice in a field -- a field he did not identify in his testimony. He specifically told us that his intention was to wound candidate Colosio to call the media's attention to pacifism and to enable him to talk publicly about pacifism. [words indistinct] his statements. He said that after being pushed and in the process of [words indistinct]. You [reporters] were there and know what happened, right? I must say that while giving general facts and other scant details about this action, he answered with a great deal of serenity. He was asked about the possibility of being part of a group, and he was questioned on his preparations in carrying out this action. He refused to reply to any of these questions. [words indistinct] but he always refused to reply. He even refused to sign the testimony documents. I have to say that I only saw him appear nervous once. I noticed this because I saw his eyes widen and look incredulously at the person. This was when they informed him that candidate Colosio had died. He started to mumble something, but he fell silent and immediately resumed his position of refusing to answer any question. This is what I perceived about him. He is a young person, 23 years old, who has the apperance of a worker. He showed a great deal of self-confidence during the entire time I was with him. To have done what he did, it seems to me that any person would show signs of anxiety, but he was extremely calm. I saw him walk briskly from one office to another. It appears he prepared himself psychologically for some time to do what he did. Unidentified reporter: Why do you think he acted like this? Do you think he is aligned with an organization or that he acted with a friend or was encouraged by someone else? Perez: I agreed to talk to you only about what I saw at the meeting [words indistinct] the rest is speculation. I have only dared think... [pauses] the magnitude of this criminal act and his conduct have led me to believe that more than one person was involved. [end recording]
