The visit comes only one day after the expiry of a NATO ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw or put under UN control all their heavy weapons in Sarajevo, or face NATO air strikes, which were deemed as unnecessary by NATO and UN officials "for the time being." Accompanying Silajdzic will be Bosnian Parliament President Miro Lazovic and Presidency Member Ivo Komsic. "The visit comes at a crucial moment for the future of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people," the local Bosnian Embassy said. Washington has been sympathetic with the Bosnian Government, which is comprised mainly of Muslims, the grieved side in the 22- month war in the Yugoslav republic. Appearing in an interview of the ABC Television, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, "finding a rational settlement, finding one that is satisfactory to the Muslims, has to be a very high priority." Christopher, who is scheduled to meet Silajdzic Monday morning, said Washington is trying to know what the Bosnian Muslims' "reasonable requirements" are and help them achieve them. Silajdzic will stay in Washington for three days. He will first meet Deputy Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman Monday morning. The prime minister will have a second meeting with Christopher Thursday afternoon. After their stay in Washington, Silajdzic and his entourage will go to New York Friday, the Bosnian Embassy said.
