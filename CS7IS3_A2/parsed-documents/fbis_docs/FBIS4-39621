The United States, Japan, and the ROK are vigorously trying to impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Considering that the PRC might veto the decision, the United States is evaluating the possibility of so-called sanction measures to apply economic pressure. First, the measure bans all contracts related to weapon sales. The embargo does not include coal and petroleum. The economic sanction measures are another means to obtain UN Security Council approval. Russia reminds them of the fact that gradual and phased sanctions by an international organ would not be opposed when all other measures have failed. Considering the PRC position, I think making a decision on an embargo by the UN Security Council would be impossible at the moment. Therefore, it is urgent to convene an international conference for the security and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as proposed by Russia. The conference may be attended by the representatives of the DPRK, South Korea, Russia, the United States, the PRC, Japan, the United Nations, and the IAEA. The conference should be an authoritative conference that contributes to ending the dangerous confrontation on the peninsula and enables the DPRK to express its concerns during the progress. U.S. President Clinton had a telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin last week and said that the conference may be appropriate at a certain time. I would like to ask him what is the appropriate time? Is it after sanctions are imposed? I doubt anything could be achieved at that point. In addition to its proposal, Moscow is prepared to evaluate other coordination measures. However, all possible political measures should be taken. There are reports that the United States, Japan, and South Korea are preparing three-party sanctions against Pyongyang without a UN decision. They should not forget that Russia has great economic and trading interests in the DPRK. When independent three-party sanctions are imposed, Russia will be in a position to consider its own legal interests.
