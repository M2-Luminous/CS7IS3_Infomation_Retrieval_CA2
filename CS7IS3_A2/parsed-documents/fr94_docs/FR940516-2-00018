FR940516-2-00018 FR940516-2-00012 Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 17&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 84_Houston, TX; Application for Subzone Status Microwave Networks, Inc. (Microwave Radios) An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Port of Houston Authority, grantee of FTZ 84, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the microwave radio manufacturing plant of Microwave Networks, Inc. (MNI), located in Houston, Texas. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 29, 1994. The MNI plant is located at 10795 Rockley Road, in Harris County, Houston, Texas. The facility (3.5 acres, 240 employees) is used to manufacture microwave radios for use in cellular and other wireless communication networks (duty rates: 2.4% to 6%). Foreign-origin materials used in the manufacturing process (some 70% of total) include: Electronic transformers, multiplexors, antennnas, transmitters/receivers, capacitors, resistors, printed circuits, diodes, transistors, integrated circuits, insulated wire, coaxial cable, flexible RF waveguide and waveguide parts (duty rates: duty-free to 10%). The application indicates that privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) would be elected on all foreign merchandise admitted to the subzone. Zone procedures would exempt MNI from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production (90% of output). On domestic sales, MNI would be able to defer Customs duty payments until the finished products leave the plant. Foreign materials and finished products held for export would be eligible for an exemption from certain state and local ad valorem taxes. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve MNI's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 15, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period August 1, 1994. A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: U.S. Department of Commerce District Office # 1 Allen Center, 500 Dallas, Suite 1160 Houston, TX 77002. Office of the Executive Secretary Foreign-Trade Zones Board U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Dated: May 9, 1994. John J.
