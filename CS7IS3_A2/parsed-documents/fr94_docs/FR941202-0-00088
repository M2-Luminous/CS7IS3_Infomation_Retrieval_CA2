FR941202-0-00088 FR941202-0-00010 (2) If the cleaning machine is a batch vapor cleaning machine and does not have a solvent/air interface, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section. (i) Maintain a log of solvent additions and deletions for each solvent cleaning machine. (ii) Ensure that the emissions from each solvent cleaning machine are equal to or less than the appropriate limits as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. (A) For cleaning machines with a cleaning capacity, as reported in §63.468(d), that is less than or equal to 2.95 cubic meters, the emission limit shall be determined using table 6 or equation 1. If using table 6, and the cleaning capacity of the cleaning machine falls between two cleaning capacity sizes, then the lower of the two emission limits applies. (B) For cleaning machines with a cleaning capacity as reported in §63.468(d), that is greater than 2.95 cubic meters, the emission limit shall be determined using equation 1. EL = 330 * (Vol) 0.6 ␣␣(1) where: EL = the 3-month rolling average monthly emission limit (kilograms/month).
