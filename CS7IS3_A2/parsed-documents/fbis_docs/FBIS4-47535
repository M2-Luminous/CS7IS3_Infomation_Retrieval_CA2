L. Leonova, O. V. Korotkova, T. I. Zabotina et al; Scientific Research Institute of Biotechnology, Moscow, Oncological Scientific Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow UDC 578.7 4 [Signed to press 4 Apr 93] [Abstract] The aim of the study was production of monoclonal antibodies and their fragments against Thym-1 antigen in order to develop, on their base, a diagnosticum, for immunohistological study of tumors of the peripheral nervous system, to produce a preparation for visualization of these tumors and to explain the role of this antigen in proliferative processes. Highly purified antibody ICO-10 IgM class against the Thy-1 antigen of thymocytes was produced and descri bed. The yield from 1 ml of of ascite was 5.3 + or - 1.6 mg. Hydrolysis of the monoclonal antibody by pepsin produced a fragment of molecular class 150-250 KD with 20 percent yield. Fragments were stable and preserved antigen-binding activity after modifications. Hydrolysis of the monoclonal antibody by trypsin produced fragments with molecular mass of 400 and 600 KDa with 50 percent yield. IgM fragments were tested on cells by cytofluorimetry. The antigen determined by ICO-10 was expressed by 5 percent on hyman thymocytes, by 45 percent on mouse thymocytes and by 35 percent on EL-4 cells. Figures 7; references 25: 3 Russian, 22 Western.
