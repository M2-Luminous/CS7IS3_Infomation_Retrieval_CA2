What was the greatest characteristic of that period, I would say, of important meetings and discussions? [Crvenkovski] The main characteristic of the days preceding the admission of the Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations was the attempt of Greece to prevent it at the last minute. That was the reason for the prolongation in handing their letter. All possible manipulations were used in order to prevent our admission at the last minute. Greece is handing, Greece is not handing the letter, it is handing it with a signature, without.... After that the Athens Government made attempts to postpone the procedure as long as possible with the UN General Assembly, now that it could not prevent the admission. They insisted that the General Assembly review the admission of Macedonia at a regular session. The main activity of the Macedonian delegation in New York those last 10 days was to "get" the UN General Assembly, and to fulfill the admission to the United Nations as soon as possible, that is immediately, which was finally carried out. The attempted postponement was, as a matter of fact, due to the fact that the Greek side became aware that, with the admission of Macedonia to the United Nations, the whole situation had drastically changed. They hoped time would help them and they hoped the whole situation could be essentially changed. Because if Macedonia had not become a member of the United Nations, it would be likewise in other international institutions within the UN system, without which it is impossible for a state to function. These are institutions, like telecommunications, transport, financial transactions, registration of vehicles, registration of aircraft, a whole complex of relations which make possible the communication of a state in the world by becoming a member of those organizations. If there is not a normal communication in the world, then there comes a total economic collapse in a country, with all the relevant consequences. That was the basis on which Greece constructed its strategy. They wanted either to prevent or postpone it as much as possible, and our vital interest was to regulate our membership as soon as possible, in order to make possible all the aspects of a normal international living, and to make the state function. [E.K.] Which were the states that helped us most in those activities, negotiations, and persuasions for easing the pressures of Greece before the membership of our country in the world community, and who were the diplomats you had the most frequent contacts with? [Crvenkovski] Well, the most profound influence was certainly of the three countries which proposed the resolution on the admission of our state to the United Nations, three countries of the European Community, which are Great Britain, France, and Spain, which was then also one of the 15 members of the Security Council. It is true that nothing would have been accomplished without the help of the five permanent members of the Security Council. [E.K.] What was the situation like with the so-called sponsors of the resolution on the admission of Macedonia to the United Nations? [Crvenkovski] If I am not mistaken, Macedonia formally had only 67 sponsors. What was of extreme importance was the great number of the members. It was also important that this number was reached in practically 24 hours. Normally, the period required for providing sponsors for a resolution on admission of a country to the United Nations lasts 15, 30, or 60 days. The ambassadors of these countries were practically standing in line for 24 hours to sign the resolution on our sponsorship. I here have to point out that we had the great support of the Slovenian mission to the United Nations, which was the main sponsor, and which did almost all the technical job in gathering other members. [E.K.] The importance of the admission of Macedonia to the United Nations is apparent. What happened and what has changed in the international life of Macedonia a year later? [Crvenkovski] As a direct consequence of the membership in the United Nations, we became members of all its specialized agencies. There are 26 such agencies, and each one of them is of vital importance for the functioning of a state. We have accomplished a full membership in 26 agencies, and what is left is only to regulate relations with GATT. There we have observer status, and we still have not regulated our membership because the negotiations with GATT need a long process of difficult negotiations, step by step, on all forms of non-customs measures of protection, something that cannot normally be expected to be solved in less than a year of negotiation. The problem is not of a political, but of a technical nature. Just after our membership in the United Nations there followed a process of membership to many state organizations, institutions, cultural, sports, and scientific international associations. It was all urged after the admission of Macedonia to the United Nations. In the meantime the process of bilateral recognition was carried out with a great number of countries, as well as of establishing diplomatic relations. The Republic of Macedonia has established full diplomatic relations with 30 countries, and 30 to 40 more countries have formally recognized our Republic. Our passports have been accepted by almost the whole world, with the exception of two neighboring countries. This is evidently a situation totally different from what we had before the admission of our country to the United Nations. [E.K.] What does the admission of Macedonia to the world organization mean for the political and security plan in relation to the Bucharest agreement of 1913? [Crvenkovski] The very act of admission to the United Nations is a de facto confirmation of the independence of the relevant state. After that moment the state becomes a full subject in international relations. It bears all the other international legal consequences following the act of recognition. Until then, until Macedonia entered the United Nations, almost all speculations concerning its future were possible. The moment we became an equal UN member the speculations stopped. Beside the practical aspects that I have here noted, membership in the specialized agencies of the world organization represents a significant moment when the sovereignty of a state is really completed. [E.K.] The problem in the relations with Greece existed even before the Macedonian membership in the United Nations, and it is still there. What are the essential changes in the negotiating status for overcoming the disputed issues between the two countries? [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to call not upon our assessment, but upon the assessment of the Greek side. During the recent discussions in the Greek parliament, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou evaluated the admission of Macedonia to the United Nations as one of the biggest errors of Greek diplomacy. I do not know how truly it is an error of the Greek diplomacy, speaking in long terms, but the claim proves that the other side is totally aware of the enormous importance of that act. First of all because since 8 April last year there has existed a relationship of equal partners in the negotiations. In spite of the fact that the other side is making desperate attempts and various problems, including the embargo against us, and in spite of all the hot statements, it is a fact that the other side, by starting the process of negotiations, demonstrated it negotiated with a sovereign country. After our admission to the United Nations, it became an equal process between two states in dispute. Until the moment of entering the United Nations, there was the problem of a state that proclaimed independence, not yet realized. After our membership in the United Nations that question was canceled from the agenda, and if you review the whole development of the total relationship of the international organizations toward the Republic of Macedonia during the past 12 months, as well as the bilateral relationship of a number of countries, and the relationship of the world's public, you will see that after the admission the whole treatment has radically changed. The disposition of the world's opinion, of all the leading world's magazines and dailies, as well as television stations, is evident, expressed in the interest of the public for the maintenance of the integrity of an independent state, a member of the world organization. Before that, that was not the case. Normally, there were various interests, although there was a certain level of support with the world's public, though of a totally different quality.
