The United States President, Bill Clinton, arrives in Moscow on Wednesday evening. What does Moscow expect from the talks between President Boris Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton? Vladislav Chernukha, accredited to the summit, got the following information at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this is what he writes: The first official visit of Bill Clinton to Russia, in the first instance, should confirm the progress that has been achieved in bilateral relations between the two countries in the past year. Second, it is expected that concrete ways of tuning the relationship between these countries, and also the perfecting of the cooperation mechanism and joint actions on the international arena will be worked out. It is difficult to conclude that the bilateral relationship between Russia and America are developing smoothly, without hitches. Naturally, there are complications and problems. But at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the view is that the most important thing is that both Russia and America are embarking on a new stage, a stage of mature relationship and mature strategic partnership. The difficulties on the road in these matters are connected, first of all, with all those problems of the world that Russia and America are called upon to solve. By the way, the problems are not only global but (?uncommon), (?for the) developments in the world have entered a new stage. Since we run into new problems and are meeting new challenges, specific differences in approaches do sometimes appear. It is necessary to add that these problems and underestimation in certain issues [as heard], had led to unnecessary waste of time in the establishment of Russian-American partnership. Besides, as two great powers, Russia and America have their specific interests that do not always coincide, and this is natural. The most important thing is that both countries should aim at further development and perfection of their partnership. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, this will become clear and will be elaborated at the impending summit. Taking into consideration the fact that both Russia and America are powers, potentially great in significance and influence in the world, and taking into account how their bilateral relationship develops to a great extent to such a level, (?that) development in the world is accordingly affected. [sentence as heard] Vladislav Chernukha sought the views of the Russian Foreign Ministry about the reported meeting planned for Friday between Russia, America, and Ukraine in Moscow, and the expected signing of a three-sided document. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the most significant thing about the document was the confirmation by Ukraine of its intention to become a nuclear free country, and the elimination of all the strategic nuclear weapons on its territory and its readiness to join the accord on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, this step will strengthen security, not only in Europe, but, more importantly, in the whole world.
