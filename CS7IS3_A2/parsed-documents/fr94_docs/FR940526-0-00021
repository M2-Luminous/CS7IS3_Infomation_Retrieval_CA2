FR940526-0-00021 FR940526-0-00009 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of producers and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. This interim final rule reapportions the Committee representation established for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Committee. This interim rule provides for broader independent handler/small cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in the raisin industry. The change will not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on handlers or producers. This action revises Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information. Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers, 10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member. The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions specified in paragraph (d) of §989.26. Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations currently provides for independent and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: (1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; (2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; and (3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing association handler(s) and all processors. For the purposes of this interim final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category (2) is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler'' group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990&hyph;91 crop year. Also, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four times the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. On the basis of this information, the Committee unanimously recommended on March 9, 1994, that one handler position be moved from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. The current and recommended independent handler/small cooperative handler representation, are shown as follows: ␣ 1Independent handler/small cooperative handler category 1Representation 2Current 2Recommended Largest 4 Handlers 2 2 Next Largest 6 Handlers 2 3 Remaining Handlers 3 2 The shift in membership recognizes the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,'' and ``all other handler groups,'' and will provide an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler'' group will be eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation and other available information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
