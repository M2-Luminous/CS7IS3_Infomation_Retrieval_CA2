It is certain that the round of voting was valid because Zoltan Toth, head of the national election office, said more than half of the electorate had turned out to vote. In the meantime, partial turnout figures for the evening have come in from 12 counties. According to these, the turnout in Baranya is 65 percent; in Bekes 66 percent; in Fejer 67 percent; in Gyoer-Moson-Sopron 73 percent; in Hajdu-Bihar 62 percent; in Heves 70 percent; in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok 66 percent; in Nograd 68 percent; in Komarom-Esztergom 68 percent; in Tolna 63 percent; in Vas 72 percent, and in Veszprem 78 percent. Arpad Toth, expert from the national election office, in reply to a question from Hungarian Radio, said that there had been no reports of irregularities. However, there had been some reports from voters about a breach of the campaign ban. People had phoned in with objections to the fact that pollsters had questioned voters lining up to cast their vote, although those commissioned to make enquiries should have done so only in private. The national election office also heard that a Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] advertisement had appeared in the television supplement of today's issue of the paper MAI NAP, during the period of the campaign ban. The voters had also objected to the fact that Gyoergy Szabad, outgoing speaker of the National Assembly and leading figure of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], had spoken on television, even if in the capacity of a historian.
