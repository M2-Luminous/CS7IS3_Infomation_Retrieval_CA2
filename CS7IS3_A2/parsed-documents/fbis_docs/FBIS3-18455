It lifted the immunity of four deputies--three from the DEP [Democracy Party] and one independent. The immunity of the following deputies has been lifted: DEP leader Hatip Dicle, Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan, Mus Deputy Sirri Sakik, and Sirnak independent Deputy Mahmut Alinak. Following the speedy decision, DEP leader Hatip Dicle and Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan were detained by police at the door to parliament. [passage omitted] Following the detention of the two deputies who had been stripped of their immunity, the police issued an alert preventing all the deputies who are under investigation from going abroad. Restrictions were imposed to prevent the deputies from going abroad. Nusret Demiral, chief public prosecutor of Ankara State Security Court, said that death penalty will be asked for the detained deputies. Nusret Demiral indicated that the case against the deputies, who have had their immunity lifted and been placed under arrest, will be conducted in accordance with Article 125, which deals with treason and crimes against the sovereignty of the state and which entails capital punishment. Demiral also said that all the deputies whose immunity has been lifted will be called to the State Security Court to testify. [passage omitted] DEP deputies will take recourse to the Constitutional Court to challenge parliament's decision to lift their immunity. Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan said that their immunity was lifted on the basis of concocted police reports. Therefore, he said, they will go to the Constitutional Court and ask for the nullification of the decision. Article 85 of the Constitution requires the Constitutional Court to reply within 15 days to the deputies' appeal for the abrogation of the lifting of immunity. What are the charges against the deputies, the files on whom were speedily taken up and processed at parliament after years of procrastination? Here are the charges found in the files on eight deputies: Hatip Dicel, leader of DEP: Dicle, who drew attention on himself when he described the martyred noncommissioned officers in the Tuzla massacre as military targets, is being charged with treason to the country for his various speeches and for engaging in activities aimed at undermining the unity of the state. Orhan Dogan, Sirnak deputy: He is being charged for wanting to place all or part of the state's territory under the suzerainty of a foreign state, due to comments in speeches he made before being elected deputy and during the oath-taking ceremony at the Turkish parliament. Sirri Sakik, deputy from Mus: He is being charged with treason and for activities aimed at undermining the state's unity. Mahmut Alinak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with making speeches aimed at undermining the Turkish Republic's unity. Alinak says that accusations leveled against him arise simply from the fact that he used the term "the Kurdish people." Leyla Zana, deputy from Diyarbakir: She is being charged with advocating the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Anatolia. Zana is known for her anti-Turkey statements made abroad. Selim Sadak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with engaging in separatism resulting from a speech he made at a rally in Izmit on 27 September 1992 and his parliamentary motion on 18 August 1992 on the Sirnak incidents. In his speech in Izmit, he said that the Sirnak incidents were organized by the state and he spoke about the Kurdish People. Ahmet Turk, deputy from Mardin: He is charged with engaging in separatist propaganda due to two speeches and one article he wrote. During his 1993 trip to the Unites States, Turk made statements about a cease-fire declaration in the southeast. During the 23 April parliament session he proposed that Kurdish children too should have holiday celebrations in their own language. Hasan Mezarci, deputy from Istanbul: He is being charged for opposing the laws on crimes against Ataturk. [passage omitted] While you were watching this footage, we received the following last minute report: Mehmet Agir, general director of the Security Directorate, has said that the deputies whose immunity has been lifted will be placed in custody successively. Mehmet Agir replied to Channel 6 reporter Ful Ekasan's questions on the phone.

Indicating that the other deputies who stand to lose their immunity will be placed in custody one after another, Mehmet Agir said that their interrogation will begin as of tomorrow. Agir added that after interrogation, the deputies will be referred to the state security court.
