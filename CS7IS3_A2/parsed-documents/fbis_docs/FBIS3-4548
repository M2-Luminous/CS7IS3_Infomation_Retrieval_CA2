The difficulty of U.S. and European access to Japanese markets does not reflect the "peculiarity" of the Japanese market as widely argued, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs. The trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, for example, is more the result of differences in supply and demand structures in each country than of the allegedly closed nature of the Japanese market, Okamatsu said in a speech at the Japan National Press Club. He also said that trade among European Union (EU) nations should be classified as domestic rather than international trade in view of the integrated nature of their economic relations. The ratio of imported products consumed in the EU, currently at 18.1 percent, would be only 4.9 percent if intrabloc trade was treated as domestic based on this concept, Okamatsu said, noting the figure is close to the 3.4 percent import ratio for Japan. Okamatsu also dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's auto market is closed to U.S.-made automobiles by pointing out that until recently U.S. automakers did not sell a single right-hand drive car in the Japanese market where such cars command a 98 percent share. A lower import share for a particular product does not mean that the country's market for the product is closed, he said, noting the U.S. aircraft industry, with almost no import record, is not branded as exclusive. Any country with product competitiveness in a certain area tends to score a trade surplus in that area, he said, adding that the U.S. has much black ink with Japan in globally competitive service sectors. Okamatsu, the chief negotiator in the recently collapsed Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, said the U.S. demand for Tokyo to set numerical trade targets is based on an erroneous evaluation of Japan's trade situation. Japan adamantly rejects such targets in order to prevent the idea of managed trade from "spilling over into the global trade arena" in defiance of free trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said. Okamatsu said Japan will not repeat "the painful experience" it had following its semiconductor accord with Washington, which he claimed developed into a political issue after Tokyo failed to achieve "nonbinding expectations" of a 20 percent foreign market share in the Japanese chip market. Tokyo will never sign an accord that "has a possibility of leaving trouble in the future," he said. But he added it might be better to map out an import plan on an individual and voluntary basis. Okamatsu said it is "impossible" for the Japanese auto industry to extend its plan to expand purchases of U.S. components in 1995 and beyond, in view of the severity of the industry's slump. The plan worked out by Japanese carmakers during then U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1993 called for an average annual growth of a sharp 20 percent in parts purchases from 1990 to 1994, Okamatsu said.
