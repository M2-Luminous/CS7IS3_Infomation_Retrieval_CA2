The diskettes were found at the headquarters of numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, in a huge old house at 1040 Fonseca Street in Bangu District. Vice Governor Nilo Batista opens the list of politicians who allegedly received financial help from the numbers game kingpins during the 1990 electoral campaign. Also on the list are Jose Vicente, Bocaiuva Cunha (deceased), Jamil Haddad, Simao Sessim, Messias Moraes, Cidinha Campos, Marcio Braga, Sergio Cinelli, Leoncio Vasconcelos, Aguinaldo Timoteo, and Ludmila Mayrink, among others. According to files found in Castor de Andrade's computers, they all received financial help during the 1990 campaign. District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia said: It is well known that the numbers game kingpins have blocs in the city council, in the legislative assembly, and at the Chamber of Deputies. According to Biscaia, bribes from the numbers game kingpins do not follow any political ideology: Leftist, center, and rightist congressmen resorted to these irregular funds to finance their campaigns. Biscaia reported that the list contained the names of politicians from all parties except the Workers Party, PT. As the lists contained in the diskettes are made known, however, new names will be added to the current ones. The files also show that these illegal funds were effectively used to pay for the maintenance of police cars, repair work at the police precincts, and payment for "bonuses" to policemen. According to the documents, police inspectors, PM colonels, and almost all leaders of the Civil Police have received these funds. The names of reporter Nelio Bilat and sports commentator Washington Rodrigues, in addition to the names of the Tupi and Manchete radio stations, are mentioned in the documents. They also reveal the amounts distributed among all the special police precincts, police barracks, and district police precincts. Also recorded on the documents are the payment of extra bonuses, donations to philanthropic institutions and to the Confraria do Garoto, as well as the overall amount collected in numbers game bets and expenses. The dismantling of the illegal game network and the raiding of its headquarters became possible with the November arrest of Castor de Andrade's son-in-law, Fernando Ignacio de Miranda. Miranda was caught red-handed trying to bribe Police Inspector Mario Covas, director of the DGPI [expansion unknown]. In a parallel investigation, and based on charges made by X-9 [expansion unknown], Ivan Custodio de Lima (main witness of the Vigario Geral massacre), the PM agents, and attorneys arrived at the bunker without knowing what to expect. To their surprise they found what they believe to be the much sought after evidence of the involvement of politicians, policemen, and journalists in the numbers racket.
