This refers to the appointment of deputy ministers in the so-called presidential ministries. In Walesa's opinion, nominations should be given out after the reorganization of the ministries. [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] Several days after the president's meeting with the SLD parliamentary floor group, Danuta Waniek became deputy minister of national defense and Zbigniew Sobotka became deputy minister of internal affairs. [Begin recording] [Walesa] First, there was supposed to be the organization, and the people were to come in afterward. First, the structural reorganization plan, as Olechowski proposed, and only then the deputy ministers. As we know, the deputy ministers have already been appointed in both ministries. [SLD Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski] Well, I think, as is often the case, that the president's statement has been distorted. The president certainly did not mean that. [end recording] [Nomejko] In Borowski's opinion, during the now famous meeting, the matter was agreed upon in two areas. The first was the coalition's participation in the presidential ministries, which, according to the SLD deputy chairman, cannot be questioned. The second was the reorganization of the ministries, consisting of somebody coming into one of the top posts in a ministry on his merits, somebody not connected to a political grouping, who would not leave along with the government in power. The minister of foreign affairs has prepared a new statute and sent it to the Council of Ministers for approval. [Begin Borowski recording] In the other two ministries, the ministers have to introduce such drafts because these are the statutes of their ministries, to put it briefly. So, it is hard to speak of a particular role of the SLD here. We support the introduction of such drafts by these ministers, and this should happen as quickly as possible. [end recording] [Nomejko] According to press reports, there is a conflict between the Polish Peasant Party and Foreign Minister Olechowski over the reform of his ministry, which may lead to the head of the Foreign Ministry handing in his resignation. [Begin recording] [Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers] The press, not for the first time and probably not for the last, is not briefed very well on what is happening inside the government, on what the prime minister is doing, and on what I am doing. So we are dealing with yet another press fact. They are concerned to show a lack of cohesion again, another struggle at the top--which does not exist, of course. [Unidentified correspondent, addressing Foreign Minister Olechowski] Is there a danger of your resigning? [Olechowski] Only if you force me to. [end recording] [Nomejko] In a week's time, the government will tackle the comprehensive reform of the central administration along with with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statute. After its likely approval, Marek Siwiec will become deputy foreign minister.
