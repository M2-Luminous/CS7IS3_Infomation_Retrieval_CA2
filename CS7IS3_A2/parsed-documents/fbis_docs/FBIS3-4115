Not long after he gained a master's degree specializing in high- polymer research at the East China Institute of Chemical Technology in 1988, he found a job at a science and technology company, which he had hoped for. "I like what I am doing," said Zhang, now serving as the general manager of the Huachang Polymeter Company, one of China's influential producers of preservative materials. Last year saw his company generate profits totalling six million yuan. Zhang himself was commended as an outstanding scientist-cum- entrepreneur. "The reason I like to go in for business is that it gives me a chance to apply sophisticated science to production and fulfill the mission of a Chinese intellectual," Zhang said. "It was this mission that has made me stay in China and devote myself to the motherland," the general manager noted. He attributed his company's credit to its high-tech products, and pledged to generate profits amounting to 10 million yuan this year. Zhang Baochang is typical of the young scientists who have taken up business in China. According to the latest statistics, there are about 5,000 non- governmental scientific enterprises, just like the Huachang Polymeter Company, on the Chinese mainland. Heads of one third of these enterprises are people under 40 years old. Soon after these enterprises came into existence, they employed a new operational mechanism to display the talents of enterprising young people. One example is Zhang Jianlong, 33, of the Shanghai Stone Computer Company. Zhang started as a salesman with the company in 1987. He was promoted to head of the components workshop half a year later because of his excellent work. He became general manager of the company in 1990. The company's sales income expanded from less than 100 million yuan in 1990 to 150 million yuan last year, developing into one of the largest non-governmental scientific enterprises in Shanghai. Zhang said, "I am grateful to the company for paving the way for me to do something I'd like to do." Many young people share his view. Zheng Baoqi, who has made 25 inventions, is serving as a deputy general manager of the Shanghai Feige (Flying Pigeon) Telecommunications Equipment Service Department under the Shanghai No. 3 Telecommunications Equipment Plant. By granting more autonomy to his employees and applying new managerial measures, he made the scientists of the department more enthusiastic about their work, and have completed 12 development projects, bringing in 270,000 yuan in profits a year. In 1991 Zheng headed his department to set up a joint-venture telecommunications technology company with an American company. Zheng became the deputy general manager in charge of the development of science and technology and management. His company, with a total of 78 employees, obtained a sales income of 30 million yuan last year by developing advanced telecommunications equipment. "Only by applying science to production can we display our talents properly," Zheng noted. The deputy general manager is determined to compete in the international market. A survey shows that the 900,000 science workers in Shanghai make about 2,000 research achievements a year, applying many of them to production. The output value generated by the 5,000 scientific enterprises in the city totalled 20 billion yuan last year, and is expected to top 40 billion yuan this year. Xu Kuangdi, deputy mayor in charge of scientific work, said, "The city is sure to have more such scientists-cum-entrepreneurs as China's social environment further improves."
