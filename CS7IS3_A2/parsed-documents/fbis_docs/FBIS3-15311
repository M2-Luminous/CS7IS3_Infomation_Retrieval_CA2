Until recently, the constitutional process in Belarus has been sluggish. The situation changed drastically when the ruling circles began to realize that the only way out of the existing situation was to introduce a presidential form of rule via the adoption of a new constitution. Up until now, the only obstacle was the disorganization among deputies representing the interests of the nomenklatura. When a total of only 260 parliamentarians convened for the session, the task of gathering the requisite 230 votes seemed difficult. To resolve this problem, it was decided on the initiative of Gennadiy Kozlov, coordinator of the "Belarus" faction, to hold a staggered ballot on disputed aspects of the draft constitution using personal voting slips. In this way, as many deputies as possible would be given an opportunity to express their views over several days. In addition, this type of ballot affords a measure of control over parliamentarians whose loyalty is in doubt. Previously, "unreliable" deputies, finding themselves in the hall of sessions under the watch of colleagues upon whom they often depend for their position, pressed the right buttons as a rule. But as soon as the matter went as far as a secret ballot through the polling booths, between 20 and 30 parliamentarians from the majority would rebel. Now they have been deprived of this possibility: The voting process is controlled entirely. To simplify the task considerably, the deputies are adopting the consitution in whole chapters, each comprising between 10 and 15 articles. Meanwhile, former Supreme Soviet Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich has completed his country vacation. A series of meetings with voters, as well as participation in the consultative conference of patriotic-democratic forces, prompt the conclusion that Shushkevich does not intend to leave politics. In the current situation, he will rely primarily on the bloc of democratic parties which gravitate toward the center. They in turn are keen to cooperate with Shushkevich whom they consider a realistic contender for the post of president at future elections. As members of the Tellers' Commission told IZVESTIYA's correspondent, as of 1000 hours 1 March, 245 deputies had answered "yes" to the questions on the voting slip. And one more thing. An unprecedented incident occured: During his address to the session under the "Any Other Business" section, Stanislav Shushkevich's microphone was cut off after he said: "You only want seats here because your are simply not fit for any other job."
