FBIS4-13139 "drnes074_m_94012" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 JORDAN Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support Papers Reject Israeli `Allegations' of Hamas Support Accusations Stem From `Impotence' JN1604100594 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic 16 Apr 94 pp 1, 18 JN1604100594 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B Arabic BFN [Editorial: "Impotence and Despair Are Behind Israel's Accusations"] [Text] The accusations the Rabin government has leveled at Jordan about alleged activity by Hamas [the Islamic Resistance Movement] on Jordanian territory and about Jordanian-Hamas relations are baseless. These accusations stem from the Rabin government's failure to end the intifadah in the occupied territories and from its frustration and despair about limiting the fedayeen operations carried out by Hamas and other Palestinian organizations. No doubt, Rabin himself is fully aware that the Hamas leadership in the occupied territories is the party that plans the operations and activities against Israeli occupation. The Rabin government also knows that Jordan has no role in, or any link to, the activity of Hamas or other organizations in the occupied territories. Hamas does not consult Jordan or any other party when it, or other Palestinian faction or organization, carries out fedayeen operations against Israeli occupation in order to avenge the massacre committed by the Jewish settlers in cooperation with Israeli occupation troops. Rabin himself certainly knows that Jordan is participating in the peace process and making a great deal of honest and sincere efforts in order to champion a comprehensive and just peace in the region at a time when Hamas opposes both the peace process and the Oslo agreement signed by Israel and the PLO. Jordan warns against a collapse in the peace process due to Israel's intransigence and procrastination. It also warns that the region could face a real disaster if the negotiations fail on all tracks. On the contrary, Hamas and 10 other Palestinian factions reject the Israeli terms on whose basis the Oslo agreement was signed. The accusations by Rabin and Peres that Jordan supports Hamas are either part of the pressure and harassment campaign being pursued against Jordan -- including, for example, the siege of al-'Aqabah -- or a new link in this campaign designed to force Jordan into signing a declaration of principles with Israel before, or even without, addressing the water, border, and refugee issues. The accusations leveled by Rabin and Peres against Jordan and their instigation of the U.S. Administration against Jordan are a new sign of their government's bankruptcy and failure to take a courageous step in order to activate the peace process on the four tracks based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on the land-for-peace principle. The Jordanian media only reported the 'Afula and Hadera operations, carried out by Hamas, just as foreign media did. The Jordanian media also cited foreign sources that reported the Hamas announcement on its responsibility for these operations from loudspeakers in Gaza mosques prior to the statement made by a Hamas information official during his stopover in Jordan. Israel's fabrications about an alleged Jordan-Hamas relationship only seek to conceal Israel's impotence and bankruptcy.
