FR940202-0-00043 FR940202-0-00006 Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows: PART 1_INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 is amended by removing the entry for ``Section 1.1275&hyph;3'' and adding the following citations in numerical order to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣* §§1.483&hyph;1 through 1.483&hyph;3 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 483(f). *␣*␣* §§1.1271&hyph;1 through 1.1274&hyph;5 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1275(d). §1.1274A&hyph;1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1274A(e) and 26 U.S.C. 1275(d). §§1.1275&hyph;1 through 1.1275&hyph;5 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1275(d). *␣*␣* Par. 2. Section 1.163&hyph;7 is added to read as follows: §1.163&hyph;7 Deduction for OID on certain debt instruments. (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an issuer (including a transferee) determines the amount of OID that is deductible each year under section 163(e)(1) by using the constant yield method described in §1.1272&hyph;1(b). This determination, however, is made without regard to section 1272(a)(7) (relating to acquisition premium) and §1.1273&hyph;1(d) (relating to de minimis OID). An issuer is permitted a deduction under section 163(e)(1) only to the extent the issuer is primarily liable on the debt instrument. For certain limitations on the deductibility of OID, see sections 163(e) and 1275(b)(2). (b) Special rules for de minimis OID _(1) Stated interest . If a debt instrument has a de minimis amount of OID (within the meaning of §1.1273&hyph;1(d)), the issuer treats all stated interest on the debt instrument as qualified stated interest. See §§1.446&hyph;2(b) and 1.461&hyph;1 for the treatment of qualified stated interest. (2) Deduction of de minimis OID on other than a constant yield basis. In lieu of deducting de minimis OID under the general rule of paragraph (a) of this section, an issuer of a debt instrument with a de minimis amount of OID (other than a de minimis amount treated as qualified stated interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) may choose to deduct the OID at maturity, on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt instrument, or in proportion to stated interest payments. The issuer makes this choice by reporting the de minimis OID in a manner consistent with the method chosen on the issuer's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the debt instrument is issued. (c) Deduction upon repurchase. Except to the extent disallowed by any other section of the Internal Revenue Code (e.g., section 249) or this paragraph (c), if a debt instrument is repurchased by the issuer for a price in excess of its adjusted issue price (as defined in §1.1275&hyph;1(b)), the excess (repurchase premium) is deductible as interest for the taxable year in which the repurchase occurs. If the issuer repurchases a debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange, the repurchase price is the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument (reduced by any unstated interest within the meaning of section 483). However, if the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument is determined under either section 1273(b)(4) or section 1274, any repurchase premium is not deductible in the year of the repurchase, but is amortized over the term of the newly issued debt instrument in the same manner as if it were OID. (d) Choice of accrual periods to determine whether a debt instrument is an applicable high yield discount obligation (AHYDO). Section 163(e)(5) affects an issuer's OID deductions for certain high yield debt instruments that have significant OID. For purposes of section 163(i)(2), which defines significant OID, the issuer's choice of accrual periods to determine OID accruals is used to determine whether a debt instrument has significant OID. See §1.1275&hyph;2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders. (e) Effective date. This section applies to debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994. §1.163&hyph;11T [Removed] Par. 3. Section 1.163&hyph;11T is removed as of February 2, 1994. Par. 4. Section 1.446&hyph;2 is added to read as follows: §1.446&hyph;2 Method of accounting for interest. (a) Applicability _(1) In general. This section provides rules for determining the amount of interest that accrues during an accrual period (other than interest described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) and for determining the portion of a payment that consists of accrued interest. For purposes of this section, interest includes original issue discount and amounts treated as interest (whether stated or unstated) in any lending or deferred payment transaction. Accrued interest determined under this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). Application of an exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to one party to a transaction does not affect the application of this section to any other party to the transaction.
