The armed movement's leadership remains divided and fragmented, and the two underground wings that took over the reins of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] following its dissolution--Djaz'ara and Salafist--seem to be clashing over the question of leadership. Meanwhile, no "moderate" official of the dissolved Islamic party has come out in favor of negotiations or participation in discussions with the Committee on National Dialogue. The communique from Said Makhloufi, the former "military official" in Abdelkader Chebouti's Armed Islamic Movement [MIA], has the merit of clarity: no dialogue and "armed struggle" until the arrival of an "Islamic republic." That communique, according to its author, comes in response to a meeting by the Djaz'ara (Algerianists close to A. Hachani) that reportedly was held in Batna at the behest of Abderrezak Redjam, former "boss" of the FIS intelligence department. A. Redjam is also one of the decision makers in the "emergency unit," an FIS body established following the arrest of Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj in June 1991. That was the unit in charge of clandestine tracts and propaganda for the dissolved FIS. Redjam, from Batna, had allegedly issued something called a declaration "of union" (Bayane el Wihda) reporting that the various secret FIS groups (Salafists, the Djaz'ara, and the Muslim Brotherhood) were uniting. Makhloufi claims that that union will split up and that only the "Salafist path" will remain. Oddly, Makhloufi's remarks remind one of early publications by Abdelhak Layada's Armed Islamic Group (GIA), in which the emphasis was on the Salafist wing in the various armed groups that had united under the "single command" of "emir Abou Adlane" following a meeting held at the start of 1993. S. Makhloufi is therefore claiming to be one of the Salafists--the radicals in the Islamic movement--and he points out that an agreement was reached stipulating that the prime condition for dialogue would be a return to the electoral process. Until recently, however, that was the condition being insisted on by the Djaz'ara's emergency unit and repeated in every communique from Mohamed Said, one of that wing's leaders. No change in position has been published so far. The disagreements between Makhloufi and the Djaz'ara seem to be the same as those that divided Chebouti and the "emirs" of the armed groups. The latter denied his right to be the supreme leader because he did not take part in the "operations." Makhloufi opposes the "politicians" for the same reasons, just as he criticizes them for having attempted to negotiate with the authorities through M. Merbah and Shaykh Benazzouz Zebda. But there is also one fact that he insistently draws attention to: Redjam and Said Guechi halted his participation and that of Kamreddine Kherbane in meetings by the Majlis Echoura following the events of June 1991 because of their preparations for "jihad" [holy war]. That was when Makhloufi was publishing his "pamphlet on civil disobedience" and going so far as to say, in an interview with the newspaper EL KHABAR, that "the time for jihad has arrived." Makhloufi is therefore excluding the politicians from the decisionmaking center and, at the same time, denying the existence of splits among the armed groups, a report that he labels brainwashing and manipulation. Salafists and GIA Since the deaths of Omar El-Eulmi and his brother Abdennacer, the two "muftis" of Layada's GIA who were killed five months apart, and the arrest of Yekhlef Cherrati, the MIA's ideologist and author of the first fatwa [Islamic legal ruling] authorizing FIS members to commit murder "as part of" the jihad, there has been little information about the new mufti or muftis of the terrorist groups. In "traditional" organization charts such as the GIA's, an "Islamic legislative committee" headed by a "learned man" was in charge of issuing various fatwas regarding the activity of the groups. That was the theory. In fact, a person with some knowledge of theology and possessing an audience among the underground members would be in charge of "urgent" fatwas as well as everyday writings. In the case of Makhloufi's communique, which well-informed observers say is genuine, one finds elements apparently inspired by ECHAHADA, the GIA's underground bulletin, excerpts from which were published by EL-WATAN EL ARABI at the beginning of the year and whose source remains unknown. There are similarities in the division into "zones," the organization of the movement, and the establishment of internal rules and of "legislation" governing the violent units. Ten months ago, ECHAHADA published a set of "bylaws" for the GIA in 65 articles, an "exclusive interview" with Layada, and "carefully worked out" documents setting forth the organization of a national movement. While Layada admitted being the GIA's emir, he denied being the author. It would seem that Makhloufi, who belongs to the same wing, is drawing his inspiration from those documents. The outline of such a Salafist-type organization could already be found in the "hard core" of the "Allal" group, where there existed, under the "orders" of the emir, a coordinator (Layada), a restricted majlis echoura (Belbachir, Bouferaa, Bentebbiche, and Zermane, who is now in prison and the only survivor out of the four), and an official in charge of religious indoctrination (Zeraoui Hammadache, who has been arrested). That organization was inspired mainly by religious texts, but also by the various experiences of the violent groups, examples being the group headed by Mustapha Bouyali--the "emir" of El-Achour--who demanded of his movement's members the "baya'a," or oath of allegiance, and who, taking his inspiration from religion, had formed one of the first "majlis echoura" in the Islamic wing in 1982. [passage omitted] Links A GIA document distributed at the beginning of the year mentioned a special "recommendation": set up "joint" armed operations and establish links between different groups. It was that same document, issued by the "western front," which first mentioned plans to "strike at foreign investments and then at their representatives." The Armed Islamic Movement is fragmented, and despite the "efforts" of political leaders or heads of terrorist groups such as Layada and Chebouti, both now gone from the scene, plans for a structured nationwide organization have failed. But there are small illegal groups that join together for specific operations, and terrorists with police records--and who are therefore wanted by police--pass from one group to another and frequently move from one region to another. Ties and contacts exist between former members of the dissolved FIS who have gone underground, and it is all those networks that now make up the terrorist web that is so difficult to evaluate. The GIA and MIA are only acronyms--the entire movement forms an obscure and constantly changing whole with no definite lines of organization but with networks that link up with each other from time to time. It is possible to begin with one individual and trace one's way back to various tiny groups and movements. For example, police arrested a man named Damerdji Kamel last 12 March for aiding a terrorist group. He has just been sentenced to six years in prison. Damerdji was collecting money at the request of his brother-in-law, who is none other than Moussa Kraouche, the spokesman for the Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF). The sums of money collected in that way were to be turned over to a certain Sayeh Attia in Medea. In exchange, Kraouche provided Damerdji with a checking account in France. Sayeh Attia, alias "Khan," alias "Younes," has been a wanted man for several months. He is considered a "very dangerous member" of the armed movement. A native of Ouled Hellal and 37 years old, he is one of the perpetrators still being sought in connection with the attack on the barracks in Boughezoul that resulted in 18 dead at the start of the year. Several soldiers had their throats cut, and the group had accomplices inside the barracks. According to investigators in the security services, Attia is the son of a harki [Algerian soldier who fought for the French against Algerian revolutionaries] and a former member of the FIS. One of the group's leaders who is still a fugitive is "Djaafar El-Afghani," whose real name is Si-Ahmed Mourad. A "repentant" former musician, he is a native of Tablat. Today he is considered one of the most formidable terrorists--like Allal, known as "Moh Leveilley," with whom he reportedly was in contact in their neighborhood in Hussein-Dey. Si-Ahmed Mourad, who was involved in the attack on the airport with members of the MIA, has an exploit to his credit that tells it all. At the age of 29 years, while operating in the Algiers region, he was among the perpetrators of the attack on the former minister of defense. According to confessions by former members of his group, he made detailed plans for kidnapping the three French consular agents that he wanted to exchange for Layada, and while living in Algiers, he went to Boughezoul for a "big operation." He is the sort of hard-core individual for whom violence has no limits: one of the Salafists who do not hesitate to slit throats for the "cause." With them there can be no dialogue, and everyone, even the Djaz'ara, has realized that.
