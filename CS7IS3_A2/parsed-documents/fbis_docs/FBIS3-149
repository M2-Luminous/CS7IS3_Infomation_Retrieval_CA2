Some progress has been reached in the discussions of specific principles and modalities on national reconciliation. Some sources said today that agreement had been reached in more than half of the issues on specific principles and modalities. The sources said agreements had been reached on issues, such as administrative centralization and the participation of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration. What now remains is the definition of the percentage of UNITA's participation in the central and provincial governments and the news media. Other issues still to be discussed are connected with the Constitution of the Republic, the granting of a special status to Jonas Savimbi, and the recovery of UNITA's property. Meanwhile, another reliable source in the peace talks neither confirmed nor denied this information. He said, however, that an agreement on specific principles and modalities could be reached this week. If this agreement is reached, the parties will once and for all resolve the national reconciliation issue. Once this is done, the peace talks will have practically been concluded, since the next issue will be the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission, which is already at an advanced stage. A special envoy of Bill Clinton arrives in Lusaka tomorrow to work for some days with Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, to prepare U.S. participation in economic and humanitarian assistance to Angola after the coming into force of the cease-fire.
