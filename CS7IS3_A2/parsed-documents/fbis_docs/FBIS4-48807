The Political Bureau [words indistinct] recommendations on the strengthening of the Central Committee's role among militants and sympathizers. The session also discussed Angolan security and made specific recommendations to the government delegation taking part in the Lusaka talks. MPLA spokesman Norberto dos Santos has the details: [Begin recording] [dos Santos] The Central Committee recommended the Political Bureau to assess the activities of the party in all echelons and to take the necessary steps to strengthen party activities within the Political Bureau, the Secretariat, intermediate structures, and grass roots organizations. So, it is necessary to revamp party activities involving militants, and to increase the flow of information on the political and socioeconomic situation. [Unidentified Correspondent] We have learned that the MPLA Political Bureau has new members. Would you like to name them? [Dos Santos] Of the 12 nominees, comrades Venancio de Moura and Anastacio (da Voca), the first secretary for Huambo Province, have been admitted as permanent members. Comrades Joao (Chipingue), the first secretary for Huila Province; Moxico Province Governor Joao Ernesto dos Santos Liberdade; Benguela Province Governor Paulo Teixeira Jorge; and Carlos Ferreira Pinto, a former first secretary for Moxico Province, have been elected as candidate members. Comrade Carlos Ferreira Pinto has also been elected coordinator of the Discipline and Audit Committee. The Political Bureau now has 21 members, of which 17 are permanent and four are candidate members. [Correspondent] Angolans are very worried about the Lusaka peace talks. They are also concerned over the Cabinda issue. Would you like to confirm whether a peace accord will be signed on 6 June? [Dos Santos] The Central Committee session did not discuss dates. No date has been set. The Central Committee has only recommended the government negotiating team to do its best to achieve peace. What the Central Committee discussed was the manner in which we will implement the peace accord. The principal issue is the organization of domestic structures so that the implementation of the peace process does not face the same risks the Bicesse Accord experienced. [Correspondent] Does that apply to Cabinda? [Dos Santos] The session heard a report on the situation in Cabinda. As you known, no direct talks have been held. So far only exploratory meetings have taken place. There are several Cabinda factions with whom a government team has held exploratory talks. That is in addition to the meeting held in Paris. The Central Committee recommended the Political Bureau take charge of this issue because one feels that the progress on Cabinda is slow. [end recording]
