FR940912-1-00004 FR940912-1-00002 2. Multiple Stroke Flash: (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of 50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms. An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system under evaluation. 3. Multiple Burst: (Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise, short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset to some digital processing systems. The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order to be used. This ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds. The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum period between bursts in 30ms, and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined below. The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H). These components are defined by the following double exponential equation: i(t)=I o (e -at ^e -bt ) where: t=time in seconds, i=current in amperes, and ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1Severe strike (component A) 1Restrike (component D) 1Multiple stroke (1/2component D) 1Multiple burst (component H) I o, amp = 218,810 109,405 54,703 10,572 a, sec -1 = 11,354 22,708 22,708 187,191 b, sec -1 = 647,265 1,294,530 1,294,530 19,105,100 This equation produces the following characteristics: i peak = 200 KA 100 KA 50 KA 10 KA and, (di/dt) max (amp/sec) = 1.4×10 11 1.4×10 11 0.7×10 11 2.0×10 11 ␣ = @t=0+sec @t=0+sec @t=0+sec @t=0+sec di/dt, (amp/sec) = 1.0×10 11 1.0×10 11 0.5×10 11 ␣ ␣ = @t=.5μs @t=.25μs @t=.25μs ␣ Action Integral (amp 2 sec) = 2.0×10 6 0.25×10 6 0.0625×10 6 ␣
