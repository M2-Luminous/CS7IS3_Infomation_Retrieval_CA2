I remember our first maneuver in 1962, directed by the head of the Army, Commander Guillermo [not further identified]. I mention this as a comparison to our Western Army's preparedness then and now. I should mention that this took place in 1962, and the Army was founded on 14 June of that same year. The maneuvers began and we were assigned to carry out offensive maneuvers. I was the head of Division 1270, and Military Unit 2424 was subordinate to our unit, which was headed by then Captain Mario [not further identified], regarding all equipment, and we were unable to communicate with any of the subordinate units. [chuckles] [Rodriguez] So, there has been a total change. [Rodiles] Yes, a very significant change. That is where we realized we were lacking a lot of military preparation. We went through other things as well. I mention this example because an immense majority of those soldiers filled officer ranks in the new Army. But as time passed, the Army began to grow in knowledge and experience. I also wanted to point out that after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, our academies and military schools began offering the advanced military courses that were offered in the USSR, with the same efficiency as in the former USSR. Today, we have more than 114,500 combatants and internationalists in our western territory. That figure includes combatants, from the production and defense brigades to our main units, as well as reserves. In that, we can see the great combat experience that our Army has acquired. All the officers and specialists, after graduating from military schools, went on to the General Staff and the troops, and once again received the practical knowledge of how to lead the troops in a modern battle. That is how we continued strengthening ouselves in theoretical principles, as well as in the practical knowledge of leading the troops. Beginning in the 1980's, the doctrine of the people's war began to be taught. Our main leader, the commander in chief, and the minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], realized that it was necessary to develop this type of defense in all its aspects since the defense of our socialist fatherland would eventually depend on our, the FAR's, and the Cuban people's effort and knowledge. That is how, in the eighties, the concept of the people's war was established and taught. I do not exaggerate when I say that since then, we have trained tens of thousands of cadres and militants in the Territorial Troops Militia [MTT]. This is in addition to the preparation given our recruits and officers, who have gone through our command to create the real conditions to carry out that sacred mission assigned 33 years ago. In this concept of the people's war, we have linked ourselves more and more to the production and defense brigades, the defense zones, the municipalities, the MTT's. In a nutshell, the concept of the people's war is of the working and revolutionary people. Together with the increase in volume of the equipment and quality of the armaments, we have carried out and continue to carry out serious work in the preparation of the military operations theater. We have the experience of the war in Iraq. At this moment, our armaments and equipment are ready to counterattack an enemy attack. It has the necessary vitality and conditions to carry out the mission successfully. Taking all this into account and faced with the question of what our Western Army represents today, I would say it defends the largest territory of our country. It includes the capital of our Republic, where the leadership of the party and the Army, the revolutionary government, and a large part of the important industries in our country and objectives of such importance are located. The armaments that our Army has are significant in power and capacity. If this is an important objective, since the country's leadership is located here, we believe this is of strategic importance. And for its defense -- I am not revealing any secrets by saying this -- we have troops who can guarantee the success of that mission and form part of the country's strategic goals. We understand the high responsibility that the Western Army has because of its sacred and historic mission. I wanted to conclude by pointing out that on one occasion, the commander in chief stated that we would defend that sky, this flag, and this land regardless of the cost. To our commander in chief, we say the Western Army, beginning with its head, will defend the capital of the nation regardless of the cost and conditions. It will never surrender to an enemy aggression. We are sure of this. [Rodriguez] General, I know there is competition -- I have called it beautiful competition -- among the three armies. Well, there is also the Youth Labor Army [EJT], but they do not have the same characteristics. They are the fourth Army. But the Western, Central, and Eastern Armies are competing to be the best and most outstanding command. I would like for you to address this. [Rodiles] Hector, a pure, healthy, beautiful competition exists among comrades. This competition is fraternal and fruitful. We have no doubt that the FAR will be who ends up winning because the results will be greater preparation, capacity, and combat readiness to defend the fatherland, the Revolution, and the achievements of socialism. Nevertheless, the Western Army has the conditions of being named the first command. In other words, it is in condition to be given the honor of best command of the FAR. [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the Eastern Army. [Rodiles] Today, our dear brother Espinosa of the Eastern Army has it. Last year, the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] held its inspection. We were also part of that inspection. It was a rigorous inspection. We obtained the high grade of good. That inspection demonstrated the morale and enthusiasm of all our comrades as well as the party and government leaders of the provinces and municipalities, the defense zones, and the production and defense brigades. This inspection covered the military aspects, as well as the aspect of the defense directed by the party and the government etc., and we were graded as good. That result was demonstrated. The inspection also demonstrated the ties, cooperation, and harmony that exists between the people's defense forces and the Western Army. Once again, it demonstrated the great affinity that exists between the Minfar and the military commands that were being inspected. The increase in the military operations theater is significant. I have already mentioned that it guarantees the vitality of the forces and equipment that will carry out such important missions. The political morale and discipline are high. Without discipline, there is nothing, as the minister of the FAR has said. We have reached first place in the conservation of armaments and equipment -- and a colonel who has already been here can attest to this. The agricultural-livestock sector is also very important. Raul challenged us to increase production by 30 percent. In some areas, it is much more than 30 percent: tubers, grains, and fish breeding. In self-sufficiency, our military heads have the basic economic training to establish an inventory of goods produced. Because of all this, we believe we will reach first place. [Rodriguez] You are still in the fight. [Rodiles] Yes, we are still in the fight. [words indistinct] victorious and invincible in Havana at 33 years of age. Today, our Army is 33 years old. At that age, we will dedicate the achievement of obtaining first place in this fraternal competition to our commander in chief. [Rodriguez] I know there is a strong competition and it is a competition in which the FAR will be the winner. The FAR will perfect itself during this competition. I know that the best command is the Eastern Army, but this year you hope to obtain that distinction. There is one topic, to conclude, that has been stressed. The minister has emphasized this. We are talking about the attention to the soldiers and officers. I would like you to discuss this briefly. [Rodiles] This is one of our main areas of work, which has been stressed by the commander in chief, as well as by the minister of the FAR. Despite the critical and difficult conditions that we are all aware of, brought about by this special period in peacetime, we have not wavered in our attention to the workers in general. We continue working to perfect living and working conditions for all categories of personnel in the Western Army. In some units, we are even working intensively to complete housing before 26 July to improve those conditions. In the recreational, cultural, and tourist areas, we are improving centers for the relaxation of our troops and officers in general. This year, several thousands of comrades, officers, and their families enjoy this attention to the worker. Beginning this year, we are going to at least duplicate the conditions and possibilities so our personnel can enjoy those vacations and recreational and cultural activities. To conclude, I want to say that we have an ambitious plan to build low-cost housing to improve the living conditions of our officers and their families, a large number of whom are living at the military unit due to the shortage in housing that we all know about. The officers, their relatives, and friends work in the construction of the houses. In other words, it is a family effort which will make them appreciate the houses even more. [Rodriguez] Brig. Gen. Samuel Rodiles, thank you for your participation on this program.
