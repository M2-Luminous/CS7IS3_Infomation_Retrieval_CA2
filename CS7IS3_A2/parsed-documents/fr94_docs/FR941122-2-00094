FR941122-2-00094 FR941122-2-00073 [Docket No. 50&hyph;237] Commonwealth Edison Co. (Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2) Exemption I Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;19, which authorizes operation of the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2 (the facility), at a steady-state power level not in excess of 2527 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Grundy County, Illinois. This license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. II By letter dated October 28, 1994, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), ComEd requested a schedular exemption for Dresden, Unit 2, from the 18-month test interval for a Type A Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT) as required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.A.6.(b). The exemption is requested to avoid a potential reactor shut down to perform the Type A test. Due to two forced outages, ComEd has had to reschedule the Dresden, Unit 2, refueling outage from September 1994 to July 1995. Subsequently, ComEd requested a maximum extension of up to an additional 242 days for the 18-month Appendix J test interval for a Type A test. The Type A test can not be performed during power operation. III In its letter dated October 28, 1994, ComEd requested a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirement of Appendix J. ComEd has provided leakage test results and maintenance information for the past two outage testing programs. The two consecutive Type A ILRT failures that placed Dresden, Unit 2, on the accelerated test schedule were because of the addition of the Type B and C test leakage results to the Type A leakage rate_not problems with the Type A boundaries. The minimum pathway data from the last two Unit 2 refueling outages (D2R12 and D2R13) indicate that, on a minimum pathway basis, the quality of primary containment does not degrade excessively through the course of the fuel cycle. The total containment leakage rate minus the Type B and C leakages for the last two Type A test failures during D2R12 and D2R13 are 285.5 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) and 302.62 scfh, respectively. These values are 47 percent and 50 percent of the Type A ILRT acceptance criteria of 610.56 scfh (0.75L a ). The acceptance criteria are from the Dresden, Unit 2, Technical Specification (TS) Section 3.7.A.2.b.(1). During the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A ILRT failed due to a leak of the inboard flange of the reactor building to suppression chamber vacuum breaker valve (2&hyph;1601&hyph;20A). This leakage was quantified to be 12720.05 scfh. If this did not occur, the Type A ILRT results would have been 543.40 scfh, which is less than the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L a ). During the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A test failed due to the as-found minimum pathway leakage of primary containment isolation valves found during Type B and C testing. The volumes that were the major contributors to this failure are as follows: The ``B'' feedwater line isolation check valves (2&hyph;220&hyph;58B and 2&hyph;220&hyph;62B), shutdown cooling isolation valves (2&hyph;1001&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;1B, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2B and 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2C), reactor water clean-up isolation valves (2&hyph;1201, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;3, 2&hyph;1299&hyph;004 and 2&hyph;1299&hyph;005), low pressure coolant injection containment spray isolation valves (2&hyph;1501&hyph;27B and 2&hyph;1501&hyph;28B), high pressure coolant injection drain pot to suppression chamber valves (2&hyph;2301&hyph;34 and 2&hyph;2301&hyph;71), traversing incore probe purge check valve (2&hyph;4799&hyph;514), electrical penetration X&hyph;202W, and drywell bellow X&hyph;113. The total minimum pathway leakage for these volumes was 685.75 scfh. Each of the above valves and volumes were repaired during the refueling outage and subsequently passed post-maintenance Type B and C tests prior to restart of Unit 2 for the current operating cycle. At the time the pertinent requirements of Appendix J were established (1973), the typical nuclear power plant fuel cycle lasted 12 months. Section III.A.6.(b) may have been written to require a Type A test at every refueling outage_specifying a numerical cap on the interval to prevent extreme cases of very long intervals (caused by extended shutdowns or operations at reduced power) between tests. An 18-month cap was reasonable for 12-month fuel cycles, but with the current 18- and 24-month fuel cycles, it clearly is not sufficient. The intent of Section III.A.6.(b) is to increase the testing frequency for a containment that exhibits leakage problems, but not to increase it so much that special shutdowns are required. Refueling outages are the only reasonable time to perform Type A test, since most plants do not have extended shutdowns at any other time. In order to add an additional margin of safety and to account for the possible increase in the leakage of a containment penetration, the licensee has imposed an administrative limit for Dresden, Unit 2, on the total maximum allowable containment leakage rate until the completion of the current operating cycle. This limit will be 519.0 scfh, which is 85 percent of the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L a ). All additional minimum pathway leakage will be added to the current total as operational Type B and C leak rate tests are performed during the current operating cycle. These corrective measures taken should reduce the chances of D2R14 failing the ``As Found'' Type A ILRT test.
