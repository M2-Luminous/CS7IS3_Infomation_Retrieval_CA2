FR940819-0-00036 FR940819-0-00016 Discussion of Comments and Final Rule This rulemaking action encompasses a variety of changes to the FAA's antidrug regulation, most of which affect the operational provisions of the antidrug rule found in 14 CFR part 121, appendix I. Because a variety of changes, both substantive and minor technical revisions, were made to appendix I, the entire revised appendix has been republished in this final rule. Each of the significant changes and any related comments are discussed in detail below. Random Testing This final rule does not change the random drug testing requirements. The FAA notes, however, that a separate NPRM was jointly issued by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation and all DOT agencies with antidrug rules on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7614). This NPRM proposed parallel changes to each agency's rule under which the random drug testing rate would be established based on the rate of random positive drug tests in the particular industry. Because of the common aspects of the random testing issues, the FAA will make any such changes as part of a joint final rule to be issued in the near future. Amendments Required by the Act Prohibition on Service; Rehabilitation and Evaluation The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act section entitled ``Prohibition on service'' (found at new FAAct section 614(b)) provides that no person who is determined to have engaged in illegal use of drugs may perform a safety-sensitive function after such determination. In accordance with this section, the FAA proposed that sections of the FAA's regulations that address the use of prohibited drugs (see, e.g ., 14 CFR 65.46(c), (d)) would be revised slightly to reflect the fact that entities other than certificate holders ( i.e ., contractor companies) can require drug tests under the antidrug rule if they have an FAA-approved antidrug program. The changes were supported by commenters and are included in the final rule. Section 614(b)(2) of the FAAct, ``Effect of Rehabilitation,'' states that no covered employee may perform a safety-sensitive function after engaging in prohibited conduct unless he or she has completed a rehabilitation program under the provisions of section 614(c) of the FAAct. Section 614(c)(1) requires the Administrator to prescribe regulations that at a minimum provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of employees in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of controlled substances. Further, the section states that the Administrator shall determine the circumstances under which such employees shall be required to participate in such a program. This language recognizes that rehabilitation may not be appropriate or warranted in all cases of prohibited conduct. The legislative requirement of section 614(b)(2) is implemented in the revisions to paragraph A, section VII, of appendix I. The legislative history of the Act reflected the fact that the FAA did not prescribe regulations with respect to specific types of rehabilitation in its antidrug rule. However, because the Act requires the FAA to prescribe regulations under which persons in need of assistance would be identified, this final rule modifies the Medical Review Officer (MRO) duties to include such identification. Some commenters noted that a MRO may not be qualified as a substance abuse professional (SAP) and should therefore be required to refer the individual to a qualified SAP for the evaluation. It was the FAA's intent that only MROs who also meet the qualifications of a SAP (as contained in the definition of a SAP) would be authorized to perform the initial evaluation of individuals who have a verified positive drug test result or refuse to submit to a required test. The final rule has been changed to clarify this requirement. It also incorporates a provision parallel to one in the alcohol misuse prevention program final rule that limits the providers or facilities to which SAPs who perform an initial evaluation may refer an employee determined to be in need of assistance. This limitation also applies to MROs who serve as SAPs. The NPRM proposed, and this final rule provides, that each covered employee who had a verified positive drug test result or who refused to submit to testing would be advised of all relevant resources available to the employee. Further, each such employee would be evaluated by a SAP (who could be the MRO) who would determine whether and what assistance the employee needed in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use. Some commenters representing labor organizations stated that the FAA should include requirements that employers must provide or pay for any required treatment and that employees should be prohibited from terminating employees who are undergoing treatment. The FAA reaffirms its position that these issues are most appropriately matters for employer/employee negotiation. New section 614(b)(3) of the FAAct, ``Performance of prior duties prohibited,'' provides sanctions for employees who engage in prohibited use of drugs. It provides that, under certain circumstances discussed below, an individual shall not be permitted to perform the duties related to air transportation that he or she performed prior to the date he or she engaged in the prohibited drug use. The legislation does not require that the individual's employment be terminated, nor that he or she be reassigned to perform non-safety-sensitive functions. However, it is an absolute bar to the performance of the same duties the employee performed before the violation.
