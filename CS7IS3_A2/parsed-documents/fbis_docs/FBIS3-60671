In an interview with independent English Newspaper, THE TELEGRAPH published in its Monday's issue captioned "Pak option for N-plan due to Indian threat."[sentence as published] The Foreign Minister said, "We believe in principle that the nuclear buildup is bad for the people. We have the capacity to do so but we have given assurances that we will not do so and we are simply keeping option for nuclear buildup open for security reasons." The question of nuclear non-proliferation and the security of the states concerned must be addressed from regional point of view while India must re-think about its role in this region, Mr Ali said. Replaying to a question about the US perception of nuclear proliferation by Pakistan, he said it would be difficult for Pakistan to sign nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) under the given situation when India was doing everything for proliferation. The Foreign Minister said that Pressler's proposal for conditionalising the signing of NPT with aid had pushed Pakistan to a stake while India was still acquiring nuclear technology and introducing new weapons like nuclear carriers and submarines. "They are the naughty boys and nuclear delinquents", he added. Asked about the present stand of the Pakistan Prime Minister not to roll back the nuclear plan in the wake of pressure from the West, Mr Ali said, "There were also suggestions from friends of Pakistan that it should not dismantle its nuclear programme." When asked if (India) is not in a position to go to war what is the necessity on the part of Pakistan to maintain nuclear plant, the Foreign Minister said, "this is just because we can't let our defence programme shelved. We had been victim of aggression before and just for that matter we can't play with our own security." The Pakistan foreign Minister referred to the Indian plea of developing nuclear weapons to counter China and said in the present context China is not at all threat to India or any other country. Asked if Pakistan was in a position to counter India which has more than half a million soldiers Mr Ali said there was no provocation from Pakistan side rather India was mobilising soldiers to contain its internal insurgency which was going on in different parts of India. He said India has got lot of problems and added even a massive troops mobilisation in Kashmir failed to restrain the Kashmiri people. "Just by using force you can't contain them." Asked Pakistan would go for any defence pact with Bangladesh particularly when the 25-year treaty between Bangladesh and India expires by 1996. [sentence as published] He said. "Let time come. We have the highest sympathetic sentiments for the people of Bangladesh and what Bangladesh expects from us will be given due attention. "We have cooperation at all levels, he said.
