Menem referred to the subject when he was asked about the possibility that this might be one of the objectives of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in case he is elected OAS secretary general because of the role he has played during the past year with regard to the Cuban Government making democratic changes. "It might be," said the Argentine president who is known for his hard stand with regard to the Fidel Castro regime. Nonetheless, he added that Cuba's reentry can only take place when democracy prevails on the island. The visitor added that "no one likes to see a country excluded," but he insisted that Castro has been in power for 35 years and it is necessary to make some changes now, as has happened in other nations of the area that had long periods of dictatorships. The Argentine president arrived on Friday in Cartagena de Indias and tomorrow will begin a two-day official visit in Santa Fe de Bogota. He also said that Gaviria has the capacity to be OAS secretary general, but he commented that his victory depends on how much support the other candidate, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, has for the post. Menem added that his Colombian counterpart has the virtues for becoming a good secretary general of the multilateral organization because "he is a qualified, good, and resourceful man and he has carried out a very good administration in Colombia." Meanwhile, in statements published today in the daily EL TIEMPO, Menem defended his economic model and said that due to the results, people are starting to talk about the "Argentine miracle." Menem explained that the model is based on a people's market economy that is accompanied by a strong policy of social solidarity. "We are absolutely convinced that this model is the only one that allows us to take up once again the path of growth and higher standards of living for the entire population," he said. As the main achievements of his government, Menem pointed out the elimination of inflation, monetary stability, elimination of the budget deficit, the privatization of several enterprises, renegotiation of the foreign debt, and a drastic reduction of tax evasion. While in Cartagena de Indias, the Argentine president has been visiting tourist spots and playing tennis and golf with Gaviria, with whom he will travel tomorrow to Santa Fe de Bogota to begin an official visit. It was learned that Menem and Gaviria will sign important agreements, one on judicial cooperation matters in the struggle against narcotics trafficking and terrorism and another one that regulates animal sanitation measures in order to increase trade in agriculture and livestock. Menem is scheduled to arrive in Santa Fe de Bogota at 1100 at a military airport where he will be received by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. In the afternoon the two presidents will meet at the House of Narino (government palace). Later on, Menem will speak with leaders of Congress and leaders of the Argentine community residing in Colombia, while on Tuesday he will have breakfast with Colombian businessmen, unveil a monument in memory of Eva Peron, and sign agreements with Gaviria.
