FR941220-2-00037 FR941220-2-00026 [Docket No. 50&hyph;029] Yankee Atomic Electric Company; Yankee Nuclear Power Station; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an order authorizing the decommissioning of the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant), that is licensed to the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or the licensee) located in Franklin County, Massachusetts. Description of Proposed Action YNPS has been shut down since October 1, 1991, and was defueled during February 1992. Finding of No Significant Impact The staff has reviewed the proposed decommissioning against the requirements in 10 CFR Part 51. Upon conducting an Environmental Assessment, the staff concluded that no significant environmental impacts are associated with the proposed SAFSTOR and DECON decommissioning and that the proposed decommissioning will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.13, not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed decommissioning of the YNPS. The following documents contain further details on this action: (1) The application from the licensee of December 20, 1993, as supplemented August 5, August 22, October 24, and October 26, 1994; (2) the Commission's related Safety Evaluation; and (3) the Commission's Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Seymour H. Weiss, Director, Non-Power Reactors and Decommissioning Project Directorate, Division of Project Support, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
