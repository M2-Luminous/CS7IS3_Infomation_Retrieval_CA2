Each percentage value indicates the share of the preceding population group (for facilities using 272 PAIs) that is estimated to fall in that row's named population category. For example, of the 2,404 PFPR facilities using 272 PAIs, 1,794 or 74.6 percent are estimated to use water. 2Within the 1,475 facilities estimated to use only the non-272 PAIs, the estimated number of facilities falling in each population group (e.g., water-users or facilities incurring impacts) is based on applying the relevant percentage from the analysis of PFPR facilities using the 272 PAIs. For example, of the 1,475 facilities using only non-272 PAIs, 74.6 percent or 1,101 facilities are estimated to use water. 3The estimates of average facility and total annual compliance cost for non-272 PAI facilities are based on the estimated average facility costs for facilities using only the original 272 PAIs. That is, the average facility annual compliance costs of $32,871 and $429,065, which were calculated from analysis of only the original 272 PAIs, are assumed to apply also for the non-272 PAI facilities. The aggregate annual compliance cost values for facilities using only non-272 PAIs were then calculated by multiplying the average costs per facility by the estimated number of facilities in the relevant non-272 PAI facility category (e.g., 311 PFPR-only facilities x $32,871/per facility = $10.2 million total annual cost for PFPR-only facilities using only non-272 PAIs). 3. Aggregate Impacts for All Facilities Using Both Original 272 and Additional PAIs The aggregate costs and impacts of Option 3/S.1 are the combined impacts upon facilities using both the original 272 PAIs and additional PAIs and facilities using only the additional PAIs. These costs and impacts are reported in Table 20. There are 869 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 3/S.1. The annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 3/S.1 are estimated to be $56.1 million. Two Subcategory C facilities are expected to close due to the compliance requirement imposed by Option 3/S.1. Two hundred fifty facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total job losses in impacted facilities are projected, in the worst case, to be 688 as a result of the proposed Option 3/S.1 regulation. Accordingly, the Agency finds that the overall impacts of this proposed rule on all pesticide formulator, packager and repackager facilities are economically achievable.
