These are the three key findings of the "Report on the Trends of the Major Aims of French Research" presented yesterday by Robert Daulray, High Commissioner for Atomic Energy, to Francois Fillon, Minister of Higher Education and Research. This document, running to some 60 pages and commissioned last September by the minister, will now be circulated to around 30,000 people, who will use it as the basis for a "major national consultation" launched today by Francois Fillon. This consultation exercise, based also on six thematic seminars to be held in different regions between now and mid-March, will be synthesized in a national debate on 9 April; this will be followed by the drafting during May of the final summative document, which will be used as the framework for parliamentary discussion on the future of French research, scheduled by the minister for the end of the spring session of the National Assembly, next June. Replying to our questions, he explains why he considers it "indispensable" to take the pulse of the French scientific community, so as to help it reach the end of the century in good shape. [LE FIGARO] Why undertake such national consultation on the aims of research now? [FILLON] Firstly, because this has not been done for 10 years, despite the major changes which have taken place since then in our society and in research. At the geopolitical level, take the disintegration of the former USSR, or, at the global level, the importance now attached to environmental problems. Take, also, the very rapid growth in the numbers of students, who should be considered not only in terms of their interests and abilities, but also in terms of the constraints of the labor market, without neglecting the research role of our universities. Next, I feel it is important for France to have a more accurate perception of its scientific resources, and of the major steps it can and must take during the next few years, for the same reason as the United States, Japan, Germany, or indeed Britain. [LE FIGARO] What should be the role of the state in scientific research? [FILLON] My main criticism of French policy in this area over the past five years is the fact that we have not managed to define strong priorities -- for pump-priming programs suitable for stimulating research in a changed national and international context; for launching basic research programs today, not only to prepare the applied research which tomorrow's companies will need, but also to respond to advances in this same applied research. The state is presently going too far in reducing its essential role to allocating funding which is growing ever larger, but which unfortunately is increasingly absorbed by major research bodies, rather than by research activities themselves. I believe it is time we found the way to target our research -- with all the consultation that requires, of course -- instead of being satisfied just to finance it, while having nothing, or virtually nothing, to say about it. Neither is it normal -- the research establishments themselves complain about this -- for the state to be unable to take selective decisions on supporting a particular laboratory which has just achieved a major breakthrough in a field which is becoming highly significant for our country... Building Bridges Between Laboratories [LE FIGARO] The preliminary report which launched this consultation refers to inflexibility over basic research. What is the cause of this, and how can it be cured? [FILLON] Though it has not yet reached paralysis, we can certainly speak of disturbing inflexibility. Its symptoms are varied: Inability properly to assess needs, or difficulty in properly allocating efforts over the medium term, leading to difficulty in developing... What causes this? The cause lies, once again, in the difficulties faced by institutions in properly developing their programs. Another cause is the doubts facing researchers, and, more generally, laboratories, over their ability to question, and, if necessary, abandon existing activities. It is also worth mentioning the problem faced by French researchers in finding the right level in particular fields, such as the "new frontier" which now is as much at the level of the infinitely complex as of the infinitely large or small. It seems that there are not enough bridges between laboratories where interdisciplinary research is concerned, such as -- to take a specific example -- global climate change. What do we do? This national consultation should analyze present modes of operation, and, hopefully, result in the basis for solutions. A Very Longstanding Deficit The preliminary report which launched this consultation refers to serious causes: For example, high-school education, which is claimed to favor the abstract at the expense of the concrete. We shall also have to look into problems which have been discussed for a long time: The insufficient mobility of researchers, their reluctance to take advantage of their job security so as to take risks, or even the lack of pump-priming funding, such as invitations to bid, for example. [LE FIGARO] How does our private-sector research compare with that of other industrial countries? [FILLON] It is common knowledge that far less is achieved here in France than in the other major industrial countries. Where German companies provide 72 percent of research and development, French companies manage only 60 percent. We suffer from a very longstanding deficit, linked to the organization of our outmoded industrial structures. Many small and medium-sized enterprises [SME's] have problems in gaining access to research. There is little contact between the public and private sectors over research. It is obvious that France needs to increase its private-sector research -- this was a matter of concern to my predecessors. I hope that this national consultation will reveal new solutions in three directions: Firstly, in developing modern tools, particularly through ANVAR, the National Agency for the Promotion of Research; then, in progressively fostering a research culture in many companies where it does not presently exist; and finally, in achieving a better understanding of the needs of our industries on the part of our research establishments. [LE FIGARO] How can we enable applied research better to service SME's? [FILLON] This can only be achieved through collective action, by the state, the private sector and local communities. For example, take the improvements in procedures for aiding research and innovation, again through such bodies as ANVAR, the creation or the strengthening of skills in companies -- by hiring engineers with greater awareness of the scope offered by research to develop an activity -- and the growing cooperation between these companies and technical education. I believe that the interweaving of research activities and the needs of SME's must take place on a regional scale. The relationship between the two can be far more firmly established, on a person to person basis, so that needs and potential for development are in harmony.
