In a speech delivered in Bonn during the luncheon offered in his honor by German Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel, Amorim emphasized the need of organizations, such as the United Nations, to have an all-encompassing and meaningful representativity reflecting the new international order. According to him, mechanisms must be adopted that are "tuned to the new international political configuration" so that the multilateral forums reflect "with more faithfulness and equity the various interests and concepts that are appearing in today's world." Brazil supports the idea of expanding the UN Security Council, and is striving for inclusion among those countries seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The Brazilian Government supports German candidacy to the Security Council. During the first day of his 48-hour visit to Bonn and Berlin, Amorim emphasized Brazilian interest in expanding its scientific and technological cooperation with Germany, including that in high technology projects. As he recalled, recent measures adopted in the country, including ratification of the agreement among Brazil, Argentina, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (which contemplates supervision of the nuclear facilities and the peaceful use of atomic energy), and Brazil's decision to comply with the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) will facilitate this cooperation. The Brazilian foreign minister also pointed out that at several multilateral forums Brazil has been contributing to preserving balance in the post-cold war world, such as in issues related to trade, the environment, disarmament, and human rights.
