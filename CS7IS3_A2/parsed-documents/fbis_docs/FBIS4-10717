This mechanism allows foreign banks to immediately receive real cruzeiros to invest in Brazil, instead of having to wait to receive payment in foreign currency. The Central Bank believes that the country will immediately obtain $210 million for the capitalization of financial institutions or holdings, whether or not these institutions have foreign capital. According to the provision promulgated yesterday by the Central Bank, creditors who in 1998 lent fresh money to Brazil have two options: exchange the money which has not been used, and is still deposited at the Central Bank, for new certificates for the rescheduled debt; or invest in the capitalization of companies in the country. The Central bank provision demands, however, that these creditors have a balance in the PFA (Parallel Financing Accord) [Acordo Paralelo de Financimaneto], which was one of the four types of fresh money used in 1987.
