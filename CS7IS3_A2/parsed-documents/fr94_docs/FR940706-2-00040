FR940706-2-00040 FR940706-2-00022 Regulatory Procedure Requirements Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., each agency, when required to publish a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that (1) this rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an Allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. The requirements of this Act can be waived if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. By his execution of this Federal Register notice, Western's Administrator certifies that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities will occur. Environmental Compliance The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. ยง4321 et seq. , and implementing regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR ยง1500 et seq. , and the Department of Energy, 10 CFR ยง1021, require that the environmental effects of agency decisions be studied and considered by decision makers. Studies were made to determine whether there were significant impacts to the environment as a result of the original allocation of this Power to the military installations. These studies and analysis are published in the Revised Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which were prepared by Western for its Sacramento Area Office 1994 Power Marketing Plan. Western is examining the applicability of the 1994 Revised Environmental Assessment to these Power allocations. Paperwork Reduction Act Of 1980 The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. , requires that certain information collection requirements be approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before information is requested of the public. OMB has issued a final rule on the Paperwork Burdens on the Public, 48 FR 13666, March 31, 1983. Determination Under Executive Order 12866 DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required. Issued at Washington, DC, June 16, 1994. William H. Clagett, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15980 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
