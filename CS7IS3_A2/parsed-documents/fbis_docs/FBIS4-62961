Over Neutral Waters. We Shall Have To Sustain Huge Expenses Unless Regulations Are Drafted for Using the Air Space Between Russia and Lithuania"] [Text] Today the skies over Kalinigrad Oblast (Russian Federation) are legally controlled by a neighboring state -- Lithuania. More specifically, the Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic Control Center. The working of Russian aircraft here fully depends on the mood of foreign specialists or rather political ambitions. Ways of resolving this problem were discussed at a meeting between Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian Federal Assembly's Security and Defense Committee, and Yuriy Matochkin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration. "Two years ago," Lt.-Gen. Vasiliy Proskurin, commander of the Baltic Fleet's Air Force said, "an interim agreement was prepared between Russia and Lithuania on using the air space in the region. It established procedures for aircraft passage from the oblast's territory to Russia. But for reasons I am not aware of it was not signed...." The effects were immediately felt by Navy, Air Defense and Border Guard pilots. An air "barrier" prevented their crossing Lithuania's territory. It came to the point that one day the Vilnyus Regional Air Traffic Control Center denied entry to the Russian defense minister's plane. Now military aircraft, taking off in Kaliningrad, fly over the sea to Liepaya and Riga and then on to Moscow. "We shall have to fly," Proskurin said, "over neutral waters via the Gulf of Finland to St. Petersburg. This is quite a detour and it will be expensive but there is no other answer so far...."
