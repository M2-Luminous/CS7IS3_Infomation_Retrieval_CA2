FR940906-0-00051 FR940906-0-00019 Section 313(c)(3) of the Magnuson Act requires that, within 45 days of the close of the public comment period, the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall analyze the public comment received and publish final regulations for implementing [the Research Plan]. Consultation with the Council was concluded July 14, 1994, in a teleconference meeting between the Council and NMFS. During this consultation, public comments received by NMFS on the Research Plan were reviewed and alternatives for NMFS' response considered. The Secretary has approved the Research Plan under section 313(c) of the Magnuson Act. Upon reviewing the Research Plan and the comments on the proposed rule to implement it, NMFS has determined that this final rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and the Research Plan as adopted by the Council. The Research Plan requires that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating in the BSAI management area groundfish, GOA groundfish, and BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries. These requirements may be extended to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers will be deployed for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also will establish a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan. The fees will be based on the exvessel value of retained catch in the BSAI management area and GOA groundfish fisheries, the BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries, and the Pacific halibut fishery off Alaska (Research Plan fisheries). Future recommendations by the Council to include other fisheries under the Research Plan will require an amendment or amendments to the Research Plan and to the regulations implementing it. The Research Plan and its implementation are explained further in the preamble to the proposed rule. With the exception of the portion of the final rule implementing the first year of the Research Plan, the measures set out in the final rule do not differ significantly from the proposed rule. Response to Comments Nine letters of comments were received within the comment period. NMFS also received oral comments during three public hearings on the Research Plan. A summary of the written and oral comments and NMFS' response follows: Comment 1. During the current Magnuson Act reauthorization, the Secretary should recommend that the name of the Research Plan be changed to the North Pacific Fisheries Observer Plan to better reflect its intent. Response. NMFS agrees that the title ``North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan'' does not accurately reflect the scope of the statutory authority set out at section 313 of the Magnuson Act. Nonetheless, any change to the title would require an amendment to the Magnuson Act. NMFS' ability to include such an amendment in the current reauthorization process is limited. An amendment to the Research Plan as adopted by the Council also would be required. NMFS recommends that the Council consider changing the name of its Research Plan the next time an amendment to the Research Plan is initiated. Until the name of the Research Plan is amended, its implementing regulations will continue to refer to the ``Research Plan'' to reduce confusion and inconsistency between the Research Plan as adopted by the Council and its implementing regulations. Comment 2. The Research Plan could become a model for other user fee programs proposed nationwide. This Research Plan, therefore, must be efficient, equitable, and supported by the industry. Response. NMFS agrees. The Research Plan must be efficiently administered and equitable to all affected sectors of the industry to ensure its success. NMFS believes that the final rule implementing the Research Plan achieves this goal. Comment 3. The present Observer Plan is satisfactory and the implementation of the Research Plan should be delayed until a comprehensive rationalization program for the crab and groundfish fisheries is implemented. Concerns about maintaining the integrity of the observer program under the existing Observer Plan can be readily addressed by contracts and penalties without the need to impose a costly new system on the industry. Response. For reasons outlined in the proposed rule, NMFS, the Council, and many sectors of the affected industry do not believe that the current Observer Plan is satisfactory. Once the Research Plan is fully implemented, the cost of observer coverage would be linked much more closely to both the benefits each participant receives from the observer program and the participant's ability to pay for observer coverage. In attaining a more equitable payment system, the costs for observer coverage will be increased for some operations, decreased for some, and remain unchanged for others. Delaying Research Plan implementation until a comprehensive rationalization program for groundfish and crab fisheries is implemented would unnecessarily delay a reasonable response to the concerns existing under the current observer programs, including conflict of interest and nonpayment for observer coverage. Under the current observer program, NMFS has limited ability to monitor contracts between vessel and processor owners, observer contractors, and observers. Under the Research Plan, observers will be employees of NMFS contractors and the possibility of conflicts of interest between the observers and the vessels they are observing is greatly reduced. Furthermore, NMFS will be in a better position to take action on cases of observer nonpayment by contractors. Comment 4. Catcher/processors will be assessed a fee of up to 2 percent of the exvessel value of their retained catch. For some processors with 100-percent observer coverage, this will result in a fee that reflects up to an eight-fold increase in costs for observer coverage. An increase of this magnitude is difficult to accept, given that observer coverage on these vessels cannot be any greater than it is now, and many more industry participants will be sharing the costs of the program. Response. One of the objectives of the Research Plan is to distribute the costs of observer coverage more equitably. Those who have low observer coverage costs relative to the exvessel value of the fish they retain and those who currently have no observer coverage requirements will experience increased costs. Those who have high observer coverage costs relative to the exvessel value of the fish they retain will experience decreased costs. The distribution of costs under the Research Plan will become more equitable, both in terms of the benefits received from the observer program and the ability to pay for observer coverage. Comment 5. Fishermen should not have to pay costs associated with agency support of the groundfish and crab observer programs under the Research Plan when NMFS and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) have paid for these costs in the past. Response. Agency costs to administer and operate the groundfish and crab observer programs are authorized recoverable costs under the Research Plan. Nonetheless, NMFS is pursuing continued funding of the observer programs at current levels. If NMFS is successful, the use of the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund (Observer Fund) to support agency costs of implementing the observer program will be minimized.
