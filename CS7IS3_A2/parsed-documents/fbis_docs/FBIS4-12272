Sa'di Mahdi Salih, member of the Iraq Command of the ASBP delivered a speech at the function, also attended by 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i and Badr al-Din Muddathir, members of the National Command of the ASBP. Salih first communicated greetings from His Excellency President Saddam Husayn to the people of the intifadah in Palestine. He emphasized that the party leadership is absolutely confident of complete victory, notwithstanding the unsavory character of certain incumbent Arab politicians and leaders. The Mother of Battles agenda has forced the Zionist-American tyrants to expose all the agent puppets, leaving none of the agents in the ranks of the Arab nation capable of concealing their treasonous connections. Salih was followed by 'Azzam al-Ahmad, the state of Palestine's ambassador in Baghdad. 'Azzam said that, led by Saddam Husayn, Iraq is bound to bring its ambitions to fruition, since they are those of the Arab nation. He said he was certain Iraq will ride out the sanctions crisis and mount a successful challenge to all types of aggression, and, in the end, emerge the victor. The Zionist enemy, he went on, is working to liquidate the Palestinian cause and extinguish the freedom of the Palestinian people to pursue their advancement and independence. The next speech was delivered on behalf of the professional and popular Palestinian organizations, which voiced their appreciation and recognition of the support they have been receiving from President Saddam Husayn in pursuing their programs in Iraq. Mr. Anwar Daklas, president of the General Union of Palestinian Engineers said: We have learned from President Saddam Husayn's Iraq all the militant values that will help us attain our liberation and advancement. Mr. Abu-Mahmud, deputy secretary general of the ALF delivered a speech in which he stressed that over the past 25 years, the front has fought all the battles in which the national existence and legitimacy of the Palestinian people were at stake and stood up to the Zionist and anti-Arab enemies. He called for severing all forms of contacts pursuing a settlement with the enemy and quitting the policy of making free concessions. He also urged that all forms of struggle, armed struggle in particular, be intensified against occupation and that all resources be mobilized to refine the valiant popular intifadah.
