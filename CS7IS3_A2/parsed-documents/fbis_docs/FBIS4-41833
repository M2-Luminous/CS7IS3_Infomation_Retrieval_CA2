As is well known, the minimum wage is increased by 40 percent on that day -- that is, from 14,620 rubles [R] to R20,500 a month. At the same time, deputies instructed the Committee for Social Policy to work out with each region within two weeks the question of the source of funding for the increased wage, so as to ensure that this decision, which the people need so much, does not remain an empty intention. The upper house also approved the federal law on amendments and additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, which had been sent to it by the State Duma. The law "On the Russian Federation's State Foreign Borrowings and State Loans Granted by the Russian Federation to Foreign States" was also approved. The Federation Council yesterday adopted an appeal to the CSCE parliaments in connection with the Latvian Saeima's adoption of a citizenship law. The document notes that this law was adopted "despite numerous protests from the international community and regardless of the recommendations made by the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number of international experts." Thus, the Latvian authorities have "ignored generally accepted standards in the human rights sphere," the appeal notes. The Federation Council called on them to "uphold the principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe, to prevent Latvia from sliding into aggressive nationalism, and to avert the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region."
