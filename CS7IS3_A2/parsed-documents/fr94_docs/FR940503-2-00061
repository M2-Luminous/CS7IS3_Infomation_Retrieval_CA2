FR940503-2-00061 FR940503-2-00040 The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. On March 23, 1994, Rheem filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Rheem's Application seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Rheem requests the allowance to test using a 20-second blower time delay when testing its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces. Rheem states that the 20-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an average increase in AFUE of 2.0 percentage points. Since current DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Rheem asks that the Interim Waiver be granted. The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue. Previous waivers for this type of time blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710, January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992, and 58 FR 68138, December 23, 1993; Lennox Industries, 55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992, 58 FR 68136, December 23, 1993, and 58 FR 68137, December 23, 1993; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December 14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation, 56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992, 58 FR 68131, December 23, 1993, 58 FR 68133, December 23, 1993 and 59 FR 14394, March 28, 1994; Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992, and 58 FR 68130, December 23, 1993; Snyder General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15, 1991, 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992 and 59 FR 12586, March 17, 1994; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting Rheem an Interim Waiver for its GDG upflow, GLH downflow, GVH horizontal, and GPH upflow/horizontal gas furnaces. Pursuant to paragraph (e) of ยง430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to Rheem was issued. Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting the petition. Issued in Washington, DC, April 19, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
