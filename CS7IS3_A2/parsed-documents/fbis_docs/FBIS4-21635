The report, which raises objections to the figures released by Furnas, remained shelved for months within the TCU. Its conclusions could destroy the executive branch's reasons for justifying the decision to continue with the construction of the plant. The auditing study reveals, for example, that Angra-2 has so far cost $5 billion, according to the most reliable calculations. This figure is more than three times the amount that Furnas has officially declared to have spent since 1977 -- $1.7 billion. The TCU report also concluded that the estimates of the investment that is necessary for concluding the project are not reliable. It is expected that the plant will call for investments that are higher than the cost of a hydroelectric plant with the same generation capacity of 1,300 megawatts. Based on the results of the auditing study, the Greenpeace environmentalist organization will request suspension of construction of the plant. "Angra-2 accounts have been revealed for the first time," says Greenpeace leader Rui de Goes. He remarked that the auditing confirms the theses of nongovernmental organizations which are against the nuclear program. The TCU document has not only challenged the credibility of Furnas, but has also cast doubts over the accounts of the entire electric power sector. It says that in the face of the estimated cost, "nuclear energy is not competitive in Plan 2015" which was prepared by Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company Inc.]. "With the most pessimistic hypothesis, thermal power will not be competitive with hydroelectric power until 2005," the TCU report says, noting that the nuclear option is the most expensive thermal power generation alternative. "For FURNAS, building a hydroelectric power plant or a nuclear power plant makes no difference, because the Union subsidizes the cost of nuclear energy," the TCU report says. Based on this report, the $5 billion that has already been spent, plus the $2.3 billion that is necessary for completion of the project, amounts to $7.3 billion for the total cost of Angra-2. The limit for Furnas spending on the construction of Angra-2 corresponds to the amount that would be spent on a hydroelectric power plant of the same size -- of approximately 1,300 megawatts. This would mean an investment of $1.2 billion for Furnas. The Treasury must supply the remaining $6.1 billion, which amounts to two minimum salaries for each Brazilian family. These figures, however, could be even larger. The TCU auditing did not estimate the financial expenses included in the construction of the plant. In the case of Angra, they account for 40 percent of the cost. For its part, Eletrobras has other estimates of the cost for completion of the project. It estimates that $2 billion is necessary for completion of the project. The TCU auditing study also has doubts about those estimates. "Angra-2 cost estimates should be considered cautiously." The report recalls the case of Angra-1, "whose cost was estimated at $319 million, but which turned out to be several times higher." The conclusions of the TCU concerning Angra-1 accounts are equally devastating. The auditors estimated the cost at $3.9 billion, noting that this figure "affords a new base for calculation of the cost-benefit ratio for Angra-1," adding that this project "has obviously contradicted the terms of the economy-efficacy-efficiency trinomial." Angra-1 has been disconnected for one year, after a radioactive leak in the cooling system caused by a deficiency in the nuclear fuel rods.
