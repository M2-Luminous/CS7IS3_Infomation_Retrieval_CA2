More than 300,000 farmers and herdsmen have made contracts to fight against soil erosion on the plateau. They have made 1,360 sq [square] km of wasteland, half of the land contracted, green in the past five years. So far more than 33,330 hectares of farmland have been reclaimed, and trees and grass now cover more than 670,000 hectares of plateau lands. Located on the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, the plateau suffers from serious soil erosion. Most of the muddy silt which gives the Yellow River its name comes from the plateau. About 47,000 sq km of land still suffers from serious soil erosion. But with effective measures taken to protect soil erosion in recent years, less soil is washed into the Yellow River. An annual amount of soil erodes into the river is now five times less than the amount in the 1950s. Farmers and herdsmen on the plateau pay equal attention to both environmental improvement and economic efficiency while transforming the wasteland. They build up farmland, plant sallow thorns and apple trees in light of soil quality and are developing a farm and sideline products processing industry.
