The special collection in this year's white paper is "Ensuring Safety Regarding the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Reactor Facilities." Following last year's special collection, "Ensuring the Safety of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle," the white paper is expressing the concept that the safety of the fuel cycle and nuclear reactor facilities is being adequately ensured. Just how was the evaluation of the safety of fast-breeder reactors (FBR), one type of nuclear reactor facility, carried out? This article will present an outline of the description of the "Monju" reactor, which was given as an example. "Monju" Safety Investigation We will explain, particularly, the special aspects of "Monju" with regard to just what type of investigation was carried out as part of the Nuclear Power Safety Committee's double check on each of the following points: 1) site conditions, 2) nuclear power facility safety design, 3) evaluation of exposure dose during normal operating periods, 4) safety design evaluation, and 5) site evaluation, as well as whether or not it was confirmed that there were no problems with regard to safety assurance. Moreover, "Monju" has many unique characteristics which differ from light-water reactors, such as: - it was designed to operate at low pressure, but at high temperature, because it utilizes sodium (which has a high boiling point) as a coolant; - because it is a reactor which uses MOX fuel and has a reactor core which uses fast neutrons in its reaction, thus giving it the ability to breed, the reactor's output density and burnup rates are high; and, - a cover gas exists above the surface of liquid sodium. While giving adequate considerations to these particular characteristics, an investigation was carried out into the appropriateness of the safety design and into the safety evaluation, based on previous experience operating FBRs and the results of research and development. Nuclear Reactor Facility Safety Design (1) Nuclear Reactor Facility--General With regard to the design of construction materials, systems, and equipment which are important for safety, because this reactor uses sodium (a high-temperature liquid metal) as a coolant, there are areas in the design which exceed the operational parameters used for light-water reactors. In such areas, it was decided to use a structure design policy that was created in consideration of the special characteristics associated with sodium reactors, based on factors such as the results of domestic experimentation and research and considering foreign standards. We confirmed that this basic policy was appropriate. Moreover, regarding the chemical activity of sodium, countermeasures have been taken, such as covering the surface of the liquid sodium with an atmosphere of an inert gas (argon gas). Furthermore, in regard to response to and burnup reaction caused by leakage of the sodium, adequate measures have been devised with regard to leak detection, burnup control, and the minimization of thermal effects. We confirmed that the basic policy was one which was designed so that the safety functions of construction materials, systems, and equipment important to safety were not harmed by the use of sodium. (2) Aseismatic Design Nuclear reactors are facilities which need to have adequate earthquake-proofing to respond to the strongest possible earthquakes conceivable. Therefore, we confirmed that, along with carrying out a classification based on importance for earthquake-proofing of facilities, systems, and equipment important for safety, the facility was designed being able to withstand the maximum calculated possible earthquake. This calculation was based on factors such as a review of the records of previous earthquakes in the region of the facility and of surrounding regions, as well as a study of the region itself. Moreover, bearing in mind the nature of the sodium, which is used as coolant, we confirmed that the internal storage unit for the large volume of liquid sodium was classified appropriately in terms of aseismatic design. (3) Important Systems and Equipment for the Safety of Nuclear Reactor Facilities Regarding the nuclear reactor, considering the fact that it utilizes MOX fuel, sodium coolant, and high-speed neutrons, we confirmed that: - even though it was probable that, in the case of a sodium void, the reaction coefficient in the inner-reactor core would be positive, countermeasures for contingencies such as the prevention of sodium boiling were adequately thought out. Moreover, because of factors such as the reactor's output power coefficient being designed to possess the special characteristic of negative feedback (unique safety) and because the reactor was designed so that, even in a situation where the control rod which exerts the greatest influence over the rate of reaction could not be inserted, the reactor core could still be maintained within operational limits, we determined that the nuclear reactor's design was appropriate. - Considering the fuel burnup and the control rod insertion conditions, given facts such as, even in a situation anticipating power distribution during a state of maximum heat generation in each sphere, the fuel's maximum temperature would remain below its melting point, we determined that the fuel was sound and, additionally, that the temperature of the sodium coolant would remain below its boiling point. Therefore, we confirmed that the design of the nuclear reactor's thermal flow power was appropriate. Regarding the instrumentation control system, we confirmed that this system was designed in a manner so that it could, during periods of both normal operations and abnormal transitional changes, operate to ensure the soundness of the nuclear reactor and other facilities, along with being able to monitor and/or regulate important parameters such as the temperature and flow rates in the primary and secondary coolant systems, the particle fluence rate, the liquid state of the sodium in the reactor vessel, and the temperature of the atmosphere beneath the nuclear reactor container floor, also maintaining these parameters within appropriate operational bounds. Furthermore, we confirmed that the system was designed so that, even during accidents, it could be able to continuously monitor and record the temperature in the atmosphere beneath the nuclear reactor housing vessel floor and measure and monitor the density of radioactive materials within the primary argon gas system and in the nuclear reactor housing vessel. Regarding the nuclear reactor's coolant system, we confirmed that it would be able to appropriately cool the reactor core during both normal operations and abnormal operational transitional changes, as well as during an accident. Along with that, it was considered highly unlikely that the nuclear reactor's coolant boundary (which acts as a barrier preventing radioactive substances in the primary coolant etc. from leaking to the outside) could be damaged. In other words, it was confirmed that: - the machinery and piping that make up the nuclear reactor's coolant boundary were designed, bearing in mind the nature of the sodium coolant which is used in the reactor (that functions under low pressure but with high temperatures), with appropriate consideration given to the material's special characteristics, including creep and factors such as their transitional thermal response power. Further, the system was designed so that, even during the period in which materials were supplied, important parts underwent regular necessary inspections; and, - even during a leak of the primary coolant, the plant was designed so that there would be no hindrance to the circulation of the primary coolant through measures such as the placing of primary coolant (which is essential for the reactor) in a guard vessel, which has adequate capacity for the reactor vessel and other systems. Furthermore, the system was designed so that, even during the period in which materials such as the reactor vessel and the guard vessel were supplied, important parts underwent regular necessary inspections. Moreover, we also confirmed things such as: - the secondary coolant system is designed such that leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary coolant system are restrained by maintaining the pressure in the secondary coolant system higher than that found in the primary system. Furthermore, even in cases where water/vapor leaks into the secondary coolant system because of damage to the steam generator heat transfer piping, the system has been designed to prevent the buildup of excessive pressure in the secondary coolant system through the automatic high-speed blowing operation of internal water and steam and through the installation of equipment to store the sodium/water reactive substance, and - in order to prevent solidification of the sodium in the primary or secondary coolant systems caused by excessive cooling, the system was designed to include emergency heating units. Even during periods when the reactor is shut down, the temperature of the sodium can be maintained at around 180�C (the melting point of sodium is around 100�C). Regarding the reactor container, we confirmed that, considering situations such as a primary coolant leak accident, it could withstand the temperatures and pressures that would be produced by the release of the maximum possible amount of energy, and that its soundness would be able to be maintained without exceeding the fixed leak rate. Evaluation of Exposure Dose During Periods of Normal Operations [omitted] Evaluation of the Safety Design (1) Analysis of Abnormal Transitional Changes During Reactor Operation Regarding reactor operation, we confirmed that the analysis and estimates were appropriately performed on the following selected unusual transitional phenomena which could be caused by factors such as the possible simple breakage of equipment during the life-span of the nuclear reactor which could, at its worst, lead to malfunction, or simple operator error: 1. abnormal changes in the reaction rates or power distribution within the reactor core; 2. abnormal heat generation in, or heat removal from, the reactor core, and 3. phenomena associated with a chemical reaction of sodium. Further, we confirmed that the standard used for making this evaluation was appropriate; namely, that in order for there to be no excessive damage to the fuel or the nuclear reactor coolant boundary, none of the following temperatures be exceeded: - the temperature in the heart of the thick fuel cladding would be less than 830�C, - the temperature of the sodium in the reactor core would not reach its boiling point, - the temperature in the reactor coolant boundary be 600�C, and - that the temperature never exceed 1.4 times the maximum operating temperature. Therefore, as a result of the analysis/evaluation regarding any conceived abnormal transitional changes during reactor operation, we confirmed that any phenomenon could be resolved and the reactor could be returned to normal operational status before any damage could be caused to the reactor core or to the reactor's coolant boundary. (2) Accident Analysis There are cases of abnormal situations occurring which exceed those considered under "Abnormal Transitional Changes During Reactor Operation," even though it is thought that the frequency of such events occurring would be extremely small. The phenomena which must be considered from the point of view of evaluating the soundness of the reactor facility and the possibility of release of radioactive materials from the reactor into the surrounding environment, are: 1. an increase of the reaction rate within the reactor core; 2. a reduction in the functionality of the coolant in the reactor core; 3. an accident occurring connected with the handling of the fuel; 4. an accident connected with the waste-processing facility; 5. a sodium chemical reaction, and 6. an accident associated with the reactor cover gas system. We confirmed that the analysis/evaluations performed in such cases were appropriate. We determined that the standard used for making this evaluation was appropriate. This standard was: 1. that no major damage occur to the reactor core, and that adequate cooling was still possible; 2. that the reactor container's leak rate remain below specified values (the temperature and pressure at the reactor container boundary be below the maximum operating temperature and pressure); 3. that the temperature of the reactor coolant boundary remain below 650�C, and below 1.6 times the maximum operating temperature, and 4. that such a situation would not pose a risk of significant radiation exposure to the surrounding public. Moreover, we confirmed that, given the fact that the coolant used in the "Monju" reactor is sodium, adequate consideration and analysis was given to factors such as the probable positive reaction rates in the inner reactor core in case of sodium void and the impact of a burnup reaction of the leaked sodium. As a result of this evaluation and analysis of possible accidents, we confirmed that an accident would not cause major damage to the reactor core or impede the cooling of the reactor core. We also confirmed that such an accident would not pose a risk of significant exposure to radioactivity to the public through the release of radioactive materials into the environment. Moreover, in the case of "Monju," in addition to performing accident analysis, because our operating experience with sodium-cooled FBRs is limited, we considered phenomena that would have occurrence frequencies even less than those of accidents, but which would have important results, and, as a result of analysis/evaluation, confirmed that the release of radioactive materials would be adequately controlled.
