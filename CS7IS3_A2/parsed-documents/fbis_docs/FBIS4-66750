India has been working hard to establish a political process and stage a show of holding elections there for the last two years. However, it failed badly in its efforts. Now again, the Indian government has established a committee to reinstate a political process in occupied Kashmir. This committee, composed of parliament members, will present recommendations on how to restart a political process. Earlier, India had tried to bring its former faithful and loyal Kashmiris forward to do this job. Dr. Farooq Abdullah was given a lot of coverage in the media in this context. He was sent abroad as a member of Indian deputations and efforts were made to send him to military areas in Srinagar behind military security. The Kashmiri people were told that Dr. Farooq Abdullah's recommendations are very important in freeing Kashmiri freedom fighters in Indian military custody and that he can help in resolving other issues also. Thus, Farooq Abdullah sat in Srinagar's military camp, sent out a message to the people, and waited for them to come visit him. However, soon the Indian government learned that the Kashmiri people have not only dismissed Dr. Farooq Abdullah, but also hate him. Not only Farooq Abdullah, but every pro-India Kashmiri is the target of their hatred. After the assassination of Wali Mohammed Raitu, former speaker of Kashmir Assembly, pro-India Kashmir politicians living in Jammu and Indian areas felt unprotected and were looking for protection. The Indian government deployed additional troops for their protection. The Indian efforts to establish a political process in Kashmir were greatly set back by Wali Mohammed Raitu's assassination. The pro-India Kashmiri politicians are scared and are hesitating in supporting India now. They are not prepared to come out in the open. The Kashmiri leaders associated with the National Conference and the Congress Party consider themselves unprotected despite all the security. They are moving to other cities quietly. This situation shows that India's plans to establish a political process in Kashmir appears to be ruined again. Meanwhile the militant organizations in occupied Kashmir have made it clear that they will not let any efforts to establish political process in the state be successful. The control of the Indian military is limited to around military camps only. No system is left for the daily administration of cities and villages. On the other hand, the freedom fighters have full control over their areas and they administrate the daily affairs there. The Indian soldiers and paramilitary forces enjoy a broad range of privileges. However, because of their fear of the freedom fighters, they have become very corrupt. For a little money they even sell their weapons and ammunition. The military officers have to court martial soldiers every other day for selling weapons and ammunition. The incidence of corruption is so frequent that even Indian newspapers have started to publish news about it. The Indian government and the military high command are greatly perturbed by this situation. One reason for their distress is that despite quick transfers and other actions they cannot put a stop to these corrupt practices. Some observers have suggested that the Indian military and paramilitary personnel have become demoralized as they have no clear goal for fighting this war against the invisible enemy in Kashmir. In addition to selling weapons, they also destroy them and relate incidents of imaginary confrontations with the freedom fighters and losing their weapons there. The laws, especially anti-Muslim laws, that were prevalent in occupied Kashmir before the present campaign began are slowly disappearing. Slaughtering cows in occupied Kashmir was a crime. This law was enacted during the Dogra regime. A person whose "crime" of slaughtering a cow was proved was sentenced to 14 years of hard labor in jail. This law is still part of the present legal books in occupied Kashmir. However, now people slaughter cows openly and eat its meat with great pleasure. These days, beef is sold at 35 rupees per kilogram in Srinagar in the open market. Other anti-Muslim laws in occupied Kashmir are meeting the same luck. Even the Indian officials there know that India has no future in occupied Kashmir and the Kashmiri people will not accept India. Although political processes has ended in occupied Kashmir and the militant organizations have taken over, Sayyed Gailani and Shabir Ahmed Shah have great influence among the people. Amanullah Khan of the Liberation Front is also greatly respected there. However, Sayyed Gailani and Shabir Ahmed Shah are revered there and perhaps that is the reason India has jailed them. A major part of these leaders' lives is being spent in Indian jails. The feeling that India refuses to accept any practical solution to the Kashmir problem just because of its enmity toward Pakistan and its unwillingness to work with Pakistan to find a solution gives strength to the political leaders in occupied and Azad Kashmir. Therefore, we should provide an opportunity to Kashmiri leaders on both sides of the Line of Control to find a respectable solution to this problem. This feeling was expressed by the All Parties Huriat Conference and Azad Kashmir leaders, especially Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayum Khan many times. This idea is getting support in Western nations now. It was learned that Lord Aubry of the British Parliament is trying to organize a conference in which Kashmiri leaders from both sides can participate. President Abdul Qayum Khan has expressed a desire to participate in this conference if the leaders of occupied Kashmir are also given the opportunity to participate in it. There is no restriction on him or any Azad Kashmir leader for participation in this conference. However, India will not permit leaders of occupied Kashmir to participate. If these leaders are not allowed to take part in this conference, the main goal of this conference will not be achieved and his participation will be useless. India should create an appropriate environment if it desires to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir and wants to find an acceptable solution of the Kashmir problem. Otherwise, it would be understood that India is not willing to be reasonable.
