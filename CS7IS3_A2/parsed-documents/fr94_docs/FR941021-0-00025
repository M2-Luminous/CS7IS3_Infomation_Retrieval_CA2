FR941021-0-00025 FR941021-0-00001 (iii) A special service marker shall be available which must attach to a binding post terminal to identify special circuits and insulate exposed metal parts from accidental shorts from tools and wires. A supply of 25 special service markers shall be provided with each SAI cabinet. The color of special service markers shall be red. (iv)(A) A supply of twisted pair cross-connect wire shall be supplied with housings that are equipped with cross-connect terminals or that have provisions for mounting cross-connect terminals. The minimum length of cross-connect wire supplied is dependent on the SAI cabinet terminal capacity as follows: ␣ 1Cabinet termination capacity (pairs) 1Wire length ␣1 to 600 60 m (200 ft) 601 to 1200 120 m (400 ft) Over 1200 180 m (600 ft) (B) The cabinet shall be equipped to store the length of wire in a manner designed for convenient dispensing. The cross-connect wire supply shall be easily replaceable. (g) Performance criteria and test procedures for binding post terminal blocks used in SAI cabinets _(1) General. Many of the tests described in this section require that the terminal block be installed in an appropriate housing in its typical field configuration. (2) Environmental requirements _(i) Insulation resistance/high humidity and salt fog exposure. A test specimen shall consist of a standard ground or pole mounted housing equipped with a full complement of binding post terminals equipped with 25 special service markers. The minimum number of terminals to be tested shall be 100 pair (100 tips and 100 associated rings). The test terminals shall be selected to form a terminal array of approximate square dimensions. A 1 cm (36 in.) length of cross-connect wire shall be installed on each test terminal. All tips shall be joined together and all rings shall be joined together with a 48 volt dc potential applied as shown in Figure 12 during the high humidity/salt fog and simulated rain exposures. The 48 volt dc may be temporarily removed from the test samples during the measurement process and the ring terminal being measured shall be isolated from the remaining ring terminals. The terminal insulation resistance shall be measured at a potential of 100 volts dc using suitable instrumentation with a minimum measurement range of 104 to 1012 ohms. Figure 12 is as follows: BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER21OC94.011 BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;C
