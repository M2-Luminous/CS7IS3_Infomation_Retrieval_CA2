Is this claim indeed justified? [Olechowski] The greatest advantage to all will come from a lasting reconciliation between Poles and Germans, along the lines of the French-German reconciliation. It will mean the elimination of a source of potential conflicts at the center of the European Continent. The second advantage will stem from the fact that Poland's accession to the EU will enhance Europe's potential for competition with other economic centers around the world. This is because Poland will bring to the EU certain new resources, such as, for example, the highly qualified but still inexpensive labor force. This will result in lowering the average production costs throughout the EU's entire territory and also bringing down the prices of the goods manufactured there--which, in turn, will make them more competitive. Poland's integration into the EU will also enhance the wealth of Europe's cultural and civilizational assets. I am referring here to our particular type of creative sensibility, which is different from its Mediterranean, English, and German counterparts. We bring to Europe our own styles and currents in the literary, musical, and visual arts. In other words, we simply bring our own identity. This is because we must not view Europe exclusively in terms of economic achievements and modern products; after all, it is true that our production record in these spheres is still comparatively low. [Szczepula] In your opinion, is the date of Poland's accession to the EU a distant prospect? We recently saw a report by a U.S. scientist, Richard Baldwin, who asserts firmly that we should not entertain any dreams of Poland becoming an EU member during the next 20-30 years because our country is simply too poor and its agrarian structure is far too antiquated. On the other hand, we have been estimating that we might be joining the EU by the year 2000. [Olechowski] If the EU membership was restricted categorically to wealthy countries, neither Greece nor Portugal nor Spain would have been accepted in the first place--nor, for that matter, somewhat earlier, would Italy have. I believe that the most important criterion is that of similarity of the political and economic situation of the particular aspiring country and the already existing European Community. That would entail the requirement for democracy and a market economy. Well, we know that Poland is moving in these very directions. What does accession to the EU mean, in fact? It means opening up our goods and services market, and that is what we are already doing within the framework of the EU association agreement; it also means a joint capital market, labor market, and so on.... If there is one area I am concerned about, it is Polish agriculture. Our agriculture is totally incompatible with the Western agricultural system. It would not be possible today to extend the European agricultural policy over our own farming system. In EU countries, some 3-7 percent of the population works in the agricultural sector, whereas in Poland the corresponding proportion is 25 percent. Our budget would not withstand an agrarian policy conducted according to the principles in force in the Union. In this sphere, we really do need more time. However, let me remind you that, when Spain was joining the EEC, its agricultural sector presented the greatest problem, too. Consequently, a longer period was allowed for adjustment in the agricultural sector, and somehow or other it managed to adjust. We will manage, too. In addition, we should remember that, because of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU not only is an economic community but also shares a common line in the spheres of foreign policy, security, and justice and internal affairs. In these areas, there are no obstacles at all to immediate integration. [Szczepula] How do you assess the Polish public's readiness to accept integration into the EU? [Olechowski] Polish people are open and ready for cooperation. The odd instances of xenophobic behavior can be explained by the present difficult economic situation in our country and a sense of frustration about the fact that, having achieved the truly momentous feat of overthrowing communism, we nevertheless failed to overcome quickly enough the civilizational recession we are still suffering now. However, let me repeat that, on the whole, we are open to new development. Even the popular saying, "A guest in the house brings God into the house," attests to our attitude. In addition, we are usually a tolerant people. Please note that Poland is the only state in this part of Europe that has signed good-neighbor agreements with all of its neighbors, despite the fact that we share a very complex historical past with four of them--namely, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. This shows that we are good at arriving at a compromise. In a community of nations, the ability to give up a proportion of one's interests in the name of the common good is an extremely important asset. [Szczepula] You said recently that the Baltic is now becoming as important for Europe as the Mediterranean. This offers a big chance to Poland and, in particular, our littoral regions. [Olechowski] This promises to be a fascinating development. Until recently, the EU was associated exclusively with the Mediterranean region, but these days the Baltic Sea is becoming more and more important for Europe. Before long, there will be four EU countries with a Baltic coast: Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Soon, they will be joined by Poland as well as Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This will certainly create a whole new situation. I believe that we will shortly be discussing that situation during the approaching forum of the Baltic States Council. [Szczepula] Recently, Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski expressed his concern about the conviction, apparently prevalent in Poland, that it will be impossible for us to overcome the crisis without the backing of foreign capital. In his opinion, the situation is exactly the opposite: It will be Poland's emergence from the crisis that will attract foreign capital. Do you agree with this view? [Olechowski] The thesis that we will not make it without outside help is incorrect because, with a relatively moderate influx of capital, we have already begun to emerge from the crisis. It is true that the eye is attracted more by the healthy and the rich than the sick and the poor, but, if we are to increase our wealth, certain conditions must be met. We do need foreign capital in order to expand our investment. Economists estimate that we could easily afford 5.8-percent economic growth. [Szczepula] Beginning on 1 July, the EU will be presided over by the Germans. As I understand, you classify that development as advantageous for Polish integration aspirations. What can we count on with the Germans? [Olechowski] The Germans favor us not only in their declarations but also in their actions because they themselves have an obvious interest in it. Consequently, it is natural that they should support Poland in its rapprochement with the EU. As we have already said, this rapprochement need not mean immediate membership because there is a need for a transition and adjustment period in the economy. However, the EU itself can accelerate the process of our conjunction by offering us its assistance in a more binding declaration. We are especially interested in hearing the EU member states declare unequivocally that they want to see Poland become a member of their community. This would mobilize us to more efforts and, at the same time, would oblige the EU member states to extend assistance to us in these efforts. [Szczepula] As you outlined the main directions and principles of Poland's foreign policy in your Sejm address, you said that the one of the most pressing needs is to change the stereotyped image of Polish people to which foreigners subscribe. Do you believe that, over the past years, we have changed so much that these stereotypes are no longer accurate? [Olechowski] Yes, I believe so. However, the way from changing a set pattern of behavior to changing people's stereotyped perception of our behavior is neither simple not obvious. Let us consider the expression "Polnische Wirtschaft" ["Polish economy"; used in a derogatory sense]. We might think that these days the phrase "Polnische Wirtschaft" would begin to denote an economy that has outstanding results in the field of market transformation and that recorded the highest growth in Europe over the course of the past year. But it is not so. The phrase still carries strong pejorative connotations. Consequently, we must make an effort to advertise our achievements more widely and energetically, and to point out how much we have changed. We must convince Europe that we are Europeans. We must send it a set of our latest pictures. [Szczepula] Let us hope that one of these new pictures will include the Europartenariat conference, which is taking place at this moment. Thank you for talking to us.
