The share of total state spending going to social services has risen markedly over the past few years. In the 1993/94 Budget 44 percent of spending was allocated to social services. If a similar percentage is applied to this year's R125-billion Budget then social services will cost about R55-billion. Such spending should go a long way in helping the government get its reconstruction and development programme (RDP) off the ground. Included in the funds is money earmarked for spending on education, housing, social security and welfare, health facilities, electrification, small business and job creation. The government has announced the establishment of a R2.5-billion RDP fund as part of the 1994/95 Budget, jointly administered by Minister without Portfolio, Jay Naidoo, and Finance Minister Derek Keys. Money from this fund is to be used as "seed money", says Bernie Fanaroff, an adviser to Mr Naidoo. Mr Fanaroff sees the two main functions of the RDP fund as a kick-start for development projects and reemphasising spending priorities within existing government departments. He says the government will be looking at the provinces to provide "coherent and integrated projects within the RDP". Analysts say that the key to the success of the RDP will be a shift in spending priorities within government departments. If previous trends are maintained this year, less than 10 percent of this amount will be capital expenditure, but analysts point out that salaries of teachers, for example, are a key to the success of education projects. Billions of rands in development finance have also been set aside by parastatal institutions. The largest of these, the Development Bank, financed projects valued at R1.75-billion in 1993/94 and arranged an additional R750-million from other borrowers. A spokesman says that similar amounts could be expected this year. Jolyon Nuttall, communications director of the Independent Development Trust (IDT), says that the IDT plans to disburse over R530-million for calendar 1994. The provision of electricity to 350,000 homes, one of the short- term objectives of the RDP, could cost up to R1.5-billion, but Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] has stated that it will be able to meet this target. The biggest question mark hangs over foreign aid. Provisional figures released by the Department of Foreign Affairs show that almost R4-billion in aid and concessionary loan finance had been guaranteed by foreign governments soon after the elections. Most of this money will be spread over a period of up to three years and at most a third will be available this year. Mr Fanaroff says only grant aid would be added to the RDP fund and that the government was drawing up guidelines to evaluate foreign aid. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Committed spending on social services 1994/5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Government budgeting allocation to so-|R55 billion | |cial services | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |RDP Fund |R2.5 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Development Bank Of Southern Africa |R2.5 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foreign Aid |R1.5 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Eskom |R1.3 billion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Independent Development Fund |R530 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kagiso Trust |R410 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Small Business Development Corporation|R310 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial Development Corporation |R220 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |R64.27 billion | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
