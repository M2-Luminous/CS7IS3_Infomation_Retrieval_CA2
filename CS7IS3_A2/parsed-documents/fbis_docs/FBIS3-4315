In 1992, a total of 70,618 persons in 25 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities suffered from poisoning from agricultural chemicals resulting in 8,620 deaths, 12.2 percent of all those succumbing to such poisoning. In 1993, some 51,283 persons in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities were found to have been poisoned with 6,156 of them dying, making up 12 percent of all those poisoned. According to experts, some 60 percent of all such poisoning cases had gone unreported. In the mid-eighties, there were many cases of such poisoning. The authorities in some provinces organized teams to prevent and treat such poisoning and educated peasants about how to use agricultural chemicals, reducing the occurrence of such poisoning. After 1987, the shortage of funds and a drop in the number of professional staff responsible for prevention and guidance work saw an increase in the number of people affected by such poisoning. The number of peasants using agricultural chemicals increased to over 100 million households made up of 200 to 300 million individuals, leading to an increase in the number of people suffering from such poisoning.
