FR940112-1-00003 FR940112-1-00001 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion Service history of certain Piper Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes reveals several occurrences of cracked main landing gear (MLG) trunnions. Five of these occurrences resulted when the left MLG trunnion, part number (P/N) 67926&hyph;12, separated from Piper Model PA34&hyph;200T airplanes during the landing roll. Further investigation revealed that the left MLG collapsed because of a transverse fracture in the trunnion at the rear web lower end fillet. Metallurgical examination of four of these MLG trunnions further disclosed that the fractures originated from very shallow fatigue cracks originating from several areas along the rear surface at the lower end of the fillet web. The length of these fatigue cracks ranged from .20 to .40 inches. Piper has issued Service Bulletin (SB) 787B, dated August 25, 1993, which specifies procedures for inspecting the MLG trunnions on certain Piper Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes, and references replacing MLG trunnions with parts of improved design. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane damage. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Piper Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the main landing gear trunnions for cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually replacing the landing gear trunnions with parts of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirement. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with Piper SB No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. The proposed replacement would be accomplished in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual.
