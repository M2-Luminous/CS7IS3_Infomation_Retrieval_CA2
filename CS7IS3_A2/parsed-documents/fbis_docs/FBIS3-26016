The article cited Deng Xiaoing's remarks made in October 1987 saying "poorness is not socialism, and being too slow in development is also not socialism," Deng Xiaoing's talks during his southern inspection tour, and Deng Xiaoping's remarks saying "whether China can resist the pressure of hegemonism and power politics and firmly adhere to our socialist system, the key lies in whether we can gain a relatively fast speed in growth and realize our development strategy or not." The article cites rapid economic growth during period from 1984 to 1988, in which the average annual growth of industrial output was 21.7 percent. The article says the speed stressed by Deng Xiaoping is different from the speed stressed during the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958. It says Deng Xiaoping has drawn a bitter lesson from the "Great Leap Forward" and attached importance to quality and efficiency in seeking development speed. Deng Xiaoping has always linked accelerating development with deepening reform and further opening up and called for turning science and technology into productive forces. In conclusion, the article says such speed as advocated by Deng Xiaoping is a genuine and sustained speed which can promote China's economic development amid widespread recession in the world.
