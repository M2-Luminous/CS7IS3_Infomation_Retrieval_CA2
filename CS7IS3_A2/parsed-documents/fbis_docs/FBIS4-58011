This, in all light, would provoke an institutional crisis that would prevent Balaguer, should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling the country beginning on 16 August, date scheduled for the change of government. After the 16 May general elections, Pena Gomez made accusations of a massive fraud in favor of Balaguer, who is seeking reelection to a seventh term. According to Pena Gomez, the JCE Computer Center and at least two of its five magistrates planned the fraud through a computer maneuver that left about 200,000 citizens, who could not vote and were replaced by others "who voted twice," off from the voting list In statements to the media, Pena Gomez said that if Balaguer is proclaimed the winner before clarifying the serious irregularities that were denounced, his deputies, senators, and mayors will not take office. With only eight voting tables pending count, Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez, but by only 1 percent of the votes, that is, about 30,000. Should this trend be repeated in the vote count for deputies, senators, and mayors, where the PRD [Dominican Revolutionary Party] could win a majority, Balaguer might be unable to rule, because the congressional chambers would not be operational. "No winner has been proclaimed and cannot be proclaimed, but if they try to do so, they should know that there would be an illegitimate government in place, which we will combat by all means," Pena Gomez said. "We will not legalize any usurper," added the black Social Democratic leader in a vigorous tone. Pena Gomez has so far prevented street demonstrations by his followers, in an effort to avoid any violence, and has shown impartiality, an image that contrasts with the one that the official party tried to sell during the electoral campaign. Pena Gomez said that in the past hours, he has received solidarity calls from Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, and Portuguese President Mario Soares. He added that he will send missions to Europe and America to show that his charges are based on reality. Meanwhile, various sectors of Dominican society started to demand a solution to the crisis through an agreement between the various political forces and President Balaguer.
