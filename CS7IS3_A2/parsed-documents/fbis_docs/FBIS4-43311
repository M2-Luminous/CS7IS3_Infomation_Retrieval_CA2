FBIS4-43311 "drweu114__a94014" FBIS-WEU-94-114-A Daily Report 14 June 1994 ANNEX Germany Greens Still See Chance for Government With SPD Greens Still See Chance for Government With SPD AU1306122894 Hamburg DPA in German 0956 GMT 13 Jun 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1306122894 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Alliance 90/Greens regard their success in the European election as signalling the wish of many people for a political change in the FRG. On Monday [13 June] Executive Committee spokeswoman Marianne Birthler and Executive Committee spokesman Ludger Volmer called on the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to declare itself in favor of a clear reform policy, in order jointly to replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition in the Bundestag election. The chances for Red-Green in the government have not yet been missed, it was stated. "We hope that the SPD will still make it," Volmer stated before journalists in Bonn. His party will continue to put pressure on the Social Democrats -- "Rudolf Scharping will not get rid of us." The Greens have finally established themselves as the third political force in Germany, he said. It is true that SPD Chairman Scharping is the loser of the European election. However, Kohl continues to be the main opponent. He alone benefits from false promises and vague fears of the people. He does not have any recipes for overcoming the problems of the future. This has to be made even clearer to the voters in the next few months, also by the Social Democrats, who must not adjust to Kohl's policy any longer. "There is a need for a tough opposition to Kohl's government" -- if necessary, the Greens will "also fight for the SPD." Claudia Roth, European frontrunner of the Greens, warned the Christian Democrats against taking the party of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi into their European parliamentary group. In this way, the ban on the right-wing extremists by the democratic parties in Europe would be undermined, she said.
