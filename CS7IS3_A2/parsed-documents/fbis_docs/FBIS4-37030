Subhi Nijm al-'Ani, director general of the Electricity Department said that ensuring constant electrical current depends on citizens' cooperation with the technical organs through rationing consumption of electrical power and avoiding unnecessary consumption or unjustified extravagance. He said such intentional extravagance in electricity consumption includes switching on a large number of lights in gardens and houses, which wastes a great deal of energy and encroaches on the rights of others. He said the best type of light for rationing electricity is the neon light because it consumes less energy and gives more light.
