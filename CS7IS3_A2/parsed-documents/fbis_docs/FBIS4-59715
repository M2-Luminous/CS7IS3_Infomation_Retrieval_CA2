The government issued a decree late Monday following the disturbances in Malakand region announcing the immediate introduction of the Sharia to replace the existing civil code. Bhutto, 40, who favours a modern and liberal interpretation of Islam, ceded to a small clerical party, Tehrik-e-Nifaz Sharia (Movement for the Introduction of Sharia), which had mobilised tens of thousands of people behind its militant religious stand. Malakand, in the northwest, is a rural and mountainous region of Pakistan, populated by Pashtuns, a heavily armed ethnic group, fiercely proud of its traditions and autonomy.
