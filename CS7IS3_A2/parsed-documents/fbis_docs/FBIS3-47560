"I have not heard yet that an agreement was reached in principle," the top government spokesman told a news conference. "I don't think we have reached an accord." Takemura's comment followed a report in Friday's edition of a leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, saying that Washington has agreed in principle to accept an action program Japan will finalize possibly on Tuesday. The action program will feature the introduction of an open bidding system for state-ordered public works projects to eliminate any discrimination against foreign participants in bidding. The U.S. has threatened to impose sanctions if Japan fails to take steps to increase the openness of its construction market and secure greater foreign access by January 20. Earlier this week, four cabinet ministers reaffirmed that the projected action plan should be designed to boost transparency, objectivity and free competition in Japan's construction market. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, meanwhile, expressed hope that Japanese and U.S. negotiators would reach an agreement in the negotiations before the January 20 deadline for possible U.S. sanctions against Japan. "Both Japan and the United States are engaged positively in negotiations and therefore sanctions will be avoided," he said. The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to endorse the action program at a cabinet session Tuesday. Government sources said the program features opening biddings for public works projects, allowing foreign contractors to participate. To be opened to foreign bidders will be national projects exceeding 700 million yen and those of local governments worth more than 2.7 billion yen, they said. The sources said Washington raised no objection to the Japanese plan during the recent informal market access negotiations in Tokyo.
