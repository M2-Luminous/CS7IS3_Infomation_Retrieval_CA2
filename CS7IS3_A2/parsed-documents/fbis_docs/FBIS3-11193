At that time, it set out to improve the basic conditions for establishing a modern agricultural sector without limitations on private property or investment. Three months later, AEA President Augusto Cilloniz Benavides says they already have a membership of 110 agriculturists. The goal is to enroll some 2,500 (or almost all those owning more than 20 hectares). In the midst of this process, the agriculturist leader describes the criteria that will guide the AEA's activities directed toward working for the modernization of infrastructure, investment, education, information, and health. The summary of his conversation with EL COMERCIO follows. Lack of Structures In addition to what has been called the problem of Peruvian agriculture -- read "financing" -- there is the lack of a business structure to coordinate the processes of planting, investing, selecting, marketing, and selling. "In the mining and fishing sectors, the Central Peru Mining Enterprise, the Peruvian Iron Mines Enterprise, and the State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency remained productive, despite being owned by the state. In agriculture, this does not apply." Thus Augusto Cilloniz Benavides, president of the Association of Peruvian Agriculturists, sums up his thoughts on the problems of the agricultural sector. According to Cilloniz, the origins of the decline in agriculture can be studied, for example, in the experience of the sugar mill companies. "They were forced to become cooperatives, and now they do not have the support for efficient operations," he said. The agriculture leader said that 90 percent of sugar production is in the hands of small proprietors who have lost the capacity to maintain a business structure. This has resulted in the destruction of the irrigation, farm machinery, and marketing systems infrastructures, as well as the destruction of companies involved in agriculture. Financing Is a Matter of Real Guarantees [EL COMERCIO] Financing then is not a problem for agriculture? [Cilloniz] Yes, it is. But more than financing, the main problem is the system of financing and the real guarantees that agricultural business offers. In order to exist, credit must be managed with reasonable risk. The agriculture sector, with its low levels of productivity, its inadequate marketing systems, and its health-related problems, is a high-risk sector. Any financial institution, whether it calls itself a commercial or development bank, or a rural fund, requires a real guarantee by the farmer. It also requires technical support to assure the farmer and the bank that the loan will be well employed and the risk will be minimum. Cilloniz cites as a useful experience in dealing with the problem of guarantees the Joint Responsibility Financing, conducted in the Huaral and Canete valleys. This project consists of farmers forming associations and contributing to a fund of guarantees that enables them to deal with any unforeseen circumstances that befall any of the members. There Are Several Levels of Agriculture There is no single agriculture sector, but rather three levels or sublevels with different problems and possibilities. The first is the level attained by export crops, which already have an assured market. They generally possess technical support provided by the exporting firms. According to Cilloniz, these farmers have no "serious problems." The second level is composed of industrial crops whose prices are quoted on the international commodities markets. Included in this category are, for example, coffee, corn, rice, cotton, and sorghum. Their principal characteristic is that the demand for them is known. If these products are managed in a technically adequate manner, the risk is only moderate and they are creditworthy. In addition, companies participate in the management, such as those that purchase textiles, in the case of cotton, for example. The problems arise at the third level, for peasants in subsistence agriculture who grow tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, and some of the fruit normally produced for the domestic market. In agriculture as in any other productive activity, the market should determine the final price. However, the very poor condition of wholesale markets prevents that rule from taking affect. As a result, the AEA believes it is necessary to complete construction of the Santa Anita market, so that farmers will have a suitable place to market their products. The Agrarian Funds Have Only Fulfilled Their Social Welfare Role If the problems are concentrated in subsistence agriculture, the AEA believes that the Agrarian Funds have been limited to a social role. The purpose of the credits extended by the Agrarian Funds has been purely social. The problem is that there is a very low rate of loan repayment and inadequate management of lines of credit. Therefore, AEA proposes that the role of the state be intensified in the areas of research and plant disease, as investment conditions in agriculture are evident. [EL COMERCIO] Is it good business to invest in agriculture? [Cilloniz] There is no such thing as good or bad business, only good and bad businessmen. Cilloniz thus assures us that if a farmer knows how to purchase his supplies, sows with the help of technical assistance, and negotiates with buyers, and if the marketing infrastructure improves, that farmer is certain to get good results. [Box, p B16] "One of the sectors that will grow most in coming years is agriculture, basically because we are starting out from a very low base, because everything is to be developed anew, and because we have rejoined the financial world.... I think we will grow even more than Chile, because we have more resources than they do," says AEA President Augusto Cilloniz on the future of agriculture. [Box, p B16] Five Short-Term Proposals The AEA announced that its activities in future years will be directed toward five principal areas. 1. Marketing Systems -- Modernize marketing. -- Standardize packaging and canning. 2. Information Systems -- Disseminate systematically all the information already available that is needed by farmers, for example, that information produced by the Office of Agrarian Information of the Ministry of Agriculture. 3. Health Measures -- An agreement with the National Agrarian Health System and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture to initiate programs leading to the elimination of the "fruit fly," the "pink worm," and Aftosa fever, which create obstacles to agricultural exports. 4. Technical Support for Farmers -- An agreement with the IPAE [Peruvian Institute of Business Administration] for the creation of agriculture-livestock technical institutes to prepare mid-level technicians to participate in agricultural productive processes. 5. Investment -- Direct the interest of investors in agriculture so that they will establish contact with agricultural businessmen, either in associations or as individuals, who produce for export. -- Intensify investment in the production of lemons, tangerines, melons, alligator pears, garlic, and onions, for export.
