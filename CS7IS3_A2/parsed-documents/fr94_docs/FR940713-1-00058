FR940713-1-00058 FR940713-1-00013 Swank and Teer (1989) indicated the historical range of the jaguar included portions of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. These authors consider the current range to occur from central Mexico through Central America and into South America as far as northern Argentina. They stated that the United States no longer contains established breeding populations, which probably disappeared from the United States in the 1960s. They also maintained that the jaguar prefers a warm tropical climate, is usually associated with water, and is only rarely found in extensive arid areas. Brown (1983) presented an analysis suggesting there was a resident breeding population of jaguars in the southwestern United States at least into the 20th century. The Service (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990) recognized that the jaguar continues to occur in the American Southwest as an occasional wanderer from Mexico. Previous Federal Action The jaguar is listed as endangered from the U.S. and Mexico border southward to include Central and South America (37 FR 6476, March 30, 1972; 50 CFR 17.11, July 15, 1991). The species was originally listed as endangered in accordance with the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969 (ESCA). Pursuant to the ESCA, two separate lists of endangered wildlife were maintained, one for foreign species and one for species native to the United States. The jaguar appeared only on the List of Endangered Foreign Wildlife. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act superseded the ESCA. The foreign and native lists were replaced by a single ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife,'' which was first published in the Federal Register on September 26, 1975 (40 FR 44412&hyph;44429). On July 25, 1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 43705) stating that, through an oversight in the listing of the jaguar and six other endangered species, the United States populations of these species were not protected by the Act. The notice asserted that it was always the intent of the Service that all populations of the seven species deserved to be listed as endangered, whether they occurred in the United States or in foreign countries. Therefore, the notice stated that the Service intended to take action as quickly as possible to propose inclusion of the United States portions of the species' range for listing. On July 25, 1980, the Service published a proposed rule (45 FR 49844&hyph;49847) to list the jaguar and four of the other species referred to above in the United States. The proposal for listing the jaguar and three other species was withdrawn on September 17, 1982 (47 FR 41145). The notice issued by the Service stated that the Act mandated withdrawal of proposed rules to list species that have not been finalized within 2 years of the proposal. On August 3, 1992, the Service received a petition from the instructor and students of the American Southwest Sierra Institute and Life Net to list the jaguar ( Panthera onca ) as endangered in the United States. The petition was dated July 26, 1992. Two subspecies of jaguar ( P. o. arizonensis and P. o. veraecrucis ) are recognized as occurring in the United States. Therefore both subspecies are encompassed by this proposed rule to revise the listed range of Panthera onca . On April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19216&hyph;19220), the Service published a finding that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted and requested public comments and biological data on the status of the jaguar. Section 4(b)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to reach a final decision on any petition accepted for review within 12 months of its receipt. This proposal constitutes the final finding on the petitioned action.
