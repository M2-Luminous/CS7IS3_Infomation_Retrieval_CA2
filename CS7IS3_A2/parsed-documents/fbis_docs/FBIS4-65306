The two leaders were meeting in Indianapolis, where Mr Clinton was unveiling a monument to assassination victims John Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Mr Reynolds was expected to discuss with the President a list of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, about the Downing Street peace declaration. Sinn Fein submitted the list to Mr Reynolds earlier this week and it was then in turn relayed to London. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew has said he will publish the list soon -- together with Britain's response. However, Ulster Unionists are suspicious of the Sinn Fein move, fearing it is another attempt at persuading Britain to clarify the declaration -- something John Major and Sir Patrick have consistently refused to do. A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Sir Patrick had not ruled out answering specific questions about the declaration, but still insisted it was not up for negotiation. Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, today warned that any answering of the questions by Britain would amount to clarification. He added: "Here once again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government that tells us one thing and does another. It is a Government that cannot be trusted. "Rewarding gunmen and bombers is not a proper way for a Government, especially Her Majesty's Government, to be behaving." Mr Robinson, MP for Belfast East, also criticised the Irish Government for acting as "postmen by appointment to the Provisional IRA". Sinn Fein's questions are believed to centre on the precise way forward proposed by the Britain and Ireland if the IRA ends its campaign of violence. Mr Reynolds has made it clear he sees the Sinn Fein approach as offering new hope of success for the declaration he and Mr Major signed in Downing Street last December. For his part, Mr Clinton, who requested today's talks, is anxious to be fully briefed on the latest Northern Ireland position ahead of an imminent visit to Britain. Mr Reynolds, who is due back in Dublin on Monday, is planning to deal with the Ulster issue in a speech in Indiana tomorrow when he is due to receive an an honourary degree from Notre Dame university. He said on his arrival in the US that Sinn Fein's questions should be dealt with "as soon as possible" to permit the peace process to move ahead.
