The disguise was perfect: In the winter months, he was studying to become a skiing instructor. In a number of winter holiday resorts, this smart ``sunny boy'' was a welcome visitor. He also traveled regularly to Vienna and Lower Austria. Everywhere he was received by ``friends,'' who waited for his deliveries. The man from Rotterdam had intensive contacts with Austrian drug dealers. He sold them hashish that he heat-sealed in plastic bags, hid in the gasoline tank of his car, and smuggled into Austria. Over the past two years, Eric de Zwart smuggled at least 38 kg of hashish worth 4 million schillings from the Netherlands to Austria. He has now been arrested by Lower Austrian criminal police officers at the Walserberg highway border crossing, carrying 4 kg of cannabis resin. Eric de Zwart was to have handed over the drugs to an Austrian dealer at the highway restaurant in Mondsee. No information on his contacts has been revealed. Detailed investigations are under way.
