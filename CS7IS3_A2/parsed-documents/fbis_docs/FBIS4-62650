Associations Give Up State-Owned Status `Not To Expose Themselves'"] [Text] A protocol of intentions has been signed with representatives of all eight Russian interregional associations -- Central Russia, the North-West, the Chernozem zone, the Siberian Accord, the Association of North Caucasian Krays and Oblasts, the Greater Volga, the Urals Regional Association, and the Far Eastern Association. According to Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko, "the country's leaders have paid dearly for their misconception that authority is concentrated in Moscow alone." Mr. Shumeyko reaffirmed that from now on the federal authorities will see interregional associations as "an equal subject of regional politics and a participant in all talks." The protocol that was signed calls for a cooperation treaty to be negotiated between the federal parliament and the associations, which, as the interregional association leaders expect, will be followed by the adoption of "a law on interregional cooperation" in which the associations will have a key role to play. Moreover, Vladimir Shumeyko hinted at the possibility of conferring "a state- legal status" on the associations. The discussion on substance was held in strict secrecy from the press. Aleksandr Danusiya, general director of the Central Russia association, told your SEGODNYA correspondent that "most association chiefs categorically opposed the proposal to finance them from the budget." "First, because this would necessitate accounting..." But the main reason for the interregional association chiefs' reluctance to assume "state status," Aleksandr Danusiya acknowledged, is that "one should not rush into the idea of enlarging the associations..." He is certain that "the associations are a prototype of a future management structure, but when they can become such -- in 10-15 years or in two years -- will depend on the situation..." However, even at this stage interregional association leaders call themselves "the sole body that can coordinate and actually implement all decisions on the ground." For instance, according to Anatoliy Dolgolaptev, coordinator of the Council of Interregional Associations, "the adoption of the 1993 privatization program was delayed so long precisely because we disagreed with it, and it was finally passed only after appropriate amendments were made." The Federation Council speaker is so far inclined to take a fairly ironical view on the possible evolution of interregional associations into government structures. If Federation components are enlarged and the 89 components are merged into eight (according to the current number of associations), then the Federation Council will consist of only 16 members, and it will be easier to work with them," [quotation marks as published] Shumeyko joked at a news conference after the protocol was signed, noting, however, that "this joke may have a grain of truth in it."
