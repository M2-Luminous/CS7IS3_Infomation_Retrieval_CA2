According to Arafat's proposal, Hamas has been offered to share the administration of Gaza and Jericho with al-Fatah, the PLO's mainstream organization, 'Abu Hamdan said. He told IRNA that Hamas leaders had turned down the proposal and instead called on the PLO chairman to rejoin the Palestinian nation and continue the armed struggle to liberate Palestine. He refuted some western press allegations that Hamas was conditionally ready to participate in Gaza-Jericho self-rule plan and said, "We believe that Gaza-Jericho has not been liberated but rather the area which covers only two percent of whole Palestinian territory, has turned into a protectorate of the Zionist regime." 'Abu Hamdan said that Hamas will never accept the plan, because it is a Satanic plot aimed at guaranteeing security of the Zionists and occupying the region economically. Asked about an alternative formula acceptable to Hamas, he said that based on the past experiences territories taken by force should be recaptured by force and that negotiations with the Zionists meant selling out the rights of Palestinian nation to them.
