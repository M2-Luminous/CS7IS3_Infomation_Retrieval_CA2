Since 1991, approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas have been sold on domestic markets each year. That is the equivalent of $600 million. (Most of the oil and gas is imported from Zone II markets.) In previous years, the state made the Oil and Gas General Corporation (Petrolimex), which is subordinate to the Ministry of Commerce, responsible for all commercial aspects, including import and distribution functions, and for providing unified support on markets nationwide. But since 1991, various corporations (such as the Oil and Gas Import-Export Corporation, the Central Petroleum Corporation, the Saigon Petrol Corporation, the Vung Tau Joint Oil and Gas Services Corporation, and the Aviation Oil and Gas Corporation) and also a number of other units and organizations in the southern provinces have been participating in commercial activities and competing against the Oil and Gas General Corporation. We realize that along with switching to a market mechanism, it is necessary to have many business entities and competition among the entities in order to prevent monopolies, give vitality to market activities, improve results, improve the quality of the commercial activities, and serve the consumers better. But what should be pointed out here is that competition on the oil and gas markets in Vietnam today is very different from this. Competition today is spontaneous and disorderly and is carried on to serve local and individual interests rather than to support production and the lives of the people. This is why the corporations and commercial organizations subject to state ownership lack wholesome competition and have failed to achieve results in importing and distributing oil and gas. There are several main problems in our country's oil and gas markets that need to be given attention: First, a number of corporations, units, and organizations engage in tax evasion (in both import and distribution activities). The state is losing both import duties and income taxes. According to regulations currently in force, the import duty on each ton of oil and gas is 40 percent of the import price, and the income tax is about 2 percent of the selling price. If a ton of imported oil and gas costs $220, the import duty is $88 (which is about 1 million dong). And if the selling price of a ton of oil and gas (approximately 1,200 liters) is 3 million dong (2,500 dong per liter times 1,200), the income tax is 60,000 dong (2 percent times 3 million dong). Thus, for every ton of oil and gas on which the taxes are not paid, the state loses 1,060,000 dong in revenues. According to statistics, of the approximately 3 million tons of oil and gas imported and sold every year in Vietnam today, the Oil and Gas General Corporation handle approximately 72 percent (about 2.16 million tons). The other corporations and commercial organizations handle approximately 28 percent (about 840,000 tons). Basically, the state can control and collect only the taxes owed by the Oil and Gas General Corporation. The state cannot control or fully collect the large percentage of the taxes owed by the other corporations and commercial organizations. Second, because of tax evasion, competition between the oil and gas enterprises is not fair. As we know, the Oil and Gas General Corporation, which is directly managed by the state, must perform two functions: it must carry on profitable operations and also provide oil and gas to support the targets, including remote locations such as the mountainous areas where transportation is difficult and expensive, at unified "ceiling prices" (without distinction between remote and nearby and difficult and easy markets). In this situation, it is obviously difficult for the the Oil and Gas General Corporation to remain dynamic and keep up with market changes, and it is hard for it to compete with other oil and gas corporations and enterprises that are not directly controlled by the state. Because they are not directly managed by the state, these corporations and commercial organizations can not only avoid paying taxes but they can also easily raise or lower oil and gas prices instead of adhering to the state's stipulated price. Actual surveys have shown that the selling price of a liter of A76 gasoline in July 1993 varied as follows: In Hanoi, a liter sold for 2,900 dong while in Danang it cost 2,500 dong. In Ho chi Minh City it cost 2,400 dong, and in Can Tho the price was 2,300 dong. Clearly, these prices do not reflect a wholesome and fair nature in commerce. The main reason for this is that many oil and gas corporations and enterprises avoid paying taxes and so they can sell their products at a price below the stipulated price. Another reason for this is that they don't have to incur expenses in transporting gasoline to distant markets. Third, because the oil and gas business lacks unified organization and management, investments have been skewed, and much capital has been wasted. It is estimated that the corporations that became involved in the oil and gas business just recently have invested more than 630 billion dong to build storehouses and to purchase means of transportation. At the same time, according to data of the Oil and Gas General Corporation, the existing storehouse system and means of transportation are adequate to satisfy the needs for storing and transporting all the oil and gas needed. In order to solve the above problems, in my view, the following measures should be implemented: 1. The state must implement a mechanism to reestablish order in the oil and gas markets with respect to imports and internal distribution. The question is: On what viewpoints should this order be reestablish? In order to reestablish order, on one hand, there must be many commercial subjects to compete with and stimulate each other in order to improve commercial results and quality and to satisfy the varied needs of consumers. On the other hand, in terms of mechanisms, the state must have concrete and binding stipulations on commercial functions and responsibilities and commercial locations (nearby and remote) for each oil and gas business subordinate to the state sector. At the same time, commercial activities, from importing to distributing oil and gas within the country, must be monitored closely and tax evasion must be opposed in order to increase budget revenues. Based on this, fair competition must be ensured between the various types of subjects. This means that in all circumstances, to hit the state's macrocosmic targets of collecting the taxes in full and stabilizing the markets, market safety and civilization must be maintained based on the principle of "ensuring national interests and not interfering directly in the commercial activities of the primary-level economic units." The oil and gas business must be maintained based on a state-controlled market mechanism. There must be flexible coordination between commercialization of prices and oil and gas "ceiling price" management on markets nationwide. 2. In order to ensure that state control of the oil and gas sphere is effective, the immediate thing is to reorganize the system of oil and gas corporations and units and not to have too many oil and gas import centers or too many oil and gas import corporations and enterprises as at present. At a level of 3 million tons of oil and gas a year, we need only about four commercial subjects. This is a sector in which in the state monopolizes business. Thus, units and individuals cannot be allowed to "dominate" business and run after profits alone. In reality, the oil and gas subjects used to have a close relationship, but because they are subordinate to many different organizations, they compete for profits. On the other hand, the organizational system has many intermediary echelons and is dispersed, and this has created many difficulties for oil and gas activities throughout the country. In order to overcome this situation, the state's macrocosmic management mechanism with respect to the oil and gas sector must be changed. First of all, oil and gas prices must be stipulated based on having "ceiling prices by region" and stimulating the corporations in remote areas, particularly the mountain areas. Through this, it will be possible to bring about fairness in business and differentiate commercial areas (near and far) based on stimulating things using prices. In cases in which a subject must carry out both commercial tasks and political and social tasks, the state must implement concrete policies on prices, particularly for transportation expenses for long trips. 3. Viewpoints must be renovated, and forms for participating in domestic oil and gas activities must be expanded for the economic elements. Should the "dealer" form, in which foreign economic elements can open dealerships to sell oil and gas to the oil and gas corporations of the state, be used? Based on the experiences of Malaysia, of the 385 state oil and gas enterprises, Petronas, the state oil and gas corporation, has directly invested in only seven of 7 of the enterprises in order to provide a model and gain experience in managing and guiding things. The other 378 businesses are all dealerships. Using the "dealership" form has the following effects: Adaptations to changes in the oil and gas market can be made quickly, trading periods are longer, and sellers are tied more closely to the business because it is more profitable. The staff can be reduced quite a bit. For example, the Zone 1 Oil and Gas Corporation presently has 70 stations with more than 500 employees selling oil and gas retail. Altogether, the corporation employs 1,300 people. If the dealership form is used, this staff can certainly be reduced by about 30 percent. This will put a stop to the negative aspects and corruption in the retail sale of oil and gas, because there will be unanimity between dealers and commercial interests. The above effects will improve the commercial results of each station and of the entire oil and gas sector in our country. Naturally, there must be a mechanism to manage the dealers, and the state oil and gas corporations must directly manage the dealerships with respect to the technical aspects.
