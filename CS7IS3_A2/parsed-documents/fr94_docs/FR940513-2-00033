FR940513-2-00033 FR940513-2-00020 Entre states that facilities associated with the proposed 25.6 Bcf storage project will consist of a 6.5-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline connected to Texas Eastern, 7 injection/withdrawal wells, compression of about 12,000 horsepower and appurtenant facilities. Entre says that if it elects to pursue the 41 Bcf storage project, it will propose to increase the size of 16-inch diameter pipeline to 24 inches and will increase total compression to 21,400 horsepower. Entre has proposed market-based rates for all of its services. Entre maintains that it lacks market power for the proposed storage services and that granting it the authority to utilize market-based rates would be consistent with Commission action in other cases. However, Entre does propose to retain 2.2 percent of injected volumes as a fuel reimbursement. Entre also proposes to add the Annual Charge Adjustment to the negotiated base rate of its various proposed charges. Entre says that the construction of storage-related facilities is scheduled to commence later in 1994. Therefore, Entre requests that the Commission expedite the processing of this application and grant the requested authorization by July 29, 1994, to permit the commencement of service during the 1994&hyph;1995 heating season.

[Docket No. CP94&hyph;459&hyph;000] Take notice that on May 2, 1994, Appalachian Gas Sales, Inc. (AGS), 333 N. Fairfax Street, Suite 300, Alexandria, Va. 22314, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;459&hyph;000 a complaint pursuant to Rule 206 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure against Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf). AGS states that Columbia Gulf has unduly discriminated against them by erroneously allocating their gas to a third party, Centran Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy on 1/2/93. In addition, AGS claims that Columbia Gulf's refusal to remedy the misallocation creates an undue preference in their favor, all as more fully set forth in the complaint which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The interruptible transportation service that Columbia Gulf performs for AGS is provided under Columbia Gulf's blanket certificate pursuant to part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. AGS states that the Commission, pursuant to its authority under Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), should direct Columbia Gulf to remedy the discrimination prejudice, and preference against AGS. Specifically AGS claims that Columbia Gulf's arbitrary allocation of gas on a pro rata basis between two shippers at a receipt point was not authorized in its tariff. AGS states that Columbia Gulf refused to accept a good faith reallocation request, tendered outside the time period provided under section 6(b)(3) of Rate Schedule ITS&hyph;1, while granting out-of-time reallocation requests for other shippers. AGS requests that the Commission order Columbia Gulf to reallocate all volumes of gas delivered for AGS's account during October 1992. AGS claims that Columbia Gulf has provided itself with a preference at AGS's expense by arbitrarily allocating AGS's gas to a third party in order to reduce its exposure as an unsecured creditor in the Centran Corporation bankruptcy. Comment date: June 6, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 3. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co.
