The present stage is crucial, says the article. As the country's traditional highly centralized economic system is being dismantled and a market economy is shaping up, economic management is undergoing changes. Different forms of ownership now co-exist, with State-owned industries playing a dominant role. Market forces are deciding the distribution of materials and output of enterprises. The government is using economic and legal measures instead of the traditional mandatory plans to regulate the country's economy. However, as conflicts and friction between the old and new economic systems frequently occur, the achievements gained by reform are being nibbled away by negative elements. One of the most eye-catching problems is that some government administrative organizations are involved in running businesses, causing chaos in management, incurring losses of State properties, widening the income gap and bringing about corruption. Meanwhile, enterprises are often ordered, under different pretexts, to pay various funds, fees and donations. Random collection of funds, coupled with the boom in non-governmental financial institutions, is burdening the reforms because China still lacks laws and regulations to standardize economic and financial activities. The article in China Business Times says it is time to solve the major problems in the reform and set up a sound economic relationship. Successful reform measures should be continued and new packages should be drafted and put into effect in line with the new circumstances, says the article. At the same time, the reform should be given more theoretical direction. Traditional exploratory measures are not enough. The article says that China's economic reform has experienced two stages in the past 15 years. During the first stage, between 1979 and 1984, the country tried hard to find reasonable measures for economic reform. While the exploration proved fruitful, many new problems emerged and mistakes were made due to the lack of experience. The second stage, between 1985 and 1991, witnessed the co-existence of exploratory measures and policy direction. Now it is time that the country map out more policies to guide the reform efficiently and equitably, the article says. Overall policies should be introduced for the establishment of the socialist market economy. When mapping out new reform packages, market needs and China's distinctive features should be taken as the major concerns. The article said the country's reform policies carried out in the past 15 years mainly originated from the practice of the masses. The two significant examples were the rural family contract responsibility system and the shareholding system for transferring management of State-owned enterprises, says the article. As the reform deepens, policy guidance has become increasingly important. At the same time, it is urgent that the legal system be perfected.
