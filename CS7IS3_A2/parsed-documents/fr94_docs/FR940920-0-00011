FR940920-0-00011 FR940920-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 918 Louisiana Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving, with additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the Louisiana regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Louisiana program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Louisiana proposed revisions to the Louisiana Surface Mining Regulations (LSMR) pertaining to revegetation success standards for tree and shrub stocking on lands with a postmining land use of forestry. The amendment specifies revegetation success standards for final bond release on reclaimed lands developed for forestry. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James H. Moncrief Telephone: (918) 581&hyph;6430. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Louisiana Program On October 10, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Louisiana program. General background information on the Louisiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Louisiana program can be found in the October 10, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 67340). Subsequent actions concerning Louisiana's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 918.15 and 918.16. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated May 3, 1994, Louisiana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348). Louisiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provision of its regulatory program that Louisiana proposed to revise was LSMR 53123.B.4.a, standards for success of revegetation at final bond release on reclaimed lands developed for forestry. In the May 26, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 27252), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment, provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. 348.02). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on June 27, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of LSMR 53123.B.4.a, revegetation success standards for tree and shrub stocking on lands with a postmining land use of forestry. OSM notified Louisiana of the concerns by letter dated July 11, 1994 (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.10). In a letter dated August 16, 1994, Louisiana responded that (1) it would not, at this time, submit revisions in response to OSM's July 11, 1994, issue letter, and (2) OSM should proceed with the publishing of the final rule Federal Register notice (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.11). III. Director's Findings As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds, with additional requirements, that the proposed program amendment submitted by Louisiana on May 3, 1994, is no less effective than the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment. 1. LSMR 53123.B.4.a, Standards for Success of Revegetation at Final Bond Release on Reclaimed Lands Developed for Forestry. a. Revegetation success standards for tree stocking and ground cover. Louisiana proposed to revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a to require that prior to final bond release there shall be 450 well-distributed free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood trees per acre of the same age, and that countable stems shall be a minimum of 3 years old. At proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a, Louisiana defined ``well-distributed'' to mean uniform stockings levels over an entire planting site, and ``free-to-grow'' to mean pine seedlings or saplings without significant hardwood competition, competing vegetation shades the pine's crown on less than 30 percent of the crown's circumference, and the pines are judged to have better than a 90 percent chance of capturing a place in the crown canopy.
