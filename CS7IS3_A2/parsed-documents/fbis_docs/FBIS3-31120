In addition to fierce tank and infantry attacks, the chetniks for the first time used helicopters on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau. Our soldiers are repelling all attacks, at the same time inflicting losses in manpower on the chetniks and letting them know that they will never subdue these areas. While the members of the 5th Corps bleed for the ninth consecutive day as they struggle against the combined enemy of the Muslim people -- the Serbo-Montenegrin aggressor -- the members of the paramilitary forces of the so-called autonomous province of western Bosnia have attacked -- in a cowardly and devious manner -- the members of the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army in the region of (?Dodig) [words indistinct]. One of our soldiers was wounded, while three were tied up and taken to Velika Kladusa. This act has elicited more bitterness among the members of the 5th Corps and the local population, who say that they would all rather die than allow the implementation of the autonomists' or the chetniks' plans.
