FR940922-2-00049 FR940922-2-00024 K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co., Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff September 16, 1994. Take notice that on September 13, 1994, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. (KNI) filed a Revised Tariff Filing. In this tariff filing, KNI has proposed revisions reflecting inadvertently omitted tariff language and typographical errors. In addition, after reviewing the effectiveness of the restructured tariff language since October 1, 1993, (KNI's restructuring implementation date), KNI realized that certain changes were necessary and, therefore, is proposing several substantive changes described more fully in the tariff filing. KNI states that copies of the revised tariff sheets were appended to KNI's application. KNI states that all interested parties have been served with this filing as well as affected public bodies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.21 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such petitions or protests should be filed on or before September 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
