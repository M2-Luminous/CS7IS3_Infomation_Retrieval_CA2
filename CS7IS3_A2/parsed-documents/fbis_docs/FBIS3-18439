That Helmut Kohl is entering his last battle is certain; he has said often enough that he wanted to know it once more. It would be more than a miracle in many respects if it were to become his last victory. Never before in the history of the FRG has a government party entered an election campaign under such miserable conditions. Since Helmut Kohl came to power, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] has lost more and more votes from one election to the next in western Germany. This is true even for the seemingly triumphant unity election of 1990; then it was only the exuberant expectations of eastern Germans that made the result appear more favorable for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. Yet four years later, Kohl no longer can count on this special bonus. On the contrary, eastern Germany will have a significant negative impact on the CDU's 1994 election balance. Never before in the history of the FRG was a chancellor given a full mandate four times in a row. When Konrad Adenauer ran for the fourth time in 1961 -- which, by the way, was also preceded by a dramatic miscalculation regarding the election of the federal president -- the main reason the government alliance won a majority again was that one of the coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], had promised the voters with great success regarding the subsequent support: with the CDU, but without Adenauer. Hence, the "old man" had to put up with a humiliating election capitulation: He was only allowed to stay in power for another two years. A look back into tradition shows that the fourth legislative term requires a particularly compelling justification. Yet where should it be found? After 12 years in power, what new things would a government still have to offer? How should a government head be ready to achieve what he failed to do three times before -- and all that in view of the enormous effects of wear and tear of such an office? In the case of Kohl, one must add that, politically, even a miraculous victory in the Bundestag election would only lead into a dead-end street. By then the CDU will, in great likelihood, have lost its majority in two laender in eastern Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will have gained a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag. Thus, Kohl is entering a battle he cannot win even if he succeeds but, at the most, he can achieve a nerve-killing blockade. Is it worth at all to fight for that? Helmut Kohl -- and this could also be seen from his appearance at the Hamburg CDU Congress -- responds to this impossible challenge with a breakneck mixture of cool realism and sheer loss of reality. In this situation, he is exclusively banking on the one thing that he never had: the bonus of the chancellor. This self-entreatment has been so breathtaking that even his eternal critic, Heiner Geissler -- one of the few who neither has anything to lose nor can immediately profit -- said in sarcastic admiration and with a lot of chutzpah: "Only he who is impressed by himself is able to impress others." Le parti, c'est moi -- The party, that is I: It was in this sense that Helmut Kohl so successfully reduced the CDU to his own person, that now -- so much for his realism -- he is really only able to rely on himself. The phalanx of secretaries general whom he personally selected and dropped again is a symbol for this process: from Biedenkopf to Geissler, Ruehe, and Peter Hintze, who is absolutely unable to fulfill this task. Yet the brutal realism of Helmut Kohl also includes the understanding that none of those who the chancellor and party chairman dropped, and whose fall he was observing with delight, has so far had the guts to challenge him openly and efficiently coordinated at a party congress. This is why it was all to easy for Kohl to make a cynical appeal in Hamburg when he said: Those who want can voice their opposition at the party congress; but after it, you have to obey. End of the debate! Yet in reality -- so much for his loss of reality -- Kohl would have to rely on all of them particularly in this very situation, and particularly in their plurality and their spirit of contradiction: the Biedenkopfs, Geisslers, Suessmuths, Albrechts, Spaeths.... Helmut Kohl as Baron von Muenchhausen: It is consistent and it is pure autosuggestion into which he is fleeing. It is particularly there where he appears to be so present that he has become completely detached from reality. He is talking to spoiled people -- as if it had not been he who spoiled them in the last dozen years. He preaches the necessity to think along different lines -- as if it had not been he who gave the voters the illusion that things could remain the same even after unification. Whenever he denounces the stubborn voters, the inhabitants of the "collective leisure park," then it does not require a lot of psychological understanding to recognize the projections of a man who himself failed to understand the signs of the time. This makes one think of Bert Brecht and ask oneself whether it would not be better for the government to elect a new people. Realistically again, the chancellor follows the scent: It is time for a change. And having lost his sense of reality once more, he believes that the genuine chancellor of the change is -- he himself. The whole thing is so absurd that it really almost becomes impressive. Reality does not stand a chance against such entreatments for reality itself. Bad surveys are not taken seriously. Indeed, they themselves are based on a high number of voters who are still undecided -- who, in turn, are in their large majority part of the potential of the CDU. Besides, all the old parties have lost support. Therefore, they have to mobilize the voters -- and to play foul. That Rau used to be Kohl's favorite candidate for succeeding President Weizsaecker -- what does it matter? It is reason enough to denigrate him now. That in the Bundestag -- after all, reconciliation was the order of the day at the time -- Kohl solemnly set out to follow the footsteps of the Brandt/Scheel and Schmidt/Genscher governments in the spheres of Ostpolitik and Germany policy -- who cares? Now one has to divide the voters by using the word treason. Yet, how does somebody intend to win the future with the wrong battles of the past? At the party congress, Kohl once more managed to win the support of the delegates. Nothing else was to be expected. Yet, through his strategy of self-entreatment he managed to do better than expected. Still, to what extent can this rather internal effect be successful? One senior warrior quoted the old cliche: Without money it can never be as good as it is bad with money. Still, as of now it is no longer just the atmosphere that counts but the votes: Lower Saxony as a test election in western Germany, the European election, Saxony Anhalt as test election in eastern Germany -- all that is on the agenda even before the summer recess. Helmut Kohl is entering his final battle. Many things are unique about this campaign. Apart from the temporary personality of Kiesinger, no chancellor has been unseated in a Bundestag election. Kohl is throwing himself into this combat true to the nice slogan of the generation of '68: You do not have any chance, so use it.
