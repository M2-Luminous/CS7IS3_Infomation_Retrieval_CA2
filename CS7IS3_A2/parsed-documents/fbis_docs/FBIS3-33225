The rebels are allegedly creating border commandos to operate along the border separating Venezuela and Colombia. "I have no idea what the reports are based on and I am going to ask where they are coming from. This is all based on supposition," he said. The Colombian daily EL TIEMPO said that certain documents seized from the ELN indicate that the rebel group, with the support of Venezuelan merchants, is trying to create a permanent military force. Their purpose is to intensify their terrorist strategy in Colombia against the state and against Japanese, European, and U.S. multinational corporations. The documents held by the Colombian newspaper, describing the guerrilla organization's military plans and the support they receive from Venezuelan merchants, reveal the complicity of a large chain of Venezuelan stores in the planning and execution of several kidnappings near the border for the ELN. Military intelligence analysts, quoted by the Colombian daily, indicate that the ELN formed logistics commandos, which have been channeling financial resources from Venezuela into Colombia since August 1993. The operation is coordinated by a committee the rebels call "Border Coordinators" [Coordinadores de la Frontera], which are in constant contact with the Venezuelan liaisons promoting the insurgent movement.
