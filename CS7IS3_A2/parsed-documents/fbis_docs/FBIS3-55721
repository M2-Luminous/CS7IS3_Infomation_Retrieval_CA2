Permit me first of all to deliver greetings from the president of Russia to this state authority, the State Duma. Esteemed deputies of the State Duma! The Federation Council and the State Duma of Russia today commence work. For the first time in the history of our country, the representative and legislative body has been elected on a multi-party basis in an environment of a free contest of views, positions, and philosophies. The Russian Federation parliament is beginning its work under a real division of powers, which is not only proclaimed by the Russian Constitution, but also is consistently implemented in its provisions. This is the most important condition for constructive interaction between the Federal Assembly, the president, the government, and all bodies of state in the country. Before us stands one task that unites us all: to seek decisions that take the fullest possible account of the diversity of interests that is natural in any pluralist society. A range of groups within society is represented in the current Russian parliament -- a range of sentiments and opinions in contemporary Russia are reflected here. I do not call upon you to show unanimity, but it will be difficult to save our country from upheaval without acknowledging and rallying toward shared values. These values are civic peace, stability, the unity of the country, and its renewal. We are responsible for this. Our electors live and want to live in a peaceful Russia. They desire stability and calm, and all the arms of power should not confound the aspirations of the people of Russia. We should all unite in our striving to preserve the integrity of the country, the dignity of Russia, and a sense of civic pride in our fellow countrymen. One of the major tasks facing us is to overcome the economic crisis, and to achieve a high standard of living in Russia. It is not only possible but essential to pool our efforts to resolve these problems. On the eve of the New Year, I sent a letter to every Russian parliamentarian seeking suggestions on how best for us to work together. Many of you responded and displayed an interest in cooperating. Every suggestion is being carefully examined and analyzed. I thank you, and I assure you that it is possible to conduct a civilized political dialogue that will exert a favorable influence on the situation in contemporary Russia. Ahead of you, esteemed deputies, lies a great deal of hard work. I hope that in accomplishing it, you will manifest your best human and political qualities, and that you will justify your electorate's trust, for the good of our motherland. I believe that the destiny of Russian Federation parliamentarianism will have a successful outcome. Bon voyage, esteemed deputies! Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia. [applause]
