We know even less about the reasons for the suddenly urgent visit. Therefore, we are forced to draw our conclusions from the statements of the foreign minister and his host in Belgrade and from the chance remarks made by [Prime Minister] Peter Boross in his radio interview on 29 January. What we can find out is that there has been a turn in the Hungarian Government's Yugoslav policies. The Hungarian statements suggest that the Yugoslav crisis has already been reevaluated in the secret rooms of international politics and Jeszenszky actually "forwarded the CSCE's stance" in Belgrade, in other words, he went there on a CSCE errand. This latter statement is doubtful to say the least, and there were no signs of the former up to last night. Therefore, these statements are nothing but mere self-justification. The turn was probably brought about by the fact that, in the laboratories of Hungarian foreign politics, the view that "the Serbs have won" must have become dominant, and we have to make rapid use of the favorable moment. This view already almost prevailed in early summer 1993, but it did not manage to break through, because the need to catch up with the Atlantic side was then dominant. At that time, the view in the United Nations and NATO was that Milosevic and his Belgrade are responsible for the situation in Bosnia and the Croatian Krajina -- even if the other sides in the fighting share this responsibility. This view has not changed since then. It is a different matter that the international organizations seem to be impotent, they cannot find a way to a peaceful solution, and they will not enter into a military solution. However, they are still aware of what the running amok of the grand nation-state concept could mean if, after Milosevic and the Serbian victories were approved, it was let loose. The foreign policy turn will probably be justified by the expected positive change in the situation of the Vojvodina Hungarians. The Hungarian Government is straying into an extremely dodgy area through this. The statement that Milosevic "is not averse to" the idea of territorial autonomy does not mean anything and is not worth anything. And to talk about the local assertion of democracy -- as Jeszenszky does -- is meaningless under dictatorial circumstances. For the same reason, it is impossible to appreciate the prime minister's statement that "a legitimate government is operating" there. For of all these reasons, it is also doubtful if the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] is acting wisely when it enters into bargaining with Milosevic, who is hungry for support and success, on an autonomy plan which, in its final form, may give rise to further ethnic cleansing, and can incite conflict between the national minorities even in places where peace has so far been preserved. Obviously, sooner or later, democratic order will also be established in Rump Yugoslavia. At that time, will the Hungarians be seen as the last ally of the dictatorship? Because its ethnic party committed itself to Milosevic with the active assistance of the mother country's government? It would be appropriate to think in terms of the more distant future.
