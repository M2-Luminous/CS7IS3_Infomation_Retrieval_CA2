FR941206-1-00132 FR941206-1-00012 We will accept or reject individual filings, and assess filing fees, as we do for printed filings, except that, in lieu of returning a copy of the printed form to the filer, we will provide a listing identifying each electronic filing with the monthly billing statement. In connection with the assessment and billing of fees for electronic filings, we are considering the option of allowing insurers to establish large prepaid accounts from which the filing fees would automatically be deducted. This enhancement would reduce costs to both insurers and the Commission. Once this system has been in place for a sufficient amount of time, we will review the fees charged and the appropriateness of changing them to reflect the costs associated with the new system. To obtain a copy of this notice, write to, call, or pick up in person from: Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 927&hyph;7428. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD service (202) 927&hyph;5721.] Regulatory Flexibility The rules proposed herein will not impose additional burdens on insurers; rather, they will offer insurers a new option of complying with existing requirements. While we expect the impact of the proposed rules to be beneficial, we do not anticipate it to be significant on insurers. Environmental and Energy Considerations We preliminarily conclude that the proposed action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.
