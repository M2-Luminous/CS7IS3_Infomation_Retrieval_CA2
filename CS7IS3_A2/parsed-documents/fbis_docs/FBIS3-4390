With the opening up, Beijing has called forth its new energy and vitality. Currently, the more than 10 million people of various nationalities in the city are struggling hard for all-round social and economic development in an effort to attain the well-off level in the capital three years ahead of schedule. This past year of 1993 has witnessed tremendous achievements in all construction work in Beijing. Its national economy has developed in a sustained, rapid and healthy manner [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang di xiangqian fazhan 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660 4104 0686 0467 4099 1455]. The yearly gross domestic output value reached 85.2 billion yuan, a 12 percent increase over the previous year. In agriculture, there was a good harvest for the sixteenth successive year. The growth rate in industrial output value came to 18.5 percent. The tertiary sector saw exceptionally rapid development, giving rise to an all-round flourish in commerce, tourism, finance, insurance, and real estate, as well as an upsurge of new undertakings, such as information and consulting services. An abundance of modern, high-level, commercial facilities rose straight from the ground in the city; the marketplace enjoyed brisk sales; and the total retail sales volume amounted to 5.49 billion yuan, a 27 percent increase. To meet the needs of a developing socialist market economy, large-scale trading centers for oil, tobacco, building materials, and industrial consumer goods have been set up and gone into operation one after another, resulting in an ever-greater increase in the volume of trade. The income and purchasing power of city residents also rose rapidly. An opening market has great potential,s indicative of bright prospects for development. Eye-catching changes have taken place in both urban and rural areas. Urban infrastructural construction has recorded marked progress, accomplishing a host of major projects in water, electricity, gas, heat supply, and roads and communications. In urban housing, 5.5 million square meters have been completed, initiating the "Well-Off Housing Project" aimed at improving the living conditions of city dwellers. Remarkable achievements also were made in tree planting and afforestation of the environment. Science, technology, and education registered all-round development. The comprehensive reform work in the first light industry and first commercical departments was carried out in an all-round way. State- owned large and medium-sized enterprises quickened their step in transforming management systems. The "Tianlong", "Tianqiao", "Renjie" and "Stone" bonds were floated in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong, respectively, making a new breakthrough in the trial introduction of the shareholding system. Explorations in marketplace construction, social security, transference of the right to use state-owned land, and the transformation of the management functions of government institutions were made, and positive results were achieved. The policy of opening up was implemented in unprecedented width and depth. So far the city has approved the establishment of 7,321 foreign-funded enterprises, and the number of multinational companies and international consortia that have come to invest in Beijing has multiplied. Exchanges with foreign countries in economics, culture, and science and technology have been very active. Apart from the 14 large cities in the world with which Beijing has friendly relations, it established friendly relations with the capital cities of four more countries last year, and it has kept up friendly ties with nearly 100 cities in the world. Tourists coming from outside mainland China totalled 2 million. The year 1994 is a crucial one, when Beijing will strive to attain the comparatively well-off level three years ahead of schedule and will march toward higher objectives. It is also an important year for Beijing to speed up the socialist market economy reform. In light of the goals put forward by the party's 14th national congress, the municipal government has decided on its general guiding principle, which is to emancipate our minds, firmly grasp opportunities, make breakthroughs in key projects, and advance with greater strides in reform and construction in order to achieve the well-off level ahead of the schedule. The whole city will do its utmost -- with the accessible maximum standards in view -- further to promote reform and opening up and to push forward the cause of modernization construction. First, we must carry out reform in revenue and expenditure, finance, investment, planning, and foreign trade, with the construction of a modern enterprise system and a macrocontrol system as the key; we must accelerate the establishment of the market system; and we must develop vigorously the production materials, finance, labor force, real estate, technology, and information markets, with the construction of the production materials market as the key link. We must continue to implement reform in the social security and housing systems; to further deepen reform in the countryside, with the raising of agricultural labor productivity as the goal, and with a modern agricultural enterprise system set up at the core; and to perfect reform in education and other areas. Second, we must emphasize the utilization of foreign capital and further expand the opening up. We must accelerate the growth of foreign-invested enterprises, and attempts must be made to improve the investment environment and to broaden the areas for foreign investment. We must guide foreign investment toward the construction of infrastructural facilities, toward the transformation of old and run-down housing, and toward weak links in the city's national economy. We must actively promote trade and non-trade undertakings, and must cultivate overseas enterprises energetically. We must foster domestic and foreign markets by making better use of domestic and foreign resources, and must extensively encourage international exchange. Third, we must stimulate economic growth so as to make new breakthroughs. The domestic gross industrial production value is expected to grow by 10 percent or more. We must further perfect the industrial structure. We must develop high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, and must accelerate the construction of hilly regions. We must gather our forces to develop supporting and key industries, and to enhance the overall quality of manufacturing and the modernization level. Taking advantage of Beijing's strength, we must develop the tertiary sector in a big way so as to cater to the needs of the developing market economy and to build Beijing into a modern international metropolis. According to the revised General Planning of the Municipality of Beijing, to be implemented up to the year 2010, it is imperative to speed up the construction of infrastructural facilities with utmost efforts and determination. Billions of yuan of investment will be put into electricity, transport, water supply, fuel, posts and telecommunications, totaling more than 30 large-scale key projects. We must accelerate the transformation of the old part of the city, do a good job in the "Well-Off Housing Project" in order to improve city dwellers' living conditions as quickly as possible. We must make efforts to afforest the city and protect its environment; to place education, science, and technology in a strategic position; and manage to run well the city's New Technological Industrial Experimental Zone, the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone, and other smaller industrial zones in various districts and counties; and increase investment in education through diverse channels and train more qualified personnel for the 21st century. While quickening the pace of opening up and modernization construction, it is imperative to strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and socialist civic virtue, to try to maintain and develop the current excellent situation of stability and unity, and to make unremitting efforts to achieve the grand goal of the capital city's modernization construction. We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of the entire population of the city, Beijing will march into the 21st century with a completely new face, and will join in the ranks of modernized, international metropolises.
