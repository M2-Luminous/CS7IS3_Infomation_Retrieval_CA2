FR940603-0-00066 FR940603-0-00025 Furthermore, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (title III), as amended in 1992, established the requirement for consultation between the Secretary of Commerce (NOAA) and any Federal agency proposing to undertake an activity in the vicinity of a National Marine Sanctuary that may result in adverse impacts on sanctuary resources or qualities, including private activities authorized by licenses, leases or permits. Such consultation must occur prior to initiation of the proposed activity. From the perspective of administrative structure, therefore, there are opportunities for both NMFS and NMSP to coordinate their programmatic objectives. Response: NMFS does not believe that extending the boundary of the SEUS critical habitat seaward to include the GRNMS is necessary (see Response to Comment 10). However, NMFS does agree that the Grays Reef program could provide additional monitoring of these whales, substantial support to the education and outreach objectives listed in the Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan and additional opportunities for coordinated efforts to enhance the potential for recovery of this critically endangered marine species. Comment 13: A commenter recommended that NMFS designate Delaware Bay as critical habitat for the northern right whale, stating that Delaware Bay is habitat that is representative of the historic geographical and ecological distribution of the species. Response: The criteria specified under 50 CFR 424.12 to be considered in designating critical habitat, and described in the preamble to the proposed designation, must consider the requirements of the species, including habitats that are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species. Section 3(5)(A)(ii) of the ESA states that areas outside the current geographical range of a species can be designated if the Secretary determines that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. The regulations to the ESA interpret this provision to mean that the Secretary shall designate as critical habitat areas outside the geographic area presently occupied by a species only when a designation limited to its present range would be inadequate to ensure the conservation of the species (50 CFR 424.12(c)). Even where the area is presently occupied by the species, section 3(5)(c) states that, with certain exceptions determined by the Secretary, ``critical habitat shall not include the entire geographic area which can be occupied by the *␣*␣* species.'' Although known to have been used by right whales, it is not completely understood to what extent Delaware Bay was used, or whether this area would ever have been considered critical habitat. It is known, however, that the area is now bypassed by northern right whales during their annual movements. NMFS believes that the current high-use areas are identified in this rule, but recognizes that the areas designated represent the minimal space required by right whales to ensure population growth. Designating Delaware Bay as critical habitat would not enhance the likelihood of recovery for this species. If evidence to the contrary becomes available, critical habitat boundaries can be modified. Comment 14: Several commenters did not oppose the designation of the critical habitat designation for the northern right whale, but were concerned with the ``general'' language of the proposed designation and felt there was no real need for it. Rather, they felt that a public awareness program for shipping interests is sufficient. They further expressed concern that the language of the preamble to the proposed designation stating that ``habitats will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations'' would become a vehicle to attack offshore dredge disposal and port expansion. The commenters requested that NMFS reconsider the need for the proposed designation as it applies to the southern coastal area, given that there is already an active task force working to prevent collisions between vessels and the northern right whale and that the other protections of the ESA still apply. Finally, one of the commenters wanted the channel, fairways to sea lanes, disposal sites, access routes to disposal sites and nearshore berm areas in the SEUS to be excluded from the critical habitat designation. The commenter noted that these areas can be excluded if the overall benefits of exclusion outweight the benefits of designation, unless the exclusion results in the extinction of the species. Response: Federal agencies active within the range of the northern right whales are already required to consult with NMFS regarding projects and activities that may affect the species pursuant to section 7 of the ESA. Federal agencies are required to evaluate their activities with respect to northern right whales and to consult with NMFS prior to engaging in any action that may affect the critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not likely to result in its destruction or adverse modification. Regarding the SEUS critical habitat specifically, these actions are being reviewed by the Southeast Implementation Team, through section 7 consultations and agreements already in place, and through the expanded efforts of the Implementation Team to reach the private and public sectors. Finally, frequent travel by commercial vessels in these areas represents a considerable threat to northern right whales. Therefore, NMFS does not agree that corridors frequently traveled by vessels within the designated critical habitat should be excluded. Comment 15: One federal agency was concerned that the proposed designation was neither appropriate nor necessary to preserve the species. The commenter felt that the current proposal merely designates areas of highest concentration of the whales and lists their characteristics, rather than considers the physical or biological features that are essential to the conservation of the species. To warrant critical habitat designation, the commenter felt that a better understanding of the species' biological and physical requirements is needed.
