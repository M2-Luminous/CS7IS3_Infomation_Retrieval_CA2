FR940816-2-00122 FR940816-2-00086 11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these standards. Such compliance standards will require that all investors eligible to purchase shares of any class of Institutional Shares be sold only shares of a class of Institutional Shares, rather than any other class of shares offered by a Fund. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees of the Trust with respect to the Alternative Purchase Plan will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees. 13. The Funds will disclose their respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than a class of Institutional Shares, in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. If the Trust offers a class of Institutional Shares, it may offer such shares solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. Any prospectus for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares, if any, and will identify the persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The Funds will disclose their respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis, whereas each Fund's per share data will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except Institutional Shares, if any. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. Information provided by the Applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present each class of shares, except Institutional Shares, separately. 14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply Commission approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 plans or Shareholder Servicing Plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 15. If any class of shares is created with a conversion feature, such class (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class of shares (``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to maximum asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the maximum asset-based sales charge and service fee which they were subject prior to the conversion.
