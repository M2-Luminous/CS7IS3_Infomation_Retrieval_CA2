The group's agents and distributors have posted sales totaling 50 million francs for 1993. Euclid, the CAD/CAM [computer-aided design and manufacturing] software, is already being used by over 200 customers, including CAST (an aerospace firm in the PRC), Ssang Yong Motors (an automotive firm in Korea), Siam Cement (the largest industrial group in Thailand), the HCG (ceramics in Taiwan), Ching Sum (a mold manufacturer in Hong Kong), First Automobile Works (an automotive firm in the PRC), and, more recently, Singapore Polytechnics. The company's success is due to proximity, local support, appropriate training, and personal attention. A training center for training and support was opened in Beijing in 1992, an office will open there before the end of the year, and Euclid has been translated into Chinese and Korean.
