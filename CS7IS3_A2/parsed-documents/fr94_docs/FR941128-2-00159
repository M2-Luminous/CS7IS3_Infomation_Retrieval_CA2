Holyoke Water Power Company (70&hyph;7495) Holyoke Water Power Company (``HWP''), One Canal Street, Holyoke, Massachusetts 01040, an electric utility subsidiary company of Northeast Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a) and 7 and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder. By Commission order dated November 9, 1988 (HCAR No. 24742), HWP was authorized to finance certain pollution control facilities at its Mt. Tom Station (``Facilities''). The cost of acquiring, constructing and installing the Facilities was financed by HWP through its use of the net proceeds from the sale by the Industrial Development Finance Authority of the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts (``IDA'') of its pollution control revenue bonds (``Bonds'') in the principal amount of $8 million. The Bonds were issued pursuant to an Indenture of Trust between the IDA and Baybank Middlesex, as trustee (``Trustee''), and the proceeds of the issuance of the Bonds were loaned to HWP pursuant to a Loan Agreement (``Loan Agreement'') between HWP and the IDA. In order to obtain the benefits of a high quality rating for the Bonds, HWP's obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by an irrevocable letter of credit (``Letter of Credit'') in the amount of $8,667,000 issued by Union Bank of Switzerland, New York Branch (``Bank'') in favor of the Trustee. The Letter of Credit secures $8 million of principal amount plus interest in the amount of $667,000 at the maximum rate of 15% per annum for 218 days. HWP now proposes to amend the Reimbursement and Security Agreement, dated as of November 1, 1988 between HWP and the Bank in order to: (1) change the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, from perpetual to a three-year term ending November 1, 1997, extendible for successive one-year terms thereafter during the term of the Loan Agreement, with the consent of HWP and the Bank; (2) reduce the annual Letter of Credit fee payable to the Bank; and (3) extend, modify or replace the Letter of Credit provided by the Bank, as permitted by the Loan Agreement, by delivery of a substitute credit facility, consisting of a new letter of credit, and related agreements, to be provided by a substitute bank to be chosen by HWP (``Substitute Bank''). The proposed Letter of Credit fee will be changed from 0.45% of the Letter of Credit amount to 0.40% of that amount. This represents an annual fee reduction of $4,334 per annum. HWP proposes to extend, modify or replace the Bank's Letter of Credit with a new letter of credit (``Substitute ``LOC'') to be issued by the same or a Substitute Bank during the term of the Bonds. The Substitute LOC would be issued under a new letter of credit and reimbursement agreement (``New LOC Agreement'') substantially identical to the Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1993 among HWP's associate company, The Connecticut Light & Power Company, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch and various co-agents and participating banks, as approved by Commission order, dated September 15, 1993 (HCAR No. 25881). The New LOC Agreement will be in accordance with the Loan Agreement and provide that: (1) the total amount available to be drawn under any such extended, modified, or replacement letter of credit does not exceed $8,667,000; (2) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension, modification, or replacement do not exceed 1.00% per annum of the total amount available; (3) that tender advances bear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed the higher of (a) the prime rate plus 2.00% or (b) the federal funds rate plus 2.00%; (4) such extension, modification, or replacement is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC Agreement.
