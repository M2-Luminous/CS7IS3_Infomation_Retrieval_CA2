It will also embarrass the Labour Party which, a spokesman said, favoured adopting the constitution as a basis for discussion but did not endorse all its provisions. The document, if adopted, would commit Britain to abandoning border controls; accepting majority voting on foreign policy; ending the system of rotating EC presidencies, and accepting vast increases in the power of the European Parliament -- where Britain holds only 15 percent of the seats. The constitution was proposed by Mr Fernand Herman, a member of Belgium's Centre-Right Social Christian Party, and draws support from much of the European People's Party (EPP), the loose grouping to which Tory Euro-MPs belong. Mr Leo Tindemans, the Belgian leader of the EPP, said yesterday that he favoured adopting the constitution as a basis for discussion. But all 32 Conservative Euro-MPs are committed to voting against it, in the latest rift between the pro-federalist parties of Europe and the British contingent, whose future in the EPP group is far from secure. A vote on a resolution which "approves this constitution as a basis for wider discussions" and commits Parliament to circulate it among EC officials and member governments is expected to take place later today. It is likely to go through. But the chances of the constitution ever being adopted are remote. The details are, however, a good guide to thinking among the Christian Democrat partners of the Conservative Party. Many of the ideas are likely to surface in the run-up to 1996, when government heads are due to decide the next stages in the integration of Europe. Enthusiasts for federalism pointed out yesterday that the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty both had their genesis in a similar kite-flying exercise by the Euro-Parliament 10 years ago. British Conservative Euro-MPs and officials have reacted in horror to some of the constitution's provisions. The proposals that most offend Britain's notions of sovereignty are: The EC's unelected and barely accountable bureaucracy would have the sole right to suggest foreign and security policy initiatives to the European Commission. These would then go to an EC vote and need only be adopted by a majority. At the moment, votes must be unanimous, giving Britain an effective veto, which would disappear. The European Parliament would have the sole right to elect the Commission president, a job which M Jacques Delors, the incumbent, has shown to be perhaps the most powerful in Europe. That decision currently rests with member states. The Euro-Parliament would have the right to initiate constitutional reforms. It would compel Britain to elect its Euro-MPs by a "common" European system -- inevitably a form of proportional representation. It would replace the rotating EC presidency with a system of renewable one-year appointments, which would go to a vote by member states. This could lead to indefinite exclusion for some countries. It would give the Parliament the right to veto any treaty concluded by the EC. Meanwhile, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC's information commissioner, revealed details of the Commission's new freedom of information policy, whose produres, he claimed, will allow the release of 99 percent of documents placed before the Commission. The procedures will be in place by the end of the month. However, sceptics doubt that they will work well in practice, noting that last year the Commission adopted a code of practice which allows it almost unlimited discretion to refuse disclosure of internal documents.
