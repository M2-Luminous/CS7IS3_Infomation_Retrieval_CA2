When Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks set out for the evening reception that was arranged by Horst Weisel on 24 March in the German Embassy, he probably expected a relaxed atmosphere, choice wines, a well-spread table, and comfortable small talk with the diplomatic and other political elite. He certainly did not expect an awkward scandal. That is precisely what happened, however. The next day, on 25 March, Drazen Budisa, president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] and a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies, wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Valentic, which was carried by all the daily newspapers in the country. The letter states that after dinner, during a conversation in which Slovene Ambassador Matija Malesic, Deputy Finance Minister Bozo Prka, Milan Djukic, SNS [Serbian National Party] president, and Presidential Adviser Nenad Porges participated, Seks stated that he knew what Budisa had said at a recent HSLS meeting in Virovitica. In response to Budisa's inquiry about how he knew that, Seks answered that he had recordings that the police had delivered to him. "I ask you, esteemed Mr. Valentic, to give me and our public an answer as to whether the police are recording HSLS meetings with your instructions and approval, and if not, I request that you urgently inquire who is doing it and on whose instructions," Budisa's letter said. It also expressed the hope that the government's policy did not include police monitoring of opposition parties. Four days later, on 29 March, Vladimir Seks answered Budisa's open letter with an article entitled "Drazen Budisa's False Misinterpretations." Categorically denying Budisa's statements, at the same time Seks also explained Budisa's motives: "It is quite unlikely that I would make such a statement to Mr. Budisa, and his request that the conversation be translated for the German ambassador obviously indicates Budisa's intention of once again indicting, accusing, and denouncing the Croatian state, while portraying himself as a politician who, as a democrat, ought to be president of the republic in accordance with alleged foreign `tastes.'" Valentic's Quick Response Who said what to whom and how it was interpreted is not that important, because only Seks and Budisa know the real truth about the course of the conversation. Far more serious is the mention of the alleged secret recording being done by the police. It is therefore not surprising that there was a quick response from Prime Minister Valentic, who said in connection with Budisa's accusations, "The Service for Protection of the Constitutional Order of the Republic of Croatia is not operationally interested in meetings of political parties, or in communications among them. Consequently, any sort of recording of the meetings of the HSLS or any other party is out of the question. I therefore reject any possibility of that the police acted in Virovitica in the way stated by Mr. Drazen Budisa. At the same time, I strongly protest the reference to the police in this context, whoever made it, because those allegations are unfounded and untrue." Zdravko Zidovec, the interior minister's chief of staff, said about this: "The claim that the police recorded an HSLS meeting in Virovitica is ridiculous. I categorically reject that possibility." Regardless of the content of the conversation between Seks and Budisa at the German Embassy, attention really has been drawn to the work of the secret services. "The state sees all, the state hears all," is the well-known slogan of the totalitarian regimes with which the communist authorities frightened us for 45 years. It is therefore not surprising that the Croatian public is sensitive to references to secret recording, monitoring, or the wiretapping of telephones. The fact is that the Croatian state inherited many of the former regime's institutions, and thus also a large police apparatus. A thorough restructuring of the intelligence services was therefore one of the first steps that Croatia took. The Service for Protection of the Constitutional Order [SZUP], which is the best-known "secret police," was created, and intelligence services are also possessed by the Defense Ministry (the SIS [Security-Information Service]) and the Foreign Ministry (Section 8), along with the youngest Croatian Information Service [HIS]. The legal framework regulating their powers and operation, as well as control over those services, was supposed to be modeled after that of other democratic countries. Their work is based on the constitution and special laws, for example, the Law on Internal Affairs (the SZUP). Internal Regulations It is thus said of the SZUP that it is "one of the police services within the Republic of Croatia's Interior Ministry," and that "in accordance with the constitution and the law, it handles matters related to protecting the order established by the constitution, within the framework of which it collects information and intelligence, and undertakes other necessary measures to detect and prevent activities aimed at undermining or destroying the order established by the constitution and threatening the country's security." It therefore focuses its activity on those criminal acts that are, in principle, prepared in secret and in an organized manner, such as terrorism, espionage, and so forth. Some occurrences in the past two years, however, drew the public's attention precisely to the work of those services. This has to do primarily with wiretapping certain individuals. The first such accusation was uttered by the controversial Nikola Viskovic, a deputy in the last Assembly. The second case, which was exploited even more by the media, is, of course, the "case of Manolic's special telephone," through which he could obtain a direct connection with any continent, and which someone regularly blocked two days out of the week. Both cases once again revived the question of where the limit to the secret services' work actually was. In the end, wiretapping is not any kind of bogeyman if it is conducted strictly in accordance with the law, and if all possibilities for abuse are eliminated. The powers of the SZUP, however, are not based exclusively on the constitution and the law. As we have unofficially learned, there are also internal regulations, which are classified at such a level that even SZUP employees cannot read them until they pass all the tests, take the oath, and receive official identification. It seems that through the unnecessary mystification of their work, those services are actually doing themselves a disservice. It is precisely for that reason that we will list some of the devices used by similar services in the world. Eavesdropping Devices A laser system for eavesdropping on inaccessible premises consists of a transmitter that sends a focused beam to the glass of a window, while the receiver catches the modulated beam in the form of the vibrations resulting from speech and turns it into an audio signal, filters it, and amplifies it. There is also a probe for surveillance and eavesdropping: Through at least an 8-mm opening, a probe is inserted, at the end of which is a sensitive microphone and a lens with a 90-degree field of vision; an ordinary camera, video camera, or tape recorder can be installed on the other end of the probe. These two devices are among the most modern ones in the world, and are said to be highly sophisticated instruments. A simple instrument for eavesdropping on telephone conversations consists of a tape recorder and a device for recording the operation of the telephone dial. That kind of tape recorder is activated whenever the telephone rings or when the phone is picked up. The numbers dialed from the telephone that is being tapped are also recorded on a separate tape. The biggest producers of this and other eavesdropping equipment are Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. Today the TRM series from 0040 to 0045 are among the best-known and most highly valued eavesdropping devices. The TRM 0040 is a microcassette recorder with a size of 119 x 55 x 17 mm and a weight of 160 grams. Thanks to this, it can be camouflaged very well in a pack of cigarettes, for example. It can record a conversation at a distance of up to 10 meters. It also has a remote control attachment, a tape counter, and a memory button. It is equipped with an additional device for voice activation, so that only so-called active speech is recorded. These are only a few of the eavesdropping devices that can be bought in West European countries in any well-equipped store selling technical goods. Information is power. The one who has it and who can get it before others has more power, and more authority. Playing with that power is dangerous, and that is why control mechanisms exist. Any indication of possible abuse of that power is useful and welcome. [Box, p 26] Vladimir Seks, Croatian deputy prime minister: "Budisa Is Making a Provocation" [Seks] You can associate this story of Budisa's with the one that the Croats destroyed a mosque in Livno. Budisa knew very well that everything bad that was done in the areas that are under the control of the Croats in Bosnia would be attributed by world political factors to the Croatian government. I understand political rivalry, competition, and scoring political points, but this shows his great impatience and goes beyond all bounds of fair play. Budisa's use of such misinterpretations in front of another country's ambassador is irrational and unclear. One can conclude precisely from that that this is a deliberate political provocation through which Budisa tried to discredit the government, the Interior Ministry, and me personally in front of the German ambassador. It really is ridiculous that I would make such a statement. Budisa and I have been friends for many years, but obviously his desire for a political breakthrough knows no bounds. [Komadina] At one time you were also the state attorney. Did you ever encounter cases in which the police secretly eavesdropped on or recorded any party's meetings? [Seks] Never. [Box, p 27] Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "Seks's Inventions" [Budisa] It really is quite improbable, as Mr. Seks said in his statement, that he said what he did. Unfortunately, a lot of things in Croatia that are quite improbable are real and true, and so is Mr. Seks's statement. In the conversation that we had the next day, after that dinner, Seks did not deny his words, but only stated that he was joking, and it seems that that is how the other participants in the conversation also perceived it. I do not have any appreciation for HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] wit, however. Consequently, the truth is precisely what I wrote to Prime Minister Valentic. On the contrary, it is not true that there was any discussion that evening about my representing myself as the future president of the Croatian state. Those are really Mr. Seks's absurdities and inventions. Now I am only considering what the people who participated in the conversation that evening are thinking about Mr. Seks. [Komadina] Had you already had similar information about your meetings being recorded? [Budisa] No. We did not even refer to that. I do not know about any recording, and that is precisely why Seks's statement was shocking--especially because he told me about it, if it is being done.
