In addition to internal waves, eddies and a wake current, high-gradient envelopes arising on the boundary of the density wake and in the wakes behind eddies are important structural elements of a current. The rules for identification of eddy current elements are formulated and the following types of vortical systems are discriminated: small-scale eddies localized in a high-gradient envelope, eddies submerged in a density wake and so-called hanging eddies. The dependencies of their geometric characteristics on the current parameters are determined. A new class of instability is defined: structural (microscale) instability when a complex relief of the horizontal isopycnic surfaces is observed against a background of a smooth velocity distribution. Fourteen characteristic types of structures are discriminated and a map of current systems is plotted. It is shown that on the (lgRe, lgFr[.sup]i[/]) plane the boundaries between systems are segments of straight lines. Figures 5; references 13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.
