At present, 2,887 village cooperatives are conducting economies of scale in different forms. They comprise 73.4 percent of all villages in the suburban districts, and they cultivate over 3 million mu of grain-growing farmland, which is 73.1 percent of the total grain-growing farmland. Economy of scale is also gradually becoming widespread in orchards, animal husbandry, and fisheries. Presently, all orchards together cover an area of 1.7 million mu, ponds for fish-farming 120,000 mu, and there are also 1,034 modernized pig farms. Developments Toward Economy of Scale Agricultural Operations Economy of scale agricultural operations started in the suburban districts of Beijing with the transformation of soil cultivation patterns, and from there branched out into other areas of agriculture. The said transformation of soil cultivation patterns occurred essentially in two phases; in the initial stage of the reform, it was the output-related system of contract responsibility, and later the system of specialized contracts and economy of scale. As early as 1978, some communes and production brigades in Changping, Daxing, and other counties in the suburbs of Beijing tried out the output-related system of contract responsibility. In 1982, 84.2 percent of the basic accounting units in farm production practiced the output-related contract responsibility system. Later, on the basis of experiences so far gained, they adopted the all-round responsibility system, and by 1983 the crop-growing industry working large fields was to 71.1 percent on the all-round contract responsibility system, which figure, by 1985, had reached 96.9 percent. The various pursuits outside of grain farming also one after the other adopted the contract responsibility system. Most of the vegetable growing was contracted out to specialized teams, some also for special job performances or to individual households. Orchards were generally worked under contract by specialized production brigades or teams, or by specialized individual households. Village production brigades in the mountainous and semi-mountainous districts that mainly engaged in fruit production generally subcontracted such cultivation to individual households. Because of the strength of the former collective economy in the suburban districts of Beijing, and because of the extent of advanced production methods and application of science and technology, there were still, at the time when the output-related contract system was being promoted, 15 percent of the communes and production brigades that had not contracted out any of their land to individual households, because of the high level of their internal specialized division of labor. They had rather made the specialized production projects themselves--projects that had come about in the division of labor and division of technologies in the former collective economy--the objects of contractual undertakings. It means that they merely transformed the organizational pattern, which had been "so loudly acclaimed," and then developed one step further the degree of specialization that had formerly existed in the rural areas. However, because the method of land distribution applied at that time was one based on the number of heads, each rural household got to cultivate only 5 to 6 mu of segmented and fragmented lots of arable land. In addition huge changes had occurred in the meantime in the setup of rural production in Beijing. By 1985, the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in the output value of the rural economy had reached 71 percent, and the proportion of nonagricultural manpower in the rural economy had reached 53 percent. The development of rural industrialization demanded a rapid improvement in agricultural productivity, as it demanded a move toward economy of scale and more intensive cultivation. On the other hand, the system of egalitarian, dispersed family operations gave cause to an increasingly serious trend in agriculture of peasants seeking other, concurrent jobs. It led to a decline in enthusiasm for grain growing among the peasants, to a reduction in input, and to a decline in the quality of manpower devoted to agriculture. It has also led to stagnation and fluctuations in agricultural developments during the two years, 1985 and 1986. However, while existing under the same conditions, a small number of township brigades did not conduct egalitarian land distribution to households, but rather practiced the specialized contractual system, and thereby could maintain a steady increase in grain production. For instance, the Nanhanji production brigade in the Fangshan district was able to maintain for ten years, consecutively since 1982, the same grain yield per mu, a state of things which was highly enlightening to leading cadres of all ranks. To alleviate pressure on the government created by the agricultural crisis and by the unbearable burden of huge subsidies to the rural cooperative organizations, the suburban districts of Beijing started, from the second half of 1985 on, trials with econmy of scale management of farmland. On the foundation that had been laid by leading cadres of all ranks, as they reviewed what had occurred at the basic levels, also due to the realities of the situation and accurately guided by the true state of affairs, economy of scale attained very rapid development. Computed for grain-growing fields in the plains, the extent of economy of scale reached 16 percent in 1986, 31.6 percent in 1987, increased to 60 percent in 1988, and was all along steadily maintained at around 70 percent after 1989. At the same time, equal progress was made in economy of scale in nonstaple food production, such as in fruit-tree farming, animal husbandry, and fishery. Throughout the process of promoting economy of scale in the suburban districts of Beijing, attention has always been given to integrate the policies of the central authorities and certain basic principles of economy of scale with the specific conditions faced by agriculture in the suburban districts of Beijing. It was through exploration and practice that a specific way was found for the modernization of such agricultural pursuits that are suited to the special conditions of Beijing. The specific methods and the understanding gained may be summarized as follows: 1. Upholding the standards of productive forces. At all times, from the output-related system of contract responsibility to the economy of scale, and in whatever specific form, at whatever time, and by whatever method economy of scale are being promoted, the principle of always acting in the interest of developing the productive forces must be upheld. 2. Upholding the principle of starting out from the realities. Basing on the differing economic conditions and different levels of development in different regions, agricultural economy of scale have to be pursued at different levels and in different forms. Where conditions are mature for the purpose, economy of scale shall be pursued, and where conditions are not yet ripe for such, one must refrain from their introduction. Economy of scale must be pursued to the extent that favorable conditions will permit. 3. Arousing enthusiasm in both in the collectives as well as in the individuals involved. Desires and choices of the masses must be respected, but attention must also be paid to taking full advantage of the strength of collective forces in the Beijing region and their great capacity for unified operations. We must not miss the opportunity for effective guidance, we must promote the concentration of landholdings, must conduct internal adjustments and render internal services, so that economy of scale will become the common desire and demand of leadership as well as masses. 4. While upholding modernization as the objective, we must give equally serious attention to economy of scale as well as to intensive operations. 5. Successful experiences in economy of scale must be promptly disseminated among all rural industries, to achieve a harmonious development in all lines of agriculture and a benign cycle in the economy. The practical experiences of the last ten years allow us to say that there have already formed the beginnings of a feasible guidance-type policy in the suburban districts of Beijing. This is an important precondition to ensure the healthy development of economy of scale. Main Forms of Economy of Scale Beijing is located on the northwestern border of the North-China plain. It is to 38 percent flatland and to 62 percent mountainous. According to the level of productive forces and of socioeconomic development, one may roughly divide the area into three districts: the suburban district, the plains, and the mountainous district. There are, however, some differences within each of these districts, resulting in differences also in the forms of economy of scale that apply to each. The following are in broad outline the main forms of economy of scale: 1. Collective farms (also called cooperative farms). Generally speaking, they are most developed in the suburban district and in the plains. In these districts, the readjustment of production, social division of labor, shifts of manpower, as well as capital accumulation and material equipment have reached a comparatively high level of development, which facilitated the introduction of intensive forms of operation with the employment of much inanimate labor. Typical and representative forms of these types may be seen in Dudian and Nanhanji villages in the Fangshan district, in Zhangxinzhuang village of Tongxian county, in Gaoliying village and Tianzhuzhen township in Shunyi County, and in Dongdian village in Daxing county. Most of these farms had been established with support from the village cooperative organizations. Some villages had only one, some had several farms. Their sizes were generally between 200 and 800 mu. A lesser number had been established by the township organizations, mainly with the backing of production service organizations (agricultural companies, farm machinery stations, production brigades, etc.), renting land from various villages for unified cultivation, at sizes from between 1,000 to 4,000 mu. The contract forms of most collective farms were of a two-stage type, namely farms contracting from the collectives and the staff and workers contracting from the farms, but there were also cases where farms contracted in a one-stage procedure from the collectives. Township and village collectives provide the farms with part of their means of production and certain services, while the farms guarantee to fulfill their obligations under the contract and to turn over a certain amount of accumulations. These farms are essentially independent accounting units, responsible for their own profits and losses, and operate on businesslike principles; a few of them also operate as cooperatives on the shareholding system. Internally, they mainly operate with labor-production contracts, and the relationship between peasant and soil is a very stable one. The farms generally have unified control of income and expenditure, their distribution is centralized and is using such methods as computing salaries on the basis of production, by stages of effective performance, or by benefits accruing, with additional encouragement rewards. This form is characterized by sound organization, relatively clear and definite economic relations, and a very sensible operational mechanism. The special characteristic of unified management in the operation of these farms is clearly evident. 2. Specialized Production Brigades When contracts are signed by households or labor as units directly with the village commune-collective and these units submit to unified management by the collective organization (some of these being agricultural companies), it is primarily important that the system of management, internally, be one of separate accounting for each household, that contracts are labor-performance related, and that each unit bears full responsibility for its own profits and losses. This form occurs mainly in intermediary areas where there is stable employment and redeployment of manpower, and where, furthermore, there is a tendency toward gradually moving toward collective farming. This form of operations is based on family-run operations, where there is one administrative level between household and village, to strengthen the servicing and administering of the different plots of land through centralized contracting, and it will, as a consequence, effectively integrate family-run operations and a more specialized administration. The special characteristic of dual-level management is clearly evident in this form. Another form which is close to the specialized production brigade type are the specialized villages and specialized townships which, within the sphere of village and township commune areas, have management contracts contracted for by families, and where the village and township cooperative organizations render production and marketing services and engage in cultivation and breeding. 3. Specialized Farming Households They mainly occur in areas where the collective economy has not been well developed, where the development of nonagricultural industries had been slow, and where agricultural production has essentially remained at the level of traditional family-run operations. Through the application of economy of scale a development was set in motion as from "small and complete" to "small and specialized," promoting "socialization" of the division of specialized labor, which had been extant as a potential in the family-run operations. The main form is one by which the peasant as unit contracts from the village brigade collective, where the peasants keep separate accounts, are responsible for their own profits and losses, and at the same time rely on the services provided by the cooperative management service organization to accomplish their production processes. This form is beneficial for a more concentrated and effective use of the soil, beneficial for the adoption of advanced production technologies, for speedier division of specialized labor in agriculture, and it represents a further advance beyond the family-run operations of the period of the "all-encompassing contracts." Compared to the formerly mentioned two forms, in this form the function of the peasant is clearer defined, but it is still a dual-stage type of operation. At present, the total grain-crop acreage in the suburban districts under economy of scale management is 2,997,000 mu, which is 73.7 percent of the area's total grain-crop acreage of 4,066,000 mu. Out of the grain-crop acreage under economy of scale management, 43.9 percent are under farm management, namely 1,316,000 mu, now counting over 1,400 farms; 25.8 percent are specialized brigade-operated, managing 773,000 mu of grain-crop fields, and having around 1,400 specialized brigades; 30.3 percent are operated by specialized households, working 908,000 mu of grain-crop fields, with somewhat over 1,000 specialized households. Among the above-mentioned three forms of operations there are also a few that are operated as joint entities and cooperatively on a shareholding basis. Remarkable Effect of Transformation to Economy of Scale Promotion and continued perfection of economy of scale in agriculture has brought about a thoroughgoing transformation and very rapid development in collective agriculture in the suburban districts of Beijing. It has caused new vigor and vitality to shine forth and has at the same time conducted valuable explorations toward the further development of a socialist agriculture with Chinese characteristics. In concrete terms, its achievements have been mainly in the following directions: -- It prevented a contraction of agriculture and greatly increased grain production. Economy of scale put an end to the fluctuations in grain production and ensured a continuing tendency of increases. In 1987 the total grain production for the first time exceeded the 2.25 billion kg mark with a 4.87 percent increase over the preceding year. In 1988 another increase of 3.35 percent was achieved with a yield of 520 kg per mu. In 1992, total grain production was 2.819 billion kg with a yield of 657.9 kg per mu, an increase of 30.2 percent and 42.1 percent, respectively, compared with 1986. Economy of scale have made us see the potential and has raised our hopes for further grain production increases. -- It has led to increased input and to improvement of the quality of agricultural equipment and technology. During the period from 1985 to 1988, investments in agriculture by Beijing Municipality and by its collectives has increased by over 200 million yuan. In Shunyi alone, one of the main grain producing counties, investments in agriculture since the start of economy of scale have always been around 50 million yuan per year, which amounts to a total of over 300 million yuan. Increased investment has resulted in better agricultural equipment. In 1988, there were 700 more wheat-harvesting combines, as compared to 1986, and they were harvesting around 60 percent of the summer wheat crop. By 1992, the total motive power used by agricultural machinery in the suburban districts was 65.2 kilowatt per mu of grain fields, the rate of mechanical plowing was 72 percent, the rate of mechanical seeding was 71 percent, and the rate of mechanical harvesting was 51 percent. In the plains, mechanization of grain production had essentially been realized at a fairly rapid pace. In Shunyi County, mechanization has been introduced for the whole process from seeding to harvesting of both wheat and corn crops. All grain fields throughout the county are essentially irrigated by water sprinklers, which is a water-saving way of cultivating. At the same time, developments of a breakthrough nature have also occurred in the dissemination of new agricultural technologies and their application, in the reform of the cropping system, as also in intensive farming operations, and in the more scientific nature of operations, promoting the modernization of agricultural production. -- In promoting the development of production in the various different lines, it has increased the degree of specializations to a very large extent. During the three-year period from 1986 to 1988, when economy of scale were rapidly introduced in the suburban districts of Beijing, 400,000 mu of fruit-bearing trees were newly added, 80,000 mu of farmland were added at the vegetable bases in the outlying suburbs, and there has also been a rapid increase in the various kinds of livestock and poultry. The villages have further distanced themselves from the small-scale production setup which had been combined with the taking up of other, concurrent jobs. There has been an accelerated adjustment of the manpower structure in the rural areas, and an additional 93,000 persons were shifted and added to the labor force of the secondary and tertiary industries. Division of labor within agriculture has been comparatively stable, and there has been an evident tendency toward specialization in production. -- It markedly improved productivity of the agricultural labor force with the effect of initially improving profitability in the agricultural economy. It brought increases in peasant incomes and increases in agricultural accumulations, while the logistics of agricultural development were also markedly strengthened. Follow-up investigations have shown that labor productivity in most farms on economy of scale in the suburban districts of Beijing, and incomes of the labor force engaged in farming, have all along been maintained at a relatively high level. In 1992, grain production per unit of labor and income per unit of labor have evidently been at a higher than average level. Income per unit of labor has more or less been equal to staff and workers' incomes in township and town enterprises. Investigations over several consecutive years show: In 1988, the average net income per mu in 635 farms investigated had reached 212 yuan; in 1989, out of 759 farms investigated, 734 farms, i.e. 96 percent, were operating profitably. In 1990, accumulations from 317 farms investigated reached 110 yuan per mu. In the past, during the time of the household responsibility system, the collectives had to pay a subsidy of 50 yuan for each mu of land each year. After the introduction of economy of scale, it is now possible to turn over to the collectives every year 80 yuan for every mu of land as accumulation. Throughout the county, grain production can provide almost 50 million yuan as accumulation every year. Add to this the more than 100,000 mu of land producing nonstaple foods and used in other economic diversifications, the collectives can obtain every year from agriculture over 60 million yuan in accumulations. Economy of scale has had the effect of initially transforming agriculture from a subsistence-type and welfare-type of pursuit into one of profitability. It has brought new hope for resolving the long-standing problems troubling agriculture, namely of very low profits in agricultural production, the widening price scissors as between industrial and agricultural products, and the slow pace at which the peasantry evolves toward prosperity. At present, the agricultural organizations operating on the economy of scale principle in the suburban districts of Beijing are now, responding to the demand for the establishment of modernized enterprise systems, engaged in further explorations in their progress. They will gradually mature into operational entities working as business enterprises and will become an important force in the move toward socialist market economy.
