Also present was Dr. Muhammad Bani-Hani, director general of the Corporation. Mr. Marwan 'Awad spoke to the news desk about the talks: [Begin 'Awad recording] We met with the director and the joint delegation of the Chinese chambers of commerce and the Chinese Exports Development Corporation. We reviewed the status of economic and commercial cooperation between the two sides and the agreements in place between our two countries. We pointed out the investment opportunities that may induce Chinese businessmen to invest in Jordan. We proposed instituting assembly lines using Chinese technology and expertise. Investors would benefit from Jordan's position and its relations with neighboring states through the bilateral pacts it has with them. This is in addition to the joint investment opportunities that may open up for Chinese investors. We also updated them on the measures taken to promote the export of Jordanian products to China in settlement of a Chinese loan to Jordan. It is a good opportunity for us to introduce Jordanian products to the Chinese market. In addition to increased trade, our aim is to reduce the deficit in the balance of trade estimated at $35-40 million. We import $60 million worth of goods from China and our exports to China are on the order of $20-25 million. The Chinese side said they were willing to raise the volume of bilateral exchanges and boost their Jordanian imports. They requested and obtained detailed lists of Jordanian goods that may form an export basis to China. For their part, the Chinese delegation will, through the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Exports Development Corporation, distribute the lists to the interested quarters. [end recording]
