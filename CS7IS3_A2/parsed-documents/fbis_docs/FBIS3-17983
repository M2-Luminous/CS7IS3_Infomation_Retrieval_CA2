This statement was made in an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, by the co-chairman of the inter-regional bloc of reforms, Leonid Kuchma. He was elected on March 27 to be people's deputy of Ukraine, winning in his constituency 91 percent of the votes. Kuchma believes that the legal basis was virtually destroyed in economics. He criticized the activities of the government which in December 1993 freed prices and restricted credits. According to the former prime minister, this has caused the debt crisis and the stoppage of enterprises. He still believes that the president should be the head of the executive power. He disagrees that the heads of the local councils be granted executive powers. "On this I agree with Kravchuk. If so, we will really have 26 presidents in 26 regions," said Kuchma. He spoke against rescheduling the presidential elections for a later date. There are no grounds for that, he said. Speaking about the problem of relations between the Crimea and Ukraine, Kuchma said that pressure on Crimea will produce no results. Crimea should be a starting point for reforms in Ukraine, said Kuchma.
