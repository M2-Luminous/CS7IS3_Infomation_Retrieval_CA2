Kivu is taking in Rwandan refugees and may be the crossing point for arms destined for the government camp in this country, despite the UN arms embargo. According to the account of a Rwandan refugee at Goma (a Zairian town on Lake Kivu, opposite Gisenyi, a stronghold of Hutu extremists in Rwanda), Rwandans are making incursions into Zaire to carry off refugees and to take them back to the Rwandan side. We have been unable to obtain confirmation of this news, although rumors of such seizures are circulating among Goma's Zairian population. One of the refugees, on the other hand, told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE that the Rwandans had come to Zaire to rustle cattle in the Bukombe district. Hutus coming from Rwanda are also said to have attacked three farms belonging to Tutsis in the Masisi region of Zaire. The owners are said to have killed some attackers and captured others. According to the same source, attacks have also taken place in the area of Rutshuru (a Jomba village) "but Ndeze, the Rutshuru's Hutu mwamui (editor's note: Member of the Republican High Council, the Kinshasa Parliament), is not letting these attacks develop, because he wants to maintain the tranquillity of the region." Tension in Kivu Readers are reminded that the Kivu (Zairian region on the frontier with Rwanda and Burundi) has a native Rwandan-speaking population consisting of Tutsis and Hutus. The region, linked to the pre-colonial Rwandan kingdom, was annexed to the Belgian Congo by the colonizers, who also subsequently encouraged, in the '30s, an immigration of workers from Rwanda. Successive waves of political and ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi since their independence have added refugees coming from these countries. In 1992-93, the Kivu was the scene of bloody outbreaks of violence between Rwandan- speaking natives (Hutus and Tutsis) on the one hand, and non-Rwandan speakers (principally Behunde and Banyanga) on the other. A Rwandan-speaking Zairian source indicates that South Kivu's Governor Keymbwa Walumona, who is a protestant pastor, has driven back to their own country Rwandans fleeing the prefecture of Cyangugu, where Tutsis and the Hutu opposition have been massacred. Privately, the governor is said to have indicated that these were instructions "from above," in other words from President Mobutu. Certain people believe such an order to be unlikely since North Kivu is welcoming refugees without difficulty. A Zairian source not from the region has indicated to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE that tensions between Hutus and Tutsis, already sensitive within the Kivu due to the ethnic clashes in the neighboring countries, have grown with the present Rwandan crisis, and that Kinshasa's policy was therefore rather to receive Tutsi refugees in South Kivu (Bukavo, Uvira) and Hutu refugees in North Kivu (Goma, Masisi, Rutshuru). A DSP (Special Presidential Division) has been installed "between the two (Kivu provinces)," in particular in the region of Masisi and along the frontier, from Rutshuru to Uvira. However, the welcome by South Kivu's governor to the Rwandan Tutsis seems pretty reticent, judging from a European source at Bukavu (capital of the province). This source added that "trading in property stolen" from the victims of the anti-Tutsi and anti-Hutu opposition pogroms in Rwanda was taking place in Bukavu, where Rwandan military had received the governor's "authorization to come and gather supplies," and was taking full advantage of this. Arms Traffic Another area of Zairian involvement in the Rwandan crisis: arms trafficking. According to information gathered by LA LIBRE BELGIQUE, an air cargo company landed a cargo of arms at Goma airport "on a Thursday, one week after President Habyarimana's death" (that would be 14 April). These arms were transported on 10 trucks belonging to local traders (Zairians and an Indian), and then escorted to Gisenyi, an area in the hands of Rwandan Government forces. In early May, a Bulgarian plane landed 42 tons of arms at Goma, which were immediately loaded onto Rwandan military trucks. In general, these transhipments are said to have taken place at night, at a rate of one a week, and from aircraft of different origins, in particular from Nigeria. Last Monday 23 May, a Zairian Army C-130 and a cargo plane from the same air freight company as the one mentioned above landed at Goma at 0000 GMT, according to eyewitnesses. At 0200 GMT, the crates were loaded onto two dump trucks and a Toyota truck belonging to the Zairian Army, en route for Gisenyi. The load must then have been transported via Lake Kivu as far as Cyangugu and, from there, by road toward Butare and Gitarama, a region that could be the next objective of the Rwandan Patriotic Front guerillas. We questioned Zaire's ambassador in Brussels about this trafficking. Mr Kimbulu told us that "Zaire is a mediator (in the Rwandan conflict) and cannot therefore allow one of the parties to be favored."
