The Question, However, Has Nevertheless Been Discussed in the Corridors of Power"] [Text] The other day POSTFACTUM distributed a report that staffers of the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers have been prohibited, in violation of the republic's current legislation, from giving information to the independent mass media. The news agency's correspondent, citing reliable sources, said that the decision was made 7 February at a government meeting chaired by Vagif Nagiyev, Cabinet of Ministers chief of staff. All staffers were given an instruction prohibiting direct contacts with the press. Only the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers press service was allowed to deal with independent journalists. Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked Kyamal Katibli, chief of the Cabinet of Ministers press service, to comment on the report. Mr. Katibli said in a telephone conversation that the matter had never been discussed at any level and that the press reports did not square with reality. "No one has barred members of the Cabinet of Ministers from contacting the mass media," Mr. Katibli said. Meanwhile, your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that the problem was in fact discussed unofficially in Azerbaijani corridors of power. Government members were recommended not to disclose information anonymously. A person speaking to journalists should introduce himself and bear responsibility for his words. Seeing that no government members would dare make any sensational statements for the press given the difficult sociopolitical situation in the republic, POSTFACTUM's report should not be seen as false. It has simply not been fully clarified.
