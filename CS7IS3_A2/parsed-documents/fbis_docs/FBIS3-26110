The original draft, submitted to the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee for deliberation last December appeared to advocate the forced sterilisation of mentally and physically disabled people and led to an outcry of protest from many Western countries. The criticism came as something of a surprise to the Ministry of Public Health, which drafted the legislation, since China had practised eugenics for the past five years and the new law was designed simply to codify existing practices. However, the State Family Planning Commission, which had borne mainly American criticism of China's one child policy and was more aware of how the legislation would be received abroad, quickly voiced its concern over the proposed law, particularly its use of language such as "inferior births". A source at the commission said the draft law was seen by many within the Government as "very contentious" and possibly damaging to China's international reputation. There was also concern that it would place additional burdens on the work of the commission without providing any extra resources, the source said. All government agencies concerned with the proposed law are now refusing to discuss the legislation publicly for fear of creating more controversy, but it is understood the draft is being reworked into a less contentious form. Sources said that while the basic aim of the law, to slow the rapid increase in the number of children born with disabilities, remained the same, the language used would be altered and the proposed regulations watered down so as to appear less Draconian. The word "eugenics" would not appear anywhere in the new draft, a source said. The new draft would make it clear that no one would be forced to have an abortion or be sterilised and that the emphasis would he placed on improving medical and social welfare care. "The new draft will focus on the positive aspects of the programme rather than those negative, prohibitive aspects," the source added. The law is now unlikely to go before the full session of the NPC which meets in Beijing on March 10. The legislation is still considered too controversial to be discussed at the NPC which attracts national and international media attention. He pointed out that the last time a controversial law was discussed at the NPC namely the three Gorges Dam project, the voting session ended in chaos with a deputy from Taiwan storming out. It was more likely that the Government would wait for a smaller standing committee meeting of the NPC before putting the legislation to the vote, he said.
