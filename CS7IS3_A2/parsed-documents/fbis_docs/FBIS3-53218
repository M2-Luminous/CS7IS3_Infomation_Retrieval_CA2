The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed the statement issued by the recent Damascus meeting on the Iranian islands as repetition of the "baseless claims by the UAE over the islands". Foreign minister of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council, (P)GCC, and their counterparts from Egypt and Syria concluded a two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria, on January 10 without reaching any result. "We pay attention to that part of the statement of the Damascus meeting which mentions friendly neighborhood and elimination of disputes through peaceful talks and declare our readiness to continue talks and receive officials from the UAE," said Mohammadi. "However," he added, "it is the UAE which has not responded positively to Iran's readiness to continue bilateral talks." He deplored that the UAE Government on the one hand emphasizes on mutual talks to settle misunderstandings between the two countries but on the other hand does not take any practical step in this connection. It should be noted that Iran has repeatedly welcomed the visit to Tehran of the UAE officials to hold talk on the settlement of misunderstandings between the two countries without any prejudgements. However, the UAE officials have not yet responded to the good-will shown by Iran which is of importance for the strengthening of the friendly neighborhood and stability in the region.
