Has a "window of favorable opportunities" been opened -- as was the case in 1989 for Germany's unification -- which could be closed again under the pressure of internal developments in Russia? Or are stable conditions emerging that could guarantee for Russia's western neighbors independence in secure borders? Boris Yeltsin suggested to the NATO states in October a common security guarantee in "partnership" for the former USSR allies as an alternative to their "selective admission" to the alliance. But security partnership between NATO and the Russian Federation is only one side of the problem to create stability and security in the East. The other side is the relationship of NATO with the countries that do not want to return to the dangerous insecurity of an "interim Europe" (1919-39). The consequence must not be -- as Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warned -- "a new cordon sanitaire" to isolate Russia, with a relapse into "bloc mentality." Vaclav Havel has adopted a counterposition that is shared by Lech Walesa. Responding to the thesis of Russian Intelligence Chief Primakov, who has said that Russia would be threatened by "an advance of NATO's military might to the Russian borders," Havel said that NATO's coming closer to Russia's border would not mean that "an enemy is approaching, but a sphere of democracy and stability." The NATO Council will have to draft a strategy to create a firm relationship of at least four East Central European states with NATO and connect these with a more comprehensive peace partnership that would include Russia. Without these two connections -- that of East Central Europe with the Atlantic security area and that of Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic states, and southeastern Europe in a pan-European framework with NATO -- it will not be possible to set up a "security architecture" on solid ground. The NATO defense ministers have formulated the principles for the North Atlantic Council in this sense in four main points. In this respect, the German concept that was expounded by Volker Ruehe as the spokesman for the European group has been generally accepted: 1. The enlargement of NATO must be seen as a political principle in a process and must be opened up as a prospect, without individual countries being mentioned as applicants, and without a timeframe being set up. 2. The concept of Partnership for Peace is interpreted as a useful first step but not as a substitute for subsequent admission to NATO. 3. Russia will not be given the right of veto against the admission of other European states to NATO or the Western European Union [WEU]. Any consideration for legitimate Russian security interests must be brought into line with the legitimate security requirements of Russia's western neighbors. 4. Solving the problem through the association of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia with the WEU can only be a temporary arrangement and interim step toward subsequent NATO membership; it can be no substitute. Such an association cannot be as close as that of the NATO members with the WEU, which take part in common defense and are members of NATO's military structures. Moreover, an enlargement of the WEU would increase its political importance outside NATO, instead of inside NATO as a "European pillar" of the alliance. Should NATO refuse to open up to the countries in the East, they will urge membership within the WEU. The result would be an increasing differentiation between NATO and the WEU, which now form a closed alliance system. To the extent that countries would be admitted to the WEU because NATO would remain closed to them, both parts of the Western alliance would develop and move away from each other. To the extent that the WEU would assume functions for "broader security" in East Europe and take over functions to "preserve peace" in Europe in crises by military means, whereas NATO would remain passively in reserve, the Atlantic alliance would lose in importance for European security -- and the reason for the United States to get involved in the defense of Western Europe would decrease as well. NATO cannot split up into two treaty areas -- a security area of common defense, and an area for security policy consultations -- without jeopardizing its unity. Thus, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded at the NATO Council meeting on 2 December regarding the summit statement to be adopted on 11 January 1994: "We should signal that we are considering an evolutionary enlargement. Our most important task will be to say how the alliance will be enlarged to the East." He added: "It is true that Partnership for Peace is an important step in itself, but it can also be a key act for NATO membership."
