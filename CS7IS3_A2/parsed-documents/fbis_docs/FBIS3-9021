The Czech minister, Josef Zieleniec, said that the framework of the plan, which the Czech Republic signed only recently, should not change. In the opposite case new talks would be necessary. He added that the Czech Republic was satisfied with the current plan and did not consider any change feasible. The Ukrainian minister, Anatoliy Zlenko, said he could only agree with Kozyrev that the plan was not a panacea. But he added that he believed that it was in the interest of all to have the same status. Zlenko expressed Ukraine's wish to cooperate with the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). He said that such an important factor of European developments as Ukraine could well complement the group's activity. Zlenko is ending a two-day visit to the Czech Republic today.
