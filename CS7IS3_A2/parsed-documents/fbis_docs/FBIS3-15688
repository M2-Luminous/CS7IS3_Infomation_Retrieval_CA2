The note says Latvia is perplexed by what was said by the head of the U.S. State Department, that almost a million Russian speakers in Latvia are deprived of the right to vote. The Foreign Ministry recalls that 278,000 out of 722,000 ethnic Russians living in Latvia are citizens of the Republic of Latvia. It is noted that Warren Christopher accepted Russia's right to provoke Latvians to extend the circle of citizens and grant the voting right to Russians who want to live in Latvia. The Latvian Foreign Ministry is worried that Russians will interpret these remarks as acceptance of the effort to (?fix) Latvia's citizenship and naturalization policy. The document emphasized that the Foreign Ministry wants to clarify Warren Christopher's comments on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvia and the Skrunda radar base. The U.S. Secretary of State (?had twice noted) the necessity of preserving the Russian troops at Skrunda, while hitherto Latvia has been convinced that the U.S. supports its efforts to demilitarize the Skrunda site. The remarks by the Secretary of State make one think the opposite. The Foreign Ministry urges a meeting of diplomatic representatives of Latvia and the USA to clarify their stances on the issues referred to, and to avert any possible misunderstandings.
