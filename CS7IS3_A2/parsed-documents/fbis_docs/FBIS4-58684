This means that the military situation has taken a grave turn, and that the Sanaa television building is being strafed by the southern warplanes. Fighting is still raging, and we can see this very clearly. As for the situation in Sanaa, I would say that guarded calm prevails in the capital, but the Yemeni citizens in the capital are afraid that the military situation will get worse, particularly considering the power outage and the shortage of gasoline. Official departments and businesses are closed. It is also observed that soldiers are patrolling all streets. Tanks are deployed in certain areas but not in the capital as some news agencies have reported. I personally did not see any tanks in the city center as I was leaving my hotel for the television building. [Tannuri] Tawfiq, can you contact Aden to learn about the latest developments there? [Jazulit] As correspondents, it is difficult to contact Aden in view of the fierce fighting raging in this area of Yemen. This also applies to any Yemeni official or citizen in Sanaa or in the northern provinces. [Tannuri] Do you know what the latest military situation on the combat lines is? [Jazulit] First, the southern Basahib brigade was completely destroyed following ferocious fighting that lasted until this morning. Second, some centers of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in Sanaa were destroyed by troops. Third, huge military units are advancing toward south Yemen to consolidate the al-'Amaliqah positions in the Abyan area. Fourth, the military fighting is revolving around Aden, which has been isolated from the outside world. Sanaa has dispatched additional troops to reinforce their positions in order to settle the battle in its favor. Fifth, the two sides are now using their air power, and military observers believe that YSP forces could enjoy superiority in this field. Sixth, the fierce fighting has spread to the various Yemeni provinces and military zones, except for Sanaa, where the sound of artillery is continuously heard. Seventh, we still do not know if the tribes are taking part in the fighting. As you can hear now [sound of explosion in the background], it seems that fighting has erupted anew in Sanaa. But I will continue my report. According to initial information, some tribes are taking part in the ongoing bloody struggle. Observers believe that the fighting between two regular armies might change to guerrilla warfare. I must stop now because it seems that fighting has intensified [sound of explosion in the background].
