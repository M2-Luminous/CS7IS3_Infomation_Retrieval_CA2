In a letter to Mr. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister said she had made the invitation in good faith and in the greater national interests. In her letter, she said a democratic government always works within constitutional framework. The last elections were the fairest since 1977 and its verdict has been acceptable to all. As regards your concerns about the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] assembly and other matters, she hoped you will seek relief through the courts of law or other constitutional mechanism available. It would be best for both of us to accept constitutional realities which cannot be subjected to political pressures. In view of your inability, I have directed the minister for finance to hold a meeting with your representative tomorrow at 0500 at the Q Block for this purpose.
