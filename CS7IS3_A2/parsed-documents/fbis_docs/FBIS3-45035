Addressing a meeting of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) which opened here today, ARATS President Wang Daohan said that his association was successful in its work in 1993. The association, a non-governmental body, serves to promote contacts across the Taiwan Straits and the eventual reunification of China. Wang praised the "Wang-Koo" [Gu] meeting -- a meeting between him and Koo Chen-fu [Gu Zhenfu], chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation from Taiwan, held in Singapore last year. "The meeting made it possible for high-ranking officials across the straits to discuss matters for the first time in the capacity of non-governmental officials," he said. That meeting marked a "major historical step" in the across- straits relations and a "new stage" in ARATS' work, he added. Wang Daohan said that Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen have paid close attention to ARATS' work and have issued instructions on its work. He also expressed thanks to Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren and to Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, for their contributions to the ARATS establishment and to its work. He said that during the ongoing meeting, participants will discuss ARATS' tasks in the new year and ways to improve ARATS' work, so that the organization will be able to play a greater role in promoting across-straits contacts and relations, and achieving peaceful reunification of the motherland. Wang expressed the belief that the deepening of the reform, opening wider to the outside world and rapid and steady growth of the economy in the mainland this year will certainly push forward the across-straits relations in the direction of peaceful reunification. According to participants, Jing Shuping will no longer serve as an ARATS vice-president on the grounds that he is now the chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Instead he will serve as an ARATS adviser. Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, will also serve as an ARATS adviser.
