Two years later, we can say that Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have managed to withstand this terrible pressure -- that is, that the sanctions have not accomplished their goal -- said Percevic, and added that Serbia had had a dignified response to this attempt at economic destruction. I believe that this latest economic program that is being implemented in Serbia represents an economic response to the attempt at economic genocide over our country and people, said SPS Vice President Goran Percevic, in a statement for Radio Belgrade on the second anniversary of the sanctions.
