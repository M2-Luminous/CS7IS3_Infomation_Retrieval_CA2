Zhilin: "It Is Impossible To Cooperate With Today's Authorities. What They Are Doing Is Not for the Good of the People"] [Text] Last week Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (USPP), made a brief visit to Donetsk. He met with members of the oblast association of leaders of enterprises and organizations. This visit from the ex-prime minister of Ukraine was no accident: On 14 April there will be a special congress of the USPP at which the critical condition of our Republic's economy and industry will be discussed. On that same day Leonid Kuchma met with journalists and answered their questions. In particular, the AKTSENT correspondent asked Kuchma the following questions: [AKTSENT] The present elections have shown that it is practically impossible to win without a powerful political organization. Will the present congress of industrialists and entrepreneurs not be the congress where a new political party is born? [Kuchma] I agree with you that without a strong party it is impossible to expect anything significant in the future. When I visited the Baltic countries, Estonia, and Lithuania, I was convinced of this once again because Brazauskas himself came to power precisely because his party had a majority in parliament. This is also why they could form their own government. In that kind of situation, it is possible to speak of something serious regarding questions of reforming the economy. But if there is no support in parliament, all your good intentions will remain on paper. I agree that we should think seriously about a party, but we are not ready for this yet. We do not plan to discuss this question at the congress. [AKTSENT] How do you evaluate the current makeup of the parliament today? [Kuchma] The tendencies of the new parliament are not very promising so far. It is quite probable that, on the one hand, the parliament will be too far to the right and, on the other, too far to the left. Of course, you know my viewpoint--people should not be included in the new parliament according to their political convictions, they should not be representatives of any particular party, but they should be people who can professionally work not so much in politics as in the economy, which today is on its last legs and is not working. [AKTSENT] Leonid Danilovich, you know that in Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts a referendum was held on a number of questions with which you are familiar. If you had voted in the Donbass how would you have responded to them? [Kuchma] My position on these issues is known. I have always been open and was one of the initiators of the alliance with both Russia and the CIS states, and I stand on that. I am not recanting even now. Regarding the Russian language, my position is this: I think there should be one state language, Ukrainian, but there should be two official languages--Russian and Ukrainian. What is an official state language? It is the language of diplomacy and laws. Everything else is in official languages, taking into account local conditions and peculiarities. I also support the land-federative structure. I am a proponent of having obligations and responsibility regarding many issues shifted to the regions... [AKTSENT] Does Ukraine need an industry that lives for itself and works for itself? [Kuchma] I have said and will say that we do not need that kind of industry, but we are not to blame for this, since we received fragments from the overall system of the former Soviet Union. It is impossible to restructure it in a single day. Structural rearrangement of industry takes time and money. At the same time we cannot simply close down the enterprises and throw the people out in the street... [AKTSENT] And if the enterprises are not making it? [Kuchma] Declare them bankrupt. I have expressed my opinion about this position many times in parliament. An analysis of the enterprises must be conducted in each branch. Enterprises that are operating at a loss or are unprofitable must be closed or reprofiled. Today the following situation has been created at many plants and mines in our country--here it is better to pay them the average wage than to pay to have them operate some how and produce products for which there is no demand. Today I have already given you the example of the Donbass. Here the coal industry was headed toward closure, dying out. It was planned to operate at a loss since immense coal deposits had been discovered in the Kuzbass where they use the open-pit method. But now coal is your future. But it takes investments to construct a modern new mine. Again I emphasize that we will not survive alone, the more so in our enclosed space. [AKTSENT] Do you have a program you are planning to bring to the new parliament as a people's deputy of the new convocation? [Kuchma] It is practically impossible to cooperate with our present executive branch because it does what it does not for the good of the people but for the opposite. I have already spoken about its program previously... [AKTSENT] Still what would you suggest as immediate steps to emerge from the crisis? [Kuchma] I think that today we must solve the problems that lie on the surface. Namely, we must finally determine which enterprises Ukraine needs and which it does not. This has to be done in order to understand who is who. Second, of course, we cannot change the situation without working capital. How can we solve this problem? Already, that is a different question. Third, is currency regulation. It too must be solved immediately since now the fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets to the dollar makes it so that all our products are exported at a loss. And, undoubtedly, we must consider a number of other questions as well, including taxation. [AKTSENT] When speaking in parliament, you have frequently repeated the question: Where is Ukraine going? So where is Ukraine going today? [Kuchma] Do you mean to ask what we are now building? I do not think there is either pure socialism or pure capitalism in the world today. Still capital has taken various of our achievements from the former Soviet Union and successfully applied them at home. Including a planned economy -- precisely planned. [AKTSENT] There has now been talk about the inexpediency of holding presidential elections. What is your opinion? [Kuchma] There is a law here and the law must be obeyed. Therefore, the presidential elections must take place. Here I fully share the opinion of Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. There are no grounds for not holding them. [AKTSENT] Ukraine also has an acute problem of nonpayments. Is there a program for this? [Kuchma] There is only one way out -- offsetting through bills of exchange and determining which enterprises are bankrupt, with all the consequences that ensue from this. [AKTSENT] How do you envisage the mechanism for the formation of the budget? [Kuchma] It must be formed from below, that is, begin with the regions so that they are interested in the distribution of productive forces. Now we have everything the other way around -- the main thing is not who works and how, but that everything is divided up per capita. This approach is absolutely incorrect. Here I think we must have a single principle for all: He who works better must also live better. [AKTSENT] Radio Liberty broadcast a report to the effect that there were various violations in the electoral precincts of your district, where you ran as a candidate people's deputy and won a victory. What do you have to say? [Kuchma] I never put out a single additional leaflet or uttered a single offensive word against my opponents. At the same time my opponents brought in mountains of various kinds of paper "garbage" and distributed it throughout the district. It would have been better for them to give notebooks and textbooks to the school children than to get involved in something like that.
