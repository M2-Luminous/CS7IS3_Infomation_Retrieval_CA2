Inseason Action 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 7 North Washington Coast Sport Fishery Closes A 3-day extension of the north Washington coast (waters west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line and south to the Queets River) sport halibut fishery during June 9 through June 11 resulted in a harvest of 10,649 lb (4.83 mt). This brings the season harvest to 65,298 lb (29.62 mt), 2,741 lb (1.24 mt) shy of the 68,039 lb (30.86 mt) catch limit. The remaining catch limit is too small to allow for a full day of fishing without exceeding the catch limit. Therefore, the sport halibut fishery in this area will remain closed for the remainder of 1994. Anglers landing in Neah Bay have caught an estimated 13,000 lb (5.90 mt) of Pacific halibut from Canadian waters. Fishing remains open in Canadian waters with a two-fish daily bag limit and no size restriction. Anglers desiring to fish in Canadian waters are strongly urged to contact Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans at (604) 666-0383/0583 for sport fishing information concerning licensing and the nautical description of closed areas. South Washington Coast Sport Fishery Closes Higher than expected effort in the south Washington coast (Queets River to Cape Falcon) sport halibut fishery led to 14,149 lb (6.42 mt) of halibut harvested in the June 2 and June 9 openings. This far exceeds the 5,670&hyph;lb (2.57 mt) catch limit; therefore sport fishing for halibut in this area will remainclosed for the remainder of 1994. Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound Sport Fishery Remains Open Sport fishing for halibut remains open in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound (waters east of a line from Bonilla Point, lat. 48 35 ’44 ’ ’ N., long. 124 43 ’00 ’ ’ W., to the buoy adjacent to Duntz Rock, lat. 48 24 ’55 ’ ’ N., long. 124 44 ’50 ’ ’ W., to Tatoosh Island lighthouse, lat. 48 23 ’30 ’ ’ N., long. 124 44 ’00 ’ ’ W., to Cape Flattery, lat. 48 22 ’55 ’ ’ N., long. 124 43 ’42 ’ ’ W.). The daily bag limit is one halibut of any size per person and is open 6 days a week (closed Wednesdays). This fishery will close, as scheduled, at 11:59 p.m. on July 5, 1994. Dated: July 6, 1994.
