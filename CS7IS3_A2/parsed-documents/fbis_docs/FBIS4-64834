According to the diplomat, three Serb judges took the decision in order to prolong the investigation which is not yet over. The date of the trial has not yet been set, Henri Jacolin added. Alain Juppe was the guest on Radio France Culture this morning. He came out in favor of a withdrawal of French UN troops within a reasonable time limit, should there be no real progress toward peace. Alain Juppe: [Begin Juppe recording] Today we have to make peace. France's aim is to act in such a way as to arrive at a peace settlement, a settlement that has to be based on a compromise. We have defined this compromise in a plan known as the European Union plan of action, which amounts to saying that we have to keep Bosnia as a state, that, within this Bosnia, each of the three communities must be able to administer itself as freely as possible, setting up a confederal or federal system of institutions, and designating territories. The sides have given their agreement to this outline, and that is what we are trying to do. We are not managing it at the moment, and I am very worried about the deterioration of the situation on the ground, and the way the diplomatic process is getting bogged down. We have to know that if we don't get there within a reasonable time, if this peace process cannot really get off the ground, if the great powers are not really ready to say to the belligerents -- Now you have to stop the war, and here are the conditions we propose in order to stop it -- I think France will change its attitude. It won't be able to keep UN troops on the ground indefinitely under the current circumstances, if there are no prospects for peace. [end recording]
