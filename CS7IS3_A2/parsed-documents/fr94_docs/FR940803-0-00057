(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions.'' (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7) which implements OMB Circular A&hyph;128, ``Audits of State and Local Governments.''

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31. §518.28 Period of availability of funds. Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency. Property Standards §518.30 Purpose of property standards. (a) Sections 518.31 through 518.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of §§518.31 through 518.37. §518.31 Insurance coverage. Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award. §518.32 Real property. Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.
