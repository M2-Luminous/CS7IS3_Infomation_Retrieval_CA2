This is how Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, answered to a question concerning memorandum on cooperation in the field of power engineering, which Britain and Azerbaijan signed earlier, at a Moscow briefing on Thursday. According to Karasin, the memorandum provides for holding talks for the purpose of working out agreements on cooperation in the field of prospecting for and extracting gas and oil in various areas including the so-called Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea. After the memorandum was signed, the Russian Foreign Ministry handed in a note to the British embassy, Karasin said. According to him, Russia pointed out in the note that the bottom of the Caspian sea is not divided into sectors, because the sea is by nature a sole reservoir with a united ecological system and represents an object for a joint use. Therefore, all the countries of the Caspian Sea region must be involved in making decisions with regard of all activities, including development, prospecting for and making use of the relevant natural resources.
