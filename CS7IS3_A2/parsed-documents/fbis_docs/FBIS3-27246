The regulations, expected to become effective on publication, will encourage foreign companies and individuals to invest in prospecting and mining China's mineral resources independently or through joint venture or cooperative projects, a ranking official said. The official said that the regulations "explicitly state the rights and responsibilities of foreign investors as well as the preferential treatment they are to receive for their investment." In drafting the regulations, he added, officials and experts at the ministry have also seen to it that they will be easy to apply. Over the years, many foreign companies have sent people to China to probe the possibility of investing in China's mining sector. But, said the official, "for lack of legislation, the sector has been behind other sectors in opening to the outside world." He noted that the "Law on Mineral Resources of the People's Republic of China," effective since 1986, contains no clause on foreign investment in the country's mining sector. The law has played a big role in promoting the development of the sector. But "it was formulated under the planned economy and some of its clauses are obviously obsolete and therefore need to be revised," the official said. The National People's Congress has included revisions of these clauses in the "mineral resources law" into its plans for legislation, the official disclosed. The State Council, for its part, has approved a set of regulations on the collection of mineral resources compensation fees, which will be published soon. The fees, explained the official, embody the rights of the nation to the ownership of the mineral resources and are meant to prevent undue mining. They will be used to cover part of the prospecting costs. Until now, mineral resources have been extracted free of charge. "We have to do away with this legacy of the planned economy, which often causes waste," he said. China depends on minerals for 95 percent of the energy and 80 percent of the industrial raw materials it needs. But its mineral resources are limited in relation to its vast population, the official pointed out.
