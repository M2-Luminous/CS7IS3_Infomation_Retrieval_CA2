Both sides quickened the pace of exchange, expanded the number of areas of cooperation, and diversified the forms of exchange and cooperation. So far, over 30 activities involving cross-strait academic and cultural exchange have been reported by newspapers and, more often than not, a variety of activities were conducted at the same time. Early this year, the China Beijing Opera Theater was invited to stage performances in Taiwan and a delegation of the Taiwan Cross-Strait Business Development Foundation visited Shanghai; the two events took place on both sides of the Taiwan Strait at the same time. In mid-January, mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong writers met in Taibei [Taipei] for a "symposium on Chinese novels"; meanwhile, mainland aeronautics and astronautics scholars arrived in Taiwan to attend a "cross-strait aeronautics and astronautics symposium." After that, a delegation of persons in charge of the central authorities' news units, a delegation of mainland writers, and a delegation of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY visited Taiwan at the same time. Such a situation--"good plays are successively staged one after another"--emerging from among cross-strait exchange activities reflects the ardent desire of the peoples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for contact with each other and for mutual understanding. As a result, the spheres of cross-strait academic and cultural exchanges have expanded. They involve scores of fields of endeavor, including the film and TV industry, publication, painting, sports, folk art, public health, environmental protection, and other sectors. A number of "first" exchange program activities appeared; a cross-strait aeronautics and astronautics symposium, a cross- strait insurance symposium, a cross-strait environmental protection symposium, a cross-strait operation and management symposium, and a cross-strait symposium on archives management and microphotography were held for the first time. In mid-February, famous mainland and Taiwan actors and actresses of Henan opera gave a performance on the same stage for the first time and, at the end of March, a Taiwan delegation of machine tool manufacturers arrived in the mainland for an exhibition for the first time. As the spheres of cross-strait exchanges expanded, the forms of exchange gradually diversified. Mainland and Taiwan folk artists gave performances on the same stage; the mainland and Taiwan cooperated with each other in producing special albums for vocalists and in selling them concurrently in both places; the Taiwan Television Enterprise invited mainland actors and actresses to cooperate in shooting films; mainland publications were on display in Taiwan; and mainland and Taiwan Red Cross societies jointly organized winter camping activities for youngsters. Symposiums and exhibitions accounted for most of the various forms of activities because both sides could learn from each other by exchanging views, use each other's experiences for reference, learn from the others' strong points to offset one's weaknesses, and jointly make improvements through these forms of exchange. Two-way exchanges in a number of spheres between the mainland and Taiwan also enjoyed new developments. Despite the fact that the mainland and Taiwan have conducted exchanges of news for several years, the visit to Taiwan by a delegation of persons in charge of the central authorities' press units signified a breakthrough. It is a consensus among scientists and technologists on the mainland and in Taiwan to strengthen cross-strait scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation. The visit to Taiwan made by Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ouyang Zhongmou, president of the China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation, this year promoted cross-strait scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation to a new level. However, the Taiwan authorities are still setting up obstacles to cross-strait exchange. Recently, the Taiwan authorities attempted to use the "Qiandao Lake Incident" as an excuse to suspend cross-strait cultural exchanges and to boycott tourists' travel to the mainland and economic exchanges. This entirely runs counter to the interests and desire of the peoples on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It is hoped that the Taiwan authorities will lift unreasonable restrictions and promote more rapid development of cross-strait academic and cultural exchanges.
