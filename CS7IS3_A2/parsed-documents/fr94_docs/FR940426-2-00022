ACTION: Notice of unsolicited financial assistance award. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14, the Department of Energy, Boston Support Office, intends to award a grant to the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates (NASUCA). The grant will provide funding in the amount of $200,000 for a project entitled: Photovoltaics Education Project (PVEP). The work will address various research and evaluation tools to identify the realistic values, benefits and costs of Photovoltacis. The proposal proposes to educate, train, and support state-appointed utility consumer advocates in evaluating cost effective installations of photovoltacis and enable them to have full participation in hearings and in the collaborative process. DOE knows of no other entity that is conducting or planning to conduct such an effort. This project is suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. The initial budget period will be twelve (12) months from the effective date of award. The project is expected to run for six years. Possible additional funding in future years will be based on satisfactory completion of the initial term and upon availability of funds.
