Since the Japan-U.S. economic consultations broke down, the U.S. retaliatory measures against Japan, as seen in the high-yen offensive, have been growing on a daily basis. It is time for Japan to consider taking some actions. The government, at an informal meeting of foreign economy issues-related ministers on 25 February, agreed to expedite actions in four areas, like deregulation, but it was assumed that specific plans would be completed by the end of March. But with the U.S. offensive intensifying, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has announced preparation of the specific plans would be hurried. The government offices concerned, meanwhile, are lost. They cannot come up with any good ideas. A senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, "After all, the Japan-U.S. summit decided we should have a cooling-down period. Right now, there is nothing." On the other hand, some of the officials charged with the Japan-U.S. consultations complained, "To be absorbed only in a cabinet reshuffle at a time like this can mean forgetting about Japan-U.S. relations." The cabinet reshuffle plan eventually was given up, but many people think the leadership and gathering power of the prime minister are bound to erode. These people felt uneasy, and said, "According to the way things are going, the restoration of relations with the United States will only be delayed. The situation is now so bad that if we do not do something, we can end up in a trade war." Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] was pleased with the outcome, saying, "This was better than having the coalition be damaged by enforcing the reshuffle." The MOF officials had strongly hoped that Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii (of Shinseito), who himself once was a bureaucrat serving in the ministry, would "be retained." There is even a mood of welcoming this development, as such. But in the ministry there is a voice expressing concern that the restoration of relations between Prime Minister Hosokawa and his housekeeper, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, which have soured would "be very difficult," according to a senior official of the ministry's Budget Bureau. The MOF has tended to work closely with Shinseito and Komeito in the past to get its economic policies adopted. The same ministry official said, "It is possible that the rift within the Prime Minister's Office will impact adversely on the Diet deliberations on the 1994 budget."
