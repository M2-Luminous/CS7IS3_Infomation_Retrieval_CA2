Development, testing, presentation, and dissemination of model programs directed at the role of State courts in effectively addressing violent crime against women, including training for State judges and court personnel in the laws of the States regarding rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes of violence motivated by the gender of the victim, which may include information on: the nature and incidence of such offenses, their impact on the victim and on society, the psychology of persons who commit these offenses and its implications for sentencing, the use of expert witnesses in trials of these offenses, the imposition of limits on the testimony or cross-examination of victims, the reasons why such offenses may be underreported and why victims may decline to testify, the use of protective orders, and related topics; and 21. Other programs, consistent with the purposes of the State Justice Institute Act, as may be deemed appropriate by the Institute, including projects dealing with the relationship between Federal and State court systems in areas where there is concurrent State-Federal jurisdiction and where Federal courts, directly or indirectly, review State court proceedings. Funds will not be made available for the ordinary, routine operation of court systems or programs in any of these areas. B. Special Interest Program Categories 1. General Description The Institute is interested in funding both innovative programs and programs of proven merit that can be replicated in other jurisdictions. Although applications in any of the statutory program areas are eligible for funding in FY 1995, the Institute is especially interested in funding those projects that: a. Formulate new procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing arrangements to improve the courts; b. Address aspects of the State judicial systems that are in special need of serious attention; c. Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and techniques that may be used in other States; and d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions. A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts. Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the rating process. (See the selection criteria listed in sections VI.B., ``Concept Paper Submission Requirements for New Projects,'' and VIII.B., ``Application Review Procedures.'')
