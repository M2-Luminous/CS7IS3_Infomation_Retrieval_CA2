Katyal: "Stabilizing Ties With China"] [Text] It is a measure of stability of the Sino-Indian relations that there was no undue despair over the limited progress by their experts, at their meeting last week to sort out differences over the expansion of confidence building measures [CBMs] along the border. On the contrary, the headlines on the conclusion of their two days' discussions were based on a positive but general comment of the Foreign Office spokesman--that both sides had adopted a "constructive and forward-looking approach." He need not have taken shelter behind these cliches. The slow advance in the negotiations on sensitive matters, connected with the advanced stage of the CBMs, is unlikely to cause a misunderstanding. On the contrary, there is the danger of avoidable suspicion if official remarks are seen as glossing over specifics. The experts, a mixed group of diplomats and military personnel, met as a follow-up of the agreement, reached during the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to China in September last year, through which the two sides formalised their resolve to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control. The agreement, it was stated then, had established a framework, but details were to be settled in keeping with the principle of "mutual and equal security." The "depth, timing and nature" of the reduction of forces--to cite one measure--were to be settled through mutual discussions. Going by official statements (and also what was left unstated) at the time of Mr. Rao's visit, the experts were to sort out differences on the alignment of the LAC [Line of Actual Control], reducing the military forces along it and the modalities for re-deployment, so as to end the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation (in some cases). The last task would also involve relocation of border posts. This is not an easy job, complicated as much by the background of confrontation as by the terrain where equality in the depth of withdrawal could confer unequal advantages on the two sides. The negotiations, therefore, were bound to be hard and tough and even the next round may not be final. This should not cause dismay, much less alarm. On the contrary, it is a matter of satisfaction that persisting differences are contained within the framework for negotiations and do not disturb either the peace in the border region or the CBMs, already in place. The two sides may not have yet pulled out troops in conformity with a mutually agreed plan but were known to have effected withdrawal on the basis of their respective, independent assessments. The steps already taken or intended to be taken (subject to the mutual agreement) are no flash-in-pan affair but are anchored in the political understanding borne out of contacts at various levels, from the top downward. It had been an incremental process that promoted amity not only on border-related issues but in most of the bilateral field. The border has been tension-free now for years and even those Western correspondents, who specialised in predicting conflict and hostilities in the late Eighties on the strength of the flimsiest of pointers, have not predicted a clash. The contacts between the commanders and other related steps involved the military forces in the institutionalised arrangement to maintain peace in the border areas. It worked well and was gradually expanded. What is now being attempted is a further expansion, based on a firmer basis. The progress and the positive results achieved in this case encouraged New Delhi to suggest an identical arrangement to Pakistan to stabilise the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. This was the subject-matter of one of the six proposals, conveyed to Islamabad last month for a smooth working arrangement. The most comprehensive document, it was virtually in the form of a draft agreement, based as it was on the parallel with the Sino-Indian border. The LAC in Jammu and Kashmir, as a matter of fact, is already demarcated, with the two sides committed to respecting it under the Shimla Agreement. The fact that there are no ambiguities about it should have been an advantage but, in the context of distrust and acrimony, the deadlock persists. The involvement of the military establishments in the Sino-Indian contacts is comparatively a recent development. The interaction began in the late Eighties but picked up in the aftermath of the positive process set in motion in December 1988 by the China visit of the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. It got a new impetus in 1992 by the Beijing trip of the Defence Minister of the day, Mr. Sharad Pawar. Mr. Pawar's move, itself, followed contacts at other levels--the 1990 visit to China of a team of the National Defence College and a return trip here by a delegation of the Chinese National Defence University. Recently, the military exchanges got a new spurt--with a visit by the Chinese Vice Chief of the Army Staff here after a gap of some 30 years and calls for the Chinese naval ships at Bombay after four decades. This is a matter of satisfaction, but not of euphoria. There are certain features of China's policies which cannot but cause worry here. China, as is known, had been of crucial help to Pakistan by providing it nuclear know-how. But for it, Islamabad, perhaps, would not have achieved the present level of development of its nuclear capability. Recently Chinese supplies of M-11 missiles to Pakistan not only caused nervousness here but also attracted the notice of the United States--it was regarded a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), to which Beijing is a party. China, of course, does not see anything unusual in it--this and other supplies are described as commercial deals, and as the Chinese Ambassador in New Delhi, Mr. Ruisheng Cheng, said the other day, India could be a buyer of the military hardware if it desired. China's nuclear capability--and its leaps forward--could not but be a source of discomfort to India. The installation of nuclear weapons in Tibet merely demonstrated the meaning of the Chinese programme for India. It could not be directed at major powers in the West. The other nations which should be worried are Japan and the ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nations] countries. But, surprisingly, both China, a nuclear power, and, Japan a non-nuclear power are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and often lecture India on the virtues of acceding to the treaty. Logically, Japan should have a better appreciation of India's concerns but, perhaps because of pressures from Washington and others in the industrialised world, it echoes their exhortations to New Delhi. The ASEAN members have big economic stakes in China in the wake of its gigantic reform and liberalisation processes. This tends to submerge the concerns over Beijing's nuclear policies and related matters. But, in their heart of hearts, there is a desire to balance a forward-looking China with some other power--India could be one--now that the United States has curtailed its presence in the region. The bilateral relations between countries are seldom a black-or-white affair, but a mix of the positive and the negative, the comforting and the worrisome. The Sino-Indian ties are no exception, and if there are incongruities in the different elements of the total relationship, it should be taken as a normal feature. The mutually conflicting strands manifest themselves in varied forms. Take the case of India and its stand on the NPT. When pressured by the Western nations to accede to the treaty or accept its regional variant, India pleads its inability to do so because of its security concerns. New Delhi wants them to take into account the China factor. And they turn round and say: "But haven't you normalised your relations with China? Have you not agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border?" Not long ago, Pakistan-China relationship was India's major worry. Because of their shared antipathy to India, the two countries found several convergence points in their neighbourhood policies. Pakistan achieved a major success by securing China's public support on the Kashmir and other problems with India. Beijing did not mince words in backing the demand for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Also, other neighbours like Nepal made full use of the China card against India. No such voices emanate from Beijing now. China supports the idea of a solution of Kashmir and other issues through direct, bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan. It sees no other role for itself--certainly not as a mediator. During her recent visit to Beijing, the Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, failed to secure China's support on these matters. But otherwise Sino-Pakistan warmth remains undiminished. And what about the United States and China? With all the talk against the human rights record of China, the United States has not hesitated in forging close trade ties with it. It is a new, pragmatic pattern--and Sino-Indian ties fit into it with several pluses--but with some minuses.
