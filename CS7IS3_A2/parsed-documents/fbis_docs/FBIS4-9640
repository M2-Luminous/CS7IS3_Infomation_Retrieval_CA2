That brought the unemployment rate down from 12.8 to 12.6 percent. All this came to light from the report of the National Labor Affairs Center (OMK). The OMK data reveal that with the present decline, which appears to be stable, unemployment has entered a new phase. For there were 74,000 fewer unemployed at the end of February of this year than a year earlier. Although the number of registered unemployed persons continues to vary by regions, the extreme regional differences appear to have narrowed. The biggest decline in the number of registered unemployed occurred mostly in Bacs-Kiskun and Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen Counties. The situation remains the worst in Szabolcs County. In metropolitan Budapest as well as in Pest, Gyor-Moson-Sopron, Vas, and Zala counties the situation is better than the national average. The number of unemployed new entrants into the job market also declined, albeit more moderately. Their closing total at the end of the month eased from 61,000 to 60,000, and their proportion within the total number of unemployed dropped from 9.6 to 9.5 percent. OMK experts claim that all this can be attributed to the programs for retraining. We also learned that, among the unemployed other than new entrants into the job market, there are respectively fewer former agricultural workers and construction workers. On the other hand there are more unemployed persons who previously had worked in industry or in nonmaterial services. During February, nearly 44,000 persons left the system of provisions for the unemployed. The average length of time an unemployed persons remains within this system continued to shorten. According to the economic players who are obliged to file notice of their intentions to lay off workers, 26,000 workers can be expected to be laid off in the near future.
