The agreement came at a meeting Friday between floor leaders Rep. Yi Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal Party and Rep. Kim Tae-sik of the Democratic Party. The meeting was called to discuss issues the two sides left out when they adopted revised political bills in a special National Assembly session which ended Friday night. The floor leaders agreed to have the Legislation and Judiciary Committee undertake preliminary work on possible revision or abolition of the security law. The National Security Law entered the spotlight in recent days when Secretary of State Warren Christopher and another senior U.S. official urged South Korea to repeal the law as part of efforts to improve human rights. The law, enacted to deter North Korean espionage and other seditious activities against the South, was often perceived as an instrument of human rights abuses by past administrations headed by retired generals. "The floor leaders of the two parties have agreed to let the Legislation and Judiciary Committee form a subcommittee to discuss the National Security Law as they agreed to do so in principle last year," said Kim Tae-sik. As a result, the committee is scheduled to hold a plenary session Saturday to form the proposed subcommittee. The two parties agreed to discuss possible revision or abolition of the law last year when the National Assembly revised the law on the Agency for National Security Planning.
