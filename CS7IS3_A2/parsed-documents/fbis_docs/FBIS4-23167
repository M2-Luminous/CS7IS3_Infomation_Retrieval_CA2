Members of the armed wings of the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress would arrive shortly from Tanzania, said Lt-Col Brian du Toit, media spokesman of the Joint Operations Centre at Walmanstal. Walmanstal, north of Pretoria, was the first base activated to train non-statutory force (NSF) members for eventual integration into the South African National Defence Force [SANDF]. An advance party of the Walmanstal non-statutory forces had been sent to Hoedspruit to assist in preparation of the assembly point. They would complete their orientation training together with the new arrivals, Col du Toit said. "Once the process of documentation and initial training has been completed suitable candidates will be offered a service contract with the SANDF and will then proceed with his/her career training." A joint operations centre consisting of SANDF and NSF personnel had been established to co-ordinate all queries, control and disciplinary actions at Hoedspruit, Col du Toit said. The Hoedspruit base would eventually accommodate 1,500 troops, he added. Col du Toit told SAPA about 6,400 soldiers were currently accommodated at Walmanstal and "things were running pretty smoothly". The third base earmarked earlier as an assembly point, Bourke's Luck, would not be activated because it was not economically viable, he said.
