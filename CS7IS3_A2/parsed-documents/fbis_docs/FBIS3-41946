We hope that our partners in nuclear arms negotiations will appreciate this unilateral step, he said. Shmarov said that the deactivation of missiles was a labor-intense process, however, Ukraine was well aware of that, when it made the decision. The Vice Premier said that in 1994 the rest of the SS-24 missiles stationed in Ukraine must be deactivated. Shmarov also said that Russian experts continued to service nuclear warheads in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Vice Premier dismissed as populist and senseless the Russian government's statement to the effect that such servicing had been stopped. In the course of trilateral talks, American, Ukrainian and Russian delegates had in Kiev last week progress was achieved in resolving the problem of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, Shmarov said. For instance, he said, the question of compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear arms removed earlier, became specific. For instance, Ukraine said it would agree to accept a smaller compensation, if Russia were to write off Ukraine's debt to it. The sides achieved understanding on the need to hand over to Ukraine enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear warheads. Shmarov said that Ukrainian experts had computed the amount. "Probably that uranium will be processed and handed over to the United States under a Russian-US contract," Shmarov said. The United States Deputy Defence Secretary William Perry is reported to have said during the talks that Washington was considering an additional 400 million dollars in compensation to Ukraine for nuclear disarmament. So far the United States has given Ukraine 175 million dollars under the Nunn-Lugar amendment in technical and other assistance for removing nuclear missiles from Ukraine.
