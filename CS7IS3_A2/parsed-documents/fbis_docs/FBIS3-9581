As Dusan Koledzaj, director of the Slovak Finance Ministry's Capital Market Department, informed TA SR yesterday, this temporary measure went into effect as of 18 March 1994. The minister had been asked to take this step by Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of national property, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry into privatization projects approved by the previous government of Vladimir Meciar after 15 February, until the ministry's analysis is wound up. [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 24 March on page 2 carries a 250-word TA SR report entitled "Inquiry Into Privatization." The report quotes Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of national property, as having told a news conference on 23 March that Prime Minister Meciar's government "approved approximately 45 privatization projects after 15 February, of which an estimated third do not conform to existing legislation." Janicina also said that those privatization projects that are "in conformity with the law and morality" will be respected.]
