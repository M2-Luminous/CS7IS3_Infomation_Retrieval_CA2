This is what he said in a talk with Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], in Tbilisi on 6 May. "Our republics need support; then Russia will also take them into consideration," he said. The foreign minister suggested "a program of the West comparable to the Marshall Plan for setting up market economy infrastructures." He said that this was particularly necessary for the "explosive" Caucasus region. Following his two-day visit to Tbilisi where he also met with chief of state Eduard Shevardnadze, Vogel planned to fly on to Moldova on 6 May.
