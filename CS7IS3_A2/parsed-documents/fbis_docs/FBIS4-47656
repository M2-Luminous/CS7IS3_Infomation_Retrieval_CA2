Two shells hit the Sainte-Famille Church in downtown Kigali Sunday where more than 2,000 people fleeing the fighting between government forces and Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels had found shelter. The UN mission said it could not determine the origin of the fire. UN special envoy Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said the latest attack again targeted civilians who were "innocent victims of a war they do not want." He urged the warring parties not to attack civilians. Within the last two weeks shells have also hit the Roi Faycal hospital and the Amahoro de Kigali stadium, killing more than 60 people. More than 12,000 people mostly Tutsis, fleeing massacres perpetrated by the armed forces and Hutu militias, have found shelter in these two facilities under UN protection.
