Mrs Bottomley's name was in a notebook found in a jacket allegedly belonging to Patrick Hayes, 41, accused of planting the bomb at the Knightsbridge store, said Mr John Bevan, prosecuting at the Old Bailey. Two newspaper articles about Mrs Rimington, from THE GUARDIAN, including one with her picture, were also found. Hayes had allegedly written on them details of her supposed address. There were also, on cigarette paper in a vacuum cleaner dustbag, details of senior Army officers, some taken from the SHOOTING TIMES. Other documents recorded details of lavatories in London hotels. Mr Bevan added: "Bombs in hotels are obviously totally indiscriminate." Mr Bevan said the notebook could "fairly be described as a hit list." The jury was told that the Canary Wharf tower in east London, Europe's second tallest building, "miraculously" escaped devastation from a huge IRA fertiliser bomb when a detonator went off but failed to ignite the main explosives. The bomb was similar to other home-made IRA bombs which twice devastated the City of London and also wrecked the Staples Corner junction of the M1 in north London. Mr Bevan said Hayes, one of two Englishmen accused of being IRA bombers, could be linked to the conspiracy to bomb Canary Wharf. Hayes is alleged to have planted a bomb which injured four people at the Harrods store in Knightsbridge in January last year. He was allegedly captured on video film with Jan Taylor, 51, a former soldier. The pair are also said to have bombed a train from Victoria to Ramsgate in Kent in February last year. Their capture, at Hayes's home in Walford Road, Stoke Newington, north London, in March last year after the Harrods films were released to the media, enabled police to capture guns, explosives and bomb-making equipment. It also brought together two previously separate terrorist investigations: Operations Brompton, springing from the Harrods and Rarnsgate explosions, and Canary, probing the tower bomb and other bombs found in Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park in north London, the jury was told. Hayes has refused to plead on what he says are "political matters" but not guilty pleas have been entered for him, alone, on allegations of three conspiracies to bomb Canary Wharf, Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park. Pleas of not guilty have also been entered for Taylor, of Stepney, east London, jointly charged with Hayes of eight further counts, including bombing Harrods and the train and firearms offences. The trial was adjourned until today.
