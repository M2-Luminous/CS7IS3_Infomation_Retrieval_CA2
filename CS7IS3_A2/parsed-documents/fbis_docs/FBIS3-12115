According to the government, sales might be possible only if Cuba complies with conditions established by Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] for the sale of crude on the international markets. A spokesman for the [word indistinct] ministry said no concessions will be made. According to official sources, Cuba has offered to cover the cost of the negotiations with sugar, in a three-party transaction that is not acceptable to Colombia. The island government would reportedly sell sugar -- the island's main source of currency -- at low prices to a third country. That nation, which has not been further identified, would resell the sugar on the international market. With the proceeds from the sale, this nation would then pay Colombia for the oil sold to Cuba. An official spokesman said: We prefer a letter of credit. As long as there are no payment guarantees, there will be no negotiations. He explained that until now President Castro's government has not made another proposal. The failure of the negotiations, which are now practically suspended, would not be due to international pressures exerted after the negotiations were announced but because Ecopetrol's conditions for negotiations of this type have not been met, the government said.
