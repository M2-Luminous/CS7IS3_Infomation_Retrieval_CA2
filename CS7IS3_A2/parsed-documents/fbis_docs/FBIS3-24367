After the Soviets had been dispersed (it is difficult to use any other term), similar kray, oblast, and city Dumas, boards, hurals, etc., etc. are supposed to be -- in the minds of the new "constitutionalists" who seized the upper hand over the Soviet authority in October of last year -- from now on the representative authority at the regional level. They are supposed to be, so to speak, a balance to the executive authority. Although what kind of "balance" can that be, if their weight categories are simply not comparable? It's like the elephant and the mosquito. The executive authority long ago become overgrown to its indecently swollen state, and more and more departments are multiplying more rapidly than rabbits. Incidentally, there were supposed to be a total of 21 "Duma men" in that same Pskov Assembly, of whom only eight were "with portfolio," that is, salaried. So just try "balancing" this incomplete platoon with an army of officials which, a very long time ago, became crowded in the thick-walled building of the former cadet corps that, quite recently, used to be called the oblast House of Soviets. It makes you wonder whether the "Duma men" will become such important, but, alas, decorative farces majeures under the ruling "court" for the purpose of playing ring-around-the-rosy there. As for the ring-around-the-rosy, there have already been precedents. You might recall that, at the dawn of perestroyka, its "romantic Rastrelli" reproached the Soviets, coupled with the trade unions and public organizations: don't play ring-around-the-rosy with us "prorabs [work superintendents] of perestroyka, but toughen up! Fight for people and for their welfare, without worrying about your own stomach! But they did not take heed... It was all in vain. They played ring-around-the-rosy... The Soviets do not exist as a political force -- it took just one rescript to flatten them like an importunate fly. The trade unions also do not really exist any more, and those that do are completely remote from real life... But this is really apropos. Let's return to the Pskov election. It was the first election to be held in Russia. It was Saturday. I'm sitting there, drinking my tea... The voting district where I am registered is around the corner, in a nearby school. I wonder whether or not I should go there. I recall how many times during the past two years the authority had called me, requested me, and entreated me to go to the ballot box so that I could give it my mandate to do what it later would attempt to do in order to make my life happy and cloudfree. But it is becoming not better, but increasingly difficult to live from day to day. So I'm sitting there, drinking my tea, and looking out of the window. I recall how, a month and a half earlier, when our last and decisive fight in front of the ballot boxes was announced again, people in the dark morning hours (it was, after all, December) walked single-file across my courtyard on their way to the school. But today it is already the middle of the day, and there don't seem to be many citizens who are inspired by the election. Just one or two, and that's it. My contemplative tea-drinking was suddenly disturbed. The local television company broke off its broadcast on the Russia-wide channel, and a member of the okrug electoral commission appeared on the screen: my dear voters, he says with a somewhat reproachful tone of voice, it might be a good time to remind you about performing your civic duty, rather than beating all your carpets and vacuuming your rooms. The voting, he said, is being discontinued so that it looks as though it might be necessary to hold a re-election, once again at the expense of you taxpayers. I must confess that this pressure upon my freedom of choice, this unceremonious conduct, coupled with the threat to empty once again my already empty pocket, irked me. And if this had happened in the much vaunted Western democracies, it certainly wouldn't have done much good for the frisky guy from the electoral commission. Because he broke the citizens' right: to vote for, or against, or not at all. And that "hand-breaker" who had smashed the voter's hands would have been fired and given a big fine,, and the election results would have been disputed in court. But that is how "they" do it... In our country, on the other hand, people, even though they are not well versed with regard to their electoral right, are nevertheless hardened -- they were not even afraid of those goadings from the television set. The result was the complete failure of the election in Pskov, in Velikiye Luki (and there approximately one-third of the electoral oblast), and this predetermined the failure of the election to the oblast assembly. But in the rural rayons, on the other hand, the activity was sufficient, and their residents gave mandates to their 13 emissaries to the oblast parliament. (More later about why that occurred.) However, there was just one mandate lacking to get the quorum necessary to proclaim the oblast assembly of deputies. Therefore the oblast parliament has not yet occurred, and a re-election has been scheduled for 27 March. That is enough time also to think a bit about why today's voter "does not have any respect for mandates," and about where the pointer of the political barometer in the province is currently pointing. At a session of the okrug electoral commission the election results were evaluated as a surprise. A few people also mentioned the reason why the people had "voted with their feet": they said that, both in Pskov and in Velikiye Luki, on the eve of the election not only the so-called "budget people," but also the workers at many plants and factories, had not received their wages. And if that is so, then why the hell do we need an authority that does not pay us for our work? They explained that people have got completely tired of elections, referendums, and also those that only worsen the Russia-wide crisis. It was noted that even the day -- Saturday -- had been poorly chosen. And was it really a good idea to come out with this election "ahead of all of Russia"? Especially so early, in January, when nothing, not even the budget, was yet definite. Well, there probably is a grain of truth in these explanations (true, they were made after the fact). They would have been exhaustive if the executive authority -- and it was precisely that authority that became the lead horse in holding the election campaign -- would honestly admit that this time it had been undone by impatience. They thought that people had not yet recovered after the December "presidential triumph" and once again would obediently do what they were told to do. But it did not happen... By and large, the voters in the major cities "voted with their feet" against the unbearable living conditions today. They voted against the reforms being carried out hurriedly, high-handedly, at a full gallop. And, finally, the impoverished people, who in addition are under the threat of complete unemployment tomorrow, oppose such attacks. Are we really supposed to believe that there is anyone who does not understand this yet? Just as, incidentally, the fact that the voters lowered the boom on the way to the seats in the oblast parliament to those contenders for those seats who include themselves in the "democratic" camp. And with what a clamor they had been making their way there! With what "programs"! One contender beat himself on the chest, swearing that he would become the only defender of all the offended and abused. Another one promised in a single blow to end all the political battles that had brought the country and the oblast to collapse. And still another one, a businessman, planned to start a "vendetta" against bureaucrats of all kinds. What scope, what boldness of ideas! One might think that this was not an oblast assembly with a clearly delineated scope of competency that the person was dashing into, but at least some European parliament. "All this, my friend, is words, words, words," Pushkin used to say, and so the voter proved to be nobody's fool. He saw through the blabbermouths with their promises. The rating that most of the "Pskov fathers of democracy" got was bad enough for them to shoot themselves. They were not even helped by the "letters of recommendation" from the Moscow "fathers of democracy and apostles of reforms," that were widely printed in the local newspapers. Yes, that is what the general practice is now -- "just like in the better homes..." Previously the recommendations used to be given there to all the governesses, intellectuals not of noble birth, and beginning clerks who were seeking work with ruined petty-bourgeois noblemen... Today they also are taking care of "their own," but it is their own from one political clan. True, it is with the proviso that this "tutor" serves the clan loyally. Unfortunately, the undertaking with these letters also was unsuccessful. As they say, this is a matter not just of cash, but also of the Moscow "wedding generals" who once again got into a mess with their wards, this time having proven at the regional level that they always, in any pre-election battles, superciliously underestimate the voter, refusing the "man in the street" the right to decide for himself what is what. And now let us consider this from the position of the oblast "province," those 13 rural electoral districts where the election to the oblast assembly took place. In and of itself, the fact that the "province" had gone to the ballot boxes is not really surprising. Even in these harrowing times, the ordinary peasant understands that it is impossible to live without authority. With authority, things are more reliable. But whether the authority always worries about the peasant is another question. So he went to the ballot box, taking with him possibly his last hope that now Moscow would know what was pressing down on the peasant, and that his own homegrown people would do everything to stand up for him. So he chose. Whom? The one who is well aware of whom he can trust, to whom he is accustomed to go with every need of his. Well, actually, why is there a need for some kind of laudatory indulgence from some high and mighty "democrat" flitting around the Moscow corridors? Why does Ivan Mikhaylovich Semenov, director of the Vyazye State Pedigree Stock Farm, need it, if the voters of Dedobichskiy and Dnovskiy rayons know him as an excellent specialist, organizer, and understanding person? If Vyazye, even today, in the grip of stifling reforms, continues to be famous for its superelite pure-bred hogs which foreigners envy! Or Gennadiy Aleksandrovich Sharstuk, chairman of the Pamyat Ilicha Kolkhoz, Pechorskiy Rayon, a young, energetic person who, during his short period of time as chairman, has completed the construction of an excellent settlement on half the kolkhoz -- why does he need it?.. Or Aleksandr Ivanovich Bukashkin, who took the Truzhenik Kolkhoz out of his father's hands and improved the farm... It is the deeds themselves and the Christian spirit of these and other agrarians that are the best propaganda for them. Incidentally, the rural candidates, unfortunately, could not even count on those propaganda "volleys" by which many of their urban associates literally deafened their voters. But the only funny thing that happened is that, having lost, certain city-dweller candidates immediately began crying, "Who will give me back those `lemons' that were spent on the importunate `Choose me, choose me...'?" Because it turns out that that's how much a seat in the oblast parliament costs -- a paltry two or three million. And that is not including the funds that were officially allocated to the oblast election along the line of Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission]. Funds, we might note, that were tremendous. But the "bird of happiness tomorrow," fortunately, is in the possession of those who were chosen. It is gratifying that, among them, more than a third are pure agrarians. And this is symptomatic: in an agrarian oblast, it would seem, the people who are running the dance, in the good sense of the word, should be people not from the asphalt, but people from the land, people from behind the plow. It is good that the legitimate deputies to the oblast assembly have already realized that and have offered the administration a package of documents pertaining to the fate of the agrarian reform in Pskov Oblast. Without waiting for the March re-election, they are already holding their working meetings, gradually developing the drafts of working documents for the oblast "Duma." People like this are not accustomed to let things get mired down in empty talking. Thank God!
