The U.S. Justice Department will soon ask each construction firm to comply with the U.S. demand for compensatory damages through process attorneys. It is said the U.S. Justice Department plans to file a suit with a Japanese court against 70 Japanese construction firms for compensatory damages. In 1989, the U.S. Government filed a suit against Japanese general contractors for rigging bids for a construction project at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Station, but the U.S. Government dropped the suit following an out-of-court settlement. This is the first time that the Clinton administration has decided to take legal action against Japanese construction firms for rigging bids. The prevailing view is that the "exposure" of the bid-rigging by the U.S. Justice Department is an indication that the Clinton administration has embarked on the offensive against Japan following the breakdown of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and the break off of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. The United States, which revived the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, is believed to have adopted a strategy to bring the Japanese keiretsu [interlocking corporate grouping] and bid-rigging structure to light by taking forcible measures to expose bid-rigging, and to open the Japanese market by hinting at the possibility of slapping sanctions on Japan in accordance with the provision. The same government source said the U.S. Justice Department claimed the Japanese construction firms have been engaged in bid- rigging for six years between 1984 and 1990 in connection with the construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station. The U.S. Justice Department also asserted that 70 Japanese construction companies, including Nishimatsu Construction Company, Obayashi Corporation, and Penta-Ocean Construction Company, have formed a cartel and, as a result, the U.S. Government has been unfairly forced to pay 1.1 billion yen more than ordinary prices. According to the U.S. side, Japanese construction firms have rigged bids for contracts for construction projects at three U.S. military bases of Yokosuka, Yokota and Sasebo. In the case of Yokosuka Naval Station, the Fair Trade Commission ordered 70 Japanese construction firms involved in the bid-rigging to pay penalty fees totalling 289.890 million yen after confirming their involvement in the bid-rigging. The Japanese construction firms later paid compensation of 4.7 billion yen to the U.S. Government at the end of an out-of-court settlement. The Fair Trade Commission has yet to confirm their involvement in the bid-rigging in connection with the construction of facilities at Atsugi Naval Station. Therefore, the government plans to investigate facilities constructed by the Japanese construction firms, their bidding prices, and the possibility of their violation of the Antimonopoly Law.
