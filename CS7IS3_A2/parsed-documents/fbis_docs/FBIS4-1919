It earnestly studied and implemented the guidelines of the National United Front Work Conference and Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech. It also planned for relevant work for the next stage, closely integrating Tibet's actual conditions and studying the situation and tasks for Tibet's united front work in the new era. Deepening and implementing the national and regional meetings' guidelines on united front work, bringing every positive factor into play, as well as strengthening the unity of all party and nonparty nationalities and people will definitely further consolidate and develop stability and unity. It will also quicken the pace of reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as initiate a new prospect for Tibet's united front work. United front work, which the party established under Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership, is an important magic weapon for achieving victory for our country's revolution and construction. Due to historical and social reasons, there is a special position and role for Tibet's united front work. The work consistently came under the kind attention and direct guidance of Mao Zedong and other revolutionaries of the older generation. In the course of peaceful liberation, democratic reform, as well as socialist revolution and construction, our party has extensively united nationalities, religious patriots, and upheld the banner of patriotism, unity, and progress. The people have firmly safeguarded the motherland's reunification and opposed splittism and retrogression. They have stood together with the party through thick and thin, and participated in political consultations and cooperation. They have made contributions to consolidating Tibet's political power, as well as economic and cultural development. Practical social experiences over a long period have fully proven that there is great vitality in the party's united front work in Tibet. The work is closely linked to the region's revolution and construction, as well as nationality development and progress. In the course of reform, opening up, and modernization, we must continue and magnify the fine tradition of united front work, the advantages of wide contacts between the work and people, insist on basing all tasks on Tibet's actual conditions, as well as strive to initiate a new trend and prospect for Tibet's united front work to make it more dazzlingly brilliant. Quickening the pace of reform, opening up, economic development, and establishing the socialist market economic system will definitely produce a profound impact on the united front work. It will bring new characteristics and demands for the work. First, united front work must be centered on economic development. We must bring every positive factor into play to contribute more toward Tibet's reform, opening up, economic construction, and social stability. Thus, great structuring has taken place in Tibet's united front team. It has transformed from a team with nationality and religious circles as the main body into an enormous and powerful force composed of nationality, religious, intellectual, and economic circles as well as Tibetan compatriots of insight outside the country. It is necessary to widen our vision and unite to the utmost. The scope of united front has enlarged, its tasks increased, and the work has developed in various fields and grass-roots level. It is more obvious that the united front work has developed toward the people and society. It is necessary to vigorously develop socialist democracy and continue to strengthen and perfect the political consultation system. We must widely adopt the people's suggestions and good ideas, as well as pool together the force and wisdom from all sides to change Tibet's backwardness as quickly as possible. We must bring into play our party's historical experiences and special advantages in the united front work. We bring every positive factor of all sides into play and struggle together to fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to us by the era. Just as Comrade Gyaincain Norbu pointed out at the meeting: "The tasks of Tibet's united front are not reduced, but increased. It is not that the tasks are not indispensable, they are even more important than at anytime in the past." The patriotic united front must earnestly do a good job in nationality and religious work. Tibet is a nationality autonomous region mainly populated by the Tibetan nationality. The majority of the people believe in religions. It bears significance to the overall situation, whether in the past, present, or future, to earnestly do a good job in religious work. We should adopt patriotism and socialism as our political foundation to bring about unity of the Tibetan-Han nationality, unity of Tibet's nationalities, as well as unity within the Tibetan nationalities. In addition, we should bring about the great unity of Tibetan compatriots in and outside the region, aimed at safeguarding the motherland's reunification. We should comprehensively and correctly implement the party's religious policy, strengthen the management of religious affairs in accordance with the law, and actively guide religious circles to adapt to social development and progress. Patriotic united front should actively undertake the antisplittism struggle to safeguard the motherland's reunification, nationality unity, and social stability for creating a good social environment for Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization. United front work is the entire party's work that requires the attention of party committees and governments at all levels and great support of relevant departments. This is a fundamental guarantee for consolidating and developing united front to make it glow. Leading comrades at all levels must deepen their understanding of the importance, necessity, and protracted nature of united front, as well as realistically strengthen their leadership over the work. They must incorporate united front work into party committees' agenda and tackle it unremittingly. They should earnestly strengthen cooperation and political consultations with nonparty personages, make more and close friends outside the party, as well as modestly listen to their opinions to truly practice democracy in policymaking. The important requirement of whether or not a leading cadre possesses a sense of united front, knowledge of the united front policy, and capability of implementing the united front work is used for evaluating his policymaking and leadership quality. Party committees at all levels in the region must earnestly implement the guidelines of the national and regional united front work meetings, do a good job in united front work, not indulge in empty talk, and do more practical work so that the party's "magic weapon" will bring into play its true role for Tibet's economic development and social progress.
