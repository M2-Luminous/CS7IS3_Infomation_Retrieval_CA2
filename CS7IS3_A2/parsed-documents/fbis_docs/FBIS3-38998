Brinkman, who heads the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] list of candidates, feels that illegal foreigners "must be rooted out." In order to prevent illegals from entering the Netherlands, foreigners, as it were, must be checked on the ramp to the airplane before it departs for the Netherlands, Brinkman said. According to Brinkman, a "precise" asylum policy is needed in order to prevent Netherlanders from blaming foreigners for all their problems. If we are clear about who is rightly here, Brinkman said, than nobody has the right to say "You don't belong here." The tone of Brinkman's speech elicited criticism from coalition partner, the PvdA [Labor Party]. M. van Traa (of the PvdA), a member of the Lower House, spoke of "a mistaken use of words. You only use the term `root out' in connection with weeds. On this subject matter, you must pay close attention to your choice of words. Politicians have to understand that." According to van Traa, illegality is not to be totally discouraged, "unless you want to build a wall around the country. You must therefore fight illegality where it causes the most trouble, for instance within the context of criminality." [passage omitted]
