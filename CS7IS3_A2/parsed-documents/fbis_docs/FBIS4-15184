The decision was taken in compliance with a resolution by the previous government, Koemecs said. The heating supply won't be suspended to kindergartens, schools and nationally important institutions. In total, local governments owe Latvenergo 19 million lats for the 1993-1994 heating season. In addition, local governments fixed lower heating tariffs (0.20 lats per square meter of floorspace) than the Board of Electric Energy and Heating Tariffs 0.38 lats per square meter of floorspace). Latvenergo plans to meet with local leaders on April 12. The enterprise has already cut heating to 63 consumers, hot water to 65 consumers and 359 consumers have been warned of the measures. Latvenergo owes the Latvijas Gaze (Latvian Gas) enterprise 60 million lats for natural gas supplies. Latvijas Gaze itself owes Russia 34.2 million USD. Russia has already warned the enterprise's management that its Gazprom consortium will stop pumping gas into the Latvian Incukalns container unless Latvijas Gaze covers the debt until May 1. Latvijas Gaze plans to cover part of the debt with a 23-million-dollar Japanese credit. Another 11 million USD could be collected from debtors, the enterprise's management said. Local consumers owed Latvijas Gaze 42.5 million lats on March 20.
