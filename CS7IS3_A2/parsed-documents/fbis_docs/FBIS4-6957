Hata, 58, told a press conference the posts of prime minister and foreign minister should be held by different individuals to meet the demands of Japan's growing international role. He pointed out that a great number of leaders from abroad now visit Japan and that the foreign minister should be able to travel overseas whenever necessary. Hata said times have changed since the 1940s, when Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida also served as foreign minister. Heads of coalition parties will endorse Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and head of Shinseito, as a candidate for prime minister Friday afternoon following a deal struck early Friday by coalition representatives on a draft policy platform for a new cabinet. Hata is certain to be elected prime minister in a Diet election expected Monday to select a successor to Hosokawa, who announced his resignation April 8.
