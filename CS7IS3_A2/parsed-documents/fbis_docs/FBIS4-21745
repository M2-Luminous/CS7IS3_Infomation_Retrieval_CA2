Al-Natshah was voted into office as mayor of Hebron in 1983, but was prevented by Israeli authorities from carrying out his duties because of allegations that he encouraged attacks against settlers. Two years ago, al-Natshah served as a negotiator at the Washington peace talks with Israel. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it opposes the appointment, and if al-Natshah accepts, he will be assassinated.
