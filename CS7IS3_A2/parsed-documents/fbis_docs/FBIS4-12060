The cabinet heard optimistic briefings about the chances of concluding the negotiations with the Palestinians by the end of April. The prime minister expressed his fear that countries that pledged to contribute funds to the Palestinians might not transfer their donations in an orderly fashion, and that the delays might harm the residents of the territories and make the political process more difficult. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the cabinet was briefed about the difficulties in the economic negotiations, due to disagreements among the Palestinians. The cabinet was further told that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will apparently arrive in the region toward the end of the month, before the resumption of the Washington negotiations. In his coming tour, he will also focus on promoting the negotiations with Syria.
