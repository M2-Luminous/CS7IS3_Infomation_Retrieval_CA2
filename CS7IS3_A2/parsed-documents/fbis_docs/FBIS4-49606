Shenzhen's Communist Party chief, Li Youwei said planning should have the aim of turning the city into a metropolis. "We have to take into account the convergence of the city with the neighbouring regions," he said. He was addressing a municipal conference on city planning and management last week. Mr Li said the Shenzhen planned to increase ties with Hong Kong to help elevate it into another "little dragon" in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the lack of planning and supervision over city management in the 16-year-old Special Economic Zone had resulted in chronic problems such as industrial hazards and backward infrastructure facilities. According to the SHENZHEN SPECIAL ZONE DAILY, Mr Li urged municipal officials to try to "converge with Hong Kong and adopt international practices" when mapping out the city plans and management regulations. He said: "We should establish a new city concept under which the economies of Shenzhen and Hong Kong will be integrated." Mr Li, also the municipal Mayor, said the Special Economic Zone should be integrated also with the Pearl River Delta region. He called for innovative thought in planning developments, and successful experience to be borrowed from the mainland and abroad. Mr Li said the "authority" of city planning should be upheld, saying the city would oppose sternly any "anarchism and separatism" and violations of laws. Any violators of laws must be severely dealt with, he said. To strengthen leadership in city planning, regulations should establish the task of planning, construction and supervision in development. Vice-mayor Li Chuan-fang called for infrastructure planning and relevant reforms to be speeded up to help the social and economic development of the country. He said also municipal authorities would clamp down on malpractice such as unlawful occupation of land and change of land use. According to the China News Service, the Shenzhen authorities will adopt a series of measures to improve traffic problems. Traffic lights at 118 road junctions will be automated and traffic flow at major roads and the first and second borders of the city will be monitored by closed-circuit television, the report said. New buildings must have their own car parks, and vehicle buyers will be required to produce proof of purchase of a parking lot. Vehicles from outside the city which will be used in the region for more than three months will have to be licensed. Mini-bus numbers will be curbed, and mass-transport facilities, such as buses, will be given priority on roads, it said.
