According to data from the state employment service, 337 enterprises are currently at the verge of bankruptcy, and if they are shut down more than 70,000 additional workers will become unemployed. This data does not take into account the so-called hidden unemployment, which is evident at hundreds of enterprises around the country. The problem has come to the fore. Without delay, we must seek ways to alleviate it and help those who missed to boat to adjust socially. Society must carry out natural selection to ensure that the most able and qualified employees have jobs at various sectors of the economy. The Ukraine State Committee on the Coal Industry has selected the first batch of 21 mines for a weeding--i.e., a test of economic viability. The collectives were given targets for raising productivity and cutting costs in coal production this year. If they fail to meet these targets, they will be shut down. Thus, unemployment among mine workers is becoming reality and requires appropriate organizational preparation. A technological lag in the Ukrainian coal industry has led to the existence of many unprofitable mines and caused excess employment. Calculated on the basis of unit of energy per employee, other countries have long ago stopped using labor so uneconomically. The need for coal forces the state to support loss-making enterprises and meet miners' demand for wage increases. The pressure from miners on management sometimes exceeds that of the administrative command system itself. Miners' victories have several times pushed the country to the brink of hopelessness, since the growth of salaries did not produce appropriate increases in output. Large-scale subsidies encouraged social parasitism and became reflected in a general worsening of the economic situation. Today, the country finds itself on the brink of a social cataclysm. Ukraine President L.Kravchuk put the problem as follows: we will either perish or find the means and the strength to save Ukraine. One of the main means for salvation is to solve the fuel and energy crisis. In this sector, coal has become the main resource of the country, since local production of gas covers only 22 percent of the country's needs and oil just 8 percent. This is why the stabilization and development of the coal industry has assumed vital importance. We need coal as much as we need bread. But this bread can no longer be purchased at the old price: otherwise, coal will become the destruction of the country, not its hope. This will clearly require a sharp change of the practices and outlook on employment that exist in the industry. The outline for the development of the industry to 2005 states that layoffs in the industry will primarily be effected by closing down mines after their coal deposits become exhausted. It is also possible that some layoffs will stem from market processes, which may lead to the reduction of output and even closure of some mines. According to calculations, the layoff process will accelerate from 1996 and will continue to 2005. But, evidently, the current catastrophic situation in the country's economy requires that the process of weeding out unhealthy enterprises begin sooner. Layoffs and retraining of employees for jobs in other industries is a normal process which accompanies the development of production. But in the coal industry it has been hampered by miners' demands that jobs be preserved. One leader of the Donbass strike committees called job reductions an attempt by the government to "squeeze miners out of the pits." The State Committee on the Coal Industry felt that it had plenty of time--as pointed out earlier, job cuts in the industry were not planned to start before 1996--and did not address the issue closely. This was, apparently, also the reason why it turned down the proposal from the Ministry of Labor to draft jointly an employment program for the industry. Nor did it support the proposal to establish a special center under its auspices to coordinate the work and provide normative and methodological guidance to enterprises, so that they could use their labor resources more efficiently. Especially important in solving today's employment problems is to select able employees, analyze changing employment trends within industries and identify retraining needs. Experience has shown that a sociological analysis of employee qualifications contributes to success. When supplemental paragraphs for the agreement on pay rates and labor and social guarantees between the State Committee on the Coal Industry and industry trade unions were drafted, the Committee was required to commission a study on this issue in the third quarter of 1993. But this resolution was ignored and was merely a waste of time. Now, due to the decision by the government to abolish subsidies to loss-making enterprises, the picture is set to change rapidly. Business requires that the management of the State Committee on the Coal Industry and of industry trade unions urgently provide organizational support and funds for such studies, which will eventually produce a methodology for compiling social and professional classifications of workers. It will become a tool allowing enterprise managers and unions to use a consistent approach for assessing the abilities of different workers and for achieving social justice in the employment sphere.
