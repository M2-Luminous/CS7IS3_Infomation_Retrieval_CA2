At the same time, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and South Lebanon Army units were put on a heightened alert following Hizballah threats and corroborating intelligence indicators that the Shi'ite organizations plan to avenge the Saturday kidnapping of al-Dirani. In the aftermath of the al-Dirani abduction, OC Northern Command Maj. Gen. Yitzhaq Mordekhay said that warnings and some indications of a possible reprisal necessitated taking all precautionary measures. Similar precautions in towns and kibbutzim in the north will be made, pending developments in the next few days. Israeli diplomats and Israeli offices and installations abroad were also put on alert for fear of possible retaliation from Hizballah or proxy organizations. Meanwhile, al-Dirani's interrogation continued in an undisclosed location in Israel. The chief of Intelligence Branch, Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, told yesterday's cabinet meeting that al-Dirani's intelligence value exceeds the issue of missing navigator Ron Arad. [passage omitted] Army sources said that al-Dirani himself, and documents found in his house in Qasr Naba, may shed light on Hizballah activities, as well as financial networking and relations with Iranian and Syrian agents.
