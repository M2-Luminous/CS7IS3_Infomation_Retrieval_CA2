"We will ask the Defense Ministry for a copy of the agreement signed by the Colombian and U.S. Armies so we can act legally," the former guerrilla said. He described the arrival of U.S. military engineers in southeastern Valle del Cauca Department as "unjustified and a violation [violatoria]." Some 133 military engineers from the Southern Command in Panama today began social projects in Valle del Cauca Department, the capital of which is Cali. The action has created great discontent among political sectors because the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops without congressional consent. According to Navarro Wolff, who will run for president in the May elections, the administration of President Cesar Gaviria "is concealing the real mission of the U.S. military contingent." The AD/M-19 leader added, "We are following the case as citizens." In recent days, Navarro Wolff traveled to the area where the foreign soldiers are deployed and gave Colombian flags to the residents. The Union of Democratic Workers of Colombia [Sindicato de Trabajadores Democraticos de Colombia] joined the protest by describing the arrival of the U.S. troops as an "attack on national sovereignty." The labor organization stated: "It is unacceptable that at the request of the president, Colombia is treated like an international beggar and permits the arrival of troops in the country under the pretext that they are coming to build a school." Gaviria and the Defense Ministry have insisted that the soldiers' mission is "humanitarian," and they have ruled out any violation of national sovereignty. The U.S. group yesterday began to build a school and a health center to serve approximately 2,000 people of a tourist area near the Colombian Navy's Malaga Bay naval base on the Pacific. Official sources indicated that the group will remain in Colombia until 28 February, when the projects are scheduled to be finished.
