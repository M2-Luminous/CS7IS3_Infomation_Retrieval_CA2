At the session, Wei Changan, secretary of the party committee and political commissar of the provincial military district, delivered a work report on behalf of the provincial military district's party committee standing committee. He said: Last year, the provincial military district concentrated efforts on building up grass-roots units and ensuring their quality, and fulfilled tasks in various fields, thereby maintaining the upward trend in the building of army units and reserve forces. In the coming year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army building in the new era, the provincial military district will further implement the policy of attaching primary importance to quality; go all out to expedite the construction of party committee leading bodies at all levels and grass-roots units; and strengthen the war preparedness, training, and management of army units and militia and reserve forces so as to push the building of army units and reserve forces to a new height. (Chen Chungeng), secretary of the party committee discipline inspection commission and deputy political commissar of the provincial military district, gave an evaluation report on results in promoting clean administration by army units in Jiangsu in various phases, and set forth demands for further promoting clean administration by members of the party committee. Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial party committee and first secretary of the provincial military district party committee, gave an important speech. He said: Last year, the provincial military district, while attending to work related to war preparedness, training, management, logistic support, and militia and reserve forces, actively organized army units and militia and reserve personnel in supporting key local construction projects and taking part in rescuing disaster victims and delivering relief, thereby forging closer ties between soldiers and civilians and promoting reform, opening up, economic construction, and social stability in Jiangsu. In the coming year, party committees at all levels in the provincial military district should diligently study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, persist in using the theory to achieve unity in thinking and to guide the work, and strive to promote the building of army units and militia and reserve forces to a new height. He added: The annual Spring Festival is drawing near. All localities should launch "double supports" activities for building closer army-civilian relations. The provincial military district, all military subdistricts and garrisons, and people's armed forces departments at all levels should strive to solidify and develop the excellent situation of army-civilian unity. Zheng Bingqing, member of the provincial party committee standing committee and commander of the provincial military district, outlined the requirements for improving leadership and work style and fulfilling this year's tasks.
