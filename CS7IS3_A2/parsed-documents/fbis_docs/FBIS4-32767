The statement was made in an interview for the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. The PDAR official made a point of saying that, contrary to information carried by ADEVARUL and EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, at the talks the PDAR delegation had late last week with President Iliescu the agrarians defended their own censure motion, which partly coincides with that of the opposition, but, agreeing that the objective difficulties of the transition period left their mark on the general economic standard of this country, insisted that the society needed moral and professional purification, not only at the top, but also among the next lower ranks. And as a possible solution to take this country out of the crisis PDAR suggested that Premier Vacaroiu extended in parliament the resignation of the present cabinet and then be commissioned to form a new government. While stressing that in PDAR's view "Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu represents the best choice for the office of prime minister," the agrarian vice-president demands that the premier be allowed to select his team by himself, starting of course, from a "political grid", and further, each minister have the liberty to choose his own second echelon. While in agreement with the opposition on economic matters, agriculture mainly, the PDAR does not share the latter's determination to impeach the president of the republic, and finds "their motivation inconclusive and ungrounded."
