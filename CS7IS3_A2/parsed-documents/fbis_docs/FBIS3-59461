Delic was born in Celic near Brcko in northeastern Bosnia. After his elementary school education he enrolled in a military school. He is one of the few officers in the Bosnian Army who has graduated from the Staff Command College [komandno-stabna skola]. Anyone in the Yugoslav People's Army who wanted to reach the rank of general had to complete his studies at this school. He left the Yugoslav People's Army with the rank of colonel. On 12 April 1992 he deserted and joined improvised units of the Territorial Defense. Before he became commander, he was the head of a logistics base in charge of arms procurement. The import and transportation of the bulk of the arms with which the Bosnians have been supplied have passed through his former base in Visoko, near Zenica. One of his first actions at the helm of the Bosnian Army was not carried out on the front lines, but in Sarajevo itself. [NEDELJNA BORBA] Local bosses were dispensing justice in the town and the surrounding hills as recently as February. [Delic] They are called bullies. [NEDELJNA BORBA] Where have they disappeared to? [Delic] In Sarajevo there were several smaller and larger groups, above all in the old part of the town. These groups operated outside the system of command and did not recognize the military hierarchy, nor were they obeying orders. Members of these groups also took part in the fighting, but in their own way. We had a mountain of problems with them. They were involved in criminal activities, they were abducting people, forcing them to dig trenches, and stealing money. They also did even worse things. We know about several murders that were committed by them. This had nothing to do with the nationality of these people and their units. They only wanted to profit from the war. The thrust of that action solved the problem of two main disobedient groups, which began to obstruct the work of the legal authorities, thus damaging the reputation of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. After that we took care of the lower ranking people involved in war profiteering and criminal activities who were using the uniforms of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina to disguise their activities. First, we had to make sure that this would not cause or lead to any retreat from the front lines, that it would not lead to internal clashes, and that the entire thing was carried out professionally, as appropriate for a state. [NEDELJNA BORBA] How do you think you will win this war? [Delic] I do not know whether the world will let anyone win. They have introduced an arms embargo only on us. Despite this, we are the only military force on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina that is gaining in strength every day and has the possibilities for further military consolidation. Croatian units, without direct support from Croatia, are not an army at all. Serbian paramilitary formations without arms and without direct support from the Yugoslav Army would not be a special force either. From the organizational and staffing point of view, we have the best prospects. If we had the suitable technical capability for operations, if we were at least technically nearly as strong as the aggressor's forces, there could be a turnabout in the war. This would be important because after that the negotiating position of our country would be considerably more favorable and the chances of a sensible political solution much greater. [NEDELJNA BORBA] Who is fighting on your side? [Delic] The brunt of every army is borne by the lower and middle ranks. We have people of every profession in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, ranging from university professors to workers and farmers. This is a war for survival and all those who know that fighting is the only way to survive and to win freedom and peace are taking part in it. Of course, not all of them bear the same burden. People who used to be in political and administrative services are perhaps hit the hardest, but they are also taking part in other spheres. The final victory will not only be won by military action. All those who stayed on our territory are involved in the fighting. If nothing else, they suffer because of the war. [NEDELJNA BORBA] What is your attitude toward those capable of fighting but have fled the country? [Delic] Wars produce heroes, deserters, cowards, war profiteers, and completely normal people. The brunt of the war is being borne by normal people, by ordinary men who do not stand out from the the crowd. Those who become media stars have become that because of the war. Many people taking part in the fighting remain anonymous. They are in the trenches, and they are the only heroes of this war. This is why we can condemn those who left. But also, just because of that, we can show understanding. People are either afraid or have their own views on it. Nevertheless, peace will be established one day and the state will have to confront them. My view differs from that held by others that they should be banned from coming back. There are not enough people in Bosnia for us to allow ourselves to prohibit them from coming back. The only thing that we should do is prevent those who left before the war to make a profit out of it. I personally would not want to see them come back as investors of capital or to take up important posts. One must know that there is a difference between those who fought and those who did not.
