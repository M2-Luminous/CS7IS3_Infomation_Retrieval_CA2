He added that the 16-nation alliance was ready to meet any UN request to help break the siege of the Bosnian towns of Tuzla and Srebrenica. Serb forces around Tuzla have prevented the re-opening of an airport there which is needed for UN aid operations. They have also hindered the relief of Canadian troops trapped at Srebrenica. The spokesman said: "We have provided our plans for close air support (of UN troops under attack) and air strikes to the UN and we have offered to send a team to UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) headquarters in Zagreb." Speaking after a regular meeting of NATO ambassadors, he added: "We are ready to help the United Nations with its planning for the re-opening of Tuzla airport and the relief of the UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica."
