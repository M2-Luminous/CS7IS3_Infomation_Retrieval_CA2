The Japanese reactionaries are going ahead with legislative arrangements to quickly send "Self-Defense Forces" to the Korean peninsula in "the event of contingency," declaring that they will take an active part in "collective security measures" in case "sanctions" were taken against the DPRK, the analyst says, and continues: They are crying over the DPRK's "nuclear threat" so hysterically for the purpose of converting Japan into a military power equipped with nuclear weapons under that pretext and realising with the backing of the United States the old dream of "the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" which Japan failed to do in the past. To dominate Asia is the invariable design of the Japanese reactionaries. It is to this end that they are now making haste with the conversion of Japan into a military power and her nuclear armament. They intend to divert the worldwide denunciation elsewhere from Japan and justify their moves to turn Japan into a military power armed with nuclear weapons by widely spreading the rumor about the DPRK's "nuclear threat." They are also scheming to stage a comeback to Korea and other Asian nations by actively partaking of the aggressive military actions of the United States. The peace and security of Northeast Asia and the Asian-Pacific region are gravely threatened by Japan.
