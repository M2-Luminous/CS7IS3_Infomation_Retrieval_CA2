Paz Zamora admitted making mistakes but not commiting crimes during his government. The news hit Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] followers the hardest. They took the news in silence. The possibility of a meeting of party leaders to analyze the issue here has not been ruled out. The population, meanwhile, compares Jaime Paz Zamora with a captain who abandoned ship without clarifying the accusations against his party. Chuquisaca Peasant Leader Octavio Flores said he was surprised because politicians involved in trafficking are not tried based on Law 1008. Bolivian jails contain many peasants who were involved in drug production out of need and now are serving sentences of up to 15 years. On the other hand, the trafficking kingpins have laws of repentance or are able to hide behind political activities. [passage omitted]
