In a press statement issued last night, the Yemeni spokesman refuted allegations by REUTER and other Gulf news agencies that the aircraft of the legitimate forces raided Aden suburbs where the rebels are deployed and targeted the drinking water storage tanks in the area. The spokesman said these allegations are fabricated, noting that the drinking water sources are controlled by the forces of legitimacy and not in the hands of the rebels. The source criticized reports by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency, the United Arab Emirates Television, and the Kuwait Television that the forces of legitimacy violated the cease-fire. He stressed that this bias in favor of the western media organs serve schemes that aim only at harming Yemen and the unity of its people and land.
