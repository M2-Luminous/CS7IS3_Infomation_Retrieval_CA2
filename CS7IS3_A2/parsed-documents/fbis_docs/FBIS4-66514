They Defend Their Negligence!"--first two paragraphs are AL-AHRAM introduction] [Text] Observers of the present situation in Asyut find the police alone in confronting the darkness-loving bats of terrorism. It is a tremendous weight to bear. The security apparatus alone will never be enough to clear Asyut's soil of the roots of terrorism or to dry up its well-springs of deluded youths, especially among students and teachers. Where are the political parties--particularly the majority ruling National [Democratic] Party (NDP), with its cadres, parliamentary deputies, and People's Assembly members? What role are the Education and Awqaf Ministries and preachers playing in training mosque imams to counter terrorist ideas? Many other questions need to be asked in order to advance the confrontation with terrorism, so that all the forces of the people participate in it. To begin, we raised the following questions with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, the NDP general secretary and local council head for Asyut Governorate: How do the terrorists commit their crimes in broad daylight and then disappear? Where are the members of 49 local councils, who in Asyut number in the thousands? [Salih] Unfortunately no one in the media mentions the positive things that the People's Assembly, local councils, and the party are doing. Many years ago--in 1987 to be exact--we organized the Islamic Meeting Place for Youth. We were able to recruit 4,000 students to stand against the extremist currents in the university, though these currents had the upper hand and strong influence. We expanded to set up 10 associations for students from the different governorates. We went to the Student Union, which was under extremist control, and battled them in 1988 and 1989. At present, we have penetrated the walls of the university by winning all 40 seats. The clashes with the police began when the extremists took to the streets. Their remnants have gone into hideouts and the areas of random development. [AL-AHRAM] Then why are incidents of terrorism increasing in Asyut? [Salih] The terrorist Islamic Group still has all its strength and organizations in al-Minya and Sawhaj; there is no confrontation there. It is clear that a mutual understanding is evolving in those two governorates about not carrying out incidents of violence. As a result, elements of these groups flee to commit their crimes in the territory of Asyut, the place closest to the two governorates to the north and south. There must be cooperation between the groups in the three governorates. The Asyut elements direct, harbor, and aid those who come to them from the north and south. Their centers of operation are the towns of Dayrut, Sidfa, Abu Tij, and recently al-Badari. What happened in the center of the city last December with the assassination of Brigadier General Muhammad Tu'aymah was a reaction to the storming of al-Rahmah Mosque. These are the full facts. Settling Scores [AL-AHRAM] Where is the role of the party and the people's assemblies? Why are they absent from the scene? [Salih] The first party secretariat at the national level organized a conference last April to study the reasons for extremism and propose solutions. Participants included all political forces and parties--except the Labor Party--the professional associations, the ulema, and intellectuals. Its most important recommendation was to form committees for reconciliation and education. Their mission would be to move among the clans and tribes in 242 villages, because the Islamic Group has concentrated on the clans in enlisting its members, especially in Dayrut. I admit that the police are battling an unknown foe. It was necessary to penetrate these groups and reach the second- and third-rank members who were going to penetrate the schools. We have resisted them in the elementary schools throughout the past two years. We carry no weapons in our confrontation with them, but we have turned over numerous repentant leaders of these groups to the police. We reached 30 persons and handed them over to State Security. Members of the party and the local councils were on the scene only 10 minutes after the recent crime in Sidfa and transported the victims. We are helping the police. The role of politicians and grass-roots figures in Asyut is being denied in order to settle scores. Our role now goes beyond the city limits. We have committees working in all the cities, towns, villages, and hamlets. They provide the security apparatus with information. I can reveal some of these secrets. The dens that the police stormed in al-Ma'sarah, al-Zawiyah al-Hamra', and al-Sayyidah Zaynab were stormed because of instructions and clues that came from Asyut. In general, most of the perpetrators of the incidents in Asyut were from outside. This confirms that it is a governorate that expels terrorism, as evidenced by the fact that most of the Islamic Group leaders whom the police apprehended in Imbabah, Alexandria, Damanhur, Cairo, and al-Minya had fled Asyut in the wake of our activity against them. [AL-AHRAM] People say you began dialogue with some terrorist leaders, including Salah Rajab. Is it true? [Salih] The dialogue began in 1992. I received a telephone call from the Islamic Group after the police took control of al-Rahmah Mosque in Asyut. They asked me for a dialogue. State Security did not refuse. I sat with them from 1700 until 1900 in continuous talks. The goal was to stop the violence for two months in return for certain demands. After these sessions they said they would submit the matter by various ways to "their brother leaders" who were in prison. They asked for a week's delay. However, it stretched on for 22 days, during which the incidents erupted. This led to a halt to the dialogue, particularly as we had asked them to lay down their arms immediately. Incidentally, we are going to reshape party formations in any area where individuals prove not to have cooperated with information in the fight against terrorists. We have begun with the youth secretariat by appointing new assistant secretaries. We will combat any passivity. We are now inventorying the extremists in every home and monitoring their movements in order to confront them. I should say that there are about 12 terrorist military wing members in Asyut, in addition to between 50 and 200 of the second rank. Handing Over Terrorist Leaders Leaving Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, we went to Dayrut, one of the constant focal points of violence, where we met Husam al-Kilani, People's Assembly member in Dayrut. [Al-Kilani] The charge that we have not played a role on the scene is wrong. I intervened in 1983 to break up the first discussion group held in al-Rahman Mosque. We went with the police to break up the gathering after meeting the group's amir at the time, Salah Rajab. I published announcements in the newspapers asking the members of these groups to repent and turn themselves in. I succeeded in handing over more than 150 members in Dayrut, foremost among them the amir of Dayrut, Khalid Sa'd. [AL-AHRAM] Why is the violence in Dayrut greater than in the other cities of Asyut [governorate]? [Al-Kilani] Social problems and material conditions lead young people to join the terrorist groups. [AL-AHRAM] What role have you played in confronting these problems? [Al-Kilani] Thirteen months ago I called for a project to help 17,000 graduates, 7,000 of them from Dayrut. We made a thorough study of 10,000 feddans of desert that could be irrigated and farmed. Such projects serve young people who have been waiting 10 years for government employment. The Islamic Group is trying to enlist these needy youths. They join the groups in return for money from which they can pay personal expenses! We were not slow to help illiteracy. Many of the guardians of members of the groups would come to hand over their sons through me. Our role as People's Assembly members makes for double responsibility between the people of my constituency and security officials. I have asked the latter to open the Dayrut youth center to young people and move the concentration of armored vehicles away from it. This in fact took place a few days ago. Nowadays, Dayrut is undisturbed by the terrorist operations that flared up two years ago. Trust Required We went to Jamil Abu-'Aqrab, the People's Assembly member in Abu Tij, and asked him: [AL-AHRAM] The charge leveled against you is that you did not help to apprehend your cousin 'Abd-al-Hamid, the leader of the terrorist groups' military wing, when he was charged with the assassination of Major General al-Shimi last year. [Abu-'Aqrab] If I see 'Abd-al-Hamid, I will hand him over to the police. I will not cover up any person, however close his kinship, who disrupts the peace and is a tool to threaten the regime. The accused is a fugitive who has not been present in the city since the crime in which he participated. Our relationship with him is in the name of his grandfather; he is not my cousin. All the same, he is a germ that shall be rooted out of our family. I am revealing no secret if I say that if he got hold of me he would kill me! [AL-AHRAM] But in general you are not among those who are helping the police. [Abu-'Aqrab] I think I am one of the members of parliament who spend most of their time helping the police, providing them with advice and needed information from our various sources. [AL-AHRAM] A dispute is said to have occurred between you and the governor of Asyut because of your not cooperating with the police. [Abu-'Aqrab] Our relations with Governor Samih al-Sa'id are good. There is full understanding on all matters. All People's Assembly and Consultative Council members feel they are backing the police with all the information they possess. None of them has ever hesitated in the face of requests by police officers involving search for a person, access to his home, or the places to which he may have escaped. We are calling for more trust between the two sides. Sympathy with Islamic Group We went to Shaykh Ramadan Haykal, the chief officer of the Awqaf [Ministry] in Asyut. [AL-AHRAM] What role has the Awqaf [Ministry] played in heading off the extremist current in Asyut? [Haykal] Our role is to immunize people against extremism. We therefore hold periodic meetings with the people. The ulema meet every Monday with people in the mosques to inform them about true religion. I don't deny that people at first were sympathetic with the Islamic Group. However, after they discovered that what they were doing had a purely political goal apart from Islam, they broke with them. The Awqaf [Ministry] sets down a monthly plan of subjects to be raised in the Friday sermon for each town and city. This is done through a weekly meeting with the ulema and preachers to agree on the sermon. For example, preachers had to deal from the pulpit with the recent events in Sidfa and Abu Tij. This is completely different from the Friday sermon in other mosques in other cities. We are not hostile to Muslim young people. It is in their interest to listen to us, because we know better than they about the Koran and Prophetic tradition. Unfortunately, the Islamic Group does not listen to what the ulema say. Indeed, when the minister of awqaf comes to us, they boycott his meetings. I don't know why. [AL-AHRAM] How did the Awqaf Ministry leave al-Rahmah Mosque to the control of the extremist groups? [Haykal] Before we speak about al-Rahmah Mosque, we must know how the Islamic Group took control of it. At first the Islamic Group concentrated in the mosque of the Islamic Law Association (Abu Bakr al-Siddiq). This mosque, with its lecture hall and student lodging, is one of the largest Islamic complexes. Being near the university, it became one of the most important centers for the Islamic Group. They used to spread out all along the road leading from the mosque to the university and took to carrying on their activities and meetings inside the Law Association [mosque]. When the imam assigned by Awqaf tried to carry out his mission, he collided with the Islamic Group. A fight broke out between him and the Islamic Group. The Awqaf called on police officers for assistance, and the Association's mosque was taken back after bloodshed. So they fled and took over the privately built al-Rahmah Mosque after expelling its imam. When we turned to the police, they told us to leave them alone! [AL-AHRAM] Finally, Shaykh Ramadan Haykal told us: [Haykal] Religious education plays no role in the schools. The religion class is peripheral. The teacher present in the school is not an example for the students--and religion is behavior. I am asking for a religious guide in every school to whom students can turn to ask about any unclear points in religion. The Egyptian people are genuinely religious, as shown by the fact that when a child sees his father pray, he does likewise. [AL-AHRAM] Education and educational policy in Asyut are in the prisoner's dock. Where is the role of learning? Is there commitment? Do the schools lack social workers to serve as psychological and social analysts to protect against extremism? We placed all these questions before Ahmad Qasim, the Education Ministry's undersecretary in Asyut, who leveled with us. [Qasim] Asyut witnessed a series of strikes at Asyut University in the late seventies. The movement was very active in the faculties of education and medicine. The movement abated under the pressure of expulsion and rustication, but the activities can still be found in the university. Then they infiltrated into the schools; they were not from within. We therefore assigned a security official in all schools--a teacher to notify ministry provincial headquarters of everything happening in the school and therefore the people to arrest in terrorist incidents, whether they were students or teachers. They have not carried on their activities or propaganda in school, or we should have known and taken steps against them. I have instructed school principals of the need to inform me immediately of any violations, even by teachers. Last year it happened that two teachers insulted each other during the morning line-up. I accordingly took the legal step of transfer. [AL-AHRAM] On what bases are teachers chosen for the job? [Qasim] The school must approve the teacher's honesty and integrity. Then the National Security Investigation Bureau is informed, so that it can investigate his affiliations and determine his suitability; for teachers educate and spread values among an entire generation. [AL-AHRAM] Does the ministry's provincial apparatus lack social workers? [Qasim] Society has three enemies: poverty, ignorance, and disease. These blights must be cured by a comprehensive development plan. Since we suffer from these problems, the largest possible number of social workers must be provided in the schools. Strangely, Asyut's schools suffer an 80 percent shortage of social workers. This is the most important element in my plan against terrorism and extremism. I also face a shortage in the category of social resources and a shortage of 1,500 teachers in science in addition to my requirements. [AL-AHRAM] How is education playing a role in overcoming the rise of terrorism? [Qasim] After the revolution, instances of blood vengeance were largely overcome. Intensive meetings were held between Azharites, the police, and influential figures in the country, and they laid out an overall strategy to treat this social custom. In order for there to be similar cooperation in treating the phenomenon of terrorism in Asyut, we are asking for the following educational plan: reducing class size; abolishing double sessions; and splitting up schools with over 3,000 students. Also, police personnel should cooperate with administrations and schools. Security posts should be set up in the large schools, staffed by police officers, retired officers, or soldiers. Every preparatory and secondary school must be provided with a soldier for protection. [Box, p 3] Illiteracy Plays Role There are 545,000 students in Asyut Governorate and 1,219 schools with 62,000 employees. Nevertheless, there is a high drop-out rate. Fathers merely pay a 5-pound fine if their children do not attend primary school, so that they can use them to till the ground or do farm work in return for wages that help support them. [Box, p 3] Asyut's Mosques There are 955 mosques with imams and ulema in Asyut. There are 1,650 privately built mosques to which preachers for the Friday service have been assigned. There are still 300 small mosques not under the auspices of the Awqaf Ministry or included in its plan. This year, 300 private mosques were joined to the Awqaf Ministry. The ministry plays a limited social role through alms (zakah) and contributions. It regularly gives about 100,000 pounds a month to 8,000 individuals throughout the governorate.
