Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said at the end of two rounds of talks between president Hafiz al-Asad and Christopher over the weekend that Syria will not accept a phased peace with Israel and that it insists on withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories as a precondition for peace in the region. Syria's categorical rejection can be attributed to its consistent policy and stance of opposing unilateral deals and compromise settlements which, Damascus believes, can abort the peace process from the foundation. Syria is also unwilling to repeat the Oslo experience. It contends that Jericho will never witness peace as long as Israeli repression and intimidation continues in other parts of the occupied West Bank. It argues that neither Jericho nor Gaza or Majdel Shams on the Golan Heights are isolated isles but they are part and parcel of the Arab territories. While renewing syrias commitment to the peace process based on UN resolutions and the principle of trading land for peace, Damascus makes no secret of its rejection of unilateral and partial settlements and comes out forcefully in favor of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It also demanded that the South Lebanon issue be settled through unconditional Israeli withdrawal in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425. In addition Syria believes that a breakthrough in the current deadlocked peace talks is only possible after Israel stops derailing the peace process and completely drops all ideas and proposals for unilateral deals and phased withdrawal. Damascus vows never to accept compromise deals over the Golan Heights and insists on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and other Arab lands. Meanwhile, Syria has provided Israel with proposals which, it said, could lead to lasting peace. The proposals were brought to israel by Christopher Sunday [1 May]. Israel's positive response to these ideas and UN Security Council resolutions related to the Middle East peace process could help in achieving peace, Radio Damascus said. The Syrian proposal, it said, "emerges from a real desire" to establish a just and comprehensive peace that would guarantee the rights of all parties. Details of the proposal were not disclosed. Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Arab states, said in Cairo today that "very considerable gaps remain" before a settlement can be reached between Israel and Syria. He has indicated his readiness to return to the Middle East in two weeks to advance peace talks between Israel and Syria. Christopher's decision is apparently based on the assumption that progress so far is enough to prompt him to continue his efforts to advance talks on the Syrian track. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad told Christopher that he is ready for "normalization with Israel" at the end of full Israeli troops pullout from the Golan Heights. "There is serious engagement, but there is a long way to go," a senior U.S. official said of the positions of the two sides.
