The center of the final drills was moved to the field, where the personnel report on weapons training, the driving of vehicles, tactics... [I. Bizhan] The overall preliminary evaluation could be as follows. On the one hand, the diligence of the enlisted men and NCOs everywhere they were during these days--in the barracks, in the field, at the motor pool--was noticeable. On the other, the low level of professional proficiency of the personnel when passing the disciplines that required the expenditures of large quantities of fuels and lubricants during the winter training period was noticeable as well. And we understand that. There were objective reasons for this, after all, that were connected first and foremost with the shortage of fuels. There is, however, no justification for those commanders who are trying to use those reasons to cover their own passivity. We were present at firing exercises by a mechanized battalion yesterday where the organization of the exercises was far from normal. What do I have in mind? The instruction areas and target range proper had not been prepared, and the equipment of the gunnery range operated erratically. There were, for instance, disruptions in providing routine supplies for the troops in the field and informing them of the results, which ultimately led to an overall unsatisfactory evaluation of the subunit for day and night firing. There could have been no other evaluation. I would like to emphasize once again--and I have reported this to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine--that many of the commanders and senior officers who were complaining about the lack of money and fuels and lubricants are carelessly fulfilling their duties in the resolution of rudimentary tasks. For example, the performance of a group exercise with the commanders of platoons of two subunits was rated unsatisfactory in the same mechanized battalion (regiment). Neither fuel nor money were required to conduct it, after all. All that was needed was systematic classes with the officers. Take even the rudimentary questions of setting up the daily routine, organizing classes, maintaining stipulated forms of dress and the internal duty roster... Tell me, what funds are required for a regiment to have order, for a firefighting team to operate well in the motor pool? But it was clearly not working in harmony. The time for the final evaluations has obviously not yet come. But I have serious complaints today toward the command personnel of the UPO for the organization of the final drills and the upholding of stipulated procedure. [NARODNA ARMIYA] Ivan Vasylovych, the headquarters officers of a mechanized division and regiment and the personnel of one of the subunits were called out in a practice alert during the training session today. How do you rate their actions? [I. Bizhan] We performed an evaluation of mobilization readiness with a regard for the situation that exists in the formation, and we checked out the system for notifying headquarters officers of the division and regiment. It is still too early to be talking about final results. But there is quite a bit left to be done here. The written confirmation of the alert signal from the higher staff was received too late by the operations duty officer in particular. These are also rudimentary matters that people must learn that do not require any particular expenditures. I would like to emphasize again that organizational conclusions will undoubtedly be drawn based on the results of the performance evaluation with a particular regard for the subjective factor that we were talking about before. The question of how the problem of fully manning the mechanized division, especially at the platoon and company (battery) levels, with officer personnel is of particular attention in this regard. The inspectorate includes representatives of the Main Personnel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who are studying this issue in detail. Everything possible has already been done on the part of the Ministry not only on this problem, but also on many of the other "sore spots" that exist in the division. Work must also be done with the officers in the field, however. Their aspirations and needs must be studied more deeply, and their problems must not be brushed aside. I am sure that we will have fewer transfer or discharge requests from the young officers in that case. [NARODNA ARMIYA] We have heard complaints more than once that bad things continue to happen in the determination of the optimal standard organizational structures of the formation. This has a negative impact on the proficiency and mood of people... [I. Bizhan] This is, first of all, in the sphere of aimless discussions again. Take the mechanized battalion that I was talking about earlier. What reforms were made in it, say, that impeded the fulfillment of the weapons training program? There were none, but they are trying to use it to cover themselves. Is that good? Second, everything that is being done is proceeding in accordance with the plan for the organizational development of the armed forces. I agree with the fact that everything is not being done as one would like here. Life itself makes corrections, and you cannot get away from that. One need not, however, put the problem of growth at the center. We are not reforming the armed forces, we are building them, as has been emphasized repeatedly by Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. That is quite true. Everything is effectively being created anew, and you cannot avoid mistakes. A large portion of the work lies ahead for us, and I am sure that the results of that will provide us with the opportunity of assessing, in objective and comprehensive fashion, the state of affairs in the formations and units of the corps being evaluated.
