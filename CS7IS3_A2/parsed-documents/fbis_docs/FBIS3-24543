Bezel and L.K.

F, B, Pb and Zn compounds. A review of available information points to the advantages of the compartmental approach to the pharmacokinetics of toxicants, rather than reliance on a generalized system data. The key factor in compartmental analysis is the flexibility with which individual tissues, organs or body fluids of interest can be monitored and analyzed for kinetic parameters, with information on the different compartments then combined for an overall assessment.
