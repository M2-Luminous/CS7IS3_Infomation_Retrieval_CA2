First, I would appreciate it if you would briefly tell me about the your personal history. [Rong] I graduated from St. Johns University in Shanghai in 1937. Immediately after graduation, I got a job at a factory my father operated. My father and my grandfather had been engaged in business since 1901. They operated factories. They mainly ran a flour mill and a spinning mill, which were regarded as important national industries in China. If we briefly follow China's modern history, we realize that China has experienced the history of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. I was born in 1916, and, since my childhood, I have witnessed the confused days under the northern warlords and the Kuomintang [KMT]. Particularly when the KMT was in power, I witnessed how miserable and how confused the Chinese people were. Honestly speaking, for some time before the birth of New China, I used to have strong expectations for the KMT government. However, immediately before the birth of New China, my expectations turned to disappointment. Also, as my parents inspired me with the patriotic spirit, and as my father had remained in China at that time, I was also determined to stay. After China's liberation, my contact with the Communist Party increased gradually and, by and by, I came to be very impressed and attracted by the pragmatic attitude of the Communist Party's leaders and the staff members in dealing with the problems and in carrying out their duties. While observing their way of doing things, which was totally different from the KMT's, my opinion about the Communist Party changed gradually. Thus, I have come to realize that socialism is the very structure that can save New China. Of course, I had to come through very hard experiences during the process. In China, we experienced the unique incident called the Cultural Revolution -- I am sure you are very familiar with its history. Yet, I have never lost my confidence in the Communist Party because I firmly believe that the Communist Party has been working for the people and for the public. Such a belief has been supporting me when I was personally in hardship. In 1978, after the Cultural Revolution, the CPC held the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and announced that it would change its policy and emphasize construction of the economy. The Chinese people were very glad to accept the proposal that all people should exert themselves in carrying out economic construction. I was very glad to hear the resolution as I had been interested in industry and business since my younger days. I felt it was my duty to contribute to the benefit of the people. [Takano] It was your sense of duty that made you establish CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Corporation], was it not? [Rong] In April 1979, Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was vice premier at that time, called me and several other All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce [FIC] members and, on the premise that China was going to carry out a policy of opening up aimed at economic construction, we were asked to discuss the meaning of the opening up policy, that is, to discuss how important it was for China to carry out such a policy. At that time, Mr. Deng Xiaoping requested that since we were well-known members of the FIC, we should make the most of our experience and cooperate with China in carrying out its opening up policy. Particularly, he asked me to exert myself in introducing foreign investment into China in the future. Coming back from the meeting, I considered the theme over and over again, and my conclusion was that there might be two ways we could take for the purpose of introducing foreign investment. One was to establish an organization similar to the existing governmental organization through which foreign investment was to be introduced. The other was to establish an enterprise -- a public corporation in Chinese words -- and to introduce foreign investment in the form of issuing bonds in the enterprise's name. I thought that, by all means, the better way was to establish a company which will be able to procure funds through broad contact with foreign enterprises, and I proposed my idea. I organized CITIC upon obtaining the consent of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and the State Council, who agreed that my idea was in line with their's. [Takano] Please let me ask a question or two. While it seems to me that the friendly relations between Mr. Deng Xiaoping and you was an important factor making it possible to establishing CITIC, I am interested to know who was the first leading member of the Communist Party with whom you became intimate after liberation. In the first place, was it Mr. Deng Xiaoping or Mr. Zhou Enlai with whom you first became very intimate after liberation, or whose personality made you feel that the Communist Party is rather acceptable? [Rong] While I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Deng Xiaoping from time to time at central government meetings, I should say Marshal Chen Yi was the first Communist Party leader I met. Then, of course, I had the opportunity of meeting with a number of leaders such as Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Liu Shaoqi, and even Marshal Zhu De. In many cases, I was urgently summoned to discuss China's government policies. Thus, I have been associating with Communist Party leaders for several scores of years. I Do Not Agree With the "Great China Economic Sphere" [Takano] Though this is my assumption, your relatives are scattered throughout the world creating a network. Has such a network proved effective for development of CITIC? [Rong] Though I suppose the network played its role to a certain extent, I understand that the China Government's opening up policy was the main cause for the development. At first, to explain the idea of organizing CITIC, I immediately visited, upon obtaining State Council approval, Germany -- it was West Germany at that time -- France, Switzerland, Japan, the United States, and Australia. To my explanation that China was going to open up its door to foreign countries, the foreign people accepted my explanation as very fresh news, and told me it was an excellent determination for China. I understand that the Chinese Government's opening up policy is a very proper way for China's economic development, making it possible to introduce and absorb foreign enterprises. As you know, I was CITIC chairman before I became PRC vice president, and I feel that the PRC Government's opening up policy was one of the motive powers which helped CITIC develop to its present level. Another motive power was the effort exerted by all CITIC staff members. The third motive power was the fact that foreign enterprises had become fully confident that the PRC's opening up policy would never be changed in the future. [Takano] My next question refers to the comment you just made. Particularly since 1991 and 1992, large business groups consisting of so called "huaqiao" [Overseas Chinese] and "huaren" [people of Chinese descent] have been actively expanding their investments in China. A world conference of Chinese businessmen will be held in Hong Kong at the end of November 1993. What do you think is the role to be played by the Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent living abroad in achieving China's economic development, and in promoting CITIC's business activities? [Rong] Generally speaking, the Overseas Chinese problem is very complicated. We use the expression "huaren" for those Overseas Chinese who have obtained the citizenship of the countries where they live, and we hope they engage in their business abiding by the laws of the countries where they live. They are of course welcome if they want to contribute to their motherland through their business activities and investments. We use the expression "huaqiao" for those Chinese living in foreign countries who have not obtained the citizenship of the host country. We also want them to carry out their business firmly abiding by the laws of the respective countries. Of course, they are welcome to exert themselves for the benefit of their motherland. As to the world conference of Chinese businessmen to be held in Hong Kong you referred to earlier, I understand it is the second conference. The first was held in Singapore. We did not originally propose the conference. [Takano] Recently, Japanese newspapers and magazines have frequently been using the expression, "great China economic sphere." It is a very common recognition in Japan that something like an invisible economic sphere is being formed by the network of Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent taking part in the Chinese economy's development, which is considered a very important factor in supporting the future development of China's economy. Because of your position, I feel that you are using a discreet expression, being afraid that it might be taken as a Chinese threat if the Chinese merchants' power became too strong throughout the world. Yet, what is your opinion about the potential of an "invisible economic network"? [Rong] Let me explain my opinion from two points. First, I want to take the example of Taiwan. Taiwan is part of China. Hong Kong is to be returned to China in 1997. Macao is also to be returned to China in 1999. To me, it seems very natural that these three areas keep very close economic relations with China. From such a standpoint, we are hoping to maintain cooperative relations with the respective areas, and to exchange opinions as to how to attain mutual development. Second, as I just referred to the problem of Overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent, we do not want to use the expression "great China economic sphere," and we do not agree with such an idea. Macrocontrol Should Be Strengthened [Takano] By the way, it seems that the Chinese economy has developed too rapidly, creating an overheated situation, or creating a bubble economy-like condition in the real estate field. What is your opinion about the present situation and the problem points of the Chinese economy? [Rong] The shift from the planned economy to a market economy is a very serious conversion creating various problems during the process. Yet, it is considered natural and inevitable that such problems are taking place. Since China is totally unfamiliar with a socialist market economy, having absolutely no experience in history, and as there is no such example in foreign countries from which we can learn lessons, the PRC Government is groping, or trying to find a way, as development is taking place. Problems always occur in the process, and it may be inevitable for us to keep moving while repeating this problem-solving process. In the process of development, every district throughout the country became more enthusiastic, making active investment and exerting themselves for the betterment of enterprises. Although such enthusiasm is understandable, the only problem is that the people tend to be hasty and to expect a quick return, thus creating an overheated condition or, in certain fields, making excessive investments. China being, originally, a developing country, its economic structure is not so well-balanced. Therefore, if an excessive investment takes place at a particular field, it will create a further imbalance in the economic structure which was originally out of balance. Particularly, there has been an active request for investment in various fields, creating a further shortage of funds. On the other hand, however, we even experienced confusion in the monetary order because the Chinese legal system is imperfect. Also, it is my opinion that the real estate sector, which you referred to before as being overheated, is a sector in China which should be further developed. However, as there is no established commercial practice [concerning real estate transactions] in China, the real estate market has been left uncontrolled, bringing about the rise of real estate prices with only a few people monopolizing the business. Therefore, the Chinese Government has decided to employ a macropolicy to strengthen macrocontrol. I think the situation has been improved to some extent. [Takano] I suppose that the introduction of foreign investment will play a more important role for China's future development. Though investment from all over the world will naturally be welcome to China, which countries do you think most preferable to make investment in China? [Rong] As we are taking an omnidirection policy in opening up our door to foreign countries, any country is welcome as long as it is willing to cooperate with China for mutual development. Since China is a developing country, we want to promote, based on our open policy, economic exchanges with foreign countries; and we think it will be wonderful if, for instance, we can improve our managerial skills through introduction of advanced scientific technologies. We would like to cooperate with Japan, the United States, and Europe. However, in view of the geological location and the cultural history, it is considered easier and more convenient for China to establish a cooperative relation with Japan. Yet, as far as we see the present amount of investment by country, the United States ranks at the top, exceeding Japan. I earnestly hope that the Japanese investors will invest more in China. The People Enjoy the Benefits of the Opening Up Policy [Takano] I understand that the Chinese Government is exerting efforts in various ways to solve the problem of economic differentials between the coastal and inland areas, which have recently tended to expand. Are you also trying to ensure, domestically, a well-balanced distribution of funds invested by foreign countries? [Rong] It is true that China's opening up policy is being applied to the coastal areas first, and is to be gradually spread to the inner areas. Particularly, it is necessary to develop the social infrastructure in the inner areas. However, it requires a vast amount of investment, also necessitating a very long period for redemption. We intend to gradually improve the investment environment, keeping pace with the promotion of the opening up policy. [Takano] In Japan, we use the expression "post-Deng Xiaoping." Some people are afraid that political and economic confusion might take place in China with the end of the Deng Xiaoping era. May I frankly ask you about your opinion on this point? [Rong] China has attained its development centering around economic construction, and the people's standard of living has been further improved during the process. Around 1978, "the Three Sacred Treasures" of the Chinese people were a bicycle, a radio, and a sewing machine. Recently, they are a television, a refrigerator, and a washing machine. Presently, the standard of living has been further elevated with an air-conditioner, a piano, and a camera becoming necessities of life for all the people. Since the fruits of China's opening up policy are being most enjoyed by the people, it is certain that the people will oppose Chinese Government leaders unless they continue to promote economic construction. Of course, there may be a variety of opinions among individual people, which should be considered natural. [Takano] Thank you very much.
