"The Slovak Government is greatly concerned and offended by the speech of Mr President as it considers it a crude assault on the basic institutions of the new state," the governmental statement reads. According to the cabinet, Kovac's speech "harms Slovakia's reputation and position abroad and destabilizes the complicated domestic situation." In the speech Kovac attacked Meciar's cabinet. The government fundamentally rejects his address as confrontational and unprecedented, opposing European political standards, human ethics and overreaching the constitutional powers of the head of state. The declaration notes that it was Meciar's government which had credentials for the creation of the independent states and bears most responsibility for its developments. In this connection the document poses the question "on behalf of whom and in whose interest Kovac's speech was said," noting that "certainly not in the interests of Slovak nationals." The government is ready to acquaint citizens with a "thorough analysis" of Kovac's speech.
