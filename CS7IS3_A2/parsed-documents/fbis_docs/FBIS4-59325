FBIS4-59325 "drnes092_j_94021" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Defense Ministry: 25th Mechanized Brigade `Captured' Defense Ministry: 25th Mechanized Brigade `Captured' JN1205053394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 12 May 94 JN1205053394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by "official military source" at the Defense Ministry in Sanaa --date not given] [Text] With God's help and support, the heroes of our brave Armed Forces have continued their brave, heroic tasks in their confrontation against the rebellious secessionist forces, which are misled by the criminal and evil separatist elements in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], who are involved in the plot against the people, unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. Our Armed Forces in the southwest axis captured the 25th Mechanized Brigade, stationed in the (?Faz) garrison, and seized all its tanks, artillery, equipment, and vehicles. A number of this brigade's officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers surrendered to the ranks of Constitutional legitimacy who are protecting Yemeni unity. In the same axis, in the al-'Anad-(?al- Hawdah) sector, our Armed Forces inflicted on the forces hostile to legitimacy and Yemeni unity huge losses in equipment and weapons. In the al-Dali'-al-'Anad sector, the Armed Forces continued their advance accomplishing their tasks successfully. In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces affiliated with the separatist forces -- which are hostile to unity and democracy and which are devoted to serving the illegitimate desires of the members of the bloody gang in the YSP leadership -- sustained huge losses in equipment, weapons, and vehicles. These forces retreated to rear positions after failing to carry out desperate attacks. Meanwhile, the heroes in the Armed Forces Air Defense in all axes confronted the air raids carried out by the aircraft of the forces of apostasy, which are hostile to the people and Constitutional legitimacy, forcing these planes to flee. This made the criminal secessionist forces resort to crazy methods, which reveal their grudge, hysteria, and death throes, by firing a number of missiles at peaceful populated cities and civilian facilities, including the firing of two Scud missiles at Sanaa early yesterday morning. One of these missiles fell in a big residential area. This shows the state of hysteria and cowardliness in which the igniters of the war are living as well as their realization of the fate they will face soon, God willing, now that their treacherous objectives of this war have been aborted. Unity has been entrenched through the blood and sacrifices of our valiant heroes in our Armed Forces and Security Forces and by their great heroism in embodying their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, unity, and democracy. Unity has also been entrenched through the entire people's solidarity with their leadership and their righteous sons in the Armed Forces and Security Forces in the battle aimed at defending life and their great national and popular achievements, championing the loftiest values and pan-Arab and human principles of justice, and at making the rebels, the enemies of people, homeland, legitimacy, and Constitutional institutions taste the consequences of their acts and tyranny, God willing. God's victory is imminent. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you will aid the cause of God, He will aid you and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]
