A delegation led by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab, member of the House Speakership Council, and includes brothers Ahmad Muhammad Sufan, Mansur Ahmad Sayf, and 'Abdallah al-Mukaybili travelled to the Arab Maghreb. Another delegation, led by brother Yahya Mansur Abu-Isba', chairman of the Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee in the House, and including Deputies brothers Dr. 'Abdallah 'Ali al-Maqalih and Mahdi Abu-Bakr al-Hamid, headed for Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Djibouti. A third delegation left for Syria and Lebanon. It is led by Deputy brother Sultan al-Barakani and includes brothers 'Abbas 'Ali al-Mu'ayyad and Ahmad al-Hayyan. A fourth team left for Iraq and Jordan. It is headed by brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kidsi and includes brothers Muhammad Naji 'Allaw and 'Abduh Muhammad al-Kanabi. The delegations are going abroad to supplement Yemeni diplomacy and convey a true picture of developments in Yemen to fraternal Arab parliaments, with a view to securing sustained support for Yemeni unity as a pan-Arab gain, as well as a national Yemeni achievement. The aim is also to make it clear that there are separatist elements out to impose secession by force of arms. In a predeparture statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud explained the mission assigned to the delegations sent out by the House to the Arab states. They are carrying messages from the brother speaker to his Arab counterparts spelling out our country's stance on current developments in Yemen and the dimensions of the anti-unity conspiracy. These contacts are necessitated by bonds of Arab brotherhood, since Yemeni unity is not an exclusively Yemeni concern, but a brick in the edifice of Arab unity. As such, Yemeni unity is as much an Arab concern as it is an affair relevant to Arab masses and states, he added. Brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab said he hoped these delegations will accomplish their task.
