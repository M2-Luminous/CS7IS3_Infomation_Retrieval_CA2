Biljana Plavsic on Thursday said that all persons who had approved the NATO air strikes against the R.S. must be excluded from the further consultations on the resumption of the peace talks for the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "General Rose is a persona non grata on the territory held by the R.S. army. He simply must leave. His departure would be one of the Serb side's three conditions for the resumption of the talks," Plavsic said on Radio Jagodina (town in central Serbia). The other two conditions on which the R.S. insists have been presented by R.S. President Radovan Karadzic, and they are the lifting of sanctions against the Serb people and the signing of a peace agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, Plavsic said. Asked to comment the report from New York that the Sarajevo formula should be applied in the case of Gorazde, too, Plavsic said that "the Serb side categorically rejects a Sarajevo formula which would be applied in Gorazde, because the situation is not the same." "The Serbs will not accept the Sarajevo model for Gorazde," she underscored. U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose on Sunday requested that NATO aircraft raid Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. U.S. NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde on Sunday and Monday, under the pretext of protecting UNPROFOR members. Before the air strikes were launched, the Muslim side had accused the Serbs of attacking civilian targets in Gorazde, while the Serbs insisted that the Muslims were using the town of Gorazde for attacks on Serb positions. Gorazde should have been demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-protected "safe area." UNPROFOR representatives, for their part, had confirmed that the fighting in the area of Gorazde had been provoked by the Muslim side. "The U.N. decision to bomb the army and civilians in the R.S. is an act of aggression on the R.S. We were aware that UNPROFOR was aiding the Muslims since July 1992, when we were forbidden to use Sarajevo airport to transport our wounded. However, now that we have been bombed, too, both the politicians and the army must realize that the U.N. peace-keepers are enemies of the Serb people," Plavsic said. "The case of Gorazde has shown from the international aspect that the agreements between Western powers and Russia are not being respected. Only consent was asked of Great Britain, while it appears that nobody had consulted Russia at all," the R.S. vice- president set out. General Rose continues saying that the R.S. army has stopped outside Gorazde and that there is no more shooting, all in an effort to prove that air raids are an effective method, Plavsic said. She set out that she left Gorazde on Wednesday night strongly convinced that the raiding of the Bosnian Serb positions had strengthened the Bosnian Serb troops in their determination to defend every inch of R.S. territory and the conviction that the U.N. peace-keepers were now an enemy of the Serb people. "It is up to the international community to evaluate the success of the aggression," Plavsic said.
