Gadzhizade; place and date not given: "Rasul Guliyev: `Those Jockeying for Power Accuse Me of Betrayal...'"] [Text] At the initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the Kyrgyz Republic parliament, the Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting was held on 4-5 May in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). Among the meeting participants were A. Dzhalilov, first deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Council; Armenian parliament speaker B. Ararktsyan; the head of Russia's mediating mission, V.N. Kazimirov; and Nagorno-Karabakh representative K. Baburyan. The result of the meeting was a protocol calling for "an end to armed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and around it," which in place of A. Dzhalilov was signed by R. Guliyev. [Gadzhizade] The president of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not expressed an official opinion on the signing of the Bishkek protocol. How do you explain this? [Guliyev] I signed this protocol with the consent and participation of the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan. [Gadzhizade] What can you tell us about the content of the protocol? [Guliyev] The purpose of the protocol is only a cease-fire and, being a protocol of intentions, it serves the truce in every way. We signed it in order to demonstrate Azerbaijan's peaceful intentions to the entire world community. Until this, Azerbaijan had often missed important diplomatic initiatives. [Gadzhizade] How substantial are your amendments to the Bishkek protocol? [Guliyev] In my opinion, the amendments to the Bishkek protocol are very significant and important. It is clear that "observers" mean CIS troops. And the mention of "international observers" says that this amendment is of an international nature, which proclaims the participation in peacekeeping operations of armed formations of foreign states together with CIS troops. The Azerbaijani side proposed that the wording "occupied territories" in the protocol be replaced by "seized territories," and this proposal was accepted. This is very important; it establishes that the other side is the aggressor. [Gadzhizade] Many mass media maintain that Nagorno-Karabakh's participation in the negotiations means in fact recognizing it de jure. [Guliyev] The contention that we have recognized Nagorno-Karabakh de jure is foolish, to say the least. One can see even from the protocol that the issue is not worth discussing. [Gadzhizade] Your attitude to the peaceful settlement plan presented by Russia? [Guliyev] Russia's plan for peaceful settlement of the armed conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh may be implemented only within the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group and under monitoring of international organizations. I will never sign a document that is contrary to the interests of the people. [Gadzhizade] Some political figures and a score of parties called the signing of the Bishkek protocol a betrayal. What can you say regarding the accusation that you have betrayed Azerbaijan's interests? [Guliyev] You know, statements by some political leaders and parties have no relation to the hopes of the people--it is simply jockeying for power. And in my opinion, in the current circumstances and situation a power struggle in itself is betrayal. [Gadzhizade] What if the political circles demand your resignation? [Guliyev] I would gladly resign, but the interests of the Azerbaijani people supersede my wishes. I will not resign until I fulfill my duty and my responsibilities. I will not allow ambitious individuals to play games with the fate of the people. [Gadzhizade] Is the National Assembly supposed to ratify the Bishkek protocol? [Guliyev] No. The Bishkek protocol was not signed for ratification because it is only a protocol, not an agreement or treaty. [Gadzhizade] Many deputies are now collecting signatures for the purpose of convening the Supreme Council. [Guliyev] I would like to tell the signature collectors that it has long been time to part with illusions. [Gadzhizade] The next meeting of the National Assembly has been moved up to next week. What was the reason? [Guliyev] This was necessitated only by the visit to Baku of the CSCE Minsk Group chairman, Mr. Jaan Eliasson.
