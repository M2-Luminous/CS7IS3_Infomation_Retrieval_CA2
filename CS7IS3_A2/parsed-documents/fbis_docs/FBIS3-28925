Earlier, Hosokawa had told leaders in his ruling coalition government that Japan considered dialogue the best means of resolving suspicions that Pyongyang may be attempting to build a nuclear arsenal. Hosokawa, following a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the weekend, had indicated that Japan was ready to support the United Nations Security Council if it decides to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. On Monday, Hosokawa spoke with Kim by telephone and both leaders agreed that cooperation with the U.S. will be essential to getting Pyongyang to accept inspections of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the officials said. With the IAEA board of governors set to meet February 21, the U.S. has indicated a willingness to take Pyongyang's refusal to allow the checks to the Security Council and press for sanctions. Japan and South Korea, which fear that sanctions might further heighten tension on the Korean peninsula and eventual disruptions in east Asia, have been seeking a negotiated settlement to the inspections impasse. Pyongyang maintains that its nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes only, but has refused for more than a year to grant IAEA inspectors access to sites believed to be nuclear waste storage facilities. During the meeting earlier in the day with the leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties, Hosokawa said, "Japan considers the best plan is through dialogue, no matter what the situation is. In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the extent of Japanese law if the Security Council proposes sanctions against Pyongyang. Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven ruling parties, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions against North Korea would be counterproductive. Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the friendly connections between the (North) Korean Workers' Party and the Chinese Communist Party. He said further that there is no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have on both North Korea and Japan. "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down, efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving the nuclear issue, Kubo said.
