The heads of the two countries' diplomatic departments spent two days in the Egyptian capital making strenuous mediating efforts to bring to a successful finale the talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, which were crowned today by the conclusion of an historic "peace protocol." Even during the actual signing ceremony, the intermediaries had to come urgently to the assistance of the sides. Several details of the dramatic episode, which almost obliterated the many months of the "peace marathon," have become known to ITAR-TASS correspondents from informed sources. As he appended his signature to the agreement, Yasir 'Arafat demanded from the United States and Russia additional security guarantees for the territories now being freed. During an enforced break in the signing procedure, the cosponsors gave him the relevant assurances, which insured the Palestinian leader's agreement to sign the document. Experts from the two great powers started consultations on the matter today, and the guarantees are expected to be countersigned tomorrow by the Russian and U.S. heads of diplomacy.
