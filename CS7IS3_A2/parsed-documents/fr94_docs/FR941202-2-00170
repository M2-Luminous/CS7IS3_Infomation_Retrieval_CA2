FR941202-2-00170 FR941202-2-00098 Option II: Statistical evaluation of data from all participants in the current study. Calculation of 95% and 99% confidence intervals to set marginal and unsatisfactory performance. Option III: Pre-established pass/fail intervals as established in 40 CFR 136, appendix B. Option IV: The following scoring protocol applies to: All chemical analytes; bacteriology samples that require quantitation (total and fecal coliform in non-potable water); fibers in air determined by phase contrast microscopy; asbestos in friable solid material by polarized light microscopy; and asbestos in air and potable water by transmission electron microscopy. The true values may be established through robust statistical analysis of the results reported by all laboratories, in order to reject gross outliers and establish a mean result and standard deviation, or through results obtained by a panel of 12 reference laboratories (this is done for asbestos in friable material). A laboratory's result on a given sample is then assessed as: Good if it is within the 95% confidence interval about the mean, or reported as ``less than'' the method detection limit if the sample is a blank; Marginal if it is outside the 95% confidence interval, but within the 99% confidence interval about the mean, or reported as ``less than'' twice the method detection limit; or Unsatisfactory if it is any other result. For each test, a laboratory receives 2 PE samples for each certified analyte. On two consecutive tests, a laboratory must obtain a passing score of at least 75% on the 4 samples analyzed, calculated by applying the following formula. E:GRAPHICSEN02DE94.012 Hence, the laboratory must obtain at least two good results plus two marginal results, or three good results plus one unsatisfactory result, over two consecutive tests.
