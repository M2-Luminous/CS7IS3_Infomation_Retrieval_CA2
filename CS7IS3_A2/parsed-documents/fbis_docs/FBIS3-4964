The requests will be included in a list of recommendations Japan will submit to a GATT working committee to help China join GATT at an early stage, as it hopes to, the officials said. The committee opens a meeting in Geneva on March 15. China, on receiving such recommendations from GATT member nations, is expected to submit a list of proposed tariff cuts to GATT by next summer. Under an agreement reached last year at the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, Japan is to cut its tariffs by an average 1.5 percent and the United States and European nations are to reduce theirs by 3.0 percent. China's high tariffs have hindered its admission to GATT. The Chinese tariffs are believed to average more than 40 percent, although China itself puts the average at 22 percent. The Japanese-proposed tariff cuts for China are expected to cover hundreds of items, including automobiles, machinery and electronics products, the officials said. The World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT in January 1995, is expected to impose stricter conditions for admission than GATT. All GATT members, however, will be allowed to join the WTO.
