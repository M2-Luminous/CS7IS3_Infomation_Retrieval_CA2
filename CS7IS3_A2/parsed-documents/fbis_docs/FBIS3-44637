How to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control? People do not have completely identical viewpoints on these questions. Hence, many of the problems occurring in the current macroeconomic management have something to do with this situation. I. The Necessity of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control History and reality prove that market economy needs macroeconomic regulation and control. Capitalist market economy has existed for several hundred years. So has macroeconomic regulation and control, though it varies in scope and degree. What needs our special emphasis is that macroeconomic regulation and control in capitalist market economy has not weakened, instead it has become stronger and stronger as history has developed to its present stage. The newly emerging industrial countries since World War II lay greater emphasis on and pay more attention to the role of macroeconomic regulation and control than the old-line capitalist countries, and have consequently achieved remarkable results. The cause lies in several points: 1) The problem of overall economic balance, that is, the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply; 2) the problem of big economic structures such as the proportion between industry and agriculture, the proportion between various industrial departments, the relationship between industry and trade, and the relationship between production development and construction of infrastructure; 3) the problem of competition on an equal basis, that is, opposing monopoly and maintaining fair competition on an equal footing; 4) the problem of the relationship between equality and efficiency, that is, maintaining social justice and equality and preventing over-polarization while ensuring a certain efficiency; 5) the problem of public services or social consumption, such as basic public utilities, elementary education, public health and national defense and security; 6) the problem of the natural and social environment in economic development, such as the ecological balance, resource protection, environmental protection, and the protection of citizens' lives and property. The solution to all these problems depends mainly on the government's macroeconomic regulation and control rather than mainly or completely on the spontaneous acts of enterprises and individuals under the influence of the market mechanism. It is a general law that market economy needs macroeconomic regulation and control, and socialist market economy is no exception. Why should market economy pay attention to and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control under the condition of socialism? This is determined by its own characteristics. First, public economy, especially state-owned economy, plays a leading role in social economy. It needs to concentrate all social forces to carry out overall, major economic construction that concerns the national economy. This not only requires the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, but also makes it possible to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control. Second, it is to eliminate poverty and move toward prosperity together. Being the inherent requirement of the socialist system, it sets a higher demand for the relationship between efficiency and equality than in other countries that practice market economy. Consequently it will depend more on macroeconomic regulation and control over the state's policy for income distribution to solve this problem. Third, the transition from a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy. It is a long process of exploration. It is not possible to depend solely on decentralizing powers to enterprises to achieve this aim. It should depend on macroeconomic regulation and control and powerful administrative interference by the government. Fourth, in the process of modernization from a big agricultural country which depends on its 800 million peasants to feed the nation, it is neither possible nor necessary for us to follow the old road of long-term development taken by countries in Europe or America. Instead, we should take a quicker road of development with Chinese characteristics. This requires that the government play a greater and more forceful role. II. The Content and Scope of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Planning, finance and banking are the three important aspects of macroeconomic regulation and control by the state in market economy. 1. Planning. Capitalist countries also make plans. However, plans made by different countries vary in form and scope. Some newly emerging industrial countries practice that type of economy which attaches great importance to planning, with the government playing a guiding role. What we want to do in the practice of market economy is to give up the old system of planned economy thoroughly. But it is by no means the case that planning is not needed. We need to replace highly centralized mandatory planning with guidance and policy-oriented planning. The stress of the state plan lies in determining the strategic goals for the national economy and social development in a rational way, doing a good job in economic development forecasts, control over total supply and demand as well as programing of major structures and layout of productive forces, focusing necessary financial and material resources to carry out major construction, and using economic levers comprehensively to promote the long-term, stable and coordinated growth of the national economy. Practice has proved that this kind of planning is highly necessary and workable. 2. Finance. It is the main means of state macroeconomic regulation and control. By means of financial revenue, the state can regulate the aggregate social supply and demand. It can also regulate the economic structure, regional structure and social distribution and redistribution. At present, the principal problems in our finance are: Revenue levying is not efficient, while its payment is far from sufficient. There have been great losses in taxes. The relationship between central finance and local finance has not been straightened out. The growth of central financial revenue lags far behind that of the national economy, being unable to meet the needs of state macroeconomic regulation and control. In expenditure, economic expenditure is not clearly separated from construction expenditure, with each crowding out the other. Consequently the efficiency of utilization is low. To solve these problems, it is necessary to practice a unified taxation system as well as the system whereby enterprises pay tax plus a percentage of profits, to strengthen supervision of tax collection by law, to practice the system of tax sharing and to increase the proportion of tax revenue going to the central government. It is also necessary to produce dual budgets and handle well the relationship between feeding the people and construction. What needs pointing out especially is that the state power of financial control and its use is the material basis for the realization of macroeconomic regulation and control. Power of financial control chiefly refers to the proportion of national revenue in the GNP and the proportion of central revenue in the GNP. Since the reform and opening up to the world these two proportions have decreased quickly. The proportion of central revenue has decreased by a large margin. Consequently it makes it difficult for state macroeconomic regulation and control to achieve good results due to the loss of effective financial support. It also makes it difficult to carry out a lot of reform measures (including price, wage, and other reforms) smoothly and in a timely manner due to the lack of financial backup. Some people of insight in the West have long since discovered that China is a country with the most diverse financial resources and the weakest central finance control capacity in the world. It is because of a solid financial basis that those Western countries that practice market economy, like the United States and Japan, can more effectively realize government macroeconomic regulation and control. This point is worth our learning. 3. Banking. It is the economic means and measure for state macroeconomic regulation and control. The government controls the overall supply and demand for currency, the total scale of credit investment and the aggregate import and export amounts by way of monetary policies and measures such as issuance of basic currency, credit loans, interest rates and exchange rates. At the same time it affects the microbehavior of enterprises. At present, the main problems existing in our banking sector are: The central bank, with no independence or definite functions, finds it difficult to establish its authority; the coexistence of the policy-oriented function and business-oriented function in specialized banks leads to inaccurate action; there is too much intervention in local banks by governments at various levels; the dual exchange rate system confuses import and export trade. The ways to solve them are: Establish an independent, authoritative central bank as soon as possible; organize and establish state policy-oriented banks; change specialized banks into real commercial banks; limit illegal intervention in banks by local government with laws and polices; change the exchange rate system and gradually practice the system of a free exchange rate. What needs pointing out in particular is that the confusion that has occurred in the present monetary system has a lot to do with the above-mentioned problems. Moreover, it also accounts for the fact that banks and monetary institutions get involved directly or indirectly in the purchase and sale of shares and securities, real estate business and non-monetary profit-making activities. There are two types of relationship between banking and the securities sector. One is the American model, that is, banks and securities are established separately. The other is the West European type, that is, banks can run securities business at the same time. As for the relationship between banks and enterprises, there are three types. One is the American type, that is, banks are strictly separated from enterprises. Neither can hold shares in the other. Another is the German type, that is, banks can hold shares in enterprises, but not the other way round. Still another is the Japanese type, that is, both enterprises and banks can be mutual shareholders. Each type has its own merits and demerits. As there are no definite responsibilities or relationship between the central bank and specialized banks and between policy-oriented banks and commercial banks in our country and the laws concerning banking institutions and their operations are not perfect, for a certain period of time banks and monetary institutions should be forbidden to get involved in securities exchange and other activities of non- monetary investment and management. Otherwise, it will be really difficult to establish normal order in the monetary market. The contents of macroeconomic regulation and control in socialist market economy also include industrial policy, price management, infrastructure construction, state asset management, etc. Through the formulation of industrial policies, the state provides enterprises with guidance in the choice of industries for investment, quickens industrial adjustment and replacement and promotes the upgrading and modernization of the industrial structure. Price management is one of the important functions of the government. Price reform should be carried out in order and step by step under government control, especially when price relationships are not yet straightened out. Even later, after price relationships are basically straightened out, prices of some important products concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood should be controlled directly by the state. As for the construction of large-scale infrastructure, major projects like communications hubs and city public utilities, which require big investment with long construction periods and low profit, and even losses, should mainly depend on investment from the government. State assets need government management all the more. III. Problems in the Present Macroeconomic Regulation and Control At present, the main factors affecting the efficiency of our macroeconomic regulation and control are: 1) The basic numbers are not clear. There exists the phenomenon of "holding something back," that is, no matter whether it is industrial output value, investment scale, financial revenue, or enterprise or personal income, a rather big leeway is left when reporting it to the higher authorities. And there exists another phenomenon in undeveloped areas, that is, targets, output, production value, revenue etc. are exaggerated; they are "inflated" to varying degrees. It is not a bad thing for localities, enterprises and individuals to store wealth. However, the problem is that the state has no idea how big the leeway left by the localities is, how much falsity there is in their reports and how large the margin is between the state statistics and the actual figures. It is easy to make mistakes in macro-decisionmaking because of unclear base numbers and judgments based on unreliable data. 2) The means for macroeconomic regulation and control are not perfect and effective. The ways and means of economic management are many, but few are really effective. Scale management is still one of the chief means we now use to control aggregate quantities in society. However, scale limits have been broken time and again both in investment in fixed assets and in credit. According to estimates by people in financial circles, actual credit loans completed are about one-fourth higher than the reported figure. The over-scale investment and low standard in duplicate construction of quite a number of localities directly affect the growth of the overall efficiency of the national economy. It is difficult to realize the efficiency of the macroeconomic regulation and control because we have not found a means for scale management that meets the demands of market economy. 3) The power and responsibilities of both the central and local governments are not definite; neither is there any clear division of work between them. The present situation is that the lower the administrative level, the greater its ability to guide and control the economy, whereas the higher the administrative level, the weaker its ability to guide and control. 4) Orders are not obeyed nor prohibitions observed. There is a saying: The experience of success gained by local authorities is: "Do not do whatever the central government asks you to do and do whatever it asks you not to do." If things go on like this, the central government will lose its authority while local governments go their own way. It will be impossible to give full play to the advantage put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, that is: "Socialism focuses its strength to do big things." It also directly affects the overall efficiency of the national economy. To deal with the above- mentioned problems, emphasis should be laid on doing a good job in the construction of the following four systems: First, build a scientific, national economic statistics monitoring system that meets the needs of the healthy development of market economy, strengthen macromonitoring of basic statistics work and improve the scientific reliability and accuracy of statistics monitoring in order to reduce errors in macro-decisionmaking. Second, build a sound macroeconomic regulation and control system that meets the needs of the development of socialist market economy. The various economic levers should be adjusted in accordance with the complexity and particularity of the targets of regulation during the transition of the economic system so as to ensure timely, appropriate and effective adjustment. Especially at present, we should intensify the application of financial means. As the present financial system is far behind this need, the step of reforming the financial system should be quickened. Third, establish and perfect as soon as possible a responsibility-power division system, divide the financial power and administrative power reasonably between the central and local governments, and set a definite division of work and responsibilities so that each exercises its function to do a good job in whatever it should take care of. Fourth, speed up the establishment of a system to guarantee effective implementation of the macropolicies, strengthen the construction of a legislative and law-enforcement contingent, strengthen supervision, and administer according to law so as to maintain the inviolability of state policies and regulations and thoroughly change the situation in which laws are neither observed nor seriously enforced.
