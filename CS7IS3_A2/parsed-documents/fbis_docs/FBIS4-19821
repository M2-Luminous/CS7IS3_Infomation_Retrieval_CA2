To justify this ban, it was said on Thursday that this event could be organized by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). This, however, would be a direct danger to "public order and security." A large number of policemen will, if necessary, enforce the ban "consistently," it was said. Participants who travel to Duesseldorf from outside are to be "caught" when entering the city.
