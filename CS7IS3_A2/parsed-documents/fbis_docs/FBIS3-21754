Six different ethnic minority groups make up the population of Yen Bai Province. Apart from rare timber, the local people earn their living mainly from growing poppy. Because of this, the people are used to taking opium and drug addiction has consequently developed at an alarming rate. Opium is making its presence increasingly felt in Yen Bai and has caused many to succumb to the magic of its soothing white smoke. A considerable number of people have been reported to have died from severe drug addiction. Not only is opium available in the black market, it has also found its way into various schools and ranks of government cadres, bringing men and also women under its influence. Women are said to have passionately turned to this habit to find solace in the opium smoke. In 1993, Yen Bai province issued many decrees on measures to fight this bad practice. It has invested in drug rehabilitation centers and also launched repeated crackdowns on drug addicts. However, not much results have been obtained. That is why this spring, Yen Bai is still bathed in the ghostly white color of the poppy flower.
