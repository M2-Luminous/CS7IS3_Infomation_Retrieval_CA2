"It is essential to our national security to continue draft registration and the selective service system (SSS)," Clinton wrote in letters to Congress, said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers in a statement. Clinton argued that the SSS and the registration provide "a hedge against unforeseen threats and a relatively low-cost `insurance policy' against our underestimating the maximum level of threat we expect our armed forces to face." "Terminating the SSS and draft registration now could send the wrong signal to our potential enemies who are watching for signs of U.S. resolve," he warned. He added that "it is increasingly important" to maintain the link between the all volunteer force and the U.S. society at large at a time when fewer and fewer people have direct military experience. In January, Clinton ordered the National Security Council to review the policy. The process involved representatives from the Office of the Secretary of State, the Pentagon inspector general and the Office of Management and Budget and SSS. The decision, in effect, rejected a Pentagon conclusion earlier this year that ending draft registration would pose no risk to national security. Clinton also urged lawmakers to support the administration's 1995 budget request of 23 million dollars for the SSS.
