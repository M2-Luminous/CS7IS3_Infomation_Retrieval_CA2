Churkin replaces M. Woerner as the secretary general of this military alliance. In fact, Churkin should already be recognized in his acquired status of NATO secretary general. If he were secretary general, everything would go smoothly, as in these days! There would be no quarrels. Even the large intelligence scandal which broke out when a Russian agent was found in the CIA leadership would be resolved in a quiet and civilized way. If Churkin were NATO secretary general, it is certain that he would be able to reach the same attitude of all NATO members toward the aggression against civilians and UN Protection Force members as is the case with the present secretary general. He would also withdraw in the same realistic way as Woerner did when the time came for firing on the aggressor in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Croatia? Since nobody mentioned Croatia in the ultimatum, Croatia can only be a topic for an academic discussion. Let me summarize: Nobody would notice any external manifestation of absurdity in Churkin's leading NATO. It is possible that somebody notices certain internal manifestations of it at the moment when every member of the alliance expresses its aims openly. France and Britain have stopped NATO actions hundreds of times so far, so that Russia, the main post-Cold War ally --as this is expressed in Washington -- should be given this possibility, too. Simulating the Ultimatum This time the Russian counterultimatum was respected; NATO gave up announced air strikes in the name of the strategy of political negotiations. The efforts for peace allegedly rose after the military threat had been expressed to both Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade. So, let us see how Serbs are coping with these negotiations. They are threatening with both weapons and words. Everybody who hoped that something else would happen is a "first-class" political dilettante. Belgrade, which should have been shaken by the NATO threats, is still self-confidently stating that it will not approve of opening of the Tuzla Airport, neither for peace nor for war purposes. NATO has issued an ultimatum that the airport must be opened on 7 March. We shall see how NATO will respond to the latest refusal from Belgrade, but we can already be sure that NATO's reaction will be of the Churkin type. The Churkin-type reaction has already been seen in a more dangerous incident than the possible one with the Tuzla Airport -- when Chetniks occupied the Sava Bridge between Stara Gradiska and Bosanska Gradiska. The local UN Protection Force (allegedly protected by the NATO ultimatum) were humiliated and expelled from their positions, their houses for monitoring were destroyed.... Approximately 20 Serbian tanks and armored vehicles (withdrawn from Sarajevo?) came so close that they can cross the Croatian border at any time (that is to say the occupied territory, but still a part of Croatia according to what NATO, the UN, and all others say). At the request of the UN Protection Force NATO aircraft are now flying over this territory and simulating the ultimatum. They are simulating it in the real sense of the word since Croatia is not mentioned in the text of the ultimatum, so that it cannot be included in its Churkin- type implementation. An act of simulation was also made the day before yesterday in response to a Serbian artillery attack on Swedish UN Protection Force members near Vares. NATO aircraft arrived in the area in which five Swedish soldiers were wounded and concluded that it could not be established who fired. Since they had a clear conscience they returned home, leaving the possibility open that either Serbs or Muslims could have fired -- or perhaps the Swedish soldiers themselves -- just as it was imputed to Muslims that they shot at the people in the Sarajevo market. If NATO aircraft were flying over Maslenica, Kasic, Paljuv, or Peruca in these days, they would not be able to see who is shooting there either. They would return home peacefully, leaving the possibility open that the Croatian Army was shooting at its own positions. As if it were not known that it was the Croatian president himself who ordered the attack on the presidential palace in Zagreb during the war in Croatia! Serbs Are Going On With Incidents Churkin, as the acting NATO secretary general, could be confronted with unpleasant situations, though -- like the one when a Serbian officer was caught by cameras in an action which violated the ultimatum (if there is something like that at all). The incident happened two days ago [22 February] in front of CBS cameras at the place where Serbian artillery weapons were being collected under the supervision of the British UN Protection Force. A Serbian officer came there with a truck, took one of the collected guns (a mountain gun, of the B-1 type), attached it to the truck, and drove away in front of UN monitors. He was stopped by British UN Protection Force soldiers at the exit, though (they are professionals, and, apart from that, cameras were there). General Rose, the UN Protection Force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was called, and he ordered his soldiers to return the gun to the marked area. A British officer said that there were still five or six Serbian guns on the surrounding hills. Nobody attacked them from the air, and we do not know anything about them. Such incidents and serious attacks by Serbian artillery are going on in the area between Bihac and Tuzla, from Maslenica to Gradiska. This means that the whole territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of Croatia are affected. What can be concluded from this? It is quite obvious that the NATO ultimatum has not taken effect. That is why there are no political negotiations which should have followed from it. Churkin's engagement and enumeration of Serbian incidents are the only two things which have been noticed so far. Churkin and the Serbs are both led by the idea to undermine a NATO intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It could be easily predicted that this idea would be carried out in this way. It is being openly carried out in the occupied Croatian territories and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Encouraged by the success of the Russian counter-ultimatum, Serbs are going on with incidents in all occupied territories (which are too large for a concentrated NATO action) using small weapons (a too cheap goal for setting the whole NATO machinery in motion) and selecting those targets which are not directly mentioned in the ultimatum (so that NATO does not have the "legal" basis for an action).... Their aim is evident -- to preserve as much occupied territories as possible though unsanctioned military actions. They have enough time and military power to do this. Apart from that, they have the political blessing from Russia which claims that it will not allow any further ultimatums for Bosnia.
