Sansaricq, president of the other Office of the Haitian Senate, thinks the Group of Latin American Countries should have also demanded the lifting of the international sanctions against Haiti. [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] They have seen that the embargo has yielded nothing. On the contrary, it has hardened the stance of some in Haiti who are really fighting for democracy and who have said that foreign countries do not have the right to interfere in our internal affairs and that we have definitively decided to pay the price -- no matter what it is. They have seen that an illegal and criminal embargo -- an embargo aimed at destroying the country, the country's economy, and the Haitian people -- has already caused 25,000 deaths in Haiti, not to mention children. We cannot imagine the destruction brought to the country's ecology. There will be elections very soon in the Dominican Republic. The country's situation can affect the results of those elections. There are factors that show the other Latin American countries that this nonsense cannot continue. They must finally lift the embargo and let Haiti decide for itself on its own fate. Not only do I share their opinion but I think they should have gone further, they should have demanded the outright lifting of the embargo against Haiti. [Unidentified reporter] Furthermore, Sen. Sansaricq has called on all sectors of the national life to participate in the formation of a new government. [Sansaricq] Since I was [elected] president of the Senate, we have been ready and waiting for the other institutions which will accompany us in the process of establishing a nationalist government, a government that can lead the fate of the country, because we cannot remain in this deep confusion with the resigning Robert Malval government that is doing nothing, that is dismissing people from time to time even though it has no right to do so because it is a resigning government. The Senate is ready; the Senate has always said it is ready. We are ready to do what has to be done so we can form a nationalist government in Haiti. We are open. We are open so we can reach a solution that will get the country out of the crisis. The Senate is open. The Senate is ready. [end recording]
