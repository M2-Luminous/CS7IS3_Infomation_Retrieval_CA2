Meeting with some of the participants of the '94 China Summit Meeting, which opened here today, Li Peng stressed that China is willing to resume its contracting status in GATT at an early date and become one of the founding members of the future World Trade Organization (WTO), adding that China has made many efforts to this end. He said that the relations between China and GATT or even the future WTO are mutually beneficial. China needs multi-lateral trade organizations like GATT while GATT and the future WTO also need China. If China, a country with over 1.1 billion people and a rapidly growing economy and trade volume, is barred from entry into GATT, it is hard to say that such a World Trade Organization is an integral one, he said. The Chinese premier also briefed the participants on the characteristics and contents of China's socialist market economic system, the situation of the state-owned major and middle-sized enterprises, the efforts China has made to handle the relations between reform, development and stability as well as the measures adopted to deepen the reform and strengthen macro-control. He pointed out that for China development is the purpose, reform is the motive force and stability is the condition. Later on Li Peng hosted a banquet in honor of all the participants at the '94 China Summit Meeting at the Great Hall of the People. Li said that China is a peace-loving country. The establishment of economic construction as the central task and the introduction of reform and opening policies advocated by Deng Xiaoping at the end of the 1970s have brought tremendous changes to China, he noted. He continued that currently China is enjoying political stability, economic development, unity among its nationalities and social progress. "We have never been so confident in the future of our country," Li stressed. Owing to its large population and less-developed economy, however, China has a long way to go in this respect, Li said. To develop its economy rapidly, China needs the long-time cooperation of the international community. "We sincerely hope that our foreign friends all over the world will cooperate and exchange with us in capital, technology, management and other aspects," he said. The country is a huge market and open to all countries that are willing to develop friendly cooperation with it, he noted. China is willing to learn about the rest of the world and the rest of the world needs to learn about China, he said. This end is surely attainable, judging from all the speeches at today's meeting. The summit meeting has dealt not only with China's economy, but with the world economy and its long-term development. "Peace and development are the common task we are faced with," Li told the gathering. Asia, East Asia in particular, boasts the most energetic economic growth in the world and has a bright future, Li said. He expressed the hope that the summit meeting would be held annually or every other year in his country and pledged it full support from the Chinese government. In his speech, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad praised new changes he had witnessed in Beijing since his visit here last year. This has resulted from the hard work of the Chinese leadership, the government and the people, he said. Mahathir voiced his appreciation of China's achievements. The prosperity of China is sure to bring about prosperity to East Asia and the rest of the whole region, Mahathir said. He wished the Chinese people more achievements in their national construction. Among those participating in today's meeting and banquet were Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, the World Bank's Managing Director Ernest Stern, and Richard McLean, publisher of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, was also present at the occasion.
