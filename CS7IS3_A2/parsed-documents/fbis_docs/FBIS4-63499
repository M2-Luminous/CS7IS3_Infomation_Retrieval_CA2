He told INTERFAX-Ukraine on Sunday [22 May] evening that people were walking across the city and nothing was happening. "This is a state of illness" when one imagines intervention and troops in the streets, he remarked. Nedrigailo pointed out that there had been complete mutual understanding and confidence between the Ukrainian and the Crimean interior ministries. He added that the Ukrainian National Guard units were carrying out their law enforcement duties together with Crimean police officers. Commenting on the information concerning Ukrainian armored vehicles in Simferopol, Nedrigailo said their arrival in Simferopol had been made known long ago. First Deputy Crimean Parliament Chairman Viktor Mezhak and a group of Crimean parliamentarians had been present when the armored vehicles arrived on Saturday. Nedrigailo announced that about twenty armored vehicles had come. Non-official sources said that there had been about 29 armored vehicles arriving in Simferopol. It is just normal equipment of the National Guards with armored carriers, Nedrigailo emphasized.
