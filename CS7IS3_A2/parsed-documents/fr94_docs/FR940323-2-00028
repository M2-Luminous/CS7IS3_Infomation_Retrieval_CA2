FR940323-2-00028 FR940323-2-00016 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;017. Applicant: University of Maryland, Physics Department, College Park, MD 20742&hyph;4111. Instrument: Thin Film Deposition System. Manufacturer: Precision Research Instruments, Canada. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of a class of low transition temperature superconductors, mainly transition metal elemental superconductors such as Nb and binary superconductors such as Mo-Ge and Nb-N. These studies will include investigating the electrodynamics of proximity coupled superconductors and the properties of arrays of coupled Josephson junctions. In addition, the instrument will be used extensively in four courses offered by the physics department. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 16, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;021. Applicant: University of Colorado at Boulder, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Campus Box 215, Boulder, CO 80309&hyph;0215. Instrument: Cryostream Nitrogen Gas Cooler. Manufacturer: Oxford Cryosystems, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of crystals of protein molecules or RNA molecules in order to determine the structures of molecules at atomic resolution. The resulting structural information will be important in protein engineering and understanding how RNA molecules fold up into conformations that are biologically active. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in several chemistry courses. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 17, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;024. Applicant: Lehigh University, 111 Research Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18015. Instrument: Measurement and Analysis of Surface Interactions and Forces. Manufacturer: Anutech Pty Ltd., Australia. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to measure: (1) The forces of interaction between polymer-bearing surfaces as a function of their distance of separation (on the order of molecular dimensions) and (2) the friction and viscosity between these surfaces. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in the graduate level course Ch.E. (Chem., Mat) 497 &hyph; Polymer Interfaces which includes 4&hyph;6 weeks of laboratory training for instrumental analysis of polymer surfaces and interfaces. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 24, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;025. Applicant: Princeton University, Geological & Geophysical Sciences, Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544. Instrument: Calorimetric System, Model STA409C. Manufacturer: Netzsch.&hyph;Geratebau GmbH, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to conduct experiments involving quantitative scanning calorimetry and TGA/DTA of silicates, oxides, minerals and ceramics with the objective of understanding fundamental thermodynamic properties. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 24, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;026. Applicant: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Chemistry, Chapel Hill, NC 27599&hyph;3290. Instrument: High Resolution Sector Mass Spectrometer, Model MAT 900. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used in the development of new and improved analytical mass spectrometry methods in research which involves biological molecules such as peptides, carbohydrates and oligonucleotides, synthetic polymers, and general organic molecules. In addition, phenomena associated with tandem mass spectrometry will be investigated. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: February 24, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;029. Applicant: University of Florida, Department of Chemistry, PO Box 117200, Gainesville, FL 32611&hyph;7200. Instrument: Excimer Laser Pumped Dye Laser System, Model LPX 240i. Manufacturer: Lambda Physik, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used as an excitation source for ionization of elemental species which have been vaporized in an electrothermal furnace and atomized (i.e., converted to free atoms) in an air&hyph;acetylene flame. The research will focus on the development of the method with emphasis on the analysis of trace elements in small biological samples (body fluids and tissues).
