After the NATO summit and the top level meetings in Prague, does Hungarian diplomacy regard the developments as a success or fiasco? [Boross] [passage omitted] There was plenty of pouting in the foreign and domestic press. However, what happened means significantly more. It allows us to hope that if we meet certain conditions, the path may lead to NATO and security. [Correspondent] Was this optimism confirmed by personal meetings, too, first and foremost, of course, with U.S. President Clinton? [Boross] Yes. He is a politician of very cordial voice and informal style. The discussion had a pleasant atmosphere and was very rich in content. A new element evolved, and it is very important. U.S. intentions for Central Europe's economic support were voiced. When President Clinton told us he would convene a conference in the United States as early as this year to facilitate the region's economic development, we learned about an initiative of the President that is destined to stimulate U.S. investment endeavors. Thus, the clear intention now seems to be to promote economic stability. [Correspondent] Together or individually -- it is obviously a big question in such an economic rise. [Boross] During my talks in Prague I had the opportunity to stress to various negotiating partners that, quite peculiarly, the forces that shape world politics think very much in terms of regions, most of the times not in terms of individual countries, but a series of linkable countries, that is regions. However, it is also clear from the statement that joining NATO, the progress, rapprochement to NATO, or becoming a NATO member are subject to the countries' individual performance. We would like to sign the document in Brussels on joining, which, we hope, will be followed by a couple of months work to prepare a working program. It will presumably include several compulsory elements regarding requirements related to the Armed Forces' armament, education, and skills, perhaps language knowledge. It shows by itself that at present the political desire that we should immediately write a letter and ask for NATO admission is absolutely unreal. [passage omitted -- Boross says two years ago, when Socialist chief Gyula Horn raised the idea of joining NATO, Hungary's application would have been rejected] [Correspondent] Obviously, every proposal is related to increasing the country's defensive ability, and in general matters regarding the country's stability. Now, after these talks, is Hungary in a significantly more favorable situation from this viewpoint than it was, let's say, two or three weeks [as heard] ago? [Boross] God forbid [ne adja a sors] that we have to test how NATO would react if some more serious danger threatened us. However, I am convinced that this initiative and also its textual content means a more favorable security situation to us than two or three years ago. However, it does not yet mean absolute security; the security that one can achieve with NATO membership. [Correspondent] Have these talks between the Visegrad countries brought about new tensions or, perhaps, have old ones, which have to be settled, been raised? It is a permanent problem, question, that the Hungarian Government does not eliminate but increases these tensions. I mean by this the prime minister's meeting with Prime Minister Meciar where the issue of Gabcikovo-Nagymaros [hydroelectric power plant and dam] and the minority issue were again raised. [Boross] I have to say that the main emphasis was on cooperation at all three talks, including my talks with Mr. Meciar. There are problems and we are aware of them. However, it was not possible to solve or to make an attempt to solve them during this time. In spite of this fact, we have a lot to do in the field of economic relations, for example in strengthening free trade relations. As soon as I returned home, this free trade issue, the question where we really stand in this matter, was put on my desk. The Hungarian Government does not worsen these relations. However, the Hungarian Government lives with a historic situation. A Hungarian Government cannot be indifferent to Hungarians living beyond its borders -- if it respected itself and called itself a Hungarian Government. The allegation that the Hungarian Government took steps that made the situation more tense then desirable I consider impossible. We have to take exception with those who think that if any kind of atrocity or disadvantageous step affected the Hungarian community in a neighboring country, the government should stay silent. Well, it cannot stay silent. [Correspondent] To what extent will the agreements, which have been or will be concluded in the form of agreements in the course of talks, influence the relations of the region's countries with Ukraine and Russia, the Russian territories. [as heard] [Boross] I have to say that the Partnership for Peace initiative can be a kind of spiritual familiarization for those who have been frightened or received this initiative unfavorably or with criticism. Therefore, the fact that here, in this region, only endeavors for security, and not preparations against the domination of somebody, can be proved by a series of facts. Ukrainian and Russian relations are extremely important to us. I hope we can soon welcome the Russian prime minister in Budapest. And here, in this place, realistically assessing where the storm of history has placed us, we have to declare that, yes, our orientation is indeed trans-Atlantic from the security point of view, but our relations toward the eastern region can be described with peaceful intentions, friendly motivations, the strengthening of political ties, and the prosperity of the economy in a way that, in the current market situation, can be really imagined only with a strengthening eastern market. [Correspondent] Should we not bother about the message of the victorious Russian -- Zhirinovskiy -- sent almost every day that we should remain neutral and not to get closer to NATO. [Boross] Well, to be honest, I hear and read different things, not only because I do not speak Russian, but for other reasons as well. [passage indistinct] The aforementioned gentleman has bewildering manifestations. If he said this, I have to qualify his manifestations as very immature. However, I hope that it cannot be considered as the Russian policy. This is a kind of peripheral phenomenon, if there were indeed voices like this. [passage omitted]
