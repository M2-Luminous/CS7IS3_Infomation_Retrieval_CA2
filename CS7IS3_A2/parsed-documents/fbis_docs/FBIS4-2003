It has successfully mobilized and organized the people of all nationalities in Qinghai to emancipate the mind, quicken the pace of reform and opening up, overcome difficulties, work hard, and live a plain life. The result has been that Qinghai has enjoyed rapid economic growth, political stability, nationality solidarity, and social progress and has basically accomplished the tasks and attained the goals outlined at the First Session of the Eighth Qinghai Provincial People's Congress. The fourth meeting said: The Qinghai Provincial Government Work Report has realistically summed up the Qinghai Provincial Government work in 1993, has pointed out the existing problems, and has analyzed both the difficulties hampering Qinghai's economic growth and the favorable conditions under which Qinghai will tide over the difficulties. The Qinghai Provincial Government Work Report is bound to exert a positive impact on such aspects as improving and strengthening the people's government work and mobilizing the people of all nationalities in Qinghai to grasp opportunities, stand up to new challenges, and make concerted efforts to strive for new victories. The fourth meeting pointed out: The year 1994 is the fourth year of the Eighth Five-Year Plan as well as a crucial year for pushing ahead with the province's comprehensive reform and making some major breakthroughs in this connection. The Qinghai Provincial Government Work Report has charted a clear-cut guiding ideology, has outlined explicit tasks, and has worked out efficient and feasible measures that are commensurate with the realities in Qinghai. This year, as the province is bound to undertake arduous and urgent reform tasks, the people's governments at all levels in Qinghai should strive to further heighten understanding, expeditiously build a socialist market economic structure, meticulously organize people to actively and properly handle problems and contradictions that crop up in the course of reform, and see to it that all sorts of reforms will go ahead smoothly. They should also attach great importance to agriculture and animal husbandry, should vigorously develop township and town enterprises, should raise funds through all possible channels, should increase inputs in resource exploitation and infrastructure construction, should make constant efforts to readjust and optimize the market-oriented economic structure, should improve the quality of economic operations, should step up macroeconomic regulation and control, should place price hikes under control, and should make sound arrangements for the masses' livelihood. The fourth meeting stressed: Social stability is an important guarantee for reform and development. Therefore, the people's governments at all levels throughout the province should firmly adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two major aspects of work simultaneously as well as consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity. The fourth meeting finally called on people of all nationalities in Qinghai to unite closely, further emancipate the mind, forge ahead, open up new vistas, and strive to accomplish all tasks in 1994 under the leadership of the Qinghai Provincial CPC Committee!
