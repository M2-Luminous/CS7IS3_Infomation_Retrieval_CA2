A single secretary or an executive committee? For two days the Liberal Party has debated and argued these points, and a short time ago they made their decision. Mimmo Sacco reports. [Sacco] Yes, now we can truly say goodbye to the old Italian Liberal Party [PLI]. The party has changed its image and moves are underway to turn it into a liberal federation. The decision was a bitter one. It was passed this evening by a show of hands. By the end of the vote there were signs of irritation and agitation -- easy to understand since the stakes were high. The intervention of [PLI Secretary Raffaele] Costa was necessary to unblock the situation: An elected body will guide the party during this transitional period until the congress that is scheduled to take place mid-July. The proposal put forward by De Luca -- that of direct elections for the secretary of the congress -- was rejected. De Luca himself had declared his intention of running for party secretary, and he loudly proclaimed that the party was being done away with. As we have already said, the whole day was punctuated by long procedural matters, but the decision has now been made.
