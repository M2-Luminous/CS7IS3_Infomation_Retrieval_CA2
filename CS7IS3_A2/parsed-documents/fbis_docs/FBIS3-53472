When this materializes, the road to a fair and permanent peace will be open wide. In a commentary in Tuesday's edition, the paper says the meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton clearly showed that the Syrian president conceals nothing and candidly declares his country's readiness to respond positively to everything Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin demands in return for ending the occupation of the Golan Heights. AL-AKHBAR stated that every sign affirms that the Syrian-U.S. summit was successful by any standard and achieved in one day what 10 rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks failed to achieve. The paper notes President Clinton's complete understanding of the Syrian position and of President al-Asad's stance, despite Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's attempt to portray the talks as a lucrative deal for Syria [words indistinct].
