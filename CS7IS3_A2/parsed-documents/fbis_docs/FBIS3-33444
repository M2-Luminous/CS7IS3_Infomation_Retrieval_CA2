They now stand at 67.50 points, which translates to losses of approximately $2 billion. Traders say this is basically due to three factors: Standard and Poor's announcement that Venezuela has been reclassified as a country of great investment risk; the U.S. inflation rate announcement, which affects U.S. 30-year bonds, which in turn affects Venezuelan collateral bonds; and a domino effect in various banks following the weekend news on financial system destabilization.
