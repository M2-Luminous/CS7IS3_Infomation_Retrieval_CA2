According to the available information, Talabani and Burkay went to the Syrian capital Damascus last week to meet Ocalan. It was said that Talabani and Burkay were going to propose to Ocalan to declare a cease-fire on the eve of the local elections [in Turkey]. Syria's refusal to allow the meeting to take place opened the way to some speculation. PUK's representative in Ankara confirmed that Talabani went to Syria last week and stayed there for "a very brief period." The representative said that he has no information as to whether a meeting was held with Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan]. It has been learned that PUK leader Jalal Talabani has now gone to Saudi Arabia from Syria. It was reported that Saudi Arabia has extended an official invitation to Talabani. The meeting with Talabani was interpreted as Saudi Arabia assuming an active interest in the Kurdish problem. It has also been learned that Semdin Sakik, PKK's Amed [area covering Diyarbakir, Bingol, and Mus] provincial commander, has resigned from his post and left for Germany. It was reported that Sakik, who had kidney problems, resigned his position voluntarily and that a new commander has been "appointed" for Amed. The PKK circles ascribe reports of "differences" between Sakik and Ocalan to the "psychological warfare" being waged by the state.
