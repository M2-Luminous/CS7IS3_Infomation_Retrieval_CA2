ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This Report and Order removes unnecessary equipment authorization requirements for Magnetic Resonance (MR) Systems. This action is taken in response to a petition from the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The intended effect of this action is to reduce the amount of time and money required to bring new non-consumer, medical magnetic resonance systems to market. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Errol Chang, Office of Engineering and Technology (202) 653&hyph;7316. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;255, FCC 94&hyph;155, adopted on June 13, 1994 and released on July 13, 1994. The full text of this Decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.

Paperwork Reduction Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 18 hours per response including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications Commission, Office of Managing Director, Paperwork Reduction Project [3060&hyph;0329], Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project [3060&hyph;0329], Washington, DC 20503. Summary of Report and Order 1. By this action, the Commission is amending Part 18 of its rules to remove regulations that unnecessarily increase the amount of time and money required to bring new non-consumer, medical magnetic resonance (MR) systems to market. These systems are used by medical professionals to study the molecular structure of a patient for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. This action is taken in response to a petition for rule making filed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association on January 29, 1992. 2. 47 CFR Part 18 sets forth requirements designed to minimize the potential for interference to radio and TV services by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment. Such equipment generates radio frequency (RF) energy in order to perform a non-communications related function. Common examples of non-consumer ISM equipment include microwave ovens and RF lighting devices. Examples of non-consumer ISM equipment include industrial heaters, RF stabilized are welders and magnetic resonance (MR) equipment. Before ISM equipment can be marketed in the United States, it must comply with the technical standards and equipment authorization procedures specified in 47 CFR Part 18. 3. It appears that MR systems pose little risk of interference because of the way they are designed and installed by professionals. We note that there are under 1000 installations of MR systems. We further note that, in the event that measures need to be taken to correct interference, the locations of these installations are on file with Manufacturers due to U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations. We also recognize that the authorization requirement is burdensome and costly for MR systems. Given the low volume production of MR systems, such requirements can significantly affect the unit cost of each system, contributing to the increasing costs of medical care. 4. The circumstances presented here are similar to those that led us earlier to exempt non-consumer medical ultrasonic equipment from 47 CFR Part 18 rules. We are unaware of any interference that resulted from the medical ultrasonic equipment exemption. On balance, we tentatively conclude that the costs of our technical standards and authorization requirements for MR systems are unwarranted given the low risk of interference. Accordingly, we are amending 47 CFR Part 18 to exempt MR systems from the technical standards and authorization requirements that now apply to them. We will continue to apply the requirements of 47 CFR Section 18.111(b), which require operators of MR systems to correct any harmful interference that may occur. The proposed rule changes are set forth below. 5. Accordingly, it is ordered that pursuant to the authority contained in Section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 CFR Part 18 is amended as set forth below. These Rules and Regulations are effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . It is further ordered that this proceeding is terminated. 6.

List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 18 Medical devices, Hospitals, Radio, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Part 18 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 18_INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 1. The authority citation for Part 18 continues to read as follows: Authority: 47 U.S.C. 4, 301, 302, 303, 304, and 307. 2. Section 18.107 is revised by adding a new paragraph (j) to read as follows: ยง18.107 Definitions. * * * * * (j) Magnetic resonance equipment. A category of ISM equipment in which RF energy is used to create images and data representing spatially resolved density of transient atomic resources within an object. 3. Section 18.121 is revised to read as follows: ยง18.121 Exemptions. Non-consumer ultrasonic equipment, and non-consumer magnetic resonance equipment, that is used for medical diagnostic and monitoring applications is subject to the provision of Sections 18.105, 18.109 through 18.119, 18.301 and 18.303.
