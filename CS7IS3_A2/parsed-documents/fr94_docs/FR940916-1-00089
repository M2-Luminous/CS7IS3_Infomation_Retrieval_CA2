FR940916-1-00089 FR940916-1-00016 Amtrak and two other passenger and commuter railroads provided comments regarding COT&S requirements for passenger cars. These commenters felt that the brake equipment on passenger cars can be maintained by criteria other than time-based COT&S. The parties proposed the possibility of requiring that a single car test be performed each time a car is on the repair track or each time the car comes in for preventive maintenance, about every 120 days. These parties would prefer to conduct periodic testing rather than changing out valves on a periodic basis. These commenters felt that the current three-year COT&S requirement on 26C-based systems is too restrictive. Amtrak also commented that the six-year COT&S requirement it employs for freight-type brake valves on its passenger cars should be considered an internal Amtrak policy. The BRC and several of its individual members admitted that the new single car test may be very valuable, but contended that the railroads are circumventing its use. These commenters stated that railroads are eliminating repair tracks all over the nation in order to avoid performing these single car tests. Several individuals presented examples of how the single car test and repair track test are being circumvented, such as making repairs in the field or moving cars to expediter tracks for repairs rather than to repair tracks. Therefore, the BRC recommended that some type of in-date testing or attention must be reinstated, preferably somewhere in the seven- to eight-year range. The RLEA also recommended that periodic attention be reinstated, contending that acceptance of AAR's unilateral change in the maintenance requirements allows the AAR to establish regulations without public comment. The BRC and several of its members also commented on the three-year COT&S requirement for passenger cars, contending that the requirement should be maintained due to condensation building up in the trainlines and the fact that compressors are not being maintained. The BRC also recommended that any change made by the AAR in their recommended maintenance practices should be approved by FRA. One manufacturer strongly endorsed the new single car test and repair track test as the most comprehensive tests ever performed. This commenter felt that these tests will ensure more effective brake maintenance than the previous application-and-release test and the 16-year COT&S requirement. FRA Conclusions. FRA agrees that the new single car test, which has been used industry-wide since January of 1992, is a much better and more comprehensive method of detecting and eliminating defective brake equipment and components than the old, time-based COT&S requirements. FRA believes that performance of the single car test will significantly reduce the number of defective components currently found and will dramatically increase the reliability of brake equipment. Thus, use of the single car test will greatly improve the safety of both railroad employees and the general public since brake equipment will be in better and safer condition. However, in order to fully benefit from the advantages of the single car test, cars must receive the test. Several labor commenters admitted that the new test was very valuable, but stated that the test is being circumvented by the railroads. These commenters provided various examples of how the tests are being avoided. Therefore, in order to ensure that all cars receive the new single car test, FRA proposes to require the performance of the test on a timely basis. FRA feels that the single car test should be conducted on any car that is on a repair or shop track for various wheel or brake equipment defects and that at a minimum freight service equipment should receive the test every one or two years depending on whether the equipment is high-utilization or non-high-utilization equipment, as defined below, and that commuter and passenger service equipment should receive the test at least every six months. Freight railroad representatives reported that on average a car is currently on the repair track 1.7 times a year and, thus, receives a full single car or repair track test at that time. Commuter and passenger railroad representatives reported that their cars are on a shop or repair track every 120 days. Therefore, FRA does not feel that requiring the single car test to be performed at the proposed time periods would be overly burdensome on the industry since, by its own admission, most cars will be on a repair or shop track within these time limits. Furthermore, parties would be allowed to request a change in the time interval for performing the single car test by monitoring their single car tests and conducting a statistical analysis of the results. The procedure for requesting a change in the time interval is further discussed in the section-by-section analysis. In order to ensure that the single car tests are properly performed, FRA believes that only qualified brake system inspectors should conduct the tests and that the single car testing devices should be tested at least once a day and receive maintenance at least every 92 days. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper maintenance of brake equipment, FRA believes that each railroad should develop and enforce written maintenance procedures for all types of brake systems it operates which meet or exceed current industry standards and all federal train brake system safety requirements. The maintenance required by these procedures should only be performed by individuals qualified as mechanical or electronic brake system inspectors. Spot checks of both the single car tests and the maintenance procedures should be conducted by qualified supervisory personnel to make sure the procedures are being followed and the tests are properly performed.
