"We are so poor it's better if I try to hijack a plane to Taiwan," Gao Guangkai told his mother before making his failed attempt on November 26 to hijack a flight between the eastern city of Nanjing and Fuzhou. Gao, 29, is from a family of five children living in a village in the underdeveloped eastern province of Anhui. He was a temporary sawmill worker, the newspaper said. The plane, which Gao threatened to blow up with a bomb concealed in his travel bag, finally landed at the airport in Hangzhou, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Nanjing. Gao was quickly apprehended by police. Gao's bag did not contain explosives, only a few personal effects and 26 yuan (four dollars), the newspaper said. Ten Chinese planes were hijacked to Taiwan in 1993, although there were two other known attempts. The hijackers face lengthy prison terms in Taiwan and officials there refuse to return them to the mainland as demanded by Beijing.
