FR941103-0-00071 FR941103-0-00010 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Southwick of the EPA Region IV Air Programs Branch at (404) 347&hyph;3555 extension 4207 and at the Region IV address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of Kentucky, EPA designated the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas as nonattainment because the areas violated the O 3 standard during the period from 1987 through 1989 (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.318.) The Owensboro and Edmonson County marginal O 3 nonattainment areas (nonattainment areas) more recently have ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O 3 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), during the period from 1989 through 1991. In addition, there have been no violations reported for the 1992, 1993, or 1994 O 3 seasons. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the amended CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted for parallel processing an O 3 maintenance SIP for the nonattainment areas and requested redesignation of the nonattainment areas to attainment with respect to the O 3 NAAQS and EPA found the request complete. On November 24, 1992, the Cabinet submitted the Marginal Ozone Nonattainment Areas Projection Inventory 1990&hyph;2004 as an amendment to the SIP. On January 15, 1993, the Cabinet submitted revisions addressing public comments on the request to redesignate the nonattainment areas to attainment. On July 16, 1993, February 28, 1994, and August 29, 1994, the Cabinet submitted revisions to the redesignation request, maintenance plan, and projection inventories. On May 7, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the Cabinet constituted a complete redesignation request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify when the Cabinet first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the amended CAA, including redesignation submittals, would not be determined complete. See ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines,'' Memorandum from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory submittals under the CAA, EPA believed it appropriate to change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to conform to the existing completeness criteria (58 FR 38108 (July 15, 1993)). Therefore, EPA believes, the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. The Cabinet submitted a redesignation request and a maintenance plan on November 13, 1992. When the maintenance plan became state effective on January 27, 1994, the Commonwealth of Kentucky no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The Kentucky redesignation request for the nonattainment areas meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the Commonwealth of Kentucky has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.
