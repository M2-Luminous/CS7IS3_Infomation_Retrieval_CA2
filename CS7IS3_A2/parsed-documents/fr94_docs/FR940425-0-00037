FR940425-0-00037 FR940425-0-00018 After reviewing the comment, NHTSA concurs and believes that if the vehicle has electrically operated shutoff valves that are normally open when the electrical system is activated, then they must be open at the time of the crash test. The agency believes that the vehicle test conditions should simulate, to the extent practicable, the conditions present in a real world crash. This is the same rationale used in having electrically activated fuel pumps in operation, before the crash test in Standard No. 301. E. Requirements Not Adopted 1. Static Rollover In the NPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose a static vehicle rollover test for dedicated CNG vehicles. The agency explained that a rollover requirement is only needed for liquid fuel vehicles (including dual-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles) because leakage is a function of gravity and the location of the rupture relative to the fuel. Without a rollover test, a rupture in the fuel system above the level of the liquid fuel would not be detected. In contrast, CNG is pressurized and would quickly escape upon rupture of the fuel system. Thus, for a CNG fuel system, any leakage would be unaffected by vehicle attitude or gravity. NHTSA received three comments addressing whether to include a static vehicle rollover requirement. Navistar and Washington State agreed with the agency's proposal that such a test was not needed. The New York City Fire Department (NYFD) believed that a rollover requirement was necessary since some CNG containers may be mounted on the vehicle's roof. NHTSA continues to believe that a static rollover test is not needed for the reasons set forth in the NPRM. The agency notes that NYFD may have misinterpreted the rollover requirement that was under consideration. The agency was considering a static rollover requirement like the one in Standard No. 301 in which after crash testing, the vehicle is rotated on its axis to determine leakage. The agency was not considering a dynamic rollover test in the context of the CNG rulemaking. 2. Refueling Connections In the NPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose requirements regarding the standardization of refueling connections, notwithstanding comments to the ANPRM advocating such an approach. These commenters believed that specifying certain connector sizes would prevent over-pressurization during refueling. NHTSA believed that it was not necessary to regulate this area because the potential safety risks associated with over-pressurization of the fuel storage containers are addressed through the proposed container venting requirements (bonfire test) discussed above. NHTSA further believed that voluntary actions by industry will address most, if not all, of the problems raised by commenters. The agency also believed that the issues raised by commenters to the ANPRM, with the exception of overfilling the fuel storage containers, did not present significant safety concerns. NHTSA received 12 comments addressing the need to standardize the refueling connections. EDO, Flxible, and Tecogen agreed with the agency's rationale for not including requirements for refueling connections. Nine commenters believed that NHTSA should adopt a requirement for refueling connections. AAMA, NGVC, and several natural gas companies believed that NHTSA should adopt NGV&hyph;1. NGV&hyph;1 is a voluntary standard being developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Canadian Gas Association Standard for Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fueling Connection Devices. Ontario recommended that the agency should specify the universal use of a single maximum filling pressure of 20,685 kPa (3000 psi). It believed that such standardization would reduce the safety risk and promote international harmonization. After reviewing the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that Federal regulation is not needed with respect to the refueling connection devices. As explained in the NPRM, the agency continues to believe that problems associated with filling fuel containers do not present significant safety concerns. Moreover, the agency continues to believe that the proposed bonfire test, which the agency is considering for CNG containers, addresses potential safety risks associated with over-pressurization. In addition, the agency believes that refueling connections present an issue that is peripheral to the agency's focus of fuel system integrity as determined by crashes. Notwithstanding this decision, the agency will continue to monitor the safety of refueling connections to determine if future agency action is needed. 3. Venting In the ANPRM, the agency discussed requiring that all pressure relief mechanisms be vented to the outside of the vehicle, away from the passenger, luggage, or other compartments that could expose vehicle occupants to the gaseous fuel. However, after considering comments to the ANPRM, NHTSA decided not to propose a venting requirement. The agency believed that such a requirement would be unnecessarily design restrictive in view of the wide variations among vehicle designs and models. In addition, the agency noted that CNG used in motor fuel applications would have an odor that would warn vehicle occupants of the presence of escaping gas. NHTSA received comments from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and Washington State about venting requirements. CHP stated that venting is necessary to ensure safety, but did not elaborate. Washington State stated that gaseous fuels could accumulate when a school bus is parked or when air circulation is inadequate. While it believed that such accumulation could be explosive, the commenter provided no data to indicate the extent of the alleged safety problem.
