Huainan has always been known as a "motive power granary" of the east China region, China's most economically vigorous region. Since implementation of the "Chang Jiang Strategy" of developing Pudong [New Economic Zone in Shanghai] to spur an economic takeoff in the entire Chang Jiang river basin, this city's status has become even more prominent. Huainan City has a superior quality coal field with the largest reserves -- the Huainan Mining region -- with projected reserves of 30 billion tons which include 10.8 billion tons of carefully surveyed reserves, equal to one-fourth of China's reserves that have the proper conditions for extraction. Huainan is about 570 kilometers from Shanghai, China's economic center, and the railroads that run through the Huainan City region are connected to China's north-south artery, the Jin-Pu [Tianjin-Pudong] line, and are just a few 10 kilometers from the Jing-Jiu [Beijing-Kowloon] line now under construction. Some 200 kilometers to the south it goes through the Yuxikou Dedicated Coal Pier and enters the Chang Jiang channel. Thus, its regional location is superior. Calculations indicate that transporting coal from Huainan to Shanghai is 1,200 kilometers closer than hauling it from China's other coal base area, Shanxi, and that hauling 30 million newly-dug tons from Huainan to Shanghai could save 1.65 billion yuan in railroad shipping fees alone compared to transporting it from Shanxi. Officials in Huainan City said that the city's total coal output during 1993 was about 12 million tons. Although by the end of this century the entire city's total coal output, including central unified distribution coal mines and local coal mines, will reach 27 million tons, it will still be unable to satisfy the huge demand for economic growth in east China. At that time, the Chang Jiang Delta region with Shanghai at its center will have coal shortages of 80 to 100 million tons. To alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand, Huainan has formulated a program to accelerate development in an effort to surpass 40 million tons in coal by 2010. The Chinese Government is providing focused support for this program and the State will invest 5.28 billion yuan in Huainan's unified distribution coal mines, including 2.04 billion yuan that will be completed during the next three years. Central authorities have already invested a total of 4 billion yuan in surveys, construction, and production in Huainan's new mining regions. Huainan also holds status in China in power generating capacity. It currently has an installed generating capacity of 2,300MW and generates 12.3 billion kWh of electricity annually.
