After describing 1993 as the most difficult year for the Cuban Revolution, Robaina predicted that 1994 will represent the beginning of an ascending curve for his people. Robaina said that among Cuba's foreign policy priorities are the democratization of the United Nations and the strengthening of the role played by the nonaligned countries.
