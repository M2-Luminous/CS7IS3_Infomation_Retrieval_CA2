At an official ceremony, the high-ranking military official disclosed that Julio Martinni, Guatemalan ambassador to the United Nations, made two requests in which he asked that Guatemala be allowed to join UN forces that provide social and defensive support to countries facing armed conflicts. Enriquez said the Army is preparing four platoons comprising military policemen, civil affairs specialists, experts in psychological operations, nurses, and other specialists who will be able to join the UN peacekeeping forces at any time. He added that the military forces are currently capable of meeting the requirement of providing soldiers but that they are not capable of creating a logistical battalion in Guatemala, as requested, because of a lack of economic resources. Minister Enriquez explained that those Guatemalans who will participate in the peacekeeping forces will remain on reserve or on waiting lists, beginning in March, enabling them to be ready whenever their help is needed. He added that this is the first time the Army will be taking part in such activities.
