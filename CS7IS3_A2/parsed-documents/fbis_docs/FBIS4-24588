FBIS4-24588 "drchi105_d_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-105 Daily Report 29 May 1994 Northeast Asia DPRK, IAEA Unable To Reach Agreement on Nuclear Fuel Rods DPRK, IAEA Unable To Reach Agreement on Nuclear Fuel Rods OW2905080294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0651 GMT 29 May 94 OW2905080294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and a team of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have failed to reach a final agreement on the replacement of fuel rods at a nuclear power station in the DPRK. A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday [28 May] that the DPRK will go ahead on its own with the replacement of the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt experimental atomic power station. He said the DPRK Government will continue to work for the transparency of nuclear development and for the settlement of the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. dialogue. The DPRK and IAEA teams held working consultations between May 25 and 27 over technical matters concerning the replacement of the spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. During the consultations, the DPRK side suggested that the DPRK keep the spent fuel rods under the supervision of the IAEA. In case it undergoes routine and ad hoc inspections with a package solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. in the future, DPRK would let the IAEA check the spent fuel rods. The DPRK and IAEA delegations also discussed the method of preserving the technical possibilities of measuring the spent fuel rods by the IAEA, the spokesman said. He said the IAEA demanded that the DPRK submit a written report on the matter and the IAEA will study the theoretical feasibility and security of the method proposed by the DPRK side. At the negotiation, the agency raised the method of selected and separated preservation of fuel rods, the spokesman said. But the DPRK believed it is not acceptable in principle because it is essentially an inspection falling under the category of ad hoc inspection and going beyond the unique status of the DPRK following its temporary suspension of withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he stressed. Although no final agreement has been reached, he said, the DPRK promised to respond any time to negotiation that might be proposed by the IAEA side in future.
