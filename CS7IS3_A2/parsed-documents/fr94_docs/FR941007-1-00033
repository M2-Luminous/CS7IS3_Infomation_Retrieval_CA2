FR941007-1-00033 FR941007-1-00006 301␣Mission Suitability 1. Evaluation subfactors a. Evaluation subfactors are the weighted areas within the Mission Suitability factor that further identify, for proposal preparation and evaluation purposes, the content of the factor. Examples of Mission Suitability subfactors found by experience to be relevant to many procurements are: understanding of the Requirement; Management Plan; Key Personnel; Corporate or Company Resources; and Excellence of Proposed Design for hardware procurements. Citation of these specific subfactors is not intended to be restrictive or all inclusive. However, as stated in NFS 1815.608&hyph;72, evaluation of the designated entities subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor. The nature and thrust of the requirements and objectives of the procurement may logically call for the use of some subfactors titled and described in a somewhat different manner than those described below: * * * * * 5. In Appendix I to section 1870.303, chapter 3, paragraph 301.1.e.(1) is revised to read as follows: Appendix I to 1870.303_NASA Source Evaluation Board Procedures (Handbook) * * * * * Chapter 3_Evaluation Factors, Subfactors and Elements * * * * * 301␣Mission Suitability 1. *␣*␣* e. (1) In structuring evaluation subfactors and elements, emphasis should be placed on identification of significant discriminators, or ``key swingers''_the essential information required to support a source selection decision. Too many subfactors and elements are detrimental to effective evaluation of proposals and may result in a leveling or averaging out of scores over all proposals. To avoid this negative effect, the number of subfactors under Mission Suitability shall be no more than 4 and the number of elements no more than 8 except for the separate evaluation of designated entities either as a separate element or a separate subfactor under Mission Suitability (See NFS 1815.608&hyph;72). Other evaluation factors shall also be limited to only essential subfactors and elements. Further, care should be taken to avoid overlap and redundancy by clearly defining each evaluation subfactor and element. Avoiding such overlap assures an offeror is not scored in two or more areas for the same work. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24914 Filed 10&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7510&hyph;01&hyph;M
