FBIS3-32876 "drlat030__a94009" FBIS-LAT-94-030-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 ANNEX Brazil Government `Willing To Allow' Inspection of Nuclear Plants PY0902203994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 8 Feb 94 p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY0902203994 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Article by Sonia Carneiro] [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Cesar Flores on 7 February admitted that the Brazilian Government is willing to allow the inspection of its nuclear plants at the request of a third country as long as the request is lodged with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA). Flores asked government leader Pedro Simon to ask the Senate to immediately approve the two nuclear nonproliferation treaties to avoid retaliatory measures against Brazil. Flores said: "There is no reason to fear the ratification of the agreement if we do not intend to build the atomic bomb." He made this statement following Germany's threat to break the nuclear agreement and suspend the transfer of technology to Brazil. The Senate today will only vote on the proposal by Senator Dirceu Carneiro (PMDB-SC [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Santa Catarina]) in favor of the approval of one of the nuclear safeguard agreements. According to the agreement, Brazil, Argentina, the Abacc (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control), and the AIEA agree to supervise the production of nuclear material restricting technological development to peaceful purposes, safeguard nuclear secrets, and authorize the Navy to build a nuclear submarine. Brazil does not have to reveal its technological secrets. Should an inspection be carried out, Brazil will not be forced to reveal how it enriches uranium. The possibility of overcoming the impasse affecting the ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty that bans nuclear weapons in Latin America seems difficult. Carneiro, coordinator of the legislative decree on the treaty, has imposed a new condition: the elimination of an article allowing special inspections at nuclear plants at the request of a third country. But, at Itamaraty's request, Senate President Humberto Lucena has put the agreement on the list of issues to be voted on today without being submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee. Contrary to Lucena's decision, Carneiro has requested that the agreement be eliminated from the list of issues to be voted on. He wants the four-party agreement to be given priority treatment. Carneiro said reports that Germany intends to break the nuclear agreement due to the Senate's delay in approving the nuclear safeguards are "illogical and untrue." According to him, "the Tlatelolco Treaty is a regional treaty to ban nuclear weapons from Latin America, and it has nothing to do with the agreement with Germany that contemplated the construction of eight nuclear plants. None of which were built."
