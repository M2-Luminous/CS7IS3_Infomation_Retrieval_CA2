FBIS4-7919 "dreeu068__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Press Attacks Rejection Decision Press Attacks Rejection Decision AU0704095294 Sofia BTA in English 0814 GMT 7 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704095294 Sofia BTA English BFN [From BTA press review] [Text] Sofia, April 7 (BTA) -- "Parliament Dooms Free Speech to Bust" (DEMOKRATSIYA); "MP's Axe Free Speech" (DUMA); "MP's Butcher Newspapers" (24 CHASA); "Secret Ballot Slaps Speech in the Face" (STANDART NEWS): These and similar headlines cap front-page comments in all dailies on yesterday's vote by which parliament defeated two bills amending the value-added tax [VAT], effective as of April 1, 1994. The bill would have granted relief from the 18 percent flat VAT rate to the Bulgarian press and fiction and popular science literature except pornographic publications. At the end of March, the newspapers ceased to publish for four days in protest of what they dubbed "the killer tax." "This is the first time that Parliament has taken a secret-ballot vote on a bill," writes DUMA. The daily reproduces yesterday's statement of its editor-in-chief, Mr. Stefan Prodev MP of the ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), at parliament's sitting, in which he called on his fellow parliamentarians to spare Bulgarian newspapers and books. "Only a few newspapers will survive; most, caught in the death grip of the tax, will perish. What is the use of a diversity of news and opinions which the diverse press provides to those who seriously think themselves to be God's chosen lot? They can anyway wallow in their own sauce which they will secrete profusely in their own parties' organs. Which, of course, will be toeing the party line," runs a comment in STANDART NEWS. KONTINENT is even more acerbic, describing the 240 MP's as "politicians manque who in four years contrived to make the Bulgarian people look back with nostalgia to totalitarianism." "Now they have set out to tax newspapers out of business, those same newspapers which seem to be the only ones that dare to put up their dirty linen in plain view of the nation or rather of what is left of it," reads a signed comment in KONTINENT. According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the only argument advanced by the opponents of tax relief to the Bulgarian press and books "was that the tax administration would find it difficult to collect the tax at a differential rate." "In the imminent election campaign, however, this decision may prove to be one of parliament's worst self-defeats," comments the financial and business daily PARI. 24 CHASA writes that "new bills to repeal the killer tax will start to be tabled even today." The paper quotes the sponsors of the defeated bills, Mr. Lyubomir Pavlov MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and Mr. Yuri Borisov MP of the BSP, as saying that "this time separate amendments will be moved concerning the newspapers, Bulgarian books, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and press advertisements."
