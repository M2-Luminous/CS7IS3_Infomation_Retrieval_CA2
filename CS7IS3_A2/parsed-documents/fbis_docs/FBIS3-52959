The Political Bureau considered the developments that have taken place in the country and discussed ways to settle the current crisis. The Political Bureau highly praised the efforts to render national dialogue a success. "The Political Bureau discussed the manifestations of the continued series of assassinations [words indistinct] and the other national forces [words indistinct] the assassination of struggler [words indistinct] in al-Bayda' governorate on 6 January 1994 in Sanaa, and the continued military mobilization actions and the harassments [word indistinct]. The Political Bureau noted that these practices are viewed as a serious exacerbation of the crisis and are a sign on the increasing role of the quarters and parties that wager on aborting national dialogue [words indistinct] push the homeland towards the brink of a catastrophe and [word indistinct] destructive civil war that will destroy everything and from which only the enemies of the people will benefit." "The Political Bureau has warned against threats posed by the trend attempting to use the agencies of the united state as a cover to execute the scheme of division, kill democracy," and "destroy the homeland's unity." "The Political Bureau stresses that these actions will exacerbate the crisis, completely conflict with the results and guidelines reached by the national dialogue committee, and place obstacles in the face of any objective solutions to the current crisis." The Political Bureau also warns against deteriorating economic conditions and a drop in the citizens' standard living conditions. It also warns against the growing political crisis and deteriorating security conditions. The Political Bureau also notes that there are "fabricated factors and reasons that are accelerating economic collapse." These include smuggling, currency forfeiting, speculation in currency, mishandling of public funds, and the drop in the value of the national currency. The Political Bureau stressed the need for finding quick solutions to the economic conditions. "The Political Bureau concludes that the current crisis is a comprehensive one with political, economic, social, and [word indistinct] dimensions and requires quick, comprehensive, objective, and responsible solutions." "The Political Bureau notes that the only serious solutions to the current crisis lie in preserving unity," and the building of a "democratic, modern, and united state based on a decentralized, democratic system of local government." Such solutions would ensure a higher degree of "political participation by all citizens of the homeland;" help achieve "economic, cultural, and social progress;" and "strengthen unity, and end all manifestations and consequences of division." The Political Bureau stresses the need to give particular attention to the "issues related to the people's security, freedom, living conditions, and progress." Finally, the Political Bureau urges "all political forces, parties, and organizations and the masses to display further awareness, cohesion, and unity." It also urges them to silence the "drums of war," prevent the "conspiracies of partition and division" and to preserve "unity and democracy."
