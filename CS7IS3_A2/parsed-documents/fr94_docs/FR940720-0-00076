FR940720-0-00076 FR940720-0-00006 a. Minimum and/or Maximum Standards. Section 80.77(g)(2), which requires that per-gallon minimum/maximums must be included in product transfer documents, is being revised to clarify the categories of reformulated gasoline for which these values must be specified. Paragraphs (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv)(A), and (g)(2)(iv)(B) of §80.77 are being revised to specify that the RVP maximum and the VOC emissions performance minimum must be included only for VOC- controlled reformulated gasoline, because these standards apply only to VOC-controlled gasoline. Paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A) and (g)(2)(iv)(B) of §80.77 also are being revised to specify that the NO X minimum must be included only for reformulated gasoline certified using the complex model. There is no separate NO X standard under the simple model. b. VOC-Controlled Gasoline That Contains Ethanol. Section 80.77(g)(3) is being added to require that product transfer documents must identify any VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline that contains any ethanol as an ethanol-containing reformulated gasoline, so that downstream parties will have sufficient knowledge to avoid violation of the prohibition, at §80.78(a)(8), against combining VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline produced using ethanol with VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline produced using any other oxygenate during the period January 1 through September 15. c. Complex Model Gasoline Certified Prior to 1998. Section 80.77(h) is being revised to clarify that the product transfer document requirements related to gasoline certified using the complex model before January 1, 1998, apply to reformulated gasoline and RBOB. The final rule makes reference to ``gasoline'' and RBOB without specifying ``reformulated gasoline,'' which could have caused confusion. 8. Controls and Prohibitions (Section 80.78) Section 80.78(a)(1)(v)(B) and (a)(1)(v)(C), concerning reformulated gasoline prohibited activities, are being revised to clarify that gasoline subject to the per-gallon RVP maximum must have an RVP that is less than or equal to this standard, and that gasoline subject to the VOC and NO X emissions reduction minimum must have emissions reductions that are greater than or equal to these standards. The final rule describes these requirements only in terms of gasoline that is ``less than'' or ``greater than'' these standards, while gasoline that equals these standards also is in compliance. 9. Enforcement Exemptions for California Gasoline (§80.81) a. Definition of California Gasoline. The final rule was intended to extend the California enforcement exemptions to gasoline produced at refineries outside California that produce only California reformulated gasoline and federal conventional gasoline. See 59 FR 7759, col. 3 (February 16, 1994). However, the regulatory definition of ``California gasoline'' could be read to exclude non-California refineries producing California reformulated gasoline from the enforcement exemptions. Therefore, §80.81(a)(2)(iii) is clarified to exclude from this definition only gasoline produced by non-California refineries that are also producing reformulated gasoline for sale in covered areas outside California. b. Compliance Demonstration Submittal. Section 80.81(b)(4) requires refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders to submit the compliance demonstration mandated by §80.81(b)(3) by May 31, 1996 ``along with reports required to be submitted under §80.75(a)(1).'' The quoted language is corrected to make clear that the compliance demonstration should accompany the report for the first quarter of 1996 due to be submitted on that date under §80.75(a)(1)(i).
