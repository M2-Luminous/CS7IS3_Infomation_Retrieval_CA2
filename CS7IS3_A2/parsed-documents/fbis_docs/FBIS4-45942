It is all the more unfortunate because this has happened just before the Prime Minister's visit to the United States. But there is a need to take a dispassionate view of the questions involved. The United States has been seeking a multilateral dialogue since 1991 to discuss non-proliferation in South Asia. Our problem has been that the South Asian framework simply does not address the problems of nuclear security in our case. But the five-nation dialogue was doomed from the day Pakistan arbitrarily derailed the process by defining the agenda in terms of seeking to establish South Asia as a nuclear weapon-free zone. U.S. insistence since then to hold a five-nation dialogue has only tended to harden attitudes in India against any multilateral dialogue on non-proliferation issues. The United States has been clearly articulating its non-proliferation objectives: it seeks to cap, reduce and eliminate nuclear capabilities in South Asia--in other words, create a nuclear weapon-free zone. This is the reason why even later variations of the five-nation dialogue continue to be deeply suspect in Indian eyes. The United States has been saying that it has no fixed agenda, but the picture at the end of the road has been clearly defined. It claims that the composition could be decided through preparatory discussions, but it seems to have strong reservations about a composition that does not stack up in favour of its goals. And the greater the U.S. pressure, the greater the Indian resistance not to give in, especially when the fundamental and vital national strategic interests of India are at stake. Basic Goals It is ironic that the basic goals of the two countries lie along parallel lines, displaced in time and scope. Our vital interests can be addressed only by a non-proliferation policy that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons from the world, while the United States wants to apply disarmament only to South Asia. We have believed that the process could be preceded by nuclear freeze and reduction in a global framework; and that this cannot be achieved in a local framework. The problem is that the U.S. aims regarding nonproliferation in South Asia, and our vital strategic interests have become increasingly irreconcilable. The bilateral dialogues were meant to improve mutual understanding of strategic concerns. Some common ground has been found in terms of starting negotiations for a global ban on production of fissile material for weapon purposes, and more can be found in working for the comprehensive test-ban treaty. These are important building blocks for the long-term goals. But these should not be jeopardised by narrow partisan aims. The question remains whether there is any scope for a multilateral dialogue. To answer this we must look at the realities dispassionately. The very term `cap' assumes that the United States considers the situation in South Asia as that representing a post-proliferation stage. Its willingness to waive its own laws against clandestine weapon programmes only confirms that it accepts Pakistan's nuclear weapon status. It is, therefore, in the interest of Indians and Pakistanis, more than anyone else, to reduce the risks associated with ambiguous nuclear capabilities. This indeed is the rationale for the Indian proposals to Pakistan for no-first-use of nuclear capabilities, non-attack on population centres. More Steps Many more steps down that road are possible if Pakistan is willing to seek greater stability and reduced risks. The United States prepared its own policies on seeking strategic stability, and could contribute constructively by agreeing to multilateral agreements that aim for strategic stability in Southern Asia. People like Mr Paul Nitze are arguing about the lack of utility and futility of U.S. nuclear responses in future scenarios. Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) have their greatest potential in a bilateral framework, but they also lend themselves to multilateral discussions and agreements, and would go a long way in achieving perhaps more than arms control measures because they circumscribe the nuclear factors. There are greater payoffs in a multilateral dialogue on peace, co-operation and security, rather than starting with non-proliferation measures on the agenda in a post-proliferation world. At the same time, the framework will have to be Asian rather than that of South Asia. We need to be sensitive to the intrinsic risks associated with ambiguous nuclear weapon programmes; and hence the need for seeking stability. The scope for bilateral dialogue with Pakistan on nuclear issues is limited to CSBMs only, and going beyond that would be counter-productive, besides according legitimacy to a clandestine programme. The Pakistani leadership has already been emphasising that its nuclear programme is capped/frozen at 1989-90 level. This is credible since no real advantage would accrue to Pakistan in going beyond the dozen or so weapon capability it has acquired; and the additional costs would be infructuous. For India, keeping the nuclear option open in a recessed deterrence posture is adequate. Even in the worse case scenario, the maximum capability that India would ever need is that of minimum deterrence. There is, thus, virtually no risk of an open-ended nuclear arms race in the sub-continent. As regards the uncertainty about who has the finger on the nuclear button in Pakistan, General Aslam Beg has recently confirmed that a national command authority for nuclear deterrence exists. Capping Strategy The other risk is that of nuclear weapon technology being passed on to another state by Pakistan. This problem cannot be resolved by the capping strategy. On the other hand, notwithstanding irresponsible and fictional accounts (like Critical Mass), it would be difficult to argue that the present situation is unstable as long as Pakistanis believe that their nuclear weapons provide them a much-needed sense of security. At the same time, there is a need for strengthening regional peace and security. This can be enhanced by a multilateral dialogue in an Asian forum for peace. Kazakhstan has already proposed a conference on confidence-building and peace in Asia, and China has supported the idea. Iran has been emphasising the need for regional solutions through regional co-operation. The time is, therefore, ripe for providing the necessary impetus to a multilateral dialogue among the states of Asia on peace and co-operation to translate the concept of Panchsheel into a new co-operative security framework under the principle of "mutual and equal security." Such a multilateral dialogue need not be a substitute for, or in contradiction of, any multilateral dialogue sought by the United States. But it would complement the fundamental goal of seeking an improved environment through better political relations and marginalise a nuclear weapon-based approach to inter-state relations and national security. The United States would need to re-think its policy approaches, especially with regard to what it seeks in a multilateral dialogue. Non-proliferation, like disarmament, is the means to the larger end of ensuring peace and security; and it should not be interpreted as an end in itself and sought for its own sake.
