Several presidential candidates, who according to Gabriel Taboada are in the pay of drug traffickers, had this to say today. [begin recording] Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential candidate: I am concerned to see that the attempt to besmirch Colombia's name continues. When a person makes accusations, he should name names. That is what the country needs. If he has names, let him say so. It is important that the country know if there is drug money in the political campaigns. The information must come out. As far as I am concerned, I am absolutely certain there is no drug money. I have just given my records to the Overseer of the National Treasury, to the National Electoral Council, and to the Colombian people. People cannot continue making these accusations. Antonio Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate for 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance: I say categorically that Antonio Navarro and Jesus Pinacue have not received a penny from drug traffickers for their campaign. I am not familiar with the rest of Mr. Taboada's statement, and it is hard to comment on something with which I am unfamiliar. Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate of the National Democratic Alternative: Some of what was said reflects what many Colombians have been saying. There is drug money in the political campaigns, and there has been in the past. Drug money has infiltrated institutions. That is a fact, and I have denounced it. [end recording] The government and the Prosecutor General's Office commented on the matter. [begin recording] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Sintura: Senator Kerry, respect Colombian justice and do not get too close to rogues. Defense Minister Rafael Pardo: Those remarks cannot be taken seriously. They reflect an ill-intended distortion to harm a country that has suffered a great deal from drug trafficking. It is not justified to give credence to someone who has no information and no way to get any and whose charges are not serious. [end recording]
