FR940511-0-00002 FR940511-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;39] Revision of Class E Airspace: DeRidder, LA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Federal rule. SUMMARY: This action revises the Class E airspace at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA. The establishment of an airport surveillance approach (ASR) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. This action provides adequate Class E airspace to contain IFR operations for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gregory L. Juro, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone 817&hyph;222&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise the Class E Airspace at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 62059). An ASR approach, a SIAP, was developed for the Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder, LA. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transitioning between the en route and terminal environments. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Therefore the proposal is adopted with only editorial changes. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 71) revises the Class E airspace located at DeRidder, LA, to provide controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Beauregard Parish Airport, DeRidder LA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).
