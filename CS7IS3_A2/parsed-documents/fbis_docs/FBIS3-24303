A total of 1,677 persons aged 18 and older were polled y means of interviews in Kiev and 102 other cities and towns [selyshcha miskoho typu] in all 24 oblasts and the Republic of Crimea. The first thing that the survey showed is that the percentage of urban voters who prefer to cast their votes for candidates who do not belong to any party is not all that large -- they make up 18% of those polled. Twice as many voters are inclined to vote for candidates put forward by one party or another. Of these respondents, 21% have already decided on their choice and named the party for whose candidates they would vote. Of the voters who expressed no preference regarding whether a candidate represented a party or not (they number 46%), only one-quarter is planning to vote in the elections. The attitude to voting in the elections is quite different among those supporting parties: nearly nine-tenths of them (89%) plan to vote. Among supporters of candidates that do not belong to any party, the number that plans to cast a vote is significantly lower -- 71%. There is more support for party candidates among men (39%) than women (34%); among members of older generations (over 60 -- 42%, between 46 and 60 -- 38%) than among younger voters (under 30 --32%, between 31 and 45 -- 33%); among those with a higher education (41%) than those with a secondary education (35%) or lower (34%). The proportion of supporters of party candidates is especially high among managers at various levels (48%) and significantly lower among white-collar workers (38%), and particularly among specialists (21%). Support for party candidates decreases geographically as one moves from west to east and from north to south. Supporters of party candidates make up 41% of the electorate in the Western region, 37% in the Central region, 35% in the Eastern region, and 34% in the Southern region. In part, this stems from the fact that there are fewer supporters of party candidates among Russians (34%) than among Ukrainians (38%), especially among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (40%). The second question to which we sought an answer in our study was which parties have most supporters and among which categories of urban voters. As far as the urban electorate of Ukraine as a whole is concerned, at the beginning of the year only three parties had voters ready to vote for them in numbers exceeding the 10% mark: 16% for the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU), 13% for Rukh, and 11% for the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU). At present, these three parties are the largest components of the multiparty political system that is forming in Ukraine. They are its "first rank," so to speak. he "second rank" in this system, numbering fewer than 10% supporters but no less than 5%, is currently "vacant." No party has the support of this percentage of voters. The "third rank" of political parties among the urban electorate consists of five parties, each of which is supported by less than 5% but more than 2.5% of the electorate. These are the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine (PDVU), the Green Party of Ukraine (PZU), the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPU), the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SocPU), and the Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS) -- each with 3% supporters. The last, "fourth rank" is comprised of nine parties, each of which has the support of at least 1% of the electorate. (We should point out that 1% of the urban electorate of Ukraine amounts to more than 250,000 persons.) The Peasant Party of Ukraine has the support of 2% of the urban voters, while the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Liberal Party, the People's Party, the Party of Labor, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party, and the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine each have 1%. An analysis of the data makes it possible to determine the breakdown of support enjoyed by the named parties among various categories of the urban electorate. Thus, the number of supporters of the DemPU among men is 1.5 times greater than among women (18% as against 12%). The ratio between the supporters of Rukh is the same (14% as against 9%). In contrast, the KPU has almost twice as many supporters among women than among men (14% as compared to 8%). In addition, the 5% "hurdle" is cleared by men in the case of the SocPU and by women in the case of the UPS. The leading position of the DemPU is particularly marked among young voters. It is supported by 18% of those under 30 years of age as against 7% for Rukh, 6% for the KPU and the UPS, and 5% for the PDVU and the PZU. Most appealing to voters between the ages of 31 and 45 are Rukh (16%) and the DemPU (14%), while the "second rank" of parties includes the KPU (6%) and the SDPU (5%). The highest degree of support among voters between 45 and 60 goes to Rukh (17%) and the KPU (15%), somewhat less to the DemPU (12%), and 6% of these voters and voters over 60 prefer the SocPU. Among the latter group, only 5% support Rukh, and the leaders are the KPU (17%) and the DemPU (16%). Among voters with a lower than secondary education, support is highest for the KPU (16%). The DemPU has only 11% and Rukh 7% in this category. The DemPU has more supporters among those with a secondary education (17%) than Rukh (13%) and the KPU (11%). Whereas voters with a higher education are more inclined to prefer Rukh (14%) and the DemPU (13%) than the KPU (9%), and 6% of voters in this category are ready to support the PZU and the SocPU. Among blue-collar workers, support runs highest for Rukh (18%) and the DemPU (14%), and no other party reaches the 5% mark. The Communist Party has the support of only 3% of blue-collar workers, and the Socialist Party of only 1%. Among white-collar workers there is more support for the KPU and Rukh (14% each) than for the DemPU (10%). In addition, 7% of the white-collar workers are inclined to support the PZU and 6% the PDVU. Among specialists and the technical and humanitarian intelligentsia, support also runs highest for the KPU and Rukh (14%), but third and fourth place in this group is shared by the PDVU and the SocPU (9% each), while the DemPU has only 5% of supporters -- the same number as the SDPU and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. In the Western region, only two parties have the support of more than 5% of the polled urban voters, but Rukh has more than 1.5 times as many supporters as the DemPU with a ratio of 29:18. Only these two parties are supported by more than 10% of the urban population of the Central region: Rukh -- 18% and the DemPU -- 15%. Three parties fall into the "second rank" here: the KPU with 9%, the SocPU with 7%, and the UPS with 5%. Among the urban electorate in the Southern region, first and second place are shared by the DemPU and the KPU (16% each). Rukh has the support of only 7% of the electorate here, and the PDVU and the Peasants' Party, of 5% each. In the Eastern region, support among urban voters runs highest for the KPU (14%) and the DemPU (12%). The SDPU is in third place here (5%), while Rukh is supported by only 2%. This breakdown of support for the different parties in the regions is rather closely linked with the breakdown of supporters in the principal ethnic and linguistic-ethnic groups. Among urban Russian voters, the KPU has markedly more supporters (16%) than the DemPU (12%), and many more than Rukh (3%). Conversely, the KPU has markedly fewer supporters among urban Ukrainian voters (10%) than the DemPU (15%) and Rukh (15%). While there are significantly more supporters of the KPU among Russian-speaking Ukrainians than among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (14% as compared to 4%), and, conversely, Rukh has many more supporters among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians than among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (24% as against 9%), DemPU has almost an equal number of supporters among all Ukrainians -- 16% among Russian-speaking Ukrainians and 15% among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians. In examining the above data, it is important to keep in mind that our elections will be held in accordance with a majority electoral system rather than a proportional one, and therefore the final distribution of deputy mandates among the representatives of the various parties and candidates with no party affiliation may differ considerably from the proportions described above.
