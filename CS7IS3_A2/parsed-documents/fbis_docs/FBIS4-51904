It has been confirmed that President Kim Il-song's lump on the back of his neck is growing bigger and causes him discomfort. CHUNGANG ILBO has exclusively obtained photographs taken by a Western figure, who recently visited North Korea, using his video recorder. Compared to a photograph that was made public in 1988 (black and white), these photographs show that his lump is growing bigger (top picture) and expanding toward his head (middle picture) and his lower neck (bottom picture). This lump is not fatal. President Kim Il-song has been undergoing acupuncture treatment since the seventies because surgery on this lump may hurt his brain.
