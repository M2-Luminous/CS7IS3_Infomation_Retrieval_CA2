Prior to the resumption of the negotiations a short while ago, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th said agreement has been reached on the deployment of joint Palestinian-Israeli police patrols in the Hebron area. He said agreement has also been reached on the weapons that will be carried by the international observer force. These weapons, he noted, will be individual weapons to be used for only self-defense. As we have said, the negotiations have been resumed. This is the only new development I know of. We will announce any further developments once they occur.
