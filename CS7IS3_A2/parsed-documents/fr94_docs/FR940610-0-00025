FR940610-0-00025 FR940610-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Political-Military Affairs [Public Notice 2018] 22 CFR Parts 123, 124, and 126 Amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 22, 1993, the Department published a major revision to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (58 FR 39280). After being in use by government agencies and industry for several months, certain issues were identified which required revision. The revisions made in this final rule are viewed by the Department of State as beneficial for U.S. persons and industry. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Information regarding this notice may be obtained from Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls. Rose Marie Biancaniello, Deputy Director for Licensing, or Glenn Smith, Licensing Officer, may be reached by phone at 703 875&hyph;6643 or fax at 703 875&hyph;6647. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 22, 1993, the Department published a major revision to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (58 FR 39280). After several months of implementation and various training seminars with other government agencies and with industry, several issues have been identified which merit regulatory or procedural changes. This final rule is being published to address three (3) of the issues. Section 123.16(a) is revised to exclude significant military equipment from the exemption stated in ยง123.16. This change was deemed necessary in order to ensure compliance with the Department's congressional notification requirements and the ITAR requirement for nontransfer and use certification for defense articles which are defined in part 120 of the ITAR as ``significant military equipment''. In addition, ยง124.10 is amended by removing the requirement that a signed DSP&hyph;83 be submitted with proposed agreements. Compliance with this requirement has proven to be difficult, and of insufficient benefit to the Department to merit continuation of the requirement. Finally, ยง126.5 is amended by deleting the exception to the Canadian exemption which requires a license for the export to Canada of unclassified technical data directly related to a classified defense article. The Department of State views these changes as beneficial for U.S. persons and industry and has decided to implement them immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed. This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under E.O. 12866 and has been reviewed internally by the Department of State to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It is also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554. List of Subjects 22 CFR Part 123 Arms and munitions, Exports.
