Cuevas made this comment after meeting with Gonzalez for just over an hour and a quarter, together with Manuel Otero, chairman of the Spanish Confederation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. The employers' organization's top leader said that he is prepared to meet with the trade unions at any time and with any agenda, but he emphasized that the labor reform process is now in a different sphere from that of the social interlocutors. In Cuevas' opinion, the essential thing is that the new legislation is in the parliamentary groups' hands, and the system's channels must be respected. He therefore specified that the prime minister has opted for the only stance that he could adopt with respect to the trade unions. In short, Cuevas sought to clarify his previous statements, which were interpreted as a refusal to negotiate. In fact, it is a matter of emphasis. The employers' organization chairman said the same thing yesterday as on previous days, but changing the stresses and emphases. Cuevas did not wish the interpretation to be made that the CEOE is being inflexible with the trade unions. Thus he maintained that he is prepared to talk with them, but proceeding from one premise: Everybody must accept his responsibilities, and the social agents must not supplant parliament. "The responsibilities of the government and parliament and those of the social agents must be delineated. This must be scrupulously respected throughout this process. However, this does not limit at all the possibility of the parliamentary groups being able to receive information and proposals from everybody regarding these very important bills." Cuevas also emphasized that, in the employers' organization's opinion, the useful thing would be for the trade unions to come and negotiate now the application of the labor reform to the various sectors. The employers' organization views this as the real key to the reform, which can be more or less important, depending on its specific application. In short, the CEOE believes that the appropriate thing is to turn over the page and get down to business -- namely, the negotiation of the collective agreements. "Let there be no confusion," Cuevas said emphatically at one point, "because there is a process here which cannot be stopped. If it stopped, that would damage everybody's credibility, but let it also be clear that the most important thing about the reform is not its text, or the very slight amendments which have been made concerning dismissal. Neither. The most important and significant thing is the discussion which will be held on the agreements on the organization of work in enterprises."
