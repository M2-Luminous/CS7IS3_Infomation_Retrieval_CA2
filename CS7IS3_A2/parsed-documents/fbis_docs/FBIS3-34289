According to Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic correspondent, this was decided last night in a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres. More from reporter Dick Winter: [Begin recording] [Winter] [passage omitted] The prime minister is not playing the PLO's game. Last night, in his meeting with the Arab Israeli Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, who has been described by Palestinian watchers as the PLO's ambassador to Israel, Prime Minister Rabin rejected the PLO's proposal to hold the talks today without 'Arafat being present. Rabin is keeping Israel's next moves close to the chest. In a speech last night welcoming Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to Israel, the prime minister repeated the stand he has been taking for the last month: [Rabin] Mr. Prime Minister, in our quest for peace we have learned that we must stand our ground on matters of life and death, to guarantee our security, and not to run after false solutions. For us, peace without security is not peace. We are mindful of lessons from your distant and not so distant past. One of them is taken from your tragic history: the agreement which abandoned your country to the destructive jaws of the Nazi regime. We have learned to rely only on ourselves. [Winter] This morning, Prime Minister Rabin will again meet with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, as well as the entire Israeli delegation and with senior members of the defense establishment, to decide on Israel's next move.
