The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in Sakhalin, Chae Chong-man, said Koreans' immigration into Sakhalin from their dear homeland was caused by the Japanese imperialists' criminal act of aggression in the past, so it is a political issue under any circumstances, not a pure "humanitarian" issue as the South Korean puppet authorities allege, nor a matter to be settled with some money. "The South Korean puppet authorities' scheme to forcibly take compatriots in Sakhalin to South Korea is aimed at fomenting discord and consciousness of confrontation within the Korean nation and perpetuating the division of the country," he contended. The chairman of the Sakhalin Regional Committee of Koreans for Support to Peaceful Reunification, Kwon Chon-sik, warned that if the South Korean authorities persist in their plot to drag away compatriots through tieup with the Japanese authorities, they would be held entirely responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in Russia, Choe Yong-su, said Korean residents in Russia would make every possible effort for a peaceful reunification of the country and national unity and fight against the South Korean authorities' anti-popular policy and for peace on the Korean peninsula.
