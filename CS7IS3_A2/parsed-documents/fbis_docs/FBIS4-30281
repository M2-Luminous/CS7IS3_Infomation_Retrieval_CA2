Last week, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen to less than 100 yen to US$1, giving the ministry a good opportunity to prepay foreign debt. A source said at the end of this month, the ministry will make a prepayment on loans extended to national development projects many years ago. This payment amounts to US$210 million, which carries an interest rate of 8.25 per cent. There are two portions: about US$100 million in Japanese currency, US$50 million in US dollars and the rest in other currencies. The prepayment will spare Thailand from paying interest over the next 7-8 years. The ministry will use the fiscal reserve of about Bt[baht]200 million to make the prepayment. The Finance Ministry has also sent a letter to the Asian Development Bank requesting permission to make a prepayment. Thailand currently owes ADB about US$200 million. The source said that external debt service currently amounts to more than 8 percent of the national expenditure budget.
