Jia Qinglin said: In view of the relatively low income the peasants earn from working the land, the provincial government has taken some measures and increased grain prices. Therefore, it is necessary for leaders in various localities to do more ideological work, encourage the spirit of dedication, and manage grain-producing areas well. Not only should grain-producing areas pay attention to grain production, but the coastal areas should also do the same. When talking about the new line of thinking on developing grain production, he said: We should not develop a one-crop economy and take grain as the key link as we did in the past, because such a practice will lead us nowhere. Grain production should be carried out as part of the entire rural economic development in connection with the development of a diversified economy and the bid to increase the peasants' income. The more grain production is developed, the greater the need to develop a diversified economy will become. Only when the entire rural economy develops and the peasants' income rises can grain production possibly be uplifted. When discussing large and medium-sized enterprises, he pointed out: Large and medium-sized enterprises must speed up the pace of technological transformation, continuously upgrade technology, enhance their competitiveness, and at the same time, do a good job of the basic work to establish a modern enterprise system, strengthen internal enterprise management, continue to change the way enterprises operate, and gradually strive to become modern enterprises. When dealing with technological input, he remarked: There is still a problem of low returns in regard to the current transformation of scientific and technological research achievements into productive forces. Scientific and technological efficiency cannot entirely be achieved by relying exclusively on government investment. It is necessary to conduct a series of reforms in agriculture and the scientific research structure and absorb some useful experiences from foreign countries. It is my hope that departments concerned will do more research. Jia Qinglin also stressed: It is necessary to place simultaneous stress on the two civilizations and attach importance to the development and construction of Meizhou Wan.
