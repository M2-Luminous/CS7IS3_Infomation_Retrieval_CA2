Ricardo Duran, Panama Chamber of Commerce president, has rejected a survey published by THE ECONOMIST last week which included Panama among countries in which foreign investors are afraid to invest. Duran said he does not know what the publication is based on because Panama's annual economic growth rate of approximately 9 percent shows investors have confidence in the country.
