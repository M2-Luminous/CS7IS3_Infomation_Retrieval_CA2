FBIS4-41577 "drsov123_c_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Duma Adopts Decree on Constitutional Court Duma Adopts Decree on Constitutional Court LD2406132694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1053 GMT 24 Jun 94 LD2406132694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] On Friday Russia's State Duma adopted a decree "On the Constitutional Court." As many as 331 deputies voted for this decree, five -- against, and 27 abstained from voting (as it is known, the RF Constitutional Court and members of the State Duma Committee on Legislation and Legal Reform submitted this bill for consideration). The procedure of filling Constitutional Court (CC) vacancies remains unchanged -- a CC judge is appointed by the Federation Council following the president's nomination. Given its authorities the CC hears trials on correspondence with federal laws, normative acts of the Russian president and of both chambers of the Federal Assembly, of Russian government, Constitutions of the republics, charters and laws of the RF constituent members to the RF Constitution. The court can also determine the congruence with the Constitution and treaties made between state bodies of power of the Russian Federation and state bodies of power of the RF constituent members, and agreements between state bodies of the RF constituent members. It is within the Court's competence to determine the congruence with the Constitution of the international agreements of the Russian Federation which are not in force yet, to interpret the RF Constitution, to make conclusions about the observance of the procedure of accusations against the Russian president of high treason or of committing any serious crime. The CC has the right to initiate legislative actions on issue which are in its competence. Any citizens of the Russian Federation who is over 40, has an excellent reputation and higher juridical education and experience of juridical work of no less than 15 years can be appointed to the post of a judge on the CC. The decree stipulates that powers of a CC judge can be suspended if the CC agrees to arrest him or to bring charges against him or if he is unable to fulfill his duties due to the state of his health. The mandate of a judge in the CC can be taken away if the rules on his appointment were violated. The same measure is taken if a judge looses citizenship of the Russian Federation or if he is sentenced or if the judge continues to behave incompatible with his post despite warnings on the part of the RF Constitutional Court. The decree foresees that the chairman of the CC is elected at its plenary sitting by a secret voting by the majority of judges. Chairman of the Court, his deputy, and judge-secretary are elected for three years.
