He also presided over the plenum of the National Committee of the Armed Forces Civilian Workers Union. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] With a heated opening, the meeting was a surprise to everyone from the very beginning. Jose Roque, Secretary General of the FAR civilian workers union, began by saying: Let us begin by talking about the beans. Debates on the principal difficulties followed. The leader of the Che Guevara Military Industrial Company workers union assessed the losses in agriculture and promoted further discussions. [Unidentified union leader] This loss situation must be solved, the farm must be closed, or we must ask for the resignation of the comrades involved in this activity. [Reporter] The Che Guevara Company director outlined the agricultural goals for 1994: [Director] I believe that concerning our agriculture, notwithstanding the costs that move us to work resolutely at the level of the industry and other activities, we can say that we are meeting the company's main needs, but that now we have to resolve current inefficiency. [Reporter] Moreover, General Ulises Rosales del Toro stressed the idea of producing at the lowest cost possible. [Rosales] You who have received the banner of our system must also be awarded in this line of production. The minister's guideline is that we cannot produce at any cost, and this must also be extended to agriculture. The idea is not only to guarantee 30 percent of production, but to produce in a reasonable manner to prevent unnecessary expenditures that will neutralize our productivity [words indistinct]. [Reporter] The FAR civilian workers union includes 85,000 workers, and at the plenum held in the presence of union leaders and representatives of the FAR, they discussed the basic activities in which the Armed Forces are engaged, for their own experience and for the good of the fatherland. The objective is to make the Armed Forces self-sufficient in foodstuffs in 1995 and continue their contributions to the people. This year, the FAR budget was reduced 50 percent. The structural reorganization improvement program, which began seven years ago, has become a generalized experience so far as profitability and suitability are concerned, and also concerning the use of human and material resources and the political work that support these goals. [Rosales] What we are doing today in production, what we are doing in the fields, what we are doing in everything we are discussing here is showing the role we play. But this requires awareness, capacity, and efficiency, and this also requires appropriate training and guidance. [Reporter] For example, a citrus fruit production farm in Hawaii Grande in 1993 harvested 70,000 quintals. The Youth Labor Army in January 1994 collected 73,000 quintals of citrus fruits from this same FAR. The FAR members and their civilian workers also played an important role in the latest potato and tomato harvests. [Ross Leal] For all these achievements, which are also reflected in figures and good results, the national CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] decided to award the FAR the banner of labor deeds. [applause] [Raul Castro] In a recent FAR military council, I called the work carried out and the results achieved over the past three years by the FAR, colossal. Thanks to these achievements, the special period has not been able to reduce our capacity or our fighting readiness. The sudden severance of the Soviet supply and the drastic reduction in resources stemming from the national economy have not intimidated us and have not made us conform. [Reporter] The FAR minister also referred to the participation of the civilian workers in the Armed Forces' achievements. He said self-supply of goods, profitability, and maintenance of defensive capacity are the basic pillars of work. He said the sixth congress of civilian workers will be held in 1995. [Raul Castro] The congress will be held in 1995, a century after the time when the fatherland had a new rebirth, with the armed uprising that achieved liberty; a century after Jose Marti fell in action, after the epic event of the invasion from east to west under Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomes. Fidel has taught us how to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the fatherland. A hundred years after the birth of the apostle, he organized and led us in an attack on the Moncada Garrison. Let us pay a worthy tribute to the centennial anniversary, to those historical, sacred, and exalted moments of the fatherland with an exemplary congress of the civilian workers of the glorious Revolutionary Armed Forces. I will see you in the sixth congress, and perhaps long before that as well. Thank you. [applause]
