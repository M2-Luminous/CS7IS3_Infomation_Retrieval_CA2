Duelfer also discussed with the Iraqis the visit of UN Sanctions Commission UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus to Iraq which is expected to start on February 2. A paper editorial added, however, the main job of Duelfer in Baghdad was to discuss with Iraqi counterparts a plan set by UNSCOM to implement the monitoring system of Iraq's weapons. Duelfer told reporters in Baghdad shortly before his departure that his talks with the Iraqi side were significant and many points were clarified. The editorial further said, Duelfer wanted to tell reporters that "there is still more to be done", he had made it clear that the monitoring system needs more time, even more than six months, the period set by Ekeus six months ago. But this "more to be done" is not by Iraq, but the UNSCOM. Iraq has accepted UN Security Council Resolution 715 which is based on the monitoring svstem. The time is, therefore, needed by the UN body to implement the technicalities of its resolution and Iraq has expressed its readiness to provide help and this was stressed by Duelfer. The editorial said before the arrival of Duelfer, Rolf Ekeus said in a press interview that monitoring would take a year to prove its efficiency. Ekeus, however, had said before that such a system needs six months to be fixed. Now, he extends that to one year which means the Security Council would need another year to think of lifting the trade sanctions on Iraq or not. However, the Security Council resolutions state that if Iraq agrees to the monitoring system, the Security Council should lift the trade sanctions even partially. It is quiet clear from the statements made by the various UN officials that the U.S. Administration is dictating the Security Council what to do in order to prolong the trade sanctions. This is quiet clear through the recent every two-month UN-official discussions held by the Security Council members on the trade sanctions on Iraq. The U.S. and British representatives' stands were rather firm to prolong the sanctions while those of France, Russia and China are rather in favour of lifting them. Any observer would see clearly how the U.S. is directly influencing the UN and its organisations. When the six-month period which was earlier given to Iraq to assess its position towards the implementation of resolution 715 becomes nearer, the U.S. extends the period to one year and Ekeus and his aides have got the message and they started talking about the year time and there is more to be done and so on. We hope that this time Ekeus would come to Iraq carrying UNSCOM's and not U.S. demands because this would only complicate the situation, the editorial concluded.
