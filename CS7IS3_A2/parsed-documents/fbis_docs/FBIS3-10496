Last week, during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with the rest of the ministries and the Central Bank, government representatives assessed the commitments Brazil will assume and the strictness with which it will have to implement the terms of the aforementioned document. The Uruguay Round agreement will not only require the amendment of laws but also a change of attitude by the government bureaucracy such as the following: The subsidy and compensatory payment code must be improved, especially because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural trade must be efficient, agile, and cautious to avoid mistakes such as the one that caused Brazil to lose a case within the GATT to the European Union (EU) regarding the application of the compensatory rights to powdered milk importers. Marques Porto [chief of the International Trade Policy Department of the Foreign Ministry] said that the codes must be in keeping with the GATT procedures. The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry will have to be alert not to increase obstacles to foreign companies in the area of financial services because the country will assume the commitment to freeze at the current level the restrictions for access to the market. That requirement will also be demanded from officials of the Transportation Ministry. The improved regulations of the Brazilian customhouse must be ready before the enforcement of the commercial agreement of the Uruguay Round which is scheduled for mid 1995 goes into effect. Brazil needs to have "a corps of specialists" in the GATT and in the European Union as well as an independent internal organization to deal with issues such as the compensatory rights and "anti-dumping" measures. Until 12 April Brazil will no longer make any concessions to its Uruguay Round partners unless it receives some benefit. It is said that the hope is that there will be no reduction in the U.S. quota for additional imports of orange juice and shoes. The multilateral agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round which Brazil will sign in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 12 April will require the government to make a great effort to adapt them to the country's domestic laws. Last week, the Foreign Ministry called the attention of other ministries and the Central Bank to the need to improve mainly the codes on compensatory rights and subsidies because the defense of the Brazilian agricultural trade must be agile and careful at the same time. Joao Gualberto Marques Porto, chief of the International Trade Policy Department of the Foreign MInistry, explained: With the approval of the "peace clause" included in the agreement on agriculture which restricts the complaints by the partners of the European Union -- which are committed to the elimination of their agricultural subsidies in nine years which is how long the clause will be in effect -- Brazil will be able to begin an investigation against the Europeans but it will have to "put it on hold" and, if possible, before charging them before the GATT, negotiate with them. For example, if Brazil feels threatened by subsidized exports, it would be advisable first to get the Europeans to increase the prices of their products instead of immediately suing them for compensatory rights or anti-"dumping," said Marques. The Brazilian failure in the powdered milk case was a lesson when Brazil lost in a "panel" (special committee of experts of the GATT) late last year a case on the request of the European Union which demanded the payment of compensatory rights on its export products. Marques Porto said Brazil will still appeal GATT's ruling because it continues to believe that the European Union subsidizes its sale of powdered milk, but it also recognizes that the terms were not respected and that this gave room to the European accusation that GATT procedures were not complied with. Marques Porto said: "We have to reestablish a capable bureaucracy for a quick and effective defense that cannot be questioned: we must have the ability to detect the "dumping" or subsidy and establish the degree of damage with the application of adequate taxes. But it is essential that this be done in accordance with the procedures advocated by the GATT." Another key issue was raised at the meeting between Brazilian Foreign Ministry representatives and those from other federal administration agencies: Brazil's commitment to freeze at current levels its restrictions on foreign participation in the supply of services. Brazil had offered to maintain the "status quo" in this particular field which means that the Central Bank and especially the Finance Ministry must take great care not to increase red tape to make sure the country does not get punished. Marques Porto said: "Brazil cannot restrict access to its market any further." It has been decided to follow Japan's suggestion on financial services and new negotiations will take place six months after the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round go into effect -- somewhere in mid 1995 -- "taking into account the new conditions," to see whether the the GATT principle of most favored nation applies to this issue. This principle recommends that benefits granted to one country should be granted to all other member countries as well. Marques Porto explained: "The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry will have to keep their eyes on the international situations to find out to what extent Brazil can improve its access to foreign markets and establish whether it is worthwhile to make a better offer." Marques Porto believes that the Uruguay Round will have a "significant impact" on the Brazilian economy. At the meeting with representatives from other ministries that took place at the Foreign Ministry, Marques Porto also mentioned that Brazil needs to have a "group of experts" with a good grasp of the GATT and the EU, a group capable of dealing with issues such as compensatory rights. This would have to be an independent group, free from political pressures, and able to help Brazilian exporters who may be accused of unfair practices and to determine the extent of domestic harm inflicted. Marques Porto added that customs services will have to adjust to GATT's new standards.
