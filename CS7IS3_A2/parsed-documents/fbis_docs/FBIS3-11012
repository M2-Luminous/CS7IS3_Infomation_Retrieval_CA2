The report, which is the second of two parts, is by Juan Manuel Alvarado who interviewed Marcos "somewhere in the jungle of Chiapas." The date of the interview is not given. Alvarado describes Marcos as a "lively" individual who "suddenly becomes sullen and pensive when he recounts family members he has not seen for more than 10 years or when he predicts that his days are numbered." When recalling his early days in the jungle, Subcommander Marcos points out "he began to learn the dialect first, and later taught military courses, all of which helped him become a subcommander." At first, he used to write "about politics, as well as the domestic and international situations." He says: "Those were the times of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front offensives," adding, "things in the USSR were starting to happen, discussions on the European Common Market had gotten under way, and I had the option to do just that -- political analysis. Nevertheless, I was young and strong, and therefore I opted for something else. My comrades told me I should try the jungle, and so I did." When asked about his youth, he says he had a "normal childhood." He describes his family as middle class, and he notes that he attended grammar school, high school, preparatory courses, and college, adding, "I did my graduate work in the jungle." Marcos is also quoted as saying, "Everything began with my parents," because from the time he was very young, "my parents always told us there were injustices in the world, and one could not just sit back and do nothing. Of course, they never took up arms. They were not religious people; they only did it out of love for humanity." Marcos adds, "My parents were aware of all the injustices, and they considered it their duty to instruct their children not to remain indifferent." Subcommander Marcos says he went to "public schools and a university in one of the provinces," and that in addition to studying he enjoyed playing baseball, soccer, and basketball, "but most of all, I enjoyed reading." Alvarado points out that Marcos did not want to answer any questions about his personal life, and he would only say he left home as an adolescent and does not know if any of his brothers are alive. Subcommander Marcos says: "Up until 1983, I did not participate in any movements, and that is why I tell photographers they are wasting their time by taking my picture. My photo is not in any file, not even in the Traffic Department's files, much less as a foreign agent. My ski mask does not hide a face with a past but, rather, a face without a future." In concluding the interview, Subcommander Marcos says: "I was surprised when it was said we were awakening the people. The truth is that we wanted to awaken them, but we thought it was going to take much longer, and that other factors would influence this process. If we had foreseen how seriously our words would be taken by the people, we would have told them many more things we have not yet said, because we are just starting to feel our way."
