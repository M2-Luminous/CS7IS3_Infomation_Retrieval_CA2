Dr. Carpizo, good evening. [Carpizo] Good evening. [Zabludovsky] We have a question about the 21 August elections. You have asked the United Nations to send observers to the elections, to see how the elections are held. Yesterday, you said you will not permit any foreign institution or government to interfere. Would you explain this? It seems contradictory. [Carpizo] I am delighted to be with you again. Your question is very pertinent. Many people have asked me the same thing, which means that it is necessary to explain the situation. This is a great medium for doing so. There is no contradiction. We wrote the United Nations, establishing for the record -- I have the text here -- that our Constitution and our laws only authorize Mexicans to organize and assess the elections. This is by virtue of the principle of sovereignty, which means that only Mexicans can make decisions on Mexico. After establishing this principle in the note to the United Nations, we told them that Mexico, as a member organization, Mexico as a sovereign state has made a decision and this requests two things: First, that a mission of electoral experts be sent to study our electoral system and draft a technical report. This is very important. It would be a technical report. They are not going to judge or evaluate us. Second, that the United Nations provide technical assistance -- the phrase is technical assistance -- to the various national observers so that they can really act impartially, independently, and objectively. The United Nations is not going to send any observer, absolutely no one. What it will do is send a UN group to our country before the elections, long before the elections, to speak to nongovernment organizations and render this technical assistance, provided these organizations accept that assistance. In other words, Mexican nongovernmental organizations have every right to say either we accept or we don't. Fortunately, right now the Civic Alliance, which includes many nongovernment organizations, has accepted. It has accepted because this is good for all of us. We do want observers, but we want national observers. We want only national observers. It is important that they know how to conduct this observation for the good of Mexico, independently but with complete objectivity and impartiality. This is all that is contained in the note to the United Nations, nothing more. It is something quite different, totally different, when a foreigner or foreign government wants to intervene and tell us how to run our elections or give us advice. We do not need it. This would affect Mexico's sovereignty. That would be tantamount to meddling. Mexico cannot tolerate this for any reason. Many changes are being made in Mexico to improve our electoral laws, to improve all technical aspects of the 21 August elections, but through decisions by Mexicans. The Mexicans are doing this out of their own convictions because society and the Government of Mexico want to take steps forward in democracy. Mexican society is asking, really demanding, as we all are, clean and crystal-clear elections. If you will allow me, there is a third issue. This week the honorable Congress of the Union -- pardon me it was last week -- but yesterday, the official gazette of the federation published the reforms of our electoral laws. They are very important. These address the third issue, that of foreign visitors. Mind you, they would not be observers, by any standard. They are people coming to Mexico because Mexico does not prohibit anyone from coming. There is freedom to come and go. What are we going to do, then, if they want to be here on election day? They will be given a document explaining Mexico's electoral system and what they cannot do. One of the things they cannot do is dare to evaluate the elections or judge Mexicans. These, Mr. Zabludovsky, are the three extraordinarily different issues, which differ from the other issue. [Zabludosvky] It is very clear, Dr. Carpizo. I would like to ask a question on a totally different topic. [Carpizo] Of course. [Zabludovsky] A few moments ago this program reported that the Spanish justice minister, Juan Alberto Belloch, suspects that there are ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] people in Mexico. A deputy of the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who says he has clues regarding the presence of ETA members in Mexico, also has this suspicion. Would you tell us about that? [Carpizo] Of course, several Spanish media have reported this for several months, and some Mexican media have echoed the story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country who come from Spain, who come from that part of the Basque region, but we do not have any evidence that there are any guerrillas. If we had proof -- this is being investigated and we will continue to investigate it -- Mexico would act according to the law. [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Dr. Carpizo. [Carpizo] Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to be with you again.
