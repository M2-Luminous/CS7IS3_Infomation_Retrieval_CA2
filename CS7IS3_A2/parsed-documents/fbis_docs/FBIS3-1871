Taiwan is currently negotiating with US officials to have its name removed from the special 301 priority watch list, which targets countries breaching IPR laws. Those countries failing to improve their IPR protection records may be hit with trade sanctions by the United States. Lin cited US customs statistics in defense of Taiwan's efforts, saying that Taiwan has gone from having the most exports of any country seized for IPR violations by US customs agents in 1991, to improving to fourth position in 1993, trailing Mainland China, an unidentified country, and Hong Kong. Mainland Chinese goods worth US$19 million were confiscated by US customs for IPR violations last year, accounting for 43 percent of the total value of goods seized by the United States. Taiwan accounted for about 5 percent of the total value of goods confiscated, or US$2.2 million. In terms of the number of shipments of goods seized by the US customs for violating IPR laws, Taiwan ranked fifth. During the day's negotiations, Lin asked the United States to provide Taiwan with information concerning Taiwan's IPR violators so that the government can more effectively police the (renegade) trade. The US side, (?alternatively), expressed its dissatisfaction over Taiwan's having reduced the maximum jail term for violators of the trademark law to three years from five years.
