In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Dr. Haddadin said article three of the agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks, which was concluded recently, states that both sides should get their legitimate share of water sources shared by them. The issue will be discussed in official talks between the two sides as soon as the coming round of the Arab-Israeli bilateral talks starts, he said. Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would focus in the negotiations on a sub-agenda which would include all the points related to the water of the al-Yarmuk and the Jordan Rivers. Jordan, he said, has rights to international rivers it is sharing with other countries in accordance with international charters. But, he added, the Jordan River's tributaries in Jordanian territory, south of the al-Yarmuk River, are internal valleys whose water had been used since the 1950s to irrigate lands in the eastern Jordan valley. and thus, are considered Jordanian waters. Reviewing Jordan's plans to exploit the Jordan River, Dr. Haddadin said Jordan has prepared a plan to use the river and its tributaries in 1939 and the plan aimed mainly at irrigating lands in the eastern Jordan Valley. The plan was updated in 1950 for the same purpose. On the other side of the river, before the establishment of Israel, the Jewish agency had drawn counterplans for the use of the Jordan River. Following the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948, Israel had drawn two more plans, he added. The Israeli plans had always clashed with the Jordanian ones, and even the Israeli ambitions in Arab water had exceeded the borders of Palestine and included plans to use the al-Litani River in Lebanon, he said. Dr. Haddadin noted that Israel draws water from the Jordan River to the Palestinian coast for agricultural projects and even to the Negev Desert to reform lands while the Jordanian water plans have only concentrated on the use of the river's water in the Jordan Valley basin itself. Israel's attempts to control Arab waters continued after 1967, when Israeli occupied the West Bank and the Golan Heights, and the Israelis put under their control most of the Jordan River's sources and tributaries north of Tiberias Lake, he said. He added that Israel also managed to control the sources of the al-Yarmuk River after the 1967 war, thus violating all international standards and charters on the use of joint water sources.
