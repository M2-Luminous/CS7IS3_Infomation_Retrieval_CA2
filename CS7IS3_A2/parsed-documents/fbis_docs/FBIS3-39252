He will meet Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, Raymond Barre, and Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet [passage omitted] [Duplouich] Everyone agrees that you are a convinced pro-European who is intent on establishing Great Britain at the heart of Europe, following in the footsteps of John Major. Unlike your European partners, you continue to harbor just as many reservations as ever when it comes to Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], the single currency, the European central bank, etc. [Clarke] John Major's government is a pro-European government. And I intend to ensure that Great Britain participates fully in the implementation of the second phase of EMU. Naturally, we have our own views on how the Union should organize itself. Consequently, I would like to see greater emphasis placed on the economic convergence of our countries than on the arbitrary establishment of a calendar proclaiming European integration. We are continuing to argue in favor of a free market, of a privatized economy, and of anything that might help us to resolve the structural causes of unemployment, especially the costs incurred by business and the burden of bureaucratic regulations. [Duplouich] However, sterling is not going to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS) so soon. [Clarke] I still believe in the virtues of a system of stable parities, and the pound's Black Wednesday [16 September 1992] did not make me change my mind on this. However, I am not certain that the best way of obtaining stable parities will involve reestablishing links between our currencies within narrow bands of fluctuation. We will have to talk about this in due course, when we have made progress regarding the convergence of our economies. In any case, the pound will not rejoin the exchange rate mechanism during the current British legislative term, which will theoretically end in 1997. [Duplouich] In order to remain competitive globally, especially among the industrialized nations, will the countries of the European Union have to simultaneously review both their social legislation and their laws governing work organization? [Clarke] Yes. However, please note that this does not mean that they will have to break with their social traditions. On the other hand, what they will have to do is trim off any excesses, especially where they constitute an obstacle to employment. We must do away with any provisions which have a negative impact on competitiveness. We must take care not to increase the costs of our businesses to such an extent that their only way out consists of axing more jobs than necessary. This demand explains our intransigence vis-a-vis our continental partners regarding the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. Once again, it is not a case of abolishing social protection for employees, but rather of easing the burden on businesses so that they can face up to competition from the United States and Japan, among others. [Duplouich] Given the current economic situation, do you believe that the implementation of a legal minimum wage is unwise? [Clarke] Yes. There can be no doubt that it would indicate good intentions, but in reality for businesses it represents an expense per employee which far exceeds that to which they can reasonably agree. This, in turn, weighs heavily on employment. [Duplouich] Could the shorter working week be an answer to unemployment? [Clarke] To my mind, the approach in Europe to the unemployment problem is fundamentally flawed. In fact, people believe that the level of employment is fixed and that jobs must now be shared. According to this argument, if everyone works less and goes into retirement earlier, there will be more jobs on the market. What are the effects of this approach? A decline in competitiveness and an increase in the rate of job losses. The system does not work. The proof of this is that in certain European countries, which have the shortest working week and the longest paid holidays in the world, unemployment is not coming down either. On the contrary. [Duplouich] What is your view on France's policy of a "strong franc?" [Clarke] I note that it constituted the pillar of the economic program of the Left, and that it is still the pillar of the economic program of the current government. Of course, a policy of this kind imposes constraints when there are divergent monetary conditions in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. For our part, we defended sterling until Black Wednesday in September 1992. We then had to go ahead with a devaluation and, at the same time, adopt a policy of rigorous monetary discipline. I have already said that, contrary to the opinion held by our so-called Euroskeptics, unlinking sterling from the system of fixed parities accelerated economic recovery. I have been following the French experiment, which has after all proven partially similar to our own. The effects are different, but the government which is seeking to defend the "strong franc" has my support.
