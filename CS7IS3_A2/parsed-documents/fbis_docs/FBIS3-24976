The condition set by UNITA is that the Angolan Government must be prepared to discuss the matter at the highest military level. This is stated in a UNITA communique dated 3 February and signed by [Chief of Staff] General Ben Ben. The communique notes UNITA's satisfaction with the agreement on a national police force reached at the Lusaka talks, but this satisfaction is tempered by Gen. Ben Ben's concern over statements by Joao de Matos, chief of the Angolan Armed Forces' General Staff, whom the communique accuses of having called for the continuation of the war in Angola despite the progress made at the Lusaka talks. Gen. Joao de Matos's statements were made before his departure for Brazil, where he is now. Gen. Ben Ben believes that de Matos was not expressing a personal view but was speaking for the Angolan Government. The communique says that UNITA leaves it to the Angolan people to judge who is making money out of purchasing arms from Brazil while the Angolans are starving to death. The communique ends with praise for UN representative Alioune Beye for his role at the Lusaka talks.
