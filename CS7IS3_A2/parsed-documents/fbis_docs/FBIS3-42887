He was offended and in order to get revenge he lured all of the children out of the city by playing his pipe. Nobody ever heard from them again. I think the rat catcher simply killed them. He led them into a swamp. They, the poor things, saw that there was a quagmire underfoot and they were squelching through it but still they walked--listening to the pipe.... Oh if only they had believed their own wet socks rather than the sweet grace notes! Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is a brilliant rat catcher of our time. His pipe is big and loud. When hearing it a person does not want to look under his feet. Force yourself--look. Through Vladimir Volfovich's book, "The Last Thrust To the South." How To Save the Russian Nation "There absolutely must be a war with the Turks. They killed my uncle!" (Schweik). Foreign policy, as we know, is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's favorite subject. The theme of foreign policy runs through his book as a leitmotif. "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical concept," writes Vladimir Volfovich. "I do not want to give it a name like, say, the Zhirinovskiy formula, but the last "Thrust" to the south, Russia's approach to the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea--these are indeed tasks for the salvation of the Russian nation...this solves all the problems at once." Deciphering the idea of the "Last Thrust": Russia must again include within its borders not only the former republics of the Transcaucasus and Tajikistan, but also--the main thing!--Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. Vladimir Volfovich explains: All the great powers have spheres of influence, which only bolsters their world prestige: the United States--Latin America, France--North Africa...our southern neighbors must become this kind of "soft underbelly" for us. The advantages, in Mr. Zhirinovskiy's opinion, are obvious. In the first place, he asserts, we would eliminate the threat to Russia from the south: Afghanistan is already sending armed detachments to Tajikistan and Ankara is already dreaming of a Turkish state that has swallowed up Azerbaijan, the Northern Caucasus, and Georgia. Our borders would become peaceful, and there would be stability in the south. Moreover, a slight rearrangement of the Near East "would also prevent a third world war." Then the Thrust would strengthen the legs of the Russian army, which were about to give out. "The new armed forces will be able to recuperate only through combat operations," -- notes Zhirinovskiy. For Vladimir Volfovich the movement southward is as simple as can be, natural and pleasant. Instead of "moving Russia into the tundra where there can only be mineral resources, where nothing can live and develop,"--forward in striped swimsuits to the Indian Ocean! After the Turkish textiles! I can just imagine how on a dank, rainy evening Mr. Zhirinovskiy bit on his quill pen, shivered from the cold, and wrote: "How I dream about having Russian soldiers wash their boots in the warm water of the Indian Ocean and change into summer uniforms forever. Light shoes, light trousers, short-sleeved T-shirts, no ties, and open collars." And following--"recreation bases, youth camps, sanitoriums, preventive treatment facilities"... The Russian language and the Russian ruble would prevail, there would be no column for "nationality" in passports, and everyone would have human rights. God, a paradise! It seems that so far people have gotten into paradise only after they are dead.... How Is the Crow Like an Office Desk? "Do not be shy, boys! Right at your heels Rolls a whole cartload of money, Clop, clop, clop! A whole cartload of money, a kitchen with farina, Well, where is there a regiment happier than ours?" (Schweik). Let us take a look at the consistency of Vladimir Volfovich's ethical maxims. It reminds us very much of Bolvanshchik's riddle, to which the author himself did not know the answer: "How is a crow like an office desk?" On the one hand, Zhirinovskiy dons the feathers of the dove of peace and takes the olive branch between his teeth. "It is impossible to recognize democracy when it is bathed in blood" V.V. says quite correctly. "It is necessary to form in people's minds and create institutions of power so as to preclude obscurantism when a whole region is covered with blood." It is necessary "To preclude a situation whereby arms are used to solve all problems." "Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not deceive. Do not commit violence...all grandmothers and grandfathers of the world teach their grandchildren to do good," Vladimir Volfovich sentimentalizes. Apparently they did not teach him. There is an engraving of Durer's. It is shocking. Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf are lying under the same blanket. She is innocence itself and he is the essence of loathsomeness. They are lying there, however, peacefully. In the same bed. Just think: Is it possible for them to lie there, under the blanket, in one body? In any case, Zhirinovskiy has two heads. We listen to the first one, the innocent one. We are also listening to the second one--in which the wolf's teeth are chattering. They are chattering a melody as old as the world: In general one must not, but I can, and only this one time. "If we begin to block Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey--possibly some of the residents of these countries will be dissatisfied. But the whole world should understand that since Russia has to do this, it is all right." Chatter! "Medicine is not always sweet. Perhaps somebody in Kabul, Tehran, or Ankara might not like it. But it will make things better for millions of people." Chatter! We have already heard these speeches somewhere before: Was it not for the good of our people that the best of them rotted away in camps? Was it not for the happiness of the German nation that the chambers of the furnaces we all know about never stopped burning? How many times have we weighed and weighed again a child's tear against the well-being of mankind, and all this is new to Vladimir Volfovich! And the farther you go, the purer it is. "Nothing will happen to the world even if the Turkish nation does die out." "Some of the population (of the southern regions), unfortunately, will die because the South does not now have sufficient medicines or a sufficient level of culture. Therefore there will be a natural survival, assimilation, and adaptation. This is a natural process." One can confidently replace "they will die" with "they will be destroyed": Perhaps it is impossible to build the path to the warm seas and oceans with an olive branch. An opponent of violence, Zhirinovskiy in his voluptuous descriptions of blue-eyed soldiers in the New South, emphasizes this detail: In their hands will be "a small modern Russian automatic produced by the Izhevsk Plant. These automatics are much better than Uzis. So any platoon of Russian soldiers could impose order in any space." Vladimir Volfovich sees "Russian commanders...marking out routes for movements of troop formations...aircraft...submarines that travel to the shores of the Indian Ocean, landing craft suitable for the shores to which soldiers of the Russian army are already marching...." How is a crow like an office desk? What do nonviolence and the last Thrust to the south have in common? Answer, you crazy Bolvanshchik. There Will Be No Paradise "Do you like Turks?- Schweik asked The tractor operator Palivets.-- Those simple ones? But do you not?" Let us turn to the facts and figures. Let them tell us: Is a Last Thrust to the South possible? Is it possible for us to swim in the Indian Ocean and vacation peacefully in Iranian sanitoriums? There is only one answer: Alas, gentlemen, there will be no swimming paradise. One wise woman said: "The first night with a man means nothing. If he remains with you after the second--you have won!" Zhirinovskiy forgets that if you go in the direction of the warmer regions you must not only set out for there--you must also keep them under control. Yes, Vladimir Volfovich has learned well the main lesson of history, which is that it does not teach us anything. Why recall that immediately after the death of Alexander of Macedonia the empire he had created fell apart. That the Greeks, whose garrisons were based throughout an immense expanse--from Egypt to Central Asia--disappeared without a trace in the mass of the local population. That Napoleon's Egyptian adventure ended ingloriously. And after two bloody wars in Afghanistan the English were still unable to add even one diamond to the imperial throne. During the golden days of the victorious tsarist army it took 76 years to subdue the mountain peoples of the Caucasus. The penetration into Central Asia, which began under Peter I, did not end until 1884. And before the revolution the Cossacks resumed the war against the Tsarist troops while Bukhara remained a vassal of the state almost until the middle of the twenties.... If today the Algerian Muslims are sowing bloody terror against nonfundamentalist foreigners, what will be the reaction of the Muslim world to an invasion by orthodox believers?! (Zhirinovskiy, incidentally, also hears "the ringing of the bells of the Russian Orthodox Church on the shore of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.") No, there will be no paradise. And peace in the captured territories will be possible in only one way: with barbed wire, barracks, guard dogs, and mountains of corpses--both from one side and from the other.... Now about the military actions themselves. Vladimir Volfovich allows as how we might be the first to be attacked. But experts say that at the present time there is no justification for saying that there is a Turkish (or "pan-Turkish") threat against Russia. Moreover, the secular nature of the modern Turkish state and its cautious policy in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia show an obvious unwillingness on Turkey's part to be drawn into even a slight resemblance of a military confrontation with Russia. So we ourselves will have to attack. Let us imagine the year 1996. Zhirinovskiy takes the presidential oath on the new Constitution. And he does everything he can to unleash war. It is quite obvious that Russia will begin it in an exceptionally disadvantageous military-political situation. Our troops will be opposed by forces of Turkey and Iran, Afghan formations, and the army of Pakistan (taking into account its involvement in Afghan events and the fact that Zhirinovskiy is secretly counting on friendly behavior from India). Invasion of Turkey, which is a member of NATO, will bring up the question of the adoption of countermeasures by all the rest of the states of the bloc and the rendering of military assistance to the anti-Russian coalition (provided that the offended parties organize it). Let us even say that the NATO countries will not move their divisions toward Russia's western borders. In any case the American, British, and French units now stationed in Turkey will be reinforced. Vladimir Volfovich's reliance on an alliance with the Arab states is not justified. On the contrary, any "bow" to Saddam Husayn, whom Mr. Zhirinovskiy likes so much (his portrait hangs in the propaganda room of the staff headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) will immediately restore the anti-Iraqi coalition of the times of the war in the Persian Gulf. The knot of conflicts that is growing ever tighter in the Transcaucasus makes it impossible for either Zhirinovskiy or anybody else to look for strong allies there. Rather, drawing the peoples of the region into the orbit of large-scale military actions will bring about a war of everyone against everyone else, which is much more destructive and irrational than the one in Afghanistan. It is clear that Vladimir Volfovich's "Thrust" will make the southern boundaries of Russia not a peaceful region but a gigantic cauldron of war in which we will have to fight alone against practically all the rest of the world. Malbruk Made Ready for a Campaign... "During the summer, under the shade of the acacias, it is pleasant to dream about being posted." (Kozma Prutkov). Can we hope for victory? Elementary arithmetic gives us the answer: We cannot. Here are the military potentials of the sides. Just Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan together have more than 2 million enlisted men and officers, 8,600 basic combat tanks, 7,300 armored vehicles, 12,500 guns and mortars, 1,700 combat airplanes, and 400 combat helicopters. In their actual trained reserves they have another 1.7 million people, not counting Afghanistan, where only babies do not carry weapons. The military potential of the Arab part of the anti-Iraqi coalition and Israel amounts to another 900,000 people (with an equal number in reserve), 10,775 tanks, 16,000 armored vehicles, about 6,300 guns and mortars, and 2,000 combat airplanes and helicopters. We are still not taking into account all the NATO forces and the armies of other European states, which are not likely to remain tolerant of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's pranks.... But what about Russia? Russia, according to the calculations of the authors, realistically has in the North Caucasus Military District, the Transcaucasian Group of Forces, and the states of Central Asia...no more than 87,500 people, 1,700 tanks, 3,820 armored vehicles, 2,050 guns and mortars, and up to 500 aircraft--and most of them belong to air defense. Not very many? And even this equipment is subject to partial reduction--under the Agreement on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. No strategist could attack under these conditions, even a genius. Well, all right, let us say the units are transferred, the reservists are called up, and all the long-distance aircraft and forces of the Black Sea and Caspian fleets would make it possible to increase the figures that were given threefold, fivefold, or 10-fold. That would still be clearly inadequate. A fresh example comes to mind. In order to overcome the resistance of the Iraqi grouping of 183,000 (not 2 or 3 million!), members of the coalition had to concentrate 750,000 people, 4,000 tanks, 3,700 rifles and mine throwers, 2,000 airplanes, and more than 100 ships, including several shock aircraft carriers, in the region. And what forces would Russia have to put in motion? People who are possessed frequently push right on through to the breaking point. Let us assume that Zhirinovskiy has decided to call up a million reservists, whose combat readiness is the subject for a separate discussion, and begins to concentrate forces. Where? --On the operationally narrow section between the Volga and the Don and along the border with Kazakhstan. After that it will also be necessary to get over the Caucasian Mountains, the Steppes, and the desert. How? --By the railroad, which cannot even take the flood of vacationers, by an air bridge, which would not have a sufficient number of airfields, or...under their own steam? All right, good. Let us assume that we got there. But is it possible to attack on several fronts that are thousands of kilometers long in a theater of war with which the army is not familiar? How do we bring in ammunition, and reinforcements, how do we evacuate the wounded? It is easy to bomb railroads, and temporary airfields--even easier.... What about communications and troop control? In modern warfare, especially in mountainous regions, their effectiveness depends largely on satellite systems. The troops of the anti-Iraqi coalition in 1991 utilized about 60 military satellites. We have a couple of dozen of them...etc., etc. Finally, will Vladimir Volfovich, following the adventuristic logic of his Thrust, not have to dig into the cherished nuclear suitcase? To strike a blow to enemy cities, to destroy nuclear power plants, oil wells, irrigation systems? And receive a response--with nuclear weapons? Chemical? Bacteriological? And not only on the Russian army but also on its territory. The result: the destruction of the army, population, and the Russian State itself. Let us imagine the Russian soldier who has reached the Indian Ocean. And is washing his boots in it. In warm water. Somewhere far away is the depopulated Russia with its ruined economy. Right behind his back is the scorched desert. Under his feet--a narrow strip of ocean shore. Ahead.... The Role of Swimming Trunks in Geopolitics "Although we shame the Russian name, we serve only ourselves." (Kozma Prutkov). A couple of days ago an argument about Zhirinovskiy broke out on the trolley. "He is only concerned about Russia!"--shouted an old woman. Oh, old woman, is he concerned! He is ready to drown in blood--that is true. To put some people in jail and others to shoot. Every device will be used. It is strange--Vladimir Volfovich increasingly reminds me of Fat Vaska. We had a person like that in our section of the apartment building. First everyone beat him, but then he got hold of a switchblade knife somewhere and, on the contrary, he began to stick it to the offenders. And what if Mr. Zhirinovskiy did not invent his absurd plans for conquering Turkey out of concern for Russia? What if he all the time has recalled how some Turks once offended him, the poor thing? Here is what the Istanbul newspaper MILLIYET wrote in 1969: "The Soviet translator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was put in jail in the city of Iskenderun for communist propaganda. The local authorities warned him repeatedly that this would not be allowed. But he, paying no attention to the advice and warnings, not only distributed badges depicting Lenin and Marx among Turkish workers and engineers, but even agitated for a communist way of life." A couple of days later for a significant dollar bribe V.V. was brought to the USSR embassy in Ankara and a couple of days later he left Turkey.... One wonders if Zhirinovskiy were caught in the States if he would declare war on them? And would he press the nuclear button? In order to get revenge for an insult? Politics without personal ambitions is not politics. But it is terrible when a person is bruised in childhood and does not receive his bread and then begins take revenge against millions. The first part of "Last Thrust to the South" is biographical. Here Vladimir Volvofovich discusses only bruises and meager bread rations. And his failures at sex. Here, for example, is what happened on the beach when Zhirinovskiy was 17: "I was lying there with a girl, she was in a swimming suit, our relations were normal, friendly. I asked her to take off the bottom of her swimsuit. But what kind of girl takes off her swimsuit the very first thing. I did not know that I was supposed to do that myself, to help her, and I was embarrassed too. So we lay there until somebody disturbed us." And later: "If I had been born into a well-off family, in a Russian city, among Russian people...I would have had childhood friends nearby, a girlfriend--then, perhaps, I would not have taken up politics." Lord, why did she not take off her swimsuit then!
