[Mansur] First, I would like to thank you for contacting us to seek reassurance about conditions in our country. What is happening in the Yemeni arena today is the last chapter, not the beginning, of the crisis. Things were settled democratically in Yemen; the Yemeni people elected their representatives in public elections, which were clean, as certified by the organizations that supervised them. The elections elected people's representatives to parliament, which freely elected a presidential council ... [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] We do not want to discuss the past. We are trying to find a solution that stops the bloodletting. How can we do that? [Mansur] Yes, this is possible. It is what we hope and work for. No rational or civilized person would choose war. We neither opted to fight nor sought to wage a war. But we welcome any peaceful initiative in the context of recognizing constitutional legitimacy. [Abu-al-Majd] You say you welcome any peaceful settlement. The Arab League put forward a peaceful settlement to end the bloodshed. You reportedly did not accept that initiative. Why? [Mansur] We accept no mediation based on the idea that there are two equal parties in the arena. If a mediation effort admits that there is a legitimate government based on parliament and the Constitution and that seeks to reconcile parties, it is welcome to that. [Abu-al-Majd] But some say the military option will take time. So the bloodletting will continue. Even if the situation is settled in your favor militarily, this will create hatred in hearts and trigger more bloodletting. [Mansur] We are optimistic. We expect the future to be bright and to bring much good for the Yemeni people, the neighboring region, and the entire Arab people. We do not think the future will be one of vengeance and bloodletting. No wise man chooses war as an approach. [Abu-al-Majd] Why do you not sit with them now through Arab mediation--by the Arab League, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, or others--to make things clearer and stop the bloodshed? [Mansur] This is a wise thought. That is exactly what we did. We have sat with them 1,001 times since the beginning of the crisis. We got together in Jordan in the presence of His Majesty King Husayn and we signed a document named the Pledge and Accord Document ... [Abu-al-Majd interrupts] Why do you not try again one last time? [Mansur] Only an irrational person rejects reconciliation. But man reconciles with people who accept reconciliation. [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party people say they accept reconciliation. Do we understand from this that you have chosen the military option and, if so, why do you send envoys to Arab states? [Mansur] I would like to say that a political decision is delaying the entry of the legitimate army to Aden. The brother president does not want to devastate Aden, because he loves its people and sympathizes with them. That is why he might throw a siege around it. The envoys being sent to Arab leaders are part of bilateral consultations; they brief our brothers on the situation in our country. [Abu-al-Majd] Some say unity cannot be imposed by the force of weapons. [Mansur] This is true. Our unity was established peacefully by consensus and consent on 22 May 1990. [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the Pledge and Accord Document can still guarantee the continuation of unity after resorting to the military option? [Mansur] The document retains the necessary elements for success and survival although it needs to be developed and reviewed in light of new developments. [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you. [Mansur] Thank you.
