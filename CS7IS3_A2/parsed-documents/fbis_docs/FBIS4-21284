Police Commissioner Colonel Trevor MacMillan confirmed yesterday that the investigation is to be done by an "internal affairs division." He could not confirm, however, reports of a plot to undermine his administration of the Force through links between renegade members of the Force and a leading cocaine dealer in the Corporate Area. The recent spate of gangland murders (110 killings in the first 62 days of the year) is linked by police sources with the plot. The plot is said to involve the cocaine dealer, who has powerful overseas connections and is assisted by some disgruntled policemen, as well as deportees who are allowed immediate membership in the gang as long as they bring their own guns. Asked about the plot, Colonel MacMillan said, "I have no evidence of it but I would not be surprised because there are people in the force who are actively involved in the drug trade. We are developing strategies to deal with it but I am not prepared to comment further at this time, other than to say I have the Minister's total support." MacMillan, determined to break the link between the police force and drug traffickers, is striving for hard evidence to establish that there is a link. Fear Citizens are reportedly reluctant to come forward and give evidence for fear of reprisal from renegade cops. Colonel MacMillan said yesterday, "recently a doctor brought a patient and the patient's mother to give us information about where the patient got hooked on cocaine, and police involvement with that location. Neither the patient nor mother was prepared to give a signed statement, attend an I.D. parade, or go to court." He said this is the kind of thing that happens, making it difficult for the police to move from intelligence information to evidence. "For obvious reasons," he said, "people are reluctant to come forward. They fear for their personal safety." In the meantime, those renegade officers are fighting back through the cocaine boss, whose men are reportedly behind many of the recent murders. Sources tell The Gleaner that 60 to 70 police officers are involved in an islandwide cocaine network providing protection for crack houses, and escort services for the transportation of ganja, cocaine and crack. "As a result of stated government policy," said the Police Commissioner "an internal affairs division has been set up to investigate the corruption of policemen."
