According to ELEVTHEROTIPIA information from reliable sources, the efforts are aimed at finding a "middle solution" by promoting a new formula and a new timetable for the confidence-building measures. Two foreign diplomats in Cyprus recently expressed the view that no effort to promote a solution to the Cyprus issue will bear fruit before the occupied pseudostate is recognized in some form. Political observers who are aware of these disturbing views have personally protested. In any case, it is becoming clearer that mistaken or insufficient international understanding of the Cyprus issue in recent years has prompted international views and beliefs that are very disturbing for our case. For example, the parliamentary spokesman of a neighboring country asked his foreign minister who their ambassador to the occupied part of Cyprus is. According to reliable information, Moscow has two schools of thought on how to approach the Cyprus issue. One is almost identical to the U.S. policy on the Cyprus issue. The other is based on the former Soviet Union's policy on Cyprus--that is, to faithfully support Cyprus' independence and territorial integrity. According to our source's evaluation, Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Boris Zenkov--whose thoughts seem to have affected one of the two Russian Foreign Ministry envoys who visited Cyprus recently-- belongs to the first school of thought.
