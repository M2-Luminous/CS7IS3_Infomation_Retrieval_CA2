A statement released by the royal palace said the reason the king is going to China earlier than planned is because he has been "slandered" over his latest proposals for peace. Some local newspapers have recently accused the king of seeking to regain power by proposing new elections. "From now on, I quit concerning myself with this tragic problem between the royal government and the Democratic Kampuchea Party. I don't want people to continue to slander me," the king, who repeatedly sought a peaceful solution to the civil war, said in a written statement. In order to end the civil war and realize peace and national reconciliation in the country, Sihanouk proposed holding an early election to give the Democratic Kampuchea Party a chance to join the government. On May 9, Khieu Samphan wrote to Sihanouk saying that he supported the proposal, but the government did not give a positive response. Some officials expressed the view that the term of the present government has yet expired, and that there are no fund available for another national election.
