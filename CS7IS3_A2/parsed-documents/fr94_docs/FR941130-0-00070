SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued notices, published in the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353) and amended in the Federal Register of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49397), which announced that Miles, Inc., Agricultural Division, P.O. Box 491, Kansas City, MO 64120, had submtted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4169) and a food/feed additive petition (FAP 3H5655) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to sections 408(d) and 409(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d) and 348(b), establish tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]- N -nitro-2-imidazolidinimine in or on the raw agricultural commodities apples at 0.5 part per million (ppm), potatoes at 0.3 ppm, and cottonseed at 6.0 ppm. FAP 3H5655 proposed establishing a food or feed additive regulation for cottonseed meal at 9 ppm and for combined residues of imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety, all expressed as imidacloprid, on apple pomace (wet or dried) at 3 ppm, on potato chip at 0.4 ppm, and on potato waste at 0.9 ppm. A time limitation was requested on the cottonseed tolerance and the cottonseed meal food additive tolerance. There were no comments or request for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notices of filling. The database for imidacloprid is relatively complete. The most significant data gap is the need to complete additional cotton crop field trials and present a final report, and this is the reason for the 2-year time limitation on the tolerances. On June 2, 1994, the Agency issued a guidance document on crop residue trials. Among other things, this document provided guidance on the number and location of domestic crop field trials for establishment of pesticide residue tolerances. Based on this guidance document, additional residue trials are needed to fully support the cotton tolerance. Given the relatively low risk presented by imidacloprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will significantly change EPA's risk assessment. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance include: 1. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a noobserved-effect level (NOEL) of 100 ppm (8 mg/kg/bwt). Rat and rabbit teratology studies were negative at doses up to 30 mg/kg/ bwt and 24 mg/kg/bwt, respectively. 2. A 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study and a NOEL of 100 ppm (5.7 mg/kg/bwt in male and 7.6 mg/kg/bwt female) for noncarcinogenic effects that included decreased body weight gain in females at 300 ppm and increased thyroid lesions in males at 300 ppm and females at 900 ppm. 3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1,250 ppm (41 mg/kg/bwt). 4. A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under conditions of the study and that had a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (208 mg/kg/day). There is no cancer risk associated with exposure to this chemical. Imidacloprid has been classified under ``Group E'' (no evidence of carcinogenicity for humans) under EPA's cancer Assement Guidlines by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Reference Dose (RfD) Committee. The reference dose (RfD), based on the 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenic study with a NOEL of 5.7 mg/kg/bwt and 100-fold uncertainty factor, is calculated to be 0.057 mg/kg/bwt. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from published uses is .001734 mg/kg/bwt/day. This represents 3% of the RfD. The proposed tolerances contribute .0008957 mg/kg/bwt/day. This represents a 1.56% increase in RfD. Dietary exposure from the existing uses and proposed uses will not exceed the reference dose for any subpopulation (including infants and children) based on the information available from EPA's Dietary Risk Evaluation System. The nature of the residue in plants and livestock is adequately understood. The residues of concern are imidacloprid and its metabolites that contain the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety, all calculated as imidacloprid. The analytical methods are common moiety methods for imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridiyl moiety using a permanganate oxidation, silyl derivatization, and capillary GC-MS selective ion monitoring. Adequate geographically representative magnitude of the residue crop field trial data for imidacloprid on apples, potatoes, and cotton indicate that residues of total imidacloprid will not exceed the proposed tolerances when the formulation is used as directed. Cotton, potato, and apple processing studies were conducted using the raw agricultural commodities bearing detectable imidacloprid residues. These studies followed commercial processing practices. Imidacloprid was found to concentrate in apple pomace, cottonseed meal, potato chips, and potato waste. Appropriate imidacloprid food additive tolerances have been requested. Based on the results of the imidacloprid bovine and poultry feeding studies finite imidacloprid residues will occur in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs from feeding of imidacloprid-treated feed items, or their processed feed items, when the formulations are used as directed. Appropriate secondary tolerances have been requested. Although additional cotton field trial are needed, EPA does not believe the additional data will change its risk assessment. There are currently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical. This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving the intended physical or technical effect. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances regulations established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health and that use of the pesticide in accordance with the terms of the requested food/feed additive tolerances will be safe. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
