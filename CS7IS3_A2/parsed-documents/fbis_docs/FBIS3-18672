In a written statement, Dogan pointed out that certain newspapers recently reported that in the wake of the exchange rate readjustments made in January, foreign exchange accounts will be frozen and converted into Turkish lira. These reports are completely unfounded, Dogan said, adding: The balanced value of foreign exchange is determined by the supply and demand in the market. There is no need to intervene. There is no shortage of foreign exchange in the market. There is no need for a transfer of foreign exchange in the banks or in the Central Bank. Foreign payments are being made with no delay. On the other hand, citizens' foreign exchange accounts are totally under the management of private banks. Our banks have sufficient supplies of foreign exchange. It is absolutely out of the question as well as unnecessary to freeze citizens' foreign exchange accounts and convert them into Turkish lira. Everything is working securely and in line with economic rules. Any statements or commentaries to the contrary are aimed at confusing the citizens. Turkey has opted for an open and growing economy. Consequently, a return to the policy of bans is out of the question. The free market mechanism will determine the areas to which savings will be channeled, as has been the case until now. Consequently, with the greatest peace of mind, our citizens must invest their savings in the way most suitable to their economic interests -- as far as terms, interest rates, and other conditions are concerned -- including foreign exchange accounts. Our citizens must ignore these rumors, which are contray to their own interests and to those of the country.
