The Austrian minister of education and arts recently gave an award to the writer of the highly sacrilegious book `The Satanic Verses'. The Iranian official said this measure is condemned not only by the Islamic republic but also by all world Muslims and followers of other divine religions. Rushdie sentenced to death for his crime is in hiding in Britain since 1989 with world Muslims determined to bring him to justice. The apostate who has hurt the feelings of the world's over one billion Muslims, is being backed by certain Western countries who from time to time reward him for his misdeed, in scant respect of Muslim sentiments.
