The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that a relative calm has prevailed on Armenia's borders for the last three days. The relative calm established along most of Karabakh frontline in recent days is still being maintained. Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reported that the fighting continued only in the north of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon in the direction of Omar Pass over the last day. But dense fog and heavy snowfall on the mountains are hampering active military operations. Despite that, the Karabakh forces managed to destroy one enemy armored car and three troop carriers, and killed a great number of Azerbaijani soldiers.
