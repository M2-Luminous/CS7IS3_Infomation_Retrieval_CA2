The Federation Council did not accept Kazannik's resignation and formally he still remains at his post. At the same time, according to the presidential decree dated February 26, the duties of prosecutor-general are being performed by Alexey Ilyushenko whose powers were reaffirmed on April 6 by President Boris Yeltsin. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Federation Council vote: "Two prosecutors-general are too many for Russia. Through its decision, the Federation Council has drawn itself into a juridical collision, and an easy and painless way out of it can hardly be expected... "Prior to making a new recommendation of a candidate for the office of prosecutor-general, the president should again suggest that the Federation Council accept Kazannik's resignation. The circle closes... "It is clear that the Federation Council will not be able to resolve the problem without a thorough juridical analysis of the current situation and a search for a compromise solution". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The Federation Council does not yield to the presidential team. Next move is to be made by the presidential side. The president should either recommend Alexey Kazannik to the Federation Council, or get to terms with the upper house of parliament in some other way". TRUD carries an analytical article headlined "Who is Prosecutor- General in Russia?" Turning to the provisions of the new Constitution, the newspaper writes: "Since a prosecutor-general is appointed by the Federation Council on the president's recommendation, it can well be reckoned that the president should have presented prosecutor-general's candidacy to parliament for approval. This must also be demanded by the upper house of parliament. "Neither the former nor the latter had been done in time. The president does not recommend Kazannik now because he has already accepted his resignation. On the other hand, by refusing to accept the resignation, the Federation Council has actually `appointed' a prosecutor-general without the president's recommendation". Newspapers also give prominence to a draft agreement on achieving civil accord in Russia, which President Yeltsin has referred to the two houses of parliament, as well as sent it for publication and country-wide discussion. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an article in which it expresses doubt that the document would be implemented. "Special sections of this sizeable document deal with both regional, national and socio-economic policies... Obligations are envisioned in all of them. But would they be feasible in real life full of contradictions?" KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) is more optimistic on the subject: "The draft agreement inspires hopes, albeit faint and indistinct." PRAVDA frontpages statistics on the economic situation in the country: "In the first quarter of this year, industrial production declined by 25 percent. Food production continues to shrink. The amounts of milk and meat produced decreased by 15-18 percent and eggs by six percent. Investment diminished as production fell. Investments in the country's economy accounted for 75-80 percent of those in the corresponding period last year." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the money incomes of the country's top officials. Under the headline "No One Wanted To Fill in a Declaration of Income", the newspaper carries an article which points to the construction of costly three-storey mansions for some ministers, mayors, and deputies. The authors of the article urge Russian parliamentarians to pass a law which would make it binding upon top executives of the country, and leaders of state-run organisations to fill in declarations of income, which could prevent the emergence of corruption in the civil service system.
