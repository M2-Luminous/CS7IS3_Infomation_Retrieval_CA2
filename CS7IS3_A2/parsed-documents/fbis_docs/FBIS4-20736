He was charged with attacking the 62-year-old head of the Sudanese National Islamic Front (NIF), Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, who in the world's eyes is considered the spiritual guide and director of the present government in Khartoum. The verdict by the 12-person jury declared the defendant Badr-al-Din innocent of the three charges against him (two counts of assault and one count of assault causing grave injury). They did so because support to uphold the case was lacking due to contradictions and discrepancies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses. Instead of lowering the curtain on the case, the verdict has raised more debate. The verdict was received in Khartoum with further charges that "foreign agencies" had "engineered a plot." The Sudanese media attacked the Canadian court's decision as biased and unjust. Criticizing the verdict at a press conference in Khartoum, Dr. al-Turabi said it was not fair. He noted that the attack had targeted him not as an individual, but as "a symbol of the Islamic revival." The Popular Arab Islamic Conference (a grouping of radical, fundamentalist, leftist, and nationalist movements that al-Turabi heads), which was meeting in Khartoum when the verdict was announced, issued a statement attacking the court's decision. These reactions agreed in explicitly or implicitly charging foreign agencies with involvement in a "conspiracy" targeting al-Turabi and attempting to liquidate him. Al-Turabi was explicit about the matter in his talk to journalists after the Popular Arab Islamic Conference meeting. "There is," he said, "a complete organization behind the attack"--the one that targeted him in Canada. He indicated that "senior European officials" were involved, but he refused to identify them. The charges were a restatement of what Sudanese agencies, al-Turabi's family, and some Arab fundamentalist movements linked to al-Turabi's organization said in the first days after the attack about 19 months ago. The Sudanese media talked from the beginning about an attempted assassination. Many NIF proteges wrote in newspapers about how there were hidden hands and foreign parties behind the case. A few days after the episode, al-Turabi's family issued a statement signed by Hasan al-Turabi's son, Sadiq al-Turabi, accusing foreign agencies of standing behind the attack and hinting that the attacker was "a tool of other agencies." The statement leveled a number of charges against the Canadian authorities. It charged them with having refused to provide Dr. al-Turabi with protection during his visit, which included Toronto and Ottawa. The police were said to have arrived on the scene about 20 minutes after the incident. It took about an hour to transport the victims to the hospital--from the occurrence of the incident to arrival at the hospital. Al-Turabi's family demanded that the Canadian authorities issue full information about the incident and its circumstances. They warned that failure to maintain "justice and fairness in the proceedings of the case would lead to complications caused by injustice." Conspiracy Theory Al-Turabi himself supported the conspiracy theory when about two months after the incident he spoke at a press meeting about how more than one agency was behind the attack. He indicated that two countries were involved, but refused to name them, saying that "the time has not yet arrived for that." Others linked to Dr. al-Turabi by family or organizational ties joined in, though without leveling charges at one particular agency and without producing proof and documents to support the conspiracy theory. Al-Turabi himself once talked about "a complete organization behind the attack." On another occasion he spoke about the involvement of "senior European officials," and on a third occasion about "the involvement of two countries." On the other hand, the Canadian police indicated that they had found no other suspects in the case and pressed charges against Hashim Badr-al-Din alone. During the trial sessions, the defense attorney indicated that his client, Badr-al-Din, had attacked al-Turabi in moments of anger and excitement. If he had really wanted to kill al-Turabi, he could have done so while the NIF general secretary lay covered on the ground in front of him, unconscious after his head had hit the floor following the Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him. The defense attorney also stressed that his client had not attempted to flee. Had the episode been planned, he would have fled. He had an opportunity to do, as it took some time for the police to arrive on the scene. Badr-al-Din himself repeatedly insisted that the attack had been an individual act and that his motives had been political. He said that he had been at Ottawa Airport by coincidence to say goodbye to a friend, when he saw al-Turabi and his followers suddenly enter the airport. One should note that al-Turabi changed the time of his plane from 1800 to 1900 in the evening, a change known to only a few of the NIF general secretary's aides and Sudanese embassy officials in Ottawa. Badr-al-Din justified the attack as an expression of "a feeling of injustice with regard to what the Sudanese people were suffering from NIF rule." He said that he "rejected what is being practiced in Sudan today in the name of Islam--things of which Islam is innocent." In questioning, at the trial, and in his statements to the press, he denied having used karate in striking al-Turabi. He said that if he had wanted to use a karate technique, he would have used his foot in the attack, as most of his strength was concentrated in his foot. Badr-al-Din, who is a religious man and a Sufi, said he had been involved previously in heated debate with other members of the NIF leadership, with which he says he disagrees strongly. He spoke of a confrontation and altercation between himself and 'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad Taha, al-Turabi's deputy in the NIF leadership, in New York before a crowd of people and of altercations with other NIF leaders in other countries, all of them acrimonious. He said he should have liked to argue with al-Turabi, had the opportunity arisen for him in Canada. Conflicting Statements by Witnesses Argument over motives and circumstances will continue, given the sharp disagreement of viewpoint and accounts between the two sides and given the contradictions and discrepancies among the prosecution witnesses who appeared before the Canadian court that heard the case. Perhaps the witnesses' contradictory statements played the greatest part in influencing the decision of the jury and the court, especially after one of the three main witnesses, Muhammad Ibrahim Rashid (a Somali who was one of al-Turabi's guards when the attack occurred) changed his account several times. In his statements after the incident describing the attack to the police, Rashid said that Badr-al-Din had attacked him also, just as he had attacked al-Turabi and Ahmad 'Uthman Makki (one of al-Turabi's close aides who helped arrange the trip to the United States and Canada). During the trial, Rashid changed his account to say that he had been in the second car that accompanied al-Turabi to Ottawa Airport the evening of 25 May 1992 (the evening of the attack). He did not see the attack, because he entered the hall of the airport a few minutes after al-Turabi and Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, at which time he saw al-Turabi stretched out on the floor, bleeding, while Badr-al-Din stood near al-Turabi shouting hostile political slogans. Under intense cross-examination by the defense attorney, Rashid admitted that he had not seen the attack on al-Turabi and that Badr-al-Din had not hit him personally, but had only tried to do so. Faced with the defense attorney's insistence, his pressure, and his demand for an explanation of the discrepancy in Rashid's statements, the witness admitted that his first statements had not been correct, and he told the court that Ahmad 'Uthman Makki had suggested that he make such statements. It was clear throughout the court sessions that the strategy of Badr-al-Din's defense attorney was based on showing discrepancies among the statements of the witnesses. He also concentrated on uncovering any gaps in the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki. Therefore the most heated court sessions were those that witnessed sharp confrontations between the defense attorney, Gary Barnes, and Makki, who is also considered an NIF leader. He has been responsible for NIF publicity and for coordinating NIF activities and contacts in the United States. The defense attorney demanded clarification of the motives for al-Turabi's visit to Canada and whether it had taken place in the name of the Sudanese Government or in the name of an international Islamic organization. He also insisted on knowing the agency that had funded the trip. He rejected witness Makki's assertion that "a friend" whose identity he did not reveal had arranged the funding. In a rapid-fire exchange of questions and answers, the defense attorney asked witness Makki about Dr. al-Turabi's position in the current government in Sudan--whether he was the real ruler or had influence in the government--and in what capacity he had visited Canada. Makki replied that al-Turabi was a noted religious figure and that he had visited Canada in that capacity and had discussed many general issues. As for the extent of his influence on the present Sudanese Government, he said it was a matter of debate and individual opinion. However, the defense attorney insisted on obtaining a more exact definition of al-Turabi's position. Makki replied that al-Turabi presently holds the position of general secretary of the Khartoum-based Popular Arab Islamic Conference. Taking up the same thread once more, the attorney asked whether this organization was part of an international Islamic organization. Attempting to prove his claim that al-Turabi led an international organization, the defense attorney went on to ask Ahmad 'Uthman Makki about his personal position and current source of support, why he divided his residence between Sudan and the United States, and about his organizational ties with al-Turabi. During the discussion about his residence in the United States, Makki was forced to withdraw his previous statements to the court that the reason for his presence in Chicago had been to obtain a graduate degree from the university there. About his source of support, he said he was drawing a salary from the Islamic Call Organization. Replying to the defense attorney's questions, Makki mentioned that he was not working in the present government, nor had he worked in previous governments in Sudan. He said his relation with al-Turabi was one of friendship, not a party relationship between a leader and his follower. He denied being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, saying that he had left the organization 65 years ago because of disagreements over certain matters. Member of Parliament When the attorney insisted on knowing whether the witness was a member of any political organization, Makki said he was connected only with a cultural, religious, and social organization--the NIF, which he refused to call a political party. However, the attorney returned to continue his questions on another occasion and asked Makki to inform the court whether during the now-ended democratic period he had ever become a member of the Sudanese Constituent Assembly (Parliament) representing a particular body. Makki answered affirmatively, saying that he had won as an NIF candidate. As for his present job and capacity, Makki said he was an Islamic missionary in an international Islamic organization called "Islamic Call." When the attorney during one session asked about the capacity in which he had stayed as a guest of the Sudanese charge d'affaires in Canada during his visit with al-Turabi to Ottawa, Makki replied that it had not occurred because he had a governmental capacity, but only because he had been a friend of the charge d'affaires since their student days together at Khartoum University. The attorney then questioned before the court how Makki could say that he and al-Turabi had no official capacity when he had already mentioned that the two had informed the Sudanese charge d'affaires of the tenor of their conversations with Canadian Government officials before heading to Ottawa Airport, where they were attacked. The defense attorney also got into an intense argument with Ahmad 'Uthman Makki over his description of the attack at the airport. Because Makki's testimony was vital to the progress of the case, the attorney tried to cast doubt on it or demolish it completely by proving the existence of contradictions or discrepancies in it. For example, when Makki mentioned that he tried to intervene to protect al-Turabi by throwing himself on him while the general secretary was stretched out motionless on the floor because of Badr-al-Din's blow that had struck him, the attorney intervened to say that the witness's version was inexact and that there were witnesses who could appear in court to say that the witness had quickly retreated when Badr-al-Din struck him and had taken refuge in the area behind the airport escalator. Makki rejected the attorney's assertion and said he would be surprised if any witnesses said he had hidden behind the escalator. The defense attorney also contested Makki's testimony that the defendant Badr-al-Din had tried to escape after his attack on al-Turabi. Attorney Barnes said that a number of witnesses as well as policemen had stated that Badr-al-Din remained in his place inside the airport until the police arrived 20 minutes later and arrested him. Al-Turabi, Looni During the questioning in court, the defense attorney indicated that al-Turabi had used an alias while in Canada. He referred to this name as Looni (Martin Looni, according to some sources). The defense attorney asked Makki whether he and al-Turabi were traveling under their real names. Makki replied that he himself had entered Canada under his real name, but he indicated that al-Turabi may have traveled under the name of H. 'Abdallah. (Al-Turabi's full name is Hasan 'Abdallah al-Turabi). When the attorney asked Makki whether he knew a person named Looni and whether al-Turabi had used the name on his trip, the witness replied in the negative. Regardless of the name that al-Turabi used on his trip, he certainly used an alias when he arrived in Ottawa. For this reason, airport security officials, who did not know that al-Turabi was in the airport on that day, became confused. It should be noted that they were trying to wait for him in order to provide him protection. The available information indicates that Canadian intelligence sent the Ottawa police a warning about possible danger to al-Turabi, especially after the protest demonstrations that confronted him during his European and American tour and after he reached Toronto. But it seems that an error occurred because of technicalities in the Canadian system: instead of informing the Gloucester police, who have jurisdiction over the airport, intelligence directed its information to the Ottawa police. An inspector named Phil Lockett from the Gloucester City Police, which has jurisdiction over the airport, informed AL-MAJALLAH that they learned of al-Turabi's arrival at Ottawa Airport only at a later time, the morning of the day he arrived to meet officials in the Canadian Foreign Ministry. He indicated that the information they received from intelligence came late. Lockett added: "The error came about because we were not informed of the alias under which al-Turabi was traveling. Thus, when we looked for al-Turabi's name in the airport records, we did not find it." Similarly, no one informed the airport of the change in the scheduled departure of al-Turabi's plane from Ottawa to Toronto the evening of 25 May. The security men waited half an hour at the airport. When al-Turabi did not arrive, they left the area, thinking that he might have changed his schedule. Al-Turabi in fact arrived about 20 minutes later, and the confrontation and attack then took place. Questions About Medical Report Other questions were raised during the trial, particularly regarding al-Turabi's state of health immediately after the attack. The medical report submitted to the court, as well as the testimony of the physician Vasco da Silva, who supervised the treatment of al-Turabi, revealed that the NIF general secretary suffered a slight concussion to the brain and light swelling on the left side of the back of the head. Swelling was visible on his upper lip and some blood in his nose when he arrived at Civic Hospital in Ottawa the evening of 25 May after the attack on him. The report indicated that al-Turabi spent his first night in the hospital's intensive care room. He was breathing normally. His blood pressure and heartbeat were also normal. Dr. da Silva told the Ottawa court that when al-Turabi was brought to the hospital, he responded to the verbal instructions he heard, but his replies to questions were not clear or logical. Da Silva said that al-Turabi was moved the next day (26 May 1992) from intensive care to the brain surgery ward. He mentioned that he allowed a Sudanese physician to examine al-Turabi at the request of the patient's family and that the physician advised using certain drugs in the treatment. A deterioration in al-Turabi's health became visible after the third day in the hospital. Surveying and mapping operations indicated a larger concussion to the brain. Al-Turabi completely lost the power to speak and appeared severely fatigued and dizzy. He therefore had to be returned to intensive care. According to the physician's report, about a week after his admission to the hospital, al-Turabi developed a reaction to one of the drugs given him. The defense attorney at the trial questioned why Dr. da Silva had allowed another physician from outside the hospital (the physician that al-Turabi's family summoned) to examine al-Turabi and interfere in his treatment. The attorney also raised a number of other questions about whether Dr. da Silva knew al-Turabi's medical history. The doctor denied any knowledge of it. The subsequent deterioration of al-Turabi's health raised questions. There was a discussion of whether the blow he had received during the attack had caused the damage or whether his head's hitting the floor had caused the concussion. Al-Turabi remained in the Canadian hospital about 25 days. Not until 13 June 1992, 19 days after entering the hospital, did he regain his ability to talk, according to the medical report submitted to the Ottawa court. Indications by the physician that al-Turabi may need long subsequent treatment in a specialized European or American hospital have raised speculations about the effects of the incident on him. [Box, p 22] The Attack The attack on al-Turabi took place the evening of 25 May 1992 at Ottawa Airport. Al-Turabi was trying to catch a plane from Ottawa to Toronto. With him were NIF leader Ahmad 'Uthman Makki and a Somali companion named Muhammad Ibrahim. There was also a Pakistani with Canadian citizenship named Ziyad Muzaffar, who helped arrange the NIF general secretary's visit to Canada. Hashim Badr-al-Din, according to accounts, was at the airport saying goodbye to one of the Sudanese who had come from Toronto to take part in a protest demonstration against al-Turabi in Ottawa. According to statements by Hashim Badr-al-Din and eyewitnesses, when Badr-al-Din saw al-Turabi hurry into the airport, he ran toward him shouting political slogans in Arabic and English: "Murderer, murderer! Terrorist, terrorist!" Ahmad 'Uthman Makki tried to block Badr-al-Din and push him away, but the latter slapped Makki hard with his right hand, forcing him to retreat. Hashim Badr-al-Din says that he struck al-Turabi a single blow on the face. Al-Turabi fell; his head struck the floor, and he lost consciousness. The Somali companion, Muhammad Ibrahim, tried to grab Hashim Badr-al-Din, but the latter wheeled round and pushed him back; so Ibrahim withdrew. Ziyad Muzaffar also tried to approach Badr-al-Din, but stopped when the latter turned to confront him. Badr-al-Din remained in his place shouting his political slogans. The police arrived on the scene about 20 minutes later. An ambulance arrived afterward to take al-Turabi and Makki to the hospital. Badr-al-Din revealed in his statements that he was taken to the hospital for treatment of his hand, which was bleeding. He said that during the scuffle between him and al-Turabi, the latter bit him on the hand. Badr-al-Din was taken later to the police station to make a statement. He was released two days later to appear in court on 2 June 1992, at which time he was charged with three counts of assault. Because al-Turabi made no statements to the police, the only versions of the incident were those by Hashim Badr-al-Din, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, Muhammad Ibrahim, and Ziyad Muzaffar, in addition to a few Canadian eyewitnesses who had been at the airport. Al-Turabi did not appear in court. The prosecutor said that the NIF general secretary had informed the authorities that he recalled no details of the attack.
