Officials had adopted a flexible approach towards applications for reporting on the mainland, said deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Wang Fengchao. But, in future, the rules would have to be strictly followed "to avoid confusion", Mr Wang told a delegation from the Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing yesterday. "Because the response from Hong Kong was that it was difficult to understand the system in China when it suddenly tightened its rules and imposed a 12-year penalty on Xi Yang, Mr Wang said it was better for China to stick to its rules," said the federation's Chan Yuen- han after the meeting with Mr Wang. Xi was jailed for 12 years for "stealing state secrets". He was accused of publishing details last summer of Beijing's plan to sell gold and raise interest rates in defence of the exchange rate. Mr Wang asked other Hong Kong journalists to stick to the confines of their approved reporting activities while on the mainland. China's State Council has seven rules regarding reporting activities in China. They stipulate that all reporters must apply in advance to cover any activity in China and that the coverage should not go beyond the items listed in the application form. Mr Wang said more than a thousand Hong Kong reporters had visited China since last year and only Xi had been arrested, illustrating that most reporters knew and followed the law. He said Xi had asked to cover news related to the Sino-British talks, meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee and an education project, but had failed to spell out his intention to cover news related to China's state finances and economy. Xi had been a reporter on the mainland for more than eight years and should have known the boundaries distinguishing normal reporting and spying for state secrets, Mr Wang said. He said that was why Xi could not be regarded as unintentionally trespassing in the "restricted areas". He said Hong Kong and China had different legal systems and Hong Kong people should not use their legal standards to make judgments about China's system. Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping has assured that Xi's sentence "will not affect Hong Kong reporters' normal reporting work".
