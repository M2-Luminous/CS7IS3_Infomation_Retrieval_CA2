Last December there was a whole host of politicians trying to fight their way into the Duma. It was packed here -- the candidates had to push and shove -- but when it came to the Federation Council the elections were null and void -- no one wanted to run! Now, however, there are 13 contenders for the last two seats in Russia. An ominous number. But the "temporarily nonworking" ex-general V. Varennikov probably is not superstitious about such things. He has visited Chelyabinsk twice. He addressed the public who, as the local newspapers reported, greeted his speeches with applause and shouts of approval. All sorts of people are being attracted to Chelyabinsk Oblast. General Makashov was here on the eve of the presidential elections. Zhirinovskiy perorated from atop a tractor at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant. Federation Council contender Lev Ubozhko, chairman of the Conservative Party of Russia, did not give a fig for this Zhirinovskiy: "When I speak, there will be nothing that that...can do!" As a politician he rates himself above Zhirinovskiy and as for Yeltsin -- even more so. Lev the Terrible! The oblast administration, it seems to me, is watching these elections with a certain unease. All last year Vadim Solovyev, the head of the administration fought the oblast Soviet (or rather the Soviet fought him). After the putsch the deputies were turfed out and a lull ensued. But the apparatus settled down into the comfortable, well paid jobs. Where the means exist the ends are not hard to achieve. The opposition has been biding its time in the shadows but has been very actively promoting its candidates into a place in the sun. Who knows how the Federation Council deputies will behave toward the administration? The Duma deputies, for example, have already brought up the big guns -- a commission from the Russian president's apparatus has already come for a heart to heart talk with Solovyev. The only calm people here are surely the voters. Calm with regard to the elections, of course. And keeping your cool when whole districts are without water and the city is up to its ears in garbage is no easy matter. Hardly anything is going to change after the elections either.
