According to Mikhas, the factions have been nicknamed the "weasels" and the "porcupines." Among the "weasels" are included party officials who disagree with Evert's allegedly "soft" opposition to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government. This group is not homogeneous, and encompasses extreme rightists such as ND deputy Kammenos, followers of former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis such as ND deputy Fani Palli-Petralia, and even a number of deputies who usually follow Evert's lead such as deputies Karatzaferis and Mikhaloliakos. The "weasel" faction's only common thread is hardline partisanship, defined by Mikhas as "protection of our own [ND] people." The "porcupine" faction, which includes ND luminary Andreas Andrianopoulos, is more dissatisfied with what it perceives to be a lack of goals and principles in Evert's policy. This faction criticizes the spirit of the new party leadership and the "language" it uses, which it views as "passe" and "boring." According to Mikhas, "porcupines" are above all concerned that Evert is leading the party to ideological marginalization. In the 14 December ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Yiannis Politis contends that ND opposition to Evert stems primarily from ideological differences. The free-market "liberal" faction headed by Andrianopoulos and former Minister of Finance Stefanos Manos openly disapproves of Evert's "popular capitalism" in which public companies remain in the hands of the state and his acceptance of "natural monopolies." A number of ND deputies also dissent from Evert's practice of "consensual politics" and would prefer a tougher stance against the government. Politis reports that one of these deputies, former Minister of Interior Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, never misses an opportunity to criticize Evert. An important source of intraparty discontent is Evert's refusal to discuss the reasons for the ND's defeat in the last parliamentary elections, Politis writes. The strongest internal attack against Evert, however, was the accusation leveled by former Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhalis Papakonstandinou that the ND leader had failed to promote Greek interests on the Skopje/Macedonia issue during his first European appearance in Brussels. Evert's reaction to the accusation was swift, Politis reports. Papakonstandinou was stripped of all party functions and prerogatives. The move is seen as an attempt to squelch intraparty opposition and to abort the rise of contesting factions within the ND.
