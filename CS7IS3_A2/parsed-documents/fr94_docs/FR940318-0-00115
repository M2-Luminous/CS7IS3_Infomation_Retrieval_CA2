FR940318-0-00115 FR940318-0-00023 D. Response to Public Comment A document summarizing public comment on the NPRM in greater detail is available in the public docket supporting this final rule. The major programmatic issues raised by the commenters and the Agency's response to them are described below. Major comments specific to the eight SNAP industry sectors are addressed in sections IX.D. through IX.K. of this final rule. 1. Scope of the SNAP Rule a. Class II substances. One commenter supported EPA's position that the Agency has the authority to review class II substances under SNAP, particularly EPA's view that where little reduction in ozone depletion potential (ODP) can be gained in going from a class I substance to a class II substance, such as from methyl chloroform to HCFC&hyph;141b, the substitution should be disallowed under SNAP. Other commenters criticized this position, arguing that the omission of any reference to class II substitutes in section 612(e) clearly indicated Congressional intent that class II substitutes not be subject to the SNAP program. For this final rule, the Agency is including class II substances under the scope of SNAP. The Agency disagrees with one commenter's interpretation of the limitation in section 612(e). Section 612(c) specifically mandates that the Agency list unacceptable and acceptable alternatives for class I or II substances. In addition, the Agency believes that Congressional intent under section 612 is to reduce the overall risk from the continued use of ozone depleting substances (ODSs). The class II substances range in ozone depletion potential (ODP) from 0.11 for HCFC&hyph;141b to 0.02 for HCFC&hyph;123. In the evaluation of substitutes completed for the NPRM, use of some class II substitutes up to the time of their phaseout was identified as representing significantly greater overall risk than use of other alternatives available for a number of end-uses. Consequently, the Agency believes lower overall risk to human health and the environment can be achieved by including class II substitutes in SNAP. Despite the limitation in section 612(e) to producers of class I substances, EPA believes it has authority under section 114 and section 301(a) to require submission of SNAP notifications with respect to class II substances as necessary to enable EPA to carry out its obligation under section 612 to evaluate both class I and class II substances, as explained in the NPRM. b. Review of existing versus new substitutes. A number of commenters believed that EPA's SNAP program has no authority to restrict existing substitutes, which companies may have switched to in an effort to eliminate the use of CFCs prior to the publication of this final rule. Arguments in support of this position include the prospective language of the statute, which says EPA must make it ``unlawful to replace'' an ODS with a substitute deemed unacceptable. Many of these commenters recommended grandfathering of these existing uses, so as not to disrupt industry's transition away from ODSs. An extension of this concern appears in several comments, in which commenters expressed the fear that SNAP will revisit prior decisions, removing substitutes previously deemed acceptable as newer and more environmentally benign substitutes are developed. Under the Agency's interpretation of section 612, in order to fulfill the Congressional mandate to review ``any'' substitute substance that may present adverse effects to human health and the environment, both new and existing substitutes must be included under SNAP. In addition, section 612(e) specifically requires notifying the Agency before new or existing chemicals are introduced into interstate commerce. EPA believes that class I and II substances are ``replaced'' within the meaning of section 612(c) each time a substitute is used, so that once EPA identifies an unacceptable substitute, any future use of such substitute is prohibited. Under any other interpretation, EPA could never effectively prohibit the use of any substitute, as some user could always start to use it prior to EPA's completion of the rulemaking required to list it as unacceptable. EPA believes Congress could not have intended such a result, and must therefore have intended to cover future use of existing substitutes. c. Grandfathering in SNAP. Many commenters supported the idea of grandfathering uses of existing substitutes, but felt that the grandfathering should be broadened to include existing uses of all substitutes which companies have invested in prior to the promulgation of the SNAP final rule, and not just HCFC&hyph;141b as proposed in the NPRM. Commenters argued that not doing so would delay transition by creating uncertainty about the useful life of alternatives. One commenter argued that the grandfathering scheme EPA has proposed with respect to HCFC&hyph;141b should be extended to existing uses of perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The commenter notes that title VI calls for regulation and elimination of ozone-depleting substances while in the commenter's opinion precluding regulation based on global warming potential. Since PFCs have no ozone depletion potential, the commenter argued that they are a better candidate than HCFC&hyph;141b for grandfathering. One commenter proposed two years past the date of an unacceptability determination as the general grandfathering period.
