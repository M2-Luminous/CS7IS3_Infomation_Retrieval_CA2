Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis has confirmed that military cooperation continues under the agreement signed by Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur with the Slovak defense minister last October 1993. Laszlo Gardai reports on the details. [Begin recording] [Gardai] [passage omitted] I asked the Slovak defense minister what are the chances of a political turn in the relations of the two countries in his view, and what kind of steps would be necessary to be taken by the two sides. [Kanis in Slovak with superimposed Hungarian translation] A more civilized political conduct is required than the one we had so far. It applies to both Slovak and foreign politicians. It would be important that the small countries established on the territories of former federations give up nationalism. Nationalism implies isolation in this region. Slovakia will be open in the future, and we will devote special attention to the cooperation between the member states of the Visegrad Four, the Slovak defense minister said. [end recording]
