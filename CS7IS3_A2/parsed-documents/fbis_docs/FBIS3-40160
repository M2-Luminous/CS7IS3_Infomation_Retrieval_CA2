On the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Mao Zedong"] [Text] This subject is a very large one, but we don't have to go into it at great length. At first glance, it seems that we are talking about the achievements and faults of Mao Zedong, but actually we are discussing our predicament as Chinese people, and the causes. To use the oft-repeated formula, currently popular among the masses on the mainland, we can speak of "the inveterate evil-mindedness" and the "vileness" of the Chinese. For the last hundred years, or since even more remote times, our several hundreds of millions of fellow countrymen definitely have been living in hellish misery. Not only has food and clothing been a problem, but even minimal human rights could not be guaranteed. To describe it in colloquial language, "the rich and powerful didn't treat us poor folks like human beings"; but, in fact, were the rich and powerful treated like human beings? They themselves had no such expectation, so slavish formulas like "I wish to labor like a dog or a horse" were fashionable politenesses, and remained in common use for a long time. In a country as large as China, were there no men? There is more. Starting two thousand years ago, with the first time that a totalitarian and despotic dynasty was overthrown, wise men have continually appeared in China, and sounded the clarion call of human rights. Their slogans and ideals were of various kinds, but they had one thing in common, and that was the demand that farmers and convicts, who were at the lowest strata of society, be treated as equals. "Are there any noblemen, or generals or great officials, who are worth anything?" The problem of food and clothing was of secondary importance. They were not things to be received as a matter of course; they had to be won through the effort of each individual. Only under the system of slavery, under feudalism, did people receive food and clothing, or get treated like human beings, as a matter of course. But people are not ordinary animals. What they demand first is to be treated like human beings, by others, and by themselves. To use the expression that is in vogue right now, they demand, first of all, that their human rights be guaranteed, not that they be treated merely as "domestic animals that can talk" or as "tame implements" to be cared for and ordered about. Therefore, it was only the clarion calls of the wise and brave men of successive ages that enabled the people to unite in vast numbers and achieve great things. Mao Zedong and his comrades (or at least a considerable portion of them) were wise and brave men of just this kind. Their slogans combined many foreign ideals and were the most alluring promises in history. How could the people, so crushed under the weight of suffering that they could not draw a breath, and muddled into bewilderment for generations by their rules, not revere him as a living bodhisattva? This is why a great savior comes to be; not because he does good things for the people, but because the people impatiently expected him to do good things for them. Placing hopes in a great savior is an ignorant fantasy, but still it cannot be called "the inveterate evil-mindedness" of a "villain." Everyone has the right to struggle for, and then to achieve, a happy life. This is also a fundamental human right. If there is any "vileness," then it lies in the pervasive conditioning, of several thousand years of despotic culture, and in the psychological tendency of small producers toward narrowness and short-sighted greed, which makes them content to accept, and be satisfied with, a "great savior." They do not want to think about "different political views" anymore, nor do they want to apply themselves anymore, to thought or action; they don't want to take risks, and think "cunningly" that, after nature has grown the fruit for them, they can then sit idle and enjoy the harvest. Therefore, they instinctively assist the "great savior" to seize power, and consolidate his dictatorial, despotic regime; in reality, they are solely responsible for building the despotic regime that oppresses and exploits them. The so-called "new authoritarianism" and "old Fascism," are nothing more than a modern version of small farmer ideology. Not only Mao Zedong, but all the great saviors of successive dynasties and eras, naturally acted out the ugly side of human nature in full measure, as soon as they were raised to be dictators. Selfishness, greed, cruelty -- these evils of human nature, that show up even in children, but are restrained by the social environment, reach almost their extreme limit in every dictator. This is because dictators are not subject to the restraint of the social environment, and possess omnipotent power offered up to them by the people in their delusion. It is just like plants and animals, that, once freed of environmental constraints, will multiply to the extreme, leading to an ecological disturbance. Once the social ecology is disturbed this will lead to an extreme expansion of government power and a pernicious growth in bureaucratism. Therefore, once the attempt is made to realize in practice, in society, the blessings of despotism under "great saviors and just rulers," as fantasized in small-farmer socialism, then small farmers themselves will become its greatest victims, and it will also bring disaster to all other strata of society. Small farmers and small producers (including "intellectuals"), are of all groups the most powerless to protect their members in society. All they can do, in the face of heavy oppression, is to beg the oppressors to take pity on them, or else, in addition to that, to betray others who are also oppressed, in return for "rights" under an ever-worsening state of life. Moreover, from this is produced a "vileness with Chinese characteristics:" They give their most revolting flattery to those who oppress and exploit them most fiercely, but they break the head of anyone who is brave enough to come forward on their behalf, and cry out against the wrongs done to them. In this way, they ingratiate themselves with those who are sucking their blood. This curious and outlandish trait of their character came out, in its most typical form, and most plainly, during the Mao Zedong era, and especially during the Cultural Revolution. This is the greatest tragedy of a great people, and it is also a tragedy for the dictators themselves. If the people, in their delusion, had not raised them up to be gods, would they not have become better people? The life of Mao Zedong is a tragedy of this kind, that will make a person wring his hands and sigh. Nowadays, some people are nostalgic about Mao Zedong. Actually, they are nostalgic for the honest government of that time (which at least proves that Mao sincerely tried to be a good person). They absolutely are not nostalgic for the excesses and poverty of that time, and still less do they "ardently love despotic socialism." When some people in official positions seize on this subject, to put over their own ideas, it means they have an ulterior motive. Don't they envy that god-like, absolute power? At least, it gave quicker results than the "new authoritarianism." It is not impossible that they might take advantage of the prevailing climate to launch a new deification movement. But, regrettably, history does not retrace its steps, and circumstances change as time goes by. A new deification movement might end in a farce, and the gods might turn into buffoons. Let us wait and see.
