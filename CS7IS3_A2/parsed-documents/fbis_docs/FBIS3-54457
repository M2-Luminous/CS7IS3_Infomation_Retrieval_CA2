This was divulged by Energy and Infrastructure Minister Moshe Shahal, who added that the reactor slated for Israel was one of several power stations developed by a Swiss company and the German Government and $10 billion had already been invested in the project. The environmentalists claim these power stations are not safe. According to Shahal Israel will wait for a clean and safe nuclear technology to be developed before it establishes a nuclear power station. Mr. Shahal made these remarks in the International Conference for Nuclear Sciences in Tel Aviv.
