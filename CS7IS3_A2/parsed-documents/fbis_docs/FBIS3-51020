I want to know your opinion on the present development of the People's Councils in Cuba in terms of problem solving at each locality, each province. [Alarcon] I believe the People's Councils in general are attaining highly positive results. They also are becoming a path, a strategy -- that of the people's participation; the people's participation in the search for solutions to their own problems; the people's participation in the real and full exercise of the government which can only be achieved at the base level. I believe that many and diverse initiatives and experiences exist, depending on the place, the nature of the situation, and the characteristics of the region. It is more evident each day that the People's Council is an effective instrument of government from the base, of control over the administration, resources, and the entire effort which the nation has to conduct. It also is an effective tool to stimulate the insertion of the people into the activities of the people's government, the activities of the nation and government of our country. I am not saying that we have reached the final alternative. We are making progress. We have to insist that the People's Councils have to conduct all their activities keeping this essential strategy in mind. Their essential strategy is to channel the people's initiatives, channel the masses's work from the base in order to exert a positive control on the entire society; also, to stimulate, develop, and strengthen all the creative potential of our people toward the solution of the problems we confront today. [Batista] However, does a People's Council at the base have the conditions to undertake these responsibilities, these tasks we are saying they have to pursue? [Alarcon] Through the people. If we were to see the People's Councils work as the endeavor of its presidents, we would be asking too much from those comrades. The People's Council president is nothing more than a district delegate elected by other delegates as their president. In Havana itself, I have seen several experiences during progress report meetings in which I have participated where the neighbors, many times at the suggestion of the president of the People's Council, have established work committees or groups; neighbors who form a health committee, an education committee, a committee to oversee food or services issues, etc. In other words, the president of the People's Council has the support, the real participation of voters, of citizens who help in performing these tasks. It would be impossible for a single person to truly discharge these responsibilities. He has a basic responsibility, that of guiding, that of exerting his authority as an elected official of the voters, and of the delegates as president of the People's Council. In the measure that he manages to insert the people, the neighbors on a daily, real, and practical basis, he can fulfill these tasks. No one knows all the things we might yet do, in the measure that the people truly undertake this method of government as their own. This is something we have to understand. It is very new: the true conduit of democracy. Democracy is the authority of the people. True democracy is that which promotes, in the measure possible, more and more each day, the direct participation of the people in their government. We can do this, first of all, because we have a social system based on equity, human solidarity, and human fraternity. These are the goals and ethical ideals of our social system -- a society free of exploitation, free of the rule of a minority over the majority of the people. Therefore, we have the social base to develop these forms of participation in the management of the society. This is not achieved overnight. Earlier, we discussed financial issues. These are complex and difficult issues but in the measure that we progress and study, we can manage and understand these problems better. There are many other things that can be done on the basis of this essential principle. This is not a case of the people and the government working apart, not a case of the people and the state working apart. Our system, not by chance, is called a people's government. It will have authority and be powerful and effective in the measure it is truly of the people. It is of the people due to its political character, due to what it seeks, because it works for the benefit of the people. However, we have to make it more of the people through the real participation of the people in the system. [Batista] Regarding your answer, I wanted to express my opinion because there are truly many people who believe that the people's government, as an institution, does not solve many problems at the base. Therefore, perhaps all this has to do with the mechanisms, or problems with resources, or, at times, a matter of method, or that the government mechanisms are not understood in terms of public health or education. This is why I was asking this type of question regarding the operations, mechanisms, solutions, resources, and possibilities of the government in each region to solve and confront the problems. [Alarcon] There are problems in our national reality that do not have solutions today, for example, everything related to material resources. However, there is another dimension to this problem, that which sees the people on one side and their representatives on the other. This has to do with the concept we have of progress report meetings. There was a period in which, to a certain measure -- I do not want to generalize, it was not the same everywhere -- it was an occasion for the voters to make their suggestions, to express their complaints to the delegate and then wait for an answer from that delegate. On more than one occasion, when ones analyses a good part of the problems brought up at the base, you realize that the problems do not relate to efforts the delegates have to make at higher levels, but to issues that can be solved by the people themselves. This is a right of the people -- that of organizing and acting, of taking their initiatives and channelling their collective efforts. The role of the delegates ought to be that of directing the pertinent effort to solve everything possible at that level. We have to abandon that passive attitude, that view of the voters as passive objects. We have to see the voter as the subject, the main subject of our system of government. When you see yourselves in that manner, when we see ourselves collectively in that manner, we find that some of the issues brought to the delegates to be solved by them, can be solved or improved by us. I am not saying that is the case in every instance. Of course, there are daily problems we all face related to the shortages of resources. However, how many difficulties are born in our minds, how many limitations have to do with our passivity, our refusal to be creative. This is a system whose main goal ought to be the development of the creative potential of the masses. It is a system which deep down is based on something Fidel has said many times, about turning the trust in the people, in their values, pride, and will into a concrete political and daily phenomenon. This is the essence of the work of the people's government at the base, and from the base up through the entire system. [Batista] What also happens is that I have seen government bodies that do not give any support or help to the municipal delegates. I believe this affects the prestige of that individual and the possibilities for the people to trust him, because one is trusted in the measure that one solves or gives appropriate answers. Otherwise, what one says is not believed. [Alarcon] That is true. Unfortunately, this is one reality our delegates have to confront, particularly in certain places. I would say this exists more so in big cities than in small communities. This is why we see such rich experiences in certain People's Councils which are not attained in places where the delegates confront more complex situations. I also believe that this is part of the necessary struggle that the entire system must confront, not only the delegate and the base. This is why the People's Council becomes a support system for that delegate. A higher level, the municipal assembly, must also play an active role, and so does the National Assembly. However, the people must also do so. The delegate might find perhaps misunderstanding, bureaucratic red tape, inertia, or lack of care, but those people must know that the delegate is truly working for the people. [Batista] Alarcon, there have also been cases of delegates who have been dismissed by the voters for shortcomings or poor performance? [Alarcon] I believe so. I know of some cases in which, perhaps due to shortcomings or other criteria, the delegate also believes he is not up to the task and asks to be replaced. There have been changes in the people's government at the base. I know of some even at the municipal level. I believe we should see this as a very healthy sign, a very natural thing which should not be seen in critical terms or as chaos. I believe is it only natural. They are representatives of the people, people from among the people, and it might happen that sometimes their possibilities become exhausted or they reach the limit of their capabilities. The people must exert their right to elect another individual. I believe this is one of the virtues of our system. Much is said abroad about great democratic systems where the people have the worst opinion of a an elected deputy and yet have to wait four or six years to elect another demagogue. This is why it is so important that several principles be fully implemented in our system: close ties between the voter and those elected -- provincial and base- level delegates; and periodic progress reports. The essential part of both mechanisms is to make people feel increasingly they are part of the system, rather than feeling foreign to it. The system is not foreign to the people. On the contrary, the people are an integral part of the people's government system.
