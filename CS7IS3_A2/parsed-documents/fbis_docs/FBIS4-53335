The group landed at Nayoka on Etorofu on Sunday morning and stayed at the houses of local residents. Bad weather forced the cancellation of events scheduled for Monday before departing for Nemuro. The mission included 24 former residents of the island and nine members involved in a campaign for the return to Japan of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. A similar Japanese group visited Kunashiri earlier this month under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. It was the first group of the year to travel to the disputed islands. A Russian group visited Hokkaido in April. The four islands were seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.
