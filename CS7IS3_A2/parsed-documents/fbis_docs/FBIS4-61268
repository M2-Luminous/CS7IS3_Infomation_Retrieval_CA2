Was any progress made? [Ioseliani] I did not see that any particular progress was made. There was too much beating around the bush. I would say that the Abkhazian side does not hold a specific position. However, we presented a number of constructive proposals. The demands presented by the Abkhazians are unrealistic and not viable. The one thing that can be viewed as a positive result is that the Abkhazians have finally become convinced that there cannot be a so-called independent Abkhazia. Even the most reactionary-minded separatist leaders have finally realized this and come to terms with it. They are now dashing about, trying to find a way out of the situation and think up some form or another so that they can run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, as they say. Our aim is to activate the peacekeeping forces so that they move into the conflict zone. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Peacekeeping forces from which state would be the most welcome for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia? [Ioseliani] We have several options at our disposal today. The United Nations, the CSCE, and so forth have become involved in this matter. I believe the ideal option would be to bring in Russian peacekeeping troops under UN command. I have in mind high command, UN jurisdiction. This option is good for us, good for Russia, and good for the whole world. All this is realistic, provided that there is no clash of interests between the UN and Russian sides. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Can one say that the most important thing at the negotiations was the question of the return of the refugees? [Ioseliani] All questions were decided on an equal level, as should be. As for the question of the status of Abkhazia, all is clear on this score. We agree to all the conditions and do not intend to restrict the Abkhazians in any way, something that, incidentally, we have never done. However, there is one condition: Maintaining the territorial integrity of Georgia -- this is the most important thing. One should not forget that the Georgian people have never been vindictive. Georgia has always been famous for its amazing ability to get along with people of different nationalities. This is a brilliant quality that our people have. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] You will, of course, agree that, in today's conditions and specifically regarding the question of settlement in Abkhazia, it is very important for Georgia how world opinion and, in particular, Russia views us. Nonetheless, as we have learned, it is precisely in Russia that there has recently developed a negative attitude toward Georgia. Many, in particular member of Parliament Tengiz Kitovani [former defense minister], explain this as enmity toward the head of state. [Ioseliani] This is not the case. Some people like someone, others do not. This is a superficial judgment. Perhaps there are those within Kitovani's circle who, being aware of his strained relations with the head of state, deliberately state things in this way. Such a view can be explained by the fact that many shortsighted politicians in Russia blame Shevardnadze for destroying the empire. They do not understand that the empire could have met with a far more terrible fate. Having returned to the track of normal development, Russia has embarked upon the path of democracy. Intelligent people in Russia have a fairly good view of Georgia. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] We cannot fail to ask you about your brainchild, the "Mkhedrioni" [former legally sanctioned paramilitary group that was incorporated into the Rescue Corps]. What fate has befallen it? [Ioseliani] The "Mkhedrioni" as such does not exist. There is the Rescue Corps, whose members have become assimilated into the structures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]. In my view, this should lead to some constructive changes in the work of this staid department. Our MVD is the real Soviet Union. It reminds me of a prehistoric machine that is useless. Work there is conducted according to the old traditional principles. Some of our lads were not taken on, having been rejected as unsuitable. You see, some people's fathers had in the past been put on trial. One can imagine that those who are sitting there and taking bribes have more right to work in these structures. In short, you should remember that new wine cannot be kept in old bottles. These have to be changed. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] As we have learned, members of the Rescue Corps are now involved in the exchange of prisoners and the bodies of the dead on the Inguri Bridge. Who is controlling their activities? [Ioseliani] Yes, our lads who fought in Abkhazia are well in control of the situation. Therefore, they were included in the Commission for the Exchange of Prisoners that is headed by Paata Zakareishvili. I control their activities. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you have any information on the results, if there are any, of the investigation into the series of murders of "Mkhedrioni" members? [Ioseliani] As yet, I know nothing. There exist many versions. Although both the security services and MVD and the Procurator's Office are dealing with these matters, I do not see any results. Some of these murders were carried out in such a professional manner that I suspect the involvement of state structures or the international mafia in them. However, the knot will eventually be unraveled....
