Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN ["Exclusive" interview with former Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios by SIEMPRE! General Director Beatriz Pages Rebollar; place and date not given: "In Light of Mexico's Difficult Transition, `A Political Agreement Is Necessary'"] [Text] In light of a confused and tense national scenario marked by an armed uprising that on 1 January shook the foundations of the system and in light of the confrontation between the three most important presidential candidates and the clouds of violence that may unleash their fury following the 21 August federal elections, SIEMPRE! set out to find a serene thought capable of untangling the puzzling scenario left from the latest events. Fernando Gutierrez Barrios broke his customary silence and decided to speak about the most sensitive topics of the moment: guerrillas, elections, democracy, political parties, negotiations in Chiapas, social peace, crisis in the system, participation of the clergy in politics, and the controversial personality of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. With his prudent but also energetic style, Fernando defined concepts, marked routes, and warned about the dangers that may affect the country's stability if no serious political agreement is reached with all national forces, "not only with the parties, but also the different representative organizations that take part in Mexico's life." A man of institutions, principles, and values and a man of unquestionable moral righteousness and deep nationalism, Gutierrez Barrios commented and made remarks with the authority bestowed upon him by his vast knowledge of the Mexican political system. "Beatriz, before starting this interview," Fernando Gutierrez Barrios explained, "I first wish to thank you for your kind presence here, as well as for giving me the opportunity to have an open and cordial dialogue with a person whom I respect and admire. I am at your disposal." [Pages] Fernando, what are, in your opinion, the elements that characterize the Zapatist National Liberation Army compared to other guerrilla movements in Latin America? [Gutierrez] To answer your question, one would have to analyze in detail different Latin American societies in each historical period and later understand the specific conditions of the guerrillas. The armed struggle in the form of guerrillas has an old tradition in Latin America which dates back to even before the Cuban Revolution which, due to its proximity, is the most well-known. All guerrilla movements had varied ideological inspiration, ranging from radical liberals to nationalists to even Marxists. Cuban revolutionary theory, the best example of which was Ernesto "Che" Guevara, can be summarized in a few points. First, "armed struggle" as the only way to reach power; second, "continental" projection of the revolution due to the similarity of "objective conditions" in Latin American countries; third, the socialist character of the revolution; fourth, the thesis that peasants, and not the working class, were the segment of society with higher revolutionary potentiality; and fifth, the concept of a vanguard composed of intellectuals, professionals, and students. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), where father Camilo Torres briefly served, acted with that same orientation. We must also mention that the Poor People's Guerrilla Army of Guatemala is also of Cuban inspiration and also includes Indians in its ranks. The other Guatemalan guerrilla group: Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA) also placed great emphasis on the Indians. The leading guerrilla movements of the late sixties and seventies separated themselves from Cuban theory, especially by focusing on nationalism rather than socialism as well as by their urban origin and influence. The 19 April Movement [M-19] of Colombia, the Montoneros of Argentina, the Tupamaros of Uruguay, the National Liberation Army of Carlos Marighella of Brazil, famous for his Minimanual of the Urban Guerrillas, are examples. The first two groups -- the M-19 and the Montoneros -- have in common that they are organized by populist forces and struggled for a true democracy as their main demand. The Sandinist National Liberation Front of Nicaragua ruled the country as the government after its victory, and today it is acting within the framework of democracy. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of El Salvador, after the peace agreements, is seeking power through elections today. Finally, we must mention the Shining Path, a unique Peruvian organization, which despite the serious defeats it has sustained, continues to harass the government. The ones I have mentioned are only a few of the nearly 100 guerrilla movements in Latin America from the days of Carlos Prestes in Brazil in the 1920's to now. You can, therefore, see that the elements that must be analyzed are extensive. The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army" has taken heterogeneous elements from the aforementioned experiences, and its unprecedented character consists of the way it reunites these experiences. The overwhelming Indian presence shows an identification with the Guatemalan movements, and the emphasis placed on democratic demands, social justice, and land ownership as well as its flexible ideological inclinations, identifies it with the M-19 and the Montoneros. The spectacular actions, on the other hand -- bearing in mind the difference of scenarios -- identify it with those of the Tupamaros and the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] of Chile. The participation and influence of certain sectors linked to the Church is an element that coincides with those of certain groups from El Salvador -- especially the FPL [Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces] -- Colombia, and Argentina. In sum they are carrying the banner of poverty, ideological syncretism, and of the work to persuade Indian communities, as well as the skillful use of psychological warfare and its expression in political propaganda. As for their military capability, it appears to be reduced and limited to a certain geographical area. Their activities are conducted with the tactic of guerrilla focus. That is why it is not accurate to establish a mechanical analogy with other Latin American movements. [Pages] What is your opinion of the government's reaction with regard to the guerrillas? Was it not paralyzed at the beginning? [Gutierrez] A fundamental element of the guerrillas is the element of surprise. If the guerrillas lose the initiative to attack where it is most advisable for them, it will not proceed according to its own nature. It is evident that they took advantage of this element in addition to the skillful use of information and psychological warfare, as well as its effects on national and international public opinion. We should be pleased to see that the government's response was one of great maturity. Prudence and composure and civilized dialogue instead of the temptation to harden the government's positions and react violently prevailed. The government declared a unilateral cease-fire, an amnesty was offered, and cabinet changes were made without demands being made. Even though what has happened is the result of an accumulation of unsolved problems, mistakes were honestly recognized, the state's governor was changed, multiparty commissions were created, and the National Human Rights Commission, in the fulfillment of its duties, visited the area of conflict. They have all been political solutions of conciliation. A peace commission for Chiapas was even appointed. The president of the Republic held a dialogue in Tuxtla Gutierrez with the leaders of the different ethnic groups. This is how the government has irreproachably responded within the framework of the state of law by supporting the actions of the Mexican Army and avoiding situations of armed pressure against the country's institutions given that the political times of the end of the current six-year period and the proximity of the federal elections could be used against the government both by the guerrillas themselves as well as by heterogeneous groups, which, stimulated by the presence of the so-called "Zapatist army," could try to take advantage of the opportunity to make innumerable demands through different forms of pressure. [Pages] Don't you think that the big loser in this conflict has been the Army? [Gutierrez] The Army is strictly carrying out the orders it receives as stated in the Constitution. It is undeniable that circumstances have been difficult. Efforts have been made to irresponsibly discredit the Army. The Army went from being attacked to being the aggressor, with the obvious manipulation of ideological change, which is another form of propaganda of ideological warfare. The National Army is an exemplary institution with a revolutionary and popular origin. Its sacrifice and service to the Republic, inseparable in its role as guarantor of the country's sovereignty, cannot be questioned by an obviously biased campaign of discredit. The Mexican Army has once again proven its serenity, maturity, discipline, and institutionalism. [Pages] What would be the alternatives for solving the conflict in Chiapas? [Gutierrez] I think that the ideal solution would be a dignified negotiation for both sides. Priority attention must be given to the just and reasonable demands made by the rebels who must end this conflict by turning over their weapons. There can be no ambiguities on this point. If a serious, just, and dignified negotiation cannot be conducted because of dogmatic intransigence, the problem would prolong itself, most certainly, until 21 August came with elections subjected to a perverse pressure. If law and order is not restored in that area of the country and the conflict continues, it will be a negative burden on the electoral process, the transfer of power, and the country's tranquility. [Pages] How do you think violence in Chiapas will affect the upcoming electoral process? [Gutierrez] Objectively speaking, no one can deny that the country was upset, as was the political situation. Worried about Chiapas, the social forces demand a clean electoral process and thus new reforms to Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures, something that will certainly be accomplished during the special period of sessions. Psychologically, citizens have been subjected to different influences. A large portion of the population has been affected as to their political preference. Citizens will study their vote more carefully. Consequently, it is important that the parties and their candidates face social problems through more updated, redeeming, and honest speeches. It is indispensable to have more social sensitivity and political keenness. The citizens have been exposed to unpredictable reactions, caused by actions that are foreign to them, such as that which occurred in Chiapas, and which move them to profound meditation. [Pages] How do you view the panorama of political parties? [Gutierrez] Politics, it has been said, is the art of the possible, but it is an art of imagination to see beyond what is immediate. Political parties are going through a crisis of representation and credibility throughout the world. This is evident in the voters' rejection and abstention. I think that political speeches must be better drafted, making them more accessible, specific, and comprehensible. Today's Mexicans deserve to be spoken to with a simple language of great truths, respecting their intelligence and dignity. Old formulas must be pushed aside, alliances must be sought, the political space must be widened, and we must include, not exclude. This must be done here and now. Those with the lowest standard of living and the worst jobs require special attention. I think that it must be emphasized that without social justice and commitment to specific situations, democracy becomes an abstraction without any relation to the country, the social sector, or the people of flesh and blood. We must take care of those who have not as well as the middle class, because the delicate balance between order and freedom cannot be subjected to the dangerous extremes of opulence and misery. [Pages] What specifically is your opinion of the PRI? [Gutierrez] As a member of the party, although somewhat distanced from active politics, I would venture to say that because of the strength of its structures and traditional organization, the PRI has managed to reach the people and maintain its position as a ruling party. The great civic awakening among the people, however, has affected it. No longer can a candidate to any given office be selected arbitrarily, either because of friendship or popularity. Dialogue has replaced monologue. Within this new open and pluralist society -- a society whose influence is becoming increasingly strong -- the PRI defines its ideals by nurturing itself from the ever-present principles of the Mexican Revolution. These are the principles that identify the party and its supporters; these principles comprise its raison d'etre. The pluralist society, which is ever more knowledgeable and critical, has taught us hard lessons through its credibility, honesty, and knowledge of reality. Nowadays, in order to win we must first convince the voters, because votes do indeed count and are indeed counted. As I said before, nowadays we need dynamic, open campaigns -- campaigns that challenge the people, address the problems that grieve us, and offer solutions. We must continue to consult the people on a broad in-depth basis to enable them to express their social concerns, make their demands, and, consequently, receive an answer. This is the new policy. It is consistent with our times and with the current circumstances. I believe the PRI will have to reaffirm its doctrine; strengthen its organizations, rank-and-file, and electoral structures; and basically revitalize its convictions and winning spirit to effectively support its candidates and lead them to victory. Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio is carrying out an enthusiastic campaign in which he is giving all of himself. It is a dynamic campaign, consistent with the current circumstances and with the political, economic, and social requirements of the specific stage the country is in. His proposals as outlined in his speeches have received a warm welcome among the people -- especially those regarding PRI autonomy and the reform of power, which is understood to be a greater balance among various powers, as well as those that address social justice, sovereignty, human rights, democracy, and freedom with respect for the Constitution and the laws of the state. [Pages] What is your opinion of the candidates from the other parties? [Gutierrez] I know all of the candidates, because I met some while I was interior secretary and others some years before that during my long political career. All deserve my greatest respect, whether or not I agree with their political positions. They are all good Mexicans who think of the higher values and interests of the nation before their personal or partisan interests. Despite their political differences, they all agree that democracy, and not violence, is what can bring about change with stability, change with social justice and freedom, and change that should emanate from society itself. [Pages] There are three candidates from three, let us say, strong political parties, who will face each other in the presidential race. In general terms, what does each one represent to the nation? [Gutierrez] They represent a historic opportunity. Partisan institutions are the expression of democracy. They will have to debate with civility and discuss the alternatives and programs each contender has to offer. Mexico gains by this. Debate is the best way to put the strength of any political party's ideals to the test. The Mexico of today comprises a pluralistic society that brings together various ideologies and trends represented by the different political parties. The unchanging nature of democracy is that the majority rules, but the minorities also have their place in the country's everyday life. That is the country's future. [Pages] What is your view regarding the role played by the media in the elections? [Gutierrez] The media are the loyal conveyors of the political situation. The media will play a pivotal role in the 1994 electoral process. They will allow society to obtain information on the candidates, their programs, and leadership capabilities. That is exactly what the new Mexico implies. Once more, the media's responsibility will be decisive, and this can only be achieved in a country such as ours, where freedom of expression is respected. [Pages] The opposition has indicated that there could be a popular uprising if the election results are not respected. What do you think about violence? [Gutierrez] I am convinced that social peace is based on respect for the individual, life, and liberty, without allowing the exercise of our rights to impinge on other people's rights. The Mexican people reject violence. No one can live amid anarchy and chaos just as peace cannot be imposed with authoritarian measures. The Mexican Government, in addition to the legal norms that rule the institutions, wields one of the best weapons: dialogue, reason, and law, because moving away from it would be the worst path to follow. The political parties, even with their ideological differences and their projects, have a common goal -- to achieve the advancement of Mexico and the benefit of the majorities as well as to preserve the de jure state. Even when the debates are at times harsh, which is normal considering the emotions political campaigns can stir, today a higher level of maturity on the part of the parties and society as a whole is perceived. This higher maturity, combined with a respect for electoral laws and the individual right to vote, will lead to a peaceful transfer of power. [Pages] Do you believe that what has been called the Mexican political system is still in effect? [Gutierrez] The Mexican political system is still in effect; it is on its own a revolutionary project and not a rhetorical abstraction. It constitutes a project that includes all political trends -- left, right, and center; professional groups from the social and business sectors; organizations of young people, women, and intellectuals; political parties; urban popular movements; and so on, all of whom participate in the political arena in the manner they deem most appropriate. It is fundamental to point out that all of the country's political parties have freedom of expression. No one is denied the right to fight for Mexico. We are not a monolithic society. The revolution has given birth to several trends, and it welcomes those who represent them. Nevertheless, excessive pluralism is not desirable because it divides and ideologically confuses the population. I believe the course for Mexico is that of a moderate pluralism with the respectful coexistence of our current political and ideological groups so that they can contribute to the country's progress. [Pages] What is your view regarding the dialogue taking place in San Cristobal de las Casas? [Gutierrez] As I told you before, this dialogue is positive. A mature dialogue leads to peace and harmony. While a dialogue is held, the cannon remains silent, but what is important is to move from dialogue to negotiation. A negotiation could become stagnant if it lacks the will and understanding of all to seek solutions with honesty and realism. This stage is a civilized and worthwhile chance to find peace. The deliberate confusion between politics and the spiritual aspect must be avoided. The baseless presumption that the "Zapatist National Liberation Army" can be maintained as a pressure group until the August elections and is allowed, because of this, to assume a higher role than the de jure state to supervise the legality and the purity of the elections must be overcome through dialogue and negotiation. In turn, it is vital to separate the Chiapas conflict from the presidential elections; strive to make the latter trustworthy, convincing, and irreproachable; and prevent the post-electoral period from becoming troublesome. [Pages] According to the difficult times the country is experiencing, what should be next? [Gutierrez] It is difficult to state one's opinions when one is not responsible and, above all, does not have total and objective information of the national problems. However, the situation can be summed up in the following basic aspects: adequate and honorable negotiations with the "Zapatist army," a task aimed at strengthening what unites us all and the construction of better bridges between society and the government; a political agreement based on strong foundations accepted by all with the country's political forces, not just the parties, but the different representative organizations that participate in the country's life. [Pages] Regarding the clergymen's intervention in politics, which becomes more evident each passing day, and which you addressed as interior secretary, what is your viewpoint now? [Gutierrez] My opinion is the same. The important thing is that Mexican clergymen do not behave as clergymen do elsewhere on this continent, where their intervention and influence is key to government actions. That is why the wise decision of President Juarez separating church and state, leaving each sector with its legal and spiritual responsibilities, becomes important these days. [Pages] What is your opinion about the political personality of Manuel Camacho Solis and regarding his latest statements? [Gutierrez] Camacho Solis is fulfilling, as it has been said, the responsibility entrusted upon him by President Salinas to overcome the conflict in Chiapas. Regarding Camacho's political opinions, he made use of his freedom to express his ideas, as all Mexicans can do. However, at this moment what our country -- which is immersed in political confusion that generates financial instability and social problems such as poverty, sometimes extreme in some regions -- needs is to avoid useless confrontation, confusion, division, and skepticism. This will permit us to achieve peace and harmony among Mexicans, so as to preserve the political stability which is the foundation of our progress and development. [Pages] Which are the main issues that should be addressed in the next six-year term? [Gutierrez] Undoubtedly, the economic program of President Salinas has yielded satisfactory results, particularly insofar as the macroeconomic indicators. However, emphasis must be given to the social demands of poor sectors, without disregarding the fight against inflation, which has been successful. Emphasis must also be placed on continuing the economic reactivation to allow the broadening of the job base and offer decent jobs to all Mexicans. Without job opportunities, it would be illusory to think of social welfare. Another public general demand that must be heeded, because it is a priority, is public security, as well as protection of persons and properties. This necessarily entails an in-depth reform in the police corps, professionalizing them and making them really serve the community. Tied to the previous point, the fight against corruption in all its forms must be strengthened. Said forms of corruption range from corruption against citizens on the streets to the more complex forms such as inexplicable enrichments and inefficiency, which is another form of corruption. Within this framework, we must include the basic topics of social justice, health, education, justice administration and implementation, housing, and roads. To conclude, I would tell you that aware of the difficult problems the country is facing at this moment, Mexico has a challenge for the future but we must have confidence in our abilities and fundamentally human resources. It is evident that we have come a long way in the post-revolutionary decades, but we must be aware of the fact that there is still much to be done. The policy of paying the social debts we have with the have-nots in the country and the city must not be overlooked. However, we also know, without eluding responsibility for neglect or deficiencies, that it will be a long time before we can definitely resolve these long-time problems. The resources and the economic capacity of the Mexican State are limited and are subject to internal factors, among them demographic growth that demands each day more health centers, more schools, more housing, as well as external factors that do not depend on our will. [Pages] You once predicted the end of the era of the vertical power structure. Luis Donaldo Colosio is now proposing "a power reform." Is there compatibility? [Gutierrez] We agree on the need for change in the face of hegemonical ambitions and the complex social, political, and economic problems of our times. We are approaching the third millennium amid political, economic, and social convulsion in a world where something collapses and something else emerges each day. We are witnesses to ideological collapses, the presence of religious, ethnic, and nationalist fundamentalisms, and the birth of a globalization process from which we cannot separate ourselves. We will persist in maintaining our nationalism and on safeguarding our culture, traditions, customs, and identity. We must, however, realize that what is described as a paternalistic and centralized policy is a thing of the past. [Pages] The IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] recognized that the hegemony of the PRI was lost and that the alternation of power is feasible. What is your opinion? [Gutierrez] In fact, the end of the single party system was predicted. The end of the PRI's prevalence was also predicted. There are some people, however, who think the opposite based on the legacy of social peace and development achieved in its 65 years of life, without denying the failures and mistakes that were made. Let us view this as follows: alternation of power as mandated by electoral preference is as feasible and legitimate as the efforts [atigencia] that the PRI rank and file is making to adjust to a changing society. A PRI based on caudillo origins is not the same as a party that has adjusted to national mobility. That is precisely the key to its survival: nonparalyzation of its strategies and programs and its permanent attempts to adjust to national reality. [Pages] It is said that certain states of the republic are at the brink of social explosion. How can the discontent of the citizens be moderated? How have we failed? Is the government's prevalence over? [Gutierrez] An old saying on democracy by Francisco Bulnes [Mexican politician and sociologist] comes to mind. He said: "When people say at noon that night has come upon us, we must start turning on the street lamps." Today the country's transformation, the construction of the new Mexico, the Mexico of the 85 million citizens with its shortages that could lead us to desperation, makes us see the need for unity with equality that can bring about change with the participation of all political forces as well as the consolidation of a state in which solutions can be implemented without trauma, excesses, or any messianic role-playing. [Pages] The third millennium is approaching. The world has changed. What are the challenges for our country? [Gutierrez] The challenges are visible. Civil society, increasingly perceptive, marks the changes. In the social field, the demands are self-evident; in the political field, society demands an opening toward pluralism; and in the economic field, it demands the need to strengthen the well-being of our families to achieve development. The world is changing today. Mexico seeks to be consistent. We are moving along a difficult path that can be overcome with the observance of the law and with the support of dialogue and concerted effort. I believe that is the path. Our national fate is at stake. The best heritage of the nation should be based on stability with social peace, democracy, social justice, unity, harmony, and composure. It seems repetitive, but in Mexico we must change -- not in order to stop existing but to be better. [Pages] What can we expect from the 21 August elections with an increasing and violent opposition? [Gutierrez] Fatalism or manifest destinies do not function in Mexico. We do not expect the 21 August elections to be easy. We expect them to be intense and participatory. Today more than 40 million Mexicans have the right to vote and, without a doubt, it will be the best demonstration that democracy has been ratified. The electoral framework has been created, and political offers are visible. Now the important thing is to settle the electoral process through the polls and not through violence. Experience shows us that disorder and violence only benefit the hegemonic forces promoting backwardness. I am sure that social peace is based on respect for the human being, life, and freedom without the exercise of our rights having to adversely affect the rights of others.
