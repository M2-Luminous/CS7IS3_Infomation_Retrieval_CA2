The Defense Ministry of the Republic of Albania received official confirmation from the press secretary's office in the White House. In Presidential Act 94/18, dated 22 March 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton states: In continuance of prerogatives granted to me from Part 503-A of the Law on Foreign Assistance dated 1961, with amendments, and from Part 3-A, Article 1, of the Law on Control of Export of Arms, I define that the supply with articles and defense services for the Governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania will strengthen the security of the United States and encourage world peace. This decision by President Clinton is another expression of the successful development of relations between Albania and the United States and is a clear indication of the extension of close political, economic, and administrative relations, as well as those in the field of defense. This news has been welcomed by the military and all the Army staffs, as well as by the broad public of our people.
