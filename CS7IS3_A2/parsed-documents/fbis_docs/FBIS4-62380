PRAVDA's Owners Reprimand V. Linnik for Poor Work"] [Text] An incident occurred on the evening of 11 May in PRAVDA Chief Editor Aleksandr Ilin's office that was probably the first in the oldest Communist newspaper's 82-year existence. According to eyewitnesses, it all started with Viktor Linnik, appointed PRAVDA's chief by the court, accusing Ilin of attempting to improve his material position at the newspaper's expense. However Linnik's recriminations rebounded on him: Sokolenko, a spokesman for the Greeks on the editorial board, whom Ilin called as a witness, said that the owners do not pay the incumbent chief editor a kopek extra and Linnik himself, according to Sokolenko, as leader of PRAVDA, regularly received large amounts of hard currency from the Greeks (and there are allegedly receipts to prove it), but despite this he demanded more. After this Linnik attacked the Greeks' representative like an enraged bear, but he probably got more than he bargained for and following a brief scuffle was well and truly thrashed by his former employer. It is worthy of note that, despite this, PRAVDA published in the morning as always without a hitch.
