Vasilov, Biotekhnologiya Scientific Production Association, Moscow; UDC 577.175.444.083.3] [Abstract] Most immunoassay methods of determining thyroxin are based on polyclonal sera. In most cases, this does not present any problems with respect to specificity of the said antibodies. Problems do arise in cases of antisera with a low titer resulting from the presence of endogenous thyroxin in immunized animals. A portion of the binding centers on the antibodies with the highest affinity are then occupied by endogenous thyroxin. This is a common problem in obtaining antibodies to endogenous compounds that can be overcome by using monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to thyroxin with binding constants of 1.96 x 10[.sup]9[/] and 2.6 x 10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] for the high-affinity antibodies have been obtained in several laboratories. Monoclonal antibodies have now been obtained that have a binding constant of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. The new monoclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with keyhole limpet hemocyanin and thyroxin conjugate and then fusing spleen cells from the immunized mice with P3-X63-Ag8.653 mouse myeloma cells. Polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as a fusing agent. About 400 clones formed in one hybridization. The four highest-affinity monoclonal antibodies (9T, 1B7, 2E10, and 10F9) were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and partially characterized. The four monoclonal antibodies all manifested good binding with thyroxin, but they differed greatly from one another with respect to affinity to triiodothyronine. The hybridoma producing the said monoclonal antibodies grew well in ascites tumors. Antibodies were isolated from ascites by ion-exchange chromatography. According to gel-electrophoresis data, the ascites contained only one type of antibody, i.e., 1B7. 1B7 was determined to belong to the IgG1 subclass and to have a cross-reactivity with triiodothyronine of less than 1 percent and an affinity constant of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. Further studies to determine the possibility of using the new antibodies in immunoassay of thyroxin established that 8-aniline-1-naphthalenesulfate in rather high concentrations (0.05 percent) did not affect antibody-antigen binding. The calibration cure obtained for thyroxin measurement was linear in log coordinates at thyroxin concentrations of 10 to 400 ng/ml. Figures 4; references 8 (Russian).
