FR940831-2-00110 FR940831-2-00084 [Docket No. 50&hyph;423] Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;49, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (the licensee), for operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 3, located in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed amendment would grant a one-time change to the Action Statement for Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.5 of the Technical Specifications. The amendment would permit Millstone Unit No. 3 to remain in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4 while the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink is greater than 75 ○F for a 24 hour period for the months of August and September 1994. Exigent action is justified in order to permit the licensee to continue operations in the above mentioned Modes. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration (SHC), which is presented below: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. The proposed temporary change to the Action Statement of LCO 3.7.5 of the Millstone Unit No. 3 Technical Specifications will increase the time the plant may be in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the average water temperature of the ultimate heat sink greater than 75 ○F from 6 hours to 24 hours. The proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously analyzed. The probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased by a short term increase in the ultimate heat sink average water temperature. The probability of Condition IV accidents, as described in Chapter 15 of the FSAR, occurring in conjunction with the short duration increase in ultimate heat sink average water temperature above 75 ○F is low enough such that they are not risk significant. Further, an evaluation has been performed that safe shutdown will be achieved and maintained for a loss of offsite power and a steam generator tube rupture event with the additional consideration of a single failure with ultimate heat sink average water temperatures as high as 77 ○F. There has been no significant increase in the consequences of these previously evaluated events. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed temporary technical specification change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously analyzed. The change increases the amount of time that is allowed for the plant to be in hot standby should the ultimate heat sink average water temperature increase above 75 ○F from 6 to 24 hours. This extension of the time allowed for the plant to be in hot standby does not change the plant configuration. As such, the change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated.
