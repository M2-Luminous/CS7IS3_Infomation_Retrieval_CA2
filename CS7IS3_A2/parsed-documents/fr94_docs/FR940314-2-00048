FR940314-2-00048 FR940314-2-00025 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Notice of Floodplain Involvement for the Proposed East Fork Poplar Creek Flow Management Project at the Oak Ridge Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of floodplain involvement. SUMMARY: DOE proposes to install an energy dissipation chamber and a raw water line in the Y&hyph;12 Plant within the East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC) floodplain which is located in Anderson County, in the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In accordance with 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 1022, DOE will prepare a Floodplain Assessment and perform this proposed action in a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DATES: Comments are due to the address below no later than March 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: R. J. Spence, Manager, DOE Y&hyph;12 Site Office, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations Office, Post Office Box 2001, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS PROPOSED ACTION, INCLUDING A LOCATION MAP, CONTACT: Susan D. Morris, DP&hyph;813, U.S. Department of Energy, Y&hyph;12 Site Office, Post Office Box 2001, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, 615&hyph;576&hyph;3545 (telephone), 615&hyph;576&hyph;8019 (fascimile). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON GENERAL DOE FLOODPLAIN/WETLAND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS, CONTACT: Carol M. Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight, EH&hyph;25, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. 20585, 202&hyph;586&hyph;4600 or 800&hyph;472&hyph;2756 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE proposes to install a concrete box with 2 weirs (obstructions placed in a stream, diverting water for measuring the rate of flow) and a raw water line to manage the flow of the EFPC. The action would take place at the headwaters of the creek, which are located within the boundaries of the Y&hyph;12 Plant. The open box would be approximately 12 by 14 feet and emplaced at the edge of the creek bank to allow for proper diffusion and mixing of the added water with creek headwaters. Additional water would be provided by extending the existing raw water line from the Clinch River. As part of the proposed action, a Best Management Practices Plan will be prepared to identify the necessary steps to minimize potential impacts to the creek. The addition of Clinch River water to the creek is required by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation in order to guarantee a minimum base flow as the limitations established in the Y&hyph;12 Plant National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit are based on management of the flow in the EFPC. Additional water will not be added when the flow in the creek is above this established minimum flow, such as during storm events. In accordance with DOE regulations, ``Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements,'' 10 CFR part 1022, DOE will prepare a Floodplain Assessment for this proposed DOE action. After DOE issues the assessment, a Floodplain Statement of Findings will be published in the Federal Register . Issued in Washington, DC, on this 7th day of March 1994. Eugene G. Grewis, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Military Application, Defense Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5897 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;PM
