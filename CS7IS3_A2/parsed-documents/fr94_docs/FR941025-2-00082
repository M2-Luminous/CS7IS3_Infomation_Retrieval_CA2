FR941025-2-00082 FR941025-2-00053 The Service estimates that the number of nesting spectacled eiders on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta has rapidly and continuously declined by over 96 percent in the past 20 years (Stehn et al. 1993; Warnock and Troy 1993; Ely et al., in press). Information from researchers in the Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, oilfields (Warnock and Troy 1993) and Native elders at Wainwright (R. Suydam, pers. comm.) suggest local population declines on the North Slope. No data are available for examining overall trends on the North Slope or in Arctic Russia. The Service responded to a December 1990 petition to list the spectacled eider as endangered. After review of the best available commercial and scientific data the species was designated as threatened on May 10, 1993 (FR 58(88):24474&hyph;27480). The primary reason for listing spectacled eiders was their rapid and continuing decline on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding grounds, and indications that they may have declined on Alaska's North Slope, as well. Other factors that contributed to the Service's concern for the species' status were varying impacts due to human activities and population growth. Causes of this species' dramatic decline, as well as the identification and determination of relative importance of current obstacles to recovery, have yet to be determined. Several current and historical causes of mortality have been identified; they are predation by fox and gulls, subsistence and sport harvest, egg and scientific collecting, and environmental contamination. Other causes of mortality are suspected, such as collisions with commercial fishing vessels, changes in the food web, global climatic changes, competition from other marine species, and diseases and parasites. Basic natural history information to elucidate the causes for decline and obstacles for recovery is lacking. Information about the distribution and abundance of spectacled eiders throughout the year is fragmentary, as is our understanding of the demography and population dynamics of this species. Whether the nesting populations of spectacled eiders in the three primary geographic areas are genetically or demographically distinct is unknown, yet specific recovery actions and priorities may hinge on such a determination. In light of these significant data gaps, an exhaustive list of tasks required to achieve recovery cannot yet be presented. Instead, interim recovery efforts that proceed simultaneously along three fronts_preliminary management actions to eliminate known sources of mortality; exploratory data collection and analysis; and hypothesis-testing regarding the causes of the species' decline and obstacles to its recovery_are recommended. Over the next several years, recovery efforts should focus on the following topics: (1) Through meaningful participation, involve Native Alaskans living within the historical range of the species in recovery and management efforts; (2) Increase efforts to reduce mortality; (3) Quantify and monitor existing breeding populations; (4) Determine molting, migration, and wintering areas and habitats; (5) Conduct research on the demography and biology of the species and develop demographic models; and (6) Attempt to determine causes for the species' decline and obstacles to its recovery. The geographic areas of emphasis for these recovery efforts are the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the North Slope, and to a lesser degree St. Lawrence Island, and Seward Peninsula, Alaska, and Arctic Russia. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.
