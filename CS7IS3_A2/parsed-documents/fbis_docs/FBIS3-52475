Syria believes that the desired peace can only be achieved within the context of international legitimacy and the Arab unity of ranks. Likewise, Syria believes that this peace must ensure the restoration of all Arab territorial and political rights. There should be neither abandonment of any such rights, nor bargaining over any such rights. AL-BA'TH adds: These principles could have created an international pressure that might have made the Zionist entity abandon its provocative and intransigent positions. Such pressure could also have created the propitious objective circumstances needed to achieve just and comprehensive peace. However, these principles have been immensely undermined by the PLO's decision to depart from Arab consensus and jump to deals with Israel, believing that this unilateral approach, which was manifested in the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho accord, would help it make some gains. However, what has happened is quite the opposite. For, the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have confirmed that it is only Israel which emerged as the winner. The Oslo agreement has begun to collapse under Zionist pressures. Even the flawed and fragile autonomy accord appears to be rejected by the Israelis. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: These fast-breaking regional developments have revealed the cards of all parties to the peace process. They have shown that any attempts to violate the principles of peace is doomed to failure, and that any such attempts will hurt the Arabs' pan-Arab interests. All this highlights Syria's redemptive role in this crucial phase of the Arab nation's history, and renders the imminent Geneva summit, due to be held between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, an important opportunity for ending the stalemate plaguing the peace process. For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the world's hopes for the success of the Syrian-U.S. summit due to be held in Geneva in mid-January, as well as the disappointment caused by the consequences of the Oslo agreement. TISHRIN says: Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer has inaugurated a new neighborhood in the Qatzrin settlement in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Israeli minister pledged to work to promote and expand Zionist settlements in the Golan, something which shows that this provocative act is part of efforts to scuttle the peace process, sabotage the U.S. peace initiative, thwart the al-Asad-Clinton summit in advance, and present to the United States and the world community a fait accompli. TISHRIN adds: Since the signing of the Oslo accord, Israel has attempted to delude the world in general and the United States in particular into believing that peace has been realized in the region, that the Palestine question has been resolved, and that peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can wait. Likewise, it has striven to marginalize Syria's role, obscure the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and promote separate deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, instead of comprehensive peace. TISHRIN goes on to say: However, deception was short-lived. For Secretary of State Christopher has commended Syria's primary role in the peace process and arranged a summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since the news of the summit was announced, the Israelis have been casting doubts on its usefulness and leaking deceptive reports on an alleged Syria role in this or that incident. In the aftermath of the failure of their maneuvers in this regard, they have initiated a provocation that has taken the form of encouraging Zionist settlers to settle in the Golan and pledging aid to expand the existing settlements in the hope of confusing the Clinton Administration. TISHRIN indicates that the entire world is fully aware that Middle East peace cannot be achieved in the absence of an effective Syrian involvement, and that peace with Syria is contingent upon the restoration of all occupied Golan territory, and the dismantlement of settlements there. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian territory, and will remain so regardless of how many settlements Israel builds there. Moreover, Syria will not abandon a single inch of Golan territory. Certainly, there will be neither a regional peace, nor a peace with Syria unless all Golan territory is returned to its rightful owners. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the Oslo agreement, which was concluded more than four months ago, saying that it has failed to produce any tangible results. The regional developments which have unfolded since the signing of the accord have shown that the accord has failed to bring peace to the Palestinian people or the region, the paper argues. Worse still, by way of this accord, Israel has managed to dissociate the PLO from the Palestinian people and its pan-Arab depth and surroundings, namely, Syria and other frontline Arab states. This accord has, indeed, legimitized Israel's aggression and occupation. The alleged differences being promoted on the provisions of the Oslo deal, the interpretations and implementation of this deal, and the intransigent PLO and Israeli stands are all parts of a campaign of contrived maneuvering and deception designed to promote the credibility of both Israel and the PLO with their constituencies after the deal has failed to bring the region closer to peace. AL-THAWRAH adds: Under all circumstances, the PLO looks like the only loser. As for the Palestinian people and Arabs, they are also big losers in all this. This is because the Oslo agreement consecrates the final liquidation of the Palestine question and replaces the Palestinian people's aspirations, as well as their legitimate right to build an independent state on Palestinian national soil, with control over a municipality whose borders will remain confined to the area of Gaza and Jericho. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH notes the approach of Rabin, who is humiliating the PLO and its leaders by reiterating the intransigent Israeli positions with regard to control over border crossings and security and negotiations on Israeli terms. If Israeli terms and positions are not accepted by the PLO, his government is not in a hurry to conclude an agreement with it, as Rabin put it. All this shows the futility of unilateral deals, as well as their failure to bring just and comprehensive peace, which must result in complete Israeli withdrawal on all fronts.
