Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are involved in the projects which were planned to be built in the Southwest. According to the plan, by the end of this century, more than 3,000 kilometers of railways will have been built or rebuilt in the abovementioned region. The projects have now started construction. The projects, which are scheduled to have completed construction before 1995, include the northern thoroughfare of the Southwest or the multiple- track Yangpingguan-Chengdu section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the eastern thoroughfare or the Daxian-Chengdu Railway, and the western thoroughfare or the Guangtong-Dali Railway in Yunnan. Moreover, the 2.6 billion-yuan electrification reconstruction project of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway also has started construction. The Chongqing-Daxian Electric Railway, the Wanxian-Daxian Railway, and the Neijiang-Kunming Railway will begin construction one after another, and they are expected to be completed by the end of this century. In road construction, some 5,000 km of arterial highways will be built and rebuilt. Sichuan Province will invest 1.13 billion to build and rebuild high-grade arterial highways that fan out to other parts of China -- with the Chang Jiang as the backing, key ports as the linking point, and Chengdu and Chongqing as the center -- and to link cities, prefectures, and counties with roads of grade-2 and above so as to form a coordinated land-and-water transport network in which expressways are linked with water transport carried out with other parts of the country. The project of the Shanghai- Chengdu arterial highway, as planned by the Ministry of Communications, will run through Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian in Sichuan, and expand from Chongqing, Guaiyang, Nanning to a sea port in Beibu Bay. According to the ministry's plan, in the first step, 800 km of high-grade arterial highways will be built and some 2,000 km of regional arterial highways will be built and rebuilt.
