And what increases in value literally by the day are the boundless expanses of Yakutia. Its territory constitutes one-fifth of the territory of Russia. And the president of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev, has undertaken to transform this part of Russia. He has not appeared at rallies, on television, or on the pages of newspapers. He has not been in the public eye and has wanted only one thing: that nobody stand in his way. And now it is becoming clear: He has fulfilled and, as they used to say in Red old days, overfulfilled his presidential campaign program. In our day not everyone does this. Resolute, seizing the moment, persistently finishing what he has started, Mikhail Nikolayev has renewed his republic without a lot of advertising. On 27 December he will have been president for two years, which means two years of work for whose results he need not apologize either to his people or to Russia or to the Lord God Himself. Mikhail Nikolayev makes it possible to judge him not only from his words, but also from his deeds. Yakutia is now the sovereign Republic of Sakha, which is a part of the Russian Federation. First the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Yakut-Sakha SSR was declared. Then presidential rule was introduced. The Federation Treaty was signed. On 27 April 1992 the new Constitution (basic law) of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) went into force. It had its own seal and flag. The republic became a full-fledged member in the large Russian home, arranging its relations with the outside world as a sovereign state. Skeptics must be warned that this is not a continuation of the so-called parade of sovereignties. The republic's political status has been documented on more than just paper. Mikhail Nikolayev cannot be silenced with titles and ranks and all the other attributes. As early as March 1992 he achieved the signing of an economic agreement with the Russian Federation whereby the Republic of Sakha gained the right to keep part of the natural resources it extracted. After the signing of the Federation Treaty the levels, spheres, and even objects and subjects of competition between the Center and the republic were determined. Last November the presidents of Russia and Yakutia signed an agreement on dividing up state property between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The edict of President B.N. Yeltsin "On Immediate Measures for Implementation of the Federation Treaty in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)" took effect in August of this year. It envisions joint solutions to key economic problems within the framework of a special program. In Moscow Mikhail Nikolayev achieved the conclusion of a separate agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) on questions of federal taxation which makes it possible for the Northern republic to dispose of its financial means independently. In this regard Yakutia is ahead of everyone else in Russia--no other component of the Federation has this right. Even this brief survey of Mikhail Nikolayev's political and economic activities during the two years of his presidency shows that this politician knows what he wants and is able to achieve the goals he sets. He completely denies accusations of separatism, patiently explaining: "Our sovereignty does not cross the line at which the disintegration of Russia begins. We have achieved a certain amount of economic independence so that we can earn our daily bread by the sweat of our brow and not wait for handouts from others." And today Yakutia is a region with a stable economic and sociopolitical situation. The republic is moving along the path of reforms and President B.N. Yeltsin's policy, constantly oriented toward all-Russian interests. Boris Nikolayevich himself, in response to the question of what he thinks about the president of Yakutia, said: "It has always been pleasant for me to see that in our new time with its paths of development which are so difficult for Russia new people are appearing so widely and freely--talented, active, capable of independently solving what would appear to be impossible problems. Their appearance gratifies me most of all and gives me the strength and confidence in the correctness of the work that has been started. For these people are to be found not only near the president and not only in Moscow. They are throughout our immense Russia and in its remote parts. "Just take Yakutia-Republic of Sakha. Its president is Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev. A native northerner, Sakha by nationality, he has the right to take his place among the leading politicians and state figures. His talent has been revealed literally during the past two or three years. President Nikolayev seems to be on a creative upsurge and has far from exhausted his potential. "Mikhail Yefimovich impresses me because he is a man of few words, he is thorough, and he has integrity. I know that he has been criticized a great deal because of his desire for independent actions and the elevation of the status of the Republic of Sakha. "But President Nikolayev is a sober-minded politician, an energetic organizer who is not inclined toward adventurism and populism. He is very cautious, but he has fairly resolutely and courageously passed through the stage of being totally taken up by sovereignization. In a short period of time he has managed to bring the status of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) into line with the new requirements of life, which has made it possible to turn the immense territory into a high-income region with a stable economic situation. Nikolayev does not wait for instructions from above. He independently searches for ways out of difficult situations and always finds them in the area of all-Russian interests. He likes the possibility of working independently, being responsible for the results of his activity, keeping up with the times, not falling behind, and even getting ahead of them in some areas. At the same time he is guided not only by the interests of the republic he heads but also Russia's. I think that this is one of the strongest aspects characterizing him as a mature politician."
