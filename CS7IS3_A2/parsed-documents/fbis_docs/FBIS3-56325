The official reminded that, during Russian President Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October, the two states expressed the wish to hold the meeting soon after the elections to the new Russian parliament. The mass media believed it meant that the date for the meeting was officially fixed for late in January. But in point of fact it was only an approximate date. Japan's viewpoint remains unchanged. It seeks to hold this year's first round of the talks as soon as possible. However it takes into account the difficulty of Russia's domestic situation, the workload the Russian Government is faced with because of the beginning of the parliament's work, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's official said. The official refused to express some supposition when the Russian-Japanese working group's meeting may be held.
