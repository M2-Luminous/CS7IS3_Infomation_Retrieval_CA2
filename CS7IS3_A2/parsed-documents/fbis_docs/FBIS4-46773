[Text] According to the presidential edict, all legislative statutes, government decrees and documents signed by the president become effective upon publication in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. That means free access to our newspaper is one of the inalienable civil rights. The censorship of the department does not exist today, but a barrier which has arisen between the newspaper and the reader is the censorship of the pocketbook, which may also be administatively controlled. The newspaper does not get to the reader by itself. It is delivered by mail. And in addition to the subscription price, the postal service sets its price for delivery. While the editors of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA determine the first price, the second is determined in each region independently. The 9,000 rubles (R) for half a year set by the editors does not cover expenses for maintaining and publishing the newspaper (a ton of paper today costs R780,000, and no one knows what it will be in 6 months). However, the post offices have a special methodology for computing the price to cover their expenditures. Then what explains such sharp variations today? For example, in Samara Oblast (where K. Titov is head of administration) they charge R15,600 for delivery of RG, while nearby in Saratov Oblast (head of administration Yu. Belykh) it is R10,396. Since, according to the methodology, transport expenditures are among the primary components of the price for delivery, we can only assume that in Saratovo Oblast the roads are better and shorter, and the gasoline is cheaper than in the neighboring oblast. Which is absurd if we remember Griboyedov's address in the "sticks" and the presence of well-developed oil processing and local gasoline in Samara Oblast. And how can we explain that in the neighboring Penza Oblast (head of administration A. Kovlyagin) they charge R4,500 for six months of delivery of our newspaper, but for the same operation with the "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Collection" they already charge R30,000? One more inexplicable difference is in the delivery to individual subscribers versus organizations. In Kaluga Oblast (head of administration A. Deryagin), offices are charged as much as R23,400 for the newspaper, while in Belgorod Oblast (head of administration Ye. Savchenko) they charge R12,000. According to V. V. Gogoleva, department head of the Federal Postal Service Administration, the newspaper is delivered to organizations with the aid of the GSP [city postal service] system, which is about two times more expensive than the ordinary mail. But why more expensive by different amounts? Viktoriya Viktorovna believes that prices are higher where the ordinary population is subsidized at the expense of organizations. And here we must go from the postmen to the heads of administration. Since, in view of the open-field system of postal price lists, it turns out that, in places where prices are low, the administration knowingly subsidizes the delivery of a newspaper which publishes documents and commentaries which are of vital importance to all of Russia. We may say this about Bryansk Oblast (head of administration V. Karpov), where delivery costs R2,760; about Krasnodar Kray (recent head of administration N. Yegorov)--R4,668, and about Tuva (president Sherit-ool Oorzhak) and Karachayevo-Cherkesiya (Council of Ministers Chairman V. Khubiyev). And in those regions where prices are high, the administration, frightening the public away from subscriptions, is facilitating the breakdown of all-Russian ties and in practice conceals from the citizens the federal laws and decrees, leaving them in the field of arbitrary activity of local authorities. That is what they do in Vologda Oblast (head of administration N. Podgornov), where the price of delivery is R18,510, in Mordovia (Council of Ministers Chairman V. Shvetsov)--R11,046, and in Moscow (Mayor Yu. Luzhkov)--R8,800. However, the most pleasant thing is that in the places where the local authorities are truly active in a positive way, there no barriers are set for the governmental newspaper. Without any prompting, benefits have been introduced for subscribers in Kabardino-Balkariya (President V. Kokov), while in Kaliningrad Oblast, an isolated little island of Russia, they even solve the problem of employment with the aid of benefits. At the decision of the oblast administration (head of administration Yu. Matochkin), delivery is half as expensive for those newspapers which are printed in Kaliningrad itself. We might add, about the press. We are even published in Cheboksary. However, there they charge both citizens and organizations the same for delivery--R22,800. Moreover, the price is the same for rural residents and for city residents living within 100 meters from the printing-house or the post office. While in Chelyabinsk, for example, the city price is R9,200, while in the oblast it is R15,594.
