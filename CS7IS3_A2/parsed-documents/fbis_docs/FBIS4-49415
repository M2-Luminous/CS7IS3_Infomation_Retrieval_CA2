To summarize, their controversy focuses on two questions: First, is the present scale of investment in fixed assets too big or not? Second, how should the state control the scale of investment under present specific conditions? The following are my own viewpoints on these two questions. The question of whether or not the present scale of investment in fixed assets is too big involves the means and standard for measuring the scale of investment. One way is to use comparable prices to compare the investment scale of one year with that of the previous year; that is, we can get the investment scale and its growth rate after allowing for price rises in the scale of investment of the year. We can accordingly judge if the investment scale is proper. Some economists favor this method, and the State Statistics Bureau has also compiled price indexes of investment in fixed assets. The statistical communique of 1993 indicated the society-wide investment in fixed assets was 1,182.9 billion yuan. Although it increased by 50.6 percent over the previous year, it actually increased by 22 percent over the previous year with the deduction of the price index of investment in fixed assets (which stood at 23.4 percent). The growth rate was lower than that of 1992, which stood at 23.7 percent. So it is impossible to come to the conclusion that the scale of investment for the year is too high. Nor did the statistical communique of 1993 mention that the investment scale of the year was too high. Instead, it only said that "the total scale of investment in fixed assests of construction projects in progress was too high." However, scale of investment and scale of construction projects in progress are two different concepts. The communique of 1993 indicated that the total scale of investment in fixed assets of construction projects in progress for state-owned units was 2,327.1 billion yuan. With the deduction of projects that were completed by the end of the year, the volume of unfinished projects amounted to 1,320 billion yuan; given that the amount of investment of the state-owned units completed in fixed assets stood at 832.1 billion yuan for the year, the unfinished projects could be completed within one year and seven months. It was major progress as compared with the fact that the construction projects in progress needed two or three or more years to be completed in recent years. So we cannot say that the scale of construction projects in progress at the end of 1993 was too big either. Another way is to get the proportion of investment in fixed assets in the GDP by comparing the investment scale of the year with the GDP based on current prices. When we view investment in connection with the economic strength of the state, we can see if the investment scale is in proportion to the state economic strength. According to the statistic data, the proportions of the last three years are listed in the following table: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Unit current |1991 |1992 |1993 | | |price (hundre-| | | | | |d million yua-| | | | | |n) | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |GDP |20188 |24020 |31380 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Society-wide |ditto |5509 |7855 |11829 | |investment in | | | | | |fixed assets | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Proportion of ||27.3 |32.7 |37.7 | |GDP | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investment of |current price |3628 |5274 |8321 | |state-owned u-|(hundred mill-| | | | |nits in fixed |ion yuan) | | | | |assets | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Proportion in ||18.0 |22.0 |26.5 | |GDP | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 1993, the society-wide fixed assets investment accounted for 37.7 percent of the GDP, while investment of the state-owned units in fixed assets accounted for 26.5 percent of the GDP. In my opinion, this indicates that the investment scale was too big. The reasons are as follows: First, in view of the historical experience of investment rates in fixed assets, the current scale of investment has broken through the rational limit. The practice of reform and opening to the world for fifteen years indicates that once the proportion of society-wide investment in fixed assets in the GDP exceeds 30 percent, and the proportion of investment of state-owned units in fixed assets in the GDP exceeds 20 percent, the relations in various aspects of the national economy will become strained and even out of proportion. The present relations of all aspects of the national economy has already been very strained. The reason is no other than this. Second, compared with the planned arrangement for 1993, the original scale of investment was much exceeded. The first plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress adopted the plan for 1993. It arranged that the total scale of society-wide investment in fixed assets to be 800 billion yuan, the investment rate being controlled within 30 percent. Investment in state-owned units took up 565 billion yuan of it while that of collective-owned units and invididuals accounted for 235 billion. Now the society- wide investment in fixed assets has exceeded the planned amount by 382.9 billion yuan, the excess rate being 47.9 percent. Investment in state-owned units is 267.1 billion more than the planned amount, the excess rate being 47.3 percent, while investment by collective- owned units and individuals has exceeded the planned amount by 115.8 billion yuan, the excess rate being 49.3%. According to the 1993 plan, the arranged investment rate was controlled within 30 percent, that is, the proportion of the society-wide investment in fixed assets in the national income. According to statistics, the rate of society-wide investment in fixed assets in 1992 was 39.5%. It is estimated that it rose to around 42 percent in 1993, exceeding that in the period of "the Great Leap Forward." This was unusual since the founding of the PRC. Third, last year's currency supply hit a record high, reflecting an excessive scale in investment. In 1993, the GDP rose by 30.6 percent according to current price calculation, while the society-wide investment in fixed assets rose by 50.6 percent. That is an important reason why the demand for currency grew. The situation of rapid increase in investment causing an abrupt increase in currency supply is as follows: On the basis of a large supply of 115.8 billion in 1992, a record high supply of 152.9 billion yuan was made in 1993. It was more than the total supply of the latter five years in the 1980s (a total supply of 115.3 billion yuan from 1985 to 1989). By the end of 1993, currency in circulation reached 586.5 billion. It rose by 35.3 percent compared to an increase of 36.5 percent in the previous year. This was exceeded only in 1988 (an increase of 46.7 percent), reaching another height. Fourth, the state of inflation also reflects an excessive scale of investment. The increase of currency supply caused by inflationary investment resulted in price hikes. In 1993, the price index of the residents living cost expenses (including commodity and service prices, i.e., the consumer price index in the West) rose by 14.7 percent compared to an increase of 6.4 percent in 1992, while the retail price index rose by 13 percent compared to an increase of 5.4 percent in 1992. The inflation rate last year exceeded two digits, for the fourth time in over four decades after the founding of the PRC. Great attention should be paid to it. As the effect of money supply on prices has a lag period, the big increase of money supply in 1993 will play a role in commodity price hikes in 1994. So this year our economy will continue to face a severe inflation situation. Fifth, compared with foreign countries, the investment scale of our country is relatively large. At present, the proportion of investment in fixed assets in the GDP usually stands around 15 to 20 percent in developed countries. Japan stood around 30 percent at the highest. Of course, this proportion has to do with the stage of economic development. Take the ROK, a newly emerging industrialized country, for example. When its economy took off in the 1970s, the highest proportion was only around 33 percent. At that time, that of Taiwan was only around 28 percent (22.8 percent in 1992). How the country should control the scale of investment is a problem that has not been settled properly under the new situation in which macro-economic regulation and control is being implemented. One opinion holds it unnecessary for the state to control the investment scale and that it cannot be controlled either. However, I think it is necessary to control it. I can only put forward some opinion about principles as I have not studied a lot about concrete steps. First, It Should Be Made Clear that the State Maintains the Principle of Guiding the Scale of Investment Through Planning Under the System of Market Economy Drawing on the experience of the market economy practiced by Western countries (regions), in its plan the state can set an absolute investment amount (including investment in fixed assets and the amount of additional circulating funds) as well as the total investment rate, i.e. the proportion of the total investment (separating fixed assets investment and the amount of additional circulating funds) in the GNP. In this way, the investment scale will be more or less in keeping with the economic strength of the country. With the reform of planning, it is required that statistics move a step ahead to work out the relevant indexes of the base period. Second, the State Should Formulate a Comparatively Detailed Industrial Policy To Guide Investment Direction An industrial policy should be implemented in various localities. We should combine readjustment of economic levers with implementation of an industrial policy to promote realization of the state investment plan. Third, the Central Bank Should Strengthen Its Control Over Fixed Asset Loans The central bank should strictly control the plan for fixed asset loans transmitted by the state. It should be included in both the state investment plan and the credit plan of the bank. It should be strictly carried out with no excess allowed. Financial institutions of all kinds should not give fixed assets loans at random. Localities and departments cannot issue bonds, launch pilot projects of adopting the share-holding system, and illegally raise funds for construction. We should work according to the state plan while exploiting foreign capital. We should strengthen guidance and practice of standardized management in those construction projects in which foreign businessmen have invested directly. Fourth, Use Different Means to Control Investments for Different Investors The present macro-management of investment actually still focuses on the management of investments by state-owned units, failing to see investors of various economic elements newly emerged since reform and opening up started, such as those of the private economy, individual economy, township and town enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperation enterprises, enterprises solely run by foreign businessmen, and enterprises run jointly by the state and collectives, by the state and individuals, and by collectives and individuals. The main efforts of our reform of the economic management structure should be shifted to these practical affairs to earnestly strengthen macro-management of investment.
