I. Introduction The Commission is proposing today to facilitate registration and reporting by foreign private issuers, by allowing flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency used in filings with the Commission and by streamlining financial statement reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers with operations in countries with hyperinflationary economies. As proposed, a foreign private issuer could state amounts in its financial statements in any currency which it deemed appropriate so long as it reports to a majority of its nonaffiliated securityholders using that currency. In addition, a foreign private issuer that accounts for its operations in hyperinflationary environments in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 21, ``The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates,'' as amended in 1993 (``IAS 21''), would not need to reconcile the differences that would have resulted from application of the U.S. standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, ``Foreign Currency Translation'' (``SFAS 52'').
