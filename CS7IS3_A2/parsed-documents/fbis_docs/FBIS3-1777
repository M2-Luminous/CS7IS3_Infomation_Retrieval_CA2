The workers there were full of spirit and joy to welcome the visit of Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee. This small grain shop has changed greatly in the short span of one month. As soon as Chen Xitong entered the grain shop yesterday, he first found female worker Lu Wenmei who had complained tearfully that the grain shop suffered deficits and the workers received a low income last month and said to her cordially: Thank you for speaking the truth. You have made us realize the actual situation and pay more attention to helping money-losing enterprises "shake off poverty." This time you must also speak the truth. What is the situation now? Lu Wenmei grimed from ear to ear and said emotionally: Thank you for your kind concern; the grain shop has changed completely; everybody here is full of enthusiasm for work and have the confidence to work hard to bring about an upsurge. While inspecting sanitation work on 21 last moth, Chen Xitong, Zhang Baifa, and Ouyang Wenan suddenly changed the district authorities' schedule to make a spot check on this grain shop. At that time, Lu Wenmei reflected tearfully the actual difficulties in the living standards of workers of this grain shop. According to Dongcheng District's investigation, about one-third of this kind of grain shop suffered deficits. Chen Xitong was very concerned about this and instructed Dongcheng District to devise plans to solve this problem within a month. Thus, efforts to make major breakthroughs of strategic significance in realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule began. Dongcheng District and the government immediately established a work group to study and formulate the initial plan for making "Hepingli grain shop and all money-losing grain shops in the whole district shake off poverty and become comparatively well-off" along with the district grain bureau and Hepingli Siqu grain shop. The newly appointed manager of Siqu grain shop did not go home for a week. He studied with workers ways to reform and invigorate the grain shop, to shake off poverty, and to become prosperous. They raised 50,000 yuan to refurnish and renovate the shop, increase operational facilities, and improve the shopping environment. Internally, this shop implemented the operational and job contracting system and shared the contract base figure to all operational groups. After implementing the contract system, this grain shop, in addition to ensuring grain and cereal oil supply, also carried out diversified undertakings, added some new service items, increased commodities like bread, small packages of miscellaneous grains, and daily necessities to over 190 varieties, and set aside a part of the shop to run a restaurant. This small shop put on a new look and generated a business volume of 7,000 yuan in three days, doubling that of the previous month, and enabled the income of workers to greatly increase. At a forum following the investigation and study, Dongcheng District grain bureau gave a work briefing on helping the money-losing grain shops shake off poverty and become prosperous. During the past month, all grain enterprises conducted general discussions on how to emancipate the mind and reach a common understanding: After the decontrol of grain and cereal oil prices, they failed to make their business keep pace with the situation, and their ideology basically remained at the level of complaining, laying bare the difficulties, and asking for policies from the higher levels. It is necessary to carry out the socialist market economy in the course of development. It is impossible for us to return to the old track of the planned economy and to lead a life by relying on state subsidies. It is also impossible for the state to make us prosperous by giving subsidies. Therefore, we must cut off the road to retreat and blaze a new trial. The district grain bureau and grain management office have urged all cadres to each give an order to change the outlook of 42 money-losing grain shops in the district in line with Siqu grain shop's requirements of shaking off poverty and becoming prosperous. According to the briefings of the district party committee and government, the grain enterprises should take the lead in this work, consider helping poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools and households shake off poverty and become prosperous as a strategic issue, accelerate the development of the whole district, and realize the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule. During the forum, Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen said: The municipal party committee and government have been greatly concerned about the low income issue of workers. The economic departments dealing with comprehensive work should study the experience of Dongcheng District, emancipate the mind, deepen reform, help the poor shake off poverty and become prosperous, do more practical things for the masses, and care for and make good arrangements for the living of low income workers, particularly before the Spring Festival period. Ouyang Wenan, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee, said: The low income issue of workers has a bearing on social stability and becoming well-off ahead of schedule. It is necessary to conscientiously conduct investigation and study and devise specific measures for solving this issue. Chen Xitong also gave a speech, in which he said: It makes me happy to see the improvements of this grain shop today. The Dongcheng party committee and government have realistically regarded solving the low income issue of workers as a major task, and showing that they have kept the people and workers in mind. Making breakthroughs in Siqu grain shop, promoting this experience to the whole district, and helping poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools, and households shake off poverty and become prosperous is a good method. We have great hopes for realizing the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule. Chen Xitong said: Workers of grain enterprises across the municipality have done much hard work in conscientiously implementing the plans of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the municipal party committee and government, which showed that this contingent has awareness, has observed discipline, and is trustworthy. He thanked and saluted the grain enterprises on behalf of the municipal party committee and government. Chen Xitong fully affirmed Dongcheng District grain bureau's effort in emancipating the mind while tuning out the disparities, freeing itself from the ideological shackle of complaints, laying bare the difficulties, and asking for help from the higher level, enhancing spirit, and in particular, recognizing that it is no longer possible to return to the old track of the planned economy to lead a life of relying on state subsidies and that it is no longer possible for the state to make the grain enterprises become well-off by providing subsidies. By doing so, this grain bureau has grasped a key point. When we have a leap forward in ideology and hope in our work, we will be able to find a way to shake off poverty and become well-off. Chen Xitong pointed out: The Dongcheng District party committee and government have made a good start in conscientiously studying plans and measures for solving the low income issue of workers. All districts and counties across the municipality and all departments should study and use Dongcheng District's method for reference, devote energy to conscientiously conducting investigation and study, grasp typical cases, make breakthroughs in some major aspects, and solve the problem of the poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools, and households. He stressed: Mountainous areas and housing and low income issues of workers constitute the most difficult points in Beijing's realization of its goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule. He called on leaders of the party committees and governments at all levels across the municipality and all departments to get moving and go to the mountainous areas and poverty-stricken shops, plants, schools, and household, and conscientiously conduct investigation and study to change this situation. All leaders should always think about what they have done to solve poverty-related issues, and should visit not only the prosperous areas but also the poverty-stricken areas. Under an excellent situation, we must never forget that there are also some fairly poor areas. We should conscientiously conduct investigation and study, support and help the poor, bring about a better situation, and let more people see the superiority of socialism and feel the concern of the party and the government. The Spring Festival will come very soon. We must show concern for the poor households and let them spend the Spring Festival happily. This is a most practical and good thing we should do.
