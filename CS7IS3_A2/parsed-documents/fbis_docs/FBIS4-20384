But while this new stage of growth has brought a clear decline in the share of our agricultural output value and of agriculture in our national income, this certainly does not imply a weakening of the position and role of agriculture as the basis of our economic growth, the guarantee of our social stability, and the root of our national prosperity and might. Precisely the opposite, the arrival of China's intermediate industrialization stage means that agriculture not only continues to contribute to China's industry, but also will play an active role in the thorough conversion to marketization of China's economic reforms. The fundamental standing of agriculture will grow more important, with agriculture undergoing this crucial stage and withstanding severe trials in the midst of these profound changes. During the crucial stage of the next 15 years (1996-2010), when our national economy is fully developing and making the transition to a market economy, our agricultural development state will directly affect our economic growth and system conversion. So when drawing up long-range development plans for our future national economy, we need to give key importance to agriculture. I. The Features, Issues, and Conflicts Involved in Our Agricultural Development from 1996 to 2010 In order to understand the features of Chinese agriculture from 1996 to 2010, it will be necessary to grasp the development phases and trends of our whole national economy, as well as the relations between industrial and agricultural development, in this stage. Various studies show that China's national economic growth has entered this intermediate industrialization stage, which China's national economy will remain in from 1996 to 2010, and which will pose a series of new demands on our agricultural development. Based on our studies of this intermediate industrialization stage, Chinese agriculture will show the following features in this stage: 1. Agricultural-product demand will grow faster. While the cries about the "problems in selling" agricultural products are now loud, this certainly does not mean that agricultural-product demand has reached its peak. The most crucial cause of these "selling difficulties" is that agricultural-product demand is in a structural-adjustment stage since the resolution of our food and clothing problem. As to the cities, this is mainly that the conflict between our farm-product supply and demand structures has resulted in inadequate direct demand for traditional farm products; and for rural areas, since the food and clothing problem was solved, the traditional low-value farm-product (mainly grain) demand-elasticity has declined quickly, while high-value farm products are in surplus. But the next 15 years of population growth, higher incomes, and particularly higher peasant incomes and changes in our urban-rural population structure, will bring a sharp growth in farm-product demand, which growth will be concentrated in animal foods, such as meat, eggs, milk, poultry, and aquatic products, as well as in areas, such as fruit, beverages, and processed foods. Our studies show that average incomes of 1,000-2,500 yuan (at 1990 prices) are the stage in which food-spending grows quickest, which fast spending-growth results mainly not from increased consumption, but rather from consumption of high-value foods. Projections for the next 15 years are that average Chinese incomes will be in this stage, meaning that demand in the next 15 years for high-value foods, such as meat, eggs, milk, and poultry, will be in a high-growth stage. As consumer demand for high-value foods higher on the food chain will be much larger for indirectly-consumed primary farm products than for directly consumed ones, this means that demand in the next 15 years will grow faster from primary farm products, such as grain, to high-value farm products. 2. Agricultural development will be faced with a severe protracted warfare with market economy. The next 15 years of this intermediate industrialization stage will bring a clear pickup in nonfarm-industry technological advance and structural conversion, sharply raising our resource-return rate and labor productivity. But on the other hand, as a traditional industry, agriculture will certainly not see a clear improvement in its rate of technological advances and higher labor productivity before its industrialization is completed as compared to its initial stage. Particularly, China is short on agricultural resources and has a weak agricultural base, in addition to our current agricultural-operating form of sharing cultivated land equally, which further sharpens our conflict of slow rates of agricultural technical advances and higher labor productivity. This means that agriculture's profit-making capability will unavoidably be clearly lower than that of nonfarm industry so that, under market-economy conditions, unless the state intervenes, the market-economy principle of profit maximization will drive a sharp loss of agricultural factors, on a scale highly likely to be far larger than at present, thus posing a severe protracted warfare to agricultural development. 3. Agricultural growth will quickly increase material-input demand. In Comparative Studies of Industrialization and Economic Growth, Chenery and others conducted a simulated analysis of input-output relations for countries in varying stages of industrialization. This shows that in the initial stage of industrialization, when per capita GNP is $100-$200 (in 1964 dollars), the ratio of agricultural material consumption to gross agricultural output is 16.4 percent, which ratio rises to 32.2 percent after per capita GNP reaches $400, and again to 45.8 percent when GNP grows to $1,500 in the latter stages of industrialization. A regression analysis that we conducted of GVAO [Growth Value of Agricultural Output] to agricultural material consumption in China for the 1979-1989 time series and for a cross-section of 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1991, shows that the elasticity of China's GVAO to agricultural material input was up from 0.86 for 1979-1989 to 0.91 by 1991. This change was absolutely predictable. The arrival of the intermediate industrialization stage meant that our national economic development had reached such a stage, that our form of relying on simple development and utilization of natural resources to drive economic growth was over, and that our economic growth was increasingly dependant on increased input of reproduceable resources which, reflected in agriculture, was naturally increased material input. The appearance of this feature requires industry to provide the material guarantees for agricultural growth on one hand, while requiring agricultural fund-input to be raised to a new level on the other. 4. Agricultural growth will tend to become more difficult. One of the key features of structural conversion in the intermediate industrialization stage is that while the industrial-agricultural structural conversion proceeds, the structural conversion within industry clearly accelerates. This results in resources flowing on a larger scale toward nonfarm industry, making growth harder for agriculture -- as the traditional industry -- due to the impact of this large-scale loss of resources. In order to confirm this assessment, we analyzed agricultural growth in the industrialization process for the five countries of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, as well as using World Bank data to conduct a cross-section analysis of industrialization and agricultural growth in over 60 countries. This showed that both the experiences of the first countries to industrialize and the practices of comtemporary countries prove that in the intermediate industrialization stage, agriculture is characterized by a strong stagnation trend (See the research task entrusted by the State Planning Commission's Economic Studies Center to the State Planning Commission, Economic Studies Institute, Rural Economic Research Office: Agricultural Growth Patterns in the Intermediate Industrialization Stage). Due to the following factors, Chinese agriculture is highly likely to grow slowly or even stagnate in the intermediate industrialization stage, just as in the first countries to industrialize. A. Once in the intermediate stage, the quantity and quality of agricultural natural resources will tend to decrease to a greater extent, sharply exacerbating China's conflict of a severe shortage of agricultural resources. B. China launched its industrialization on a quite weak base. As China chose the route of very rapid industrialization slanted toward heavy industry, we have never been able to rectify the problem of our weak agricultural base. And with the arrival of our intermediate industrialization stage, our national economic focus will shift toward nonfarm industry, making this problem an even more glaring one. C. Our traditional agricultural-growth pattern of a large input of live labor to make up our resource-input shortage has reached the critical point, so that our abundant agricultural workforce not only is no longer an advantage, but even is threatening our agricultural growth. D. Our agricultural S&T and technology-dissemination system is also facing a stiff test from the market-economy tide. The above analyzes China's agricultural-development possibilities for the next 15 years from a quantitative perspective. This section will set forth a simple quantitative description. Based on China's real agricultural-development achievements since the founding of the PRC, particularly since 1978, combined with the model we chose to analyze our agricultural-development features and the key problems and conflicts we will face in the next 15 years, we have projected our key agricultural indexes for 1996-2010.

By the year 2000, China will have a cultivated land area of 1.368-1.373 billion mu which, at a population of 1.3 billion, will average out to about 1.05 mu per person. As to grain production, this will reach 495.9 million tons by the year 2000, for an average increase of 1.34 percent a year, giving us 381 kg of grain per person, still under the 1984 level; by 2010, gross output will reach 576.33 million tons, for an average increase of 1.51 percent a year, to give us 412 kg per person, slightly higher than the minimum of 800 jin [one-half kg] per person. II. Our Agricultural Development Strategies for 1996-2010 It is not hard to see from the above analysis that China's farm-product supply and demand situation will be quite grim from 1996 to 2010. Unless we resolve this matter appropriately, it will very likely affect China's industrialization progress, our realization of a comparatively well-off economy, and our rural and even overall national stability. So to ensure that our agriculture in this period is as suited as possible to our national economic-growth needs, we need to take corresponding countermeasures starting now. As to the conflicts and problems that our agriculture will face in this period, we hold that our basic agricultural-development guiding ideology for this period should be to adhere to the principle of developing but not depending wholly on markets and, with state support, to focus on structural adjustment, by relying on S&T, policy, input, and service to promote agricultural growth, on which basis to appropriately regulate and guide farm-product demand. In the next 15 years, as our farm-product demand will have been converted from the traditional quantitative demand to qualitative and variety demand, making our traditional planned guidance hardly suited to diversified and frequently-changing market demand, we will have to persistently move ahead with agricultural market-reform. Meanwhile, we need to soberly understand that as agriculture is a traditional industry, it will suffer much more heavily from the adverse impact of a market economy than other industries. Particularly as Chinese agriculture is so short on resources and weak in base, so will be in a very adverse position in market competition, we will have to accompany our adherence to market reforms with a great emphasis on state support for agriculture, instead of trying to push agriculture completely into markets as in the previous stage. With state support, structural adjustment will be our key agricultural-development mission for the next 15 years. Structural adjustment will enable us to adapt to demand changes and achieve overall growth. In farming, structural adjustment will raise our percentage of high-yield, quality crops, giving us overall farming growth, on which basis we can focus on developing livestock, aquatic products, and famous, specialty, and superior farm products. Based on the above guiding ideology, we are making the following strategic suggestions: 1. We should continue to move forward resolutely with market reform. A. We need to accelerate our development of diversified circulation subjects. Farm-product circulation is a problem obstructing our current agricultural development that is in urgent need of solution. As the key to rationalizing farm-product circulation is to establish plural circulation subjects in equal competition, the government needs to avoid direct participation in circulation, to treat equally all economic entities taking part in farm-product circulation. Equal competition among circulation subjects of all components will promote market development. The government's key future intervention in farm-product circulation should be: 1) To establish and perfect market-order and transaction rules, and to draw up scientific laws and regulations for farm-product trade. 2) To set up a regulatory system for staple farm products, particularly grain reserves, using this system's volume to balance farm-product market supply and demand. So we are suggesting the establishment of a Central Grain Reserves Regulation Bureau to be directly subordinate to the State Council, independent of the commercial system, and fully independent in financing, storage capacity, and operation. B. We need to establish a diversified rural money market. We need to separate out the policy-bank functions of the Agricultural Bank [AB], by upgrading the AB to a genuine commercial bank, and upgrading credit cooperatives to a peasant-owned and businesslike cooperative bank, while supporting rural cooperative foundations and other private financial organizations in the formation of a diversified rural money market under Agricultural-Policy-Bank leadership. C. While developing a diversified agricultural capital-goods market with equal competition, the state needs to enhance its management of the agricultural capital-goods market. As to the production and sale of important agricultural-use manufactured goods, it must exercise the necessary licensing system, do a good job of technical oversight, and stop agricultural cheating and swindling at the production and sale source. D. We need to establish rational flow mechanisms for our cultivated-land resources, to encourage the right scale of operation. We suggest strengthening the authority of collective economic organizations to allocate cultivated land and, based on collective economic organizations developing jobs to transfer surplus agricultural manpower, paving the way for the remaining agricultural workforce to contract enough cultivated land. Meanwhile, to keep our cultivated land from being adjusted too frequently and steadily downsized in operating scale, our future land-contract terms could be extended to a fixed 30-50 years on the principle of "adding people but not land, and reducing people but not land," with contract rights being inheritable and allowed to be sold at value. 2. The state should support farm-product supply. State support should be aimed at promoting agrotechnology advances, raising agricultural productivity, and improving to a certain extent the adverse position of agriculture in market competition. A. Revenue investment in agriculture should go mostly to maintain stable economic growth, with profitmaking investment reduced as much as possible, and revenues invested mainly in basic industries that are unprofitable but play a key role in maintaining stable economic growth, thus preparing the material foundation for revenue support of basic industries, such as agriculture. B. The state needs to include agroscience research and S&T dissemination in basic academic disciplines, suitably increasing its investment and providing priority support, instead of overemphasizing the marketization route for agricultural S&T dissemination. C. We need to establish and perfect state credit-support for agriculture. Once the State Agriculture Policy Bank is established, it should apply a preferential interest-rate policy to agricultural loans. D. The state should continue to focus some financial resources on large-scale water-conservancy capital construction on farmland. We need to upgrade our old irrigated zones, by giving priority support to the restoration and completion of irrigation and drainage projects. Future state investment in farmland capital construction of water conservancy works should grow faster than or at least as fast as revenue growth. E. For farm-product purchasing, we should practice a minimum protective-price system. F. We need to continue to build commodity bases for farm products, particularly grain. We could select 500 large commodity-grain counties throughout China for preferential state funding and technical support. 3. With state support, we should turn S&T advances into this stage's agricultural-growth leader. A. We need to make breakthrough advances in cultivating farm-product varieties. The state ought to organize the agricultural S&T sector to tackle key S&T problems, by developing a batch of high-yield and quality varieties among staple farm products, such as rice, wheat, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, in order to meet the needs of structural change in farm-product demand during this period. B. We need to focus on developing resource-conservation, particularly land-conservation, agroproduction technology, with our main lines of attack, in addition to breeding, being areas, such as planting patterns, cultivation (breeding) technology, fertilizer-application technology, crop protection, and epidemic-disease prevention and control, to form a comprehensive, complete, and mature technology model for dissemination and application. C. We need to raise our farmers' S&T levels to new heights. We should develop agricultural high schools faster, utilizing all forms to run agrotechnology training classes. Through these measures, we should strive to raise in this period our ratio of agricultural growth from S&T applications to all agricultural growth from its current 30-40 percent to 50-60 percent. 4. We should set up a sound socialized-service system for agriculture. In the next 15 years, the state should vigorously support the building of a pre-, mid-, and post-production agricultural service-organization system. We suggest that the state select 100 counties a year from now on, with the Agricultural Policy Bank arranging 10 billion yuan in special loans, to be specially used to help all rural service organizations set up a group of service entities that integrate trade, inndustry, and agriculture, as well as cultivation, breeding, and manufacturing. This should promote the development of our whole rural economy. 5. We should open up small- and medium-sized cities faster, build small cities and towns in a planned way, and speed up the conversion of our agricultural workforce, to pave the way for an agricultural economy of scale. 6. We need to guide residents in a planned way to evolve a food-consumption structure with equal emphasis on plant and animal foods. Our studies show that as the economy develops, food-structure changes are roughly from mostly plant foods to mostly animal foods and then to an equal emphasis on plant and animal foods. But in order to resolve China's conflict of a shortage of agricultural resources while taking health into consideration, we suggest purposely detouring the mostly animal foods stage to go straight into the one of equal emphasis on plant and animal foods. So we suggest speeding up reform of our subsidized supply system for urban life-service facilities, to lower farm-product demand. This will include matters, such as thoroughly reforming our low-price consumption system for farm products, speeding up our housing commercialization, and raising our consumer prices for items, such as health care, urban transportation and communications, and nongovernmental energy use.
