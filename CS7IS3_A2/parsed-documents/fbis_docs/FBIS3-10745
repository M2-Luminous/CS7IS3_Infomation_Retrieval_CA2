Endara added that Aleman's appointment is backed by the Constitution. Cesar Quintero, constitutional expert and former Supreme Court justice, said the position of a minister without portfolio does not exist in presidential system governments like that of Panama but that it does exist in parliamentary governments. Quintero said the only precedent was in 1944 when the government of President Adolfo de la Guardia appointed Demetrio Porras as minister without portfolio, but for a relatively short time. This week, the board of directors of the Legislative Assembly said it will file a suit of unconstitutionality at the Supreme Court against President Endara for violating the Constitution and taking over functions he does not have by appointing a minister without portfolio. According to the president, Minister Aleman placed his position at the president's disposal on 8 March "to avoid problems and eliminate speculations." Endara did not accept the resignation and asked Aleman to remain in the post until the current presidential term ends. On 7 March the Legislative Assembly harshly questioned Presidency Minister Ivonne Young about this appointment. Since 9 February Aleman's name has appeared in the GACETA OFICIAL as minister without portfolio. "I think the legislators and the Assembly board of directors have been extremely unfair with Minister Young, because she was not the one who appointed Aleman. I appointed him," Endara said. He said the Constitution empowers him to appoint the ministers he considers necessary for the efficient functioning of his administration. "The legislators are mistaken. I do not have to consult with that government branch to appoint a minister, because the Constitution gives me the power to make these appointments," Endara said. Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino believes the minister without portfolio should not sign cabinet decrees and resolutions. "I am of the opinion that the president has the right to appoint all his advisers, but I do not think it is advisable for Aleman to be signing cabinet resolutions," he added.
