More than 500 delegates of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and its political wing, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), participated in the convention, which was held in southern Sudan and ended Friday, the sources said. SPLA leader Colonel John Garang attended. The conference was called in a bid to reinforce Garang's authority in the face of an internal power struggle with SPLA-United, a breakaway faction formed in 1991 and led by one of his former aides, Riek Machar. The sources said the conference's resolutions would be published in the next few days. They added that one of the meeting's objectives was to modify the SPLA charter, which stipulates that the rebels are fighting for a share of power within a united Sudan. The movement has in recent years shifted towards a separatist stance favouring a division of Sudan into two independent states -- a Moslem north and a Christian south. The SPLA and the Sudanese Government held brief and inconclusive talks last month in Nairobi within the framework of wider peace negotiations brokered by the regional Inter-Governmental Authority and Drought and Development, which comprises representatives from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. The negotiations are scheduled to resume mid-May.
