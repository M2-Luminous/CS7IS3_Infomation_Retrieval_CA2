What is the actual state of things? Official data are not published anywhere. [Hryb] According to Finance Minister Yanchuk, the foreign debt of Belarus, excluding interest, amounted to $1022.2 million as of 1 April 1994. Taking into account interest, our debt reaches $1288.5 million. The Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution on 26 February 1994, determining the ceiling of the debt at $2 billion. Aside from this, the issue of mutual debts among former Soviet republics remains unresolved. According to National Bank estimates, other republics owe us 25830.1 million Belarusian rubles. However, these issues have not been confirmed by appropriate commitments. Is this a lot or a little? The world practice uses the system of foreign debt evaluation. Its primary characteristic is the correlation between the sum of the foreign debt, the GNP, and yearly export revenues. When correlation between foreign debt and the GNP amounts to 50 percent, the situation is believed to be critical. If our foreign debt reached $2 billion, this figure would still be 29 percent, while in Bulgaria it is 111, in Poland 54, in Hungary 65, and in Turkey 51 percent respectively. If we compare the correlation between our foreign debt and export revenues, where 257 percent is considered to be the critical figure, it is currently only 37 percent, while in Bulgaria it is 203, in Hungary -- 157, in Poland -- 301, and in Turkey -- 193 percent respectively. Thus, the facts testify to the contrary.[passage omitted] [Reader from Minsk] Do you think that the dismissal of former Ministers Uladzimir Yahoraw and Eduard Shirkowski was just? If this is not a secret, how did you personally vote? [Hryb] The decision to dismiss those two ministers was made by the Supreme Soviet and not me personally. However both violated the laws of the Republic of Belarus on the procedure of detaining foreign citizens on our territory and extraditing foreign and Belarusian citizens. This had been done many times. We had warned the ministers but the latter did not draw any conclusions. Thus they received what they deserved. [passage omitted] [Reader from Vitebsk] As the Supreme Soviet chairman, do you consider yourself the guarantor of the observance of the Belarusian Constitution? Why were certain articles of the Constitution violated when the treaty on the unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems was being signed? Why did the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers remain silent? Why has Kebich not yet been sued? [Hryb] As the Supreme Soviet chairman I have done everything in my power to guarantee the protection and observance of the basic law of Belarus. The Supreme Soviet did not discuss the issue of the unification; it was not on the agenda. The agreement can become valid only following a ratification by the legislature. The Belarusian Prosecutor's Office has investigated whether the prime minister violated the Belarusian Constitution while signing the agreement. The case was closed because of a lack of corpus delicti.[passage omitted] [Reader from Minsk] Whom will we be electing -- a president or a governor general? After we have surrendered our National Bank and currency to Moscow, we will surrender our sovereignty too. This is evident. My second question is: Where does Kebich take money for all kinds of compensations, allowances, and the like? Who is financing his electoral campaign? [Hryb] The Supreme Soviet and I have already stated that we do not promote any of the candidates. It is each person's personal business for whom to vote. On the other hand, the money earmarked for the electoral campaign was equally divided among the candidates. In the event of any embezzlements, the Central Electoral Commission will sort things out.[passage omitted] [Reader from Minsk] I am worried and even enraged with the way signatures in support of Kebich were collected. Collective farm managers, village soviet chairmen, and all other empowered people scared people into signing the lists. Can these facts be investigated and those guilty punished? I am afraid that this may continue during the course of the elections -- there might be all kinds of fraud, pressure, or even unregistered ballot-boxes.... [Hryb] We have requested that Central Electoral Commission Chairman A. Abramovich investigate these facts.[passage omitted]
