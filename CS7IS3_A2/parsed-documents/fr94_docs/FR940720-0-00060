FR940720-0-00060 FR940720-0-00005 r. Section 86.159(r). Pennsylvania proposes at subsection (r) that, at the request of the applicant, the Department will maintain the confidentiality of the applicant's financial information and the terms and the conditions of the security interests unless it is allowed to be disclosed under other laws. There is no comparable Federal counterpart. These regulations implement Pennsylvania's statute at 52 P.S. §§1396.4 and 1406.6, which prohibit such disclosure. Therefore, the Director finds that the rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. s. Section 86.159(s). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (s) that applications for a self-bond and each annual update of a self-bond shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $900. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, in a comparable Federal rule at 30 CFR 777.17, permit fees are allowed so long as they do not exceed the costs to the regulatory authority. Pursuant to the October 10, 1987, Pennsylvania Bulletin, Pennsylvania stated that the $900 fee was needed to cover the costs of reviewing and verifying the application and to obtain the services of an outside consultant to analyze the applicant's eligibility or continuing eligibility. Therefore, the Director finds that the fee is reimbursement of the costs to Pennsylvania and finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. t. Section 86.159(t). Proposed subsection (t) establishes the regulatory authority of the Department to seek remedies against a permittee or applicant apart from those specifically set forth in the proposed self-bonding rules. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, it is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations because it clarifies that the remedies under SMCRA are not the only ones available to Pennsylvania. u. Section 86.166(b). Pennsylvania is revising this paragraph to correct the rule reference concerning release of bonds from ``Part 4 of this subchapter'' to ``86.170&hyph;86.173 (relating to release of bonds).'' The Director finds that this revision is nonsubstantive in nature and will not render the Pennsylvania program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. v. Section 86.166(c). Pennsylvania prohibited a permittee from replacing its existing bond with a self-bond. Pennsylvania is now proposing to delete this prohibition. Since the corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.30(a) allows permittees to replace existing bonds with other bonds that provide equivalent coverage, the Director finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than the Federal rule. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(ii)(i), the Director solicited comments from various Federal and State agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Pennsylvania program. The Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), commented that the proposed amendment would have no effect on MSHA operations or regulations. The Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that the proposed changes would not have any significant effects on the environmental integrity of the regulations. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded that they had no comments.
