The Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau here in the past developed the designs on which the Russian high-speed river and maritime fleet was based -- the famous Raketas, Meteors, Voskhods, and Kolkhidas. R. Alekseyev, chief hydrofoil designer, for whom this central design bureau is now named, was a pioneer of this work. Only comparatively recently did it become known that a fundamentally new type of hydrofoil was created under his direction back in the sixties -- the wing-in-ground effect vehicle. Whereas hydrofoils can develop speeds of up to 120 kph [kilometers per hour], a WIG craft has almost the speed of an aircraft -- up to 600 kph. In moving over the surface this vessel seems to break free from the water and hover above the surface. A huge advantage is that it is not necessary to build expensive take-off and landing strips for WIG craft; they can be based on water and on shore alike. The WIG craft can move over ice or a snowy surface and surmount any barriers. The WIG craft, if it is successfully introduced, promises a real "transport breakthrough." According to specialists' assessments, the WIG craft belongs to the class of 21st century flying machines, and in this field we are at least 20-25 years ahead of many countries. "Yes, we are the pioneers in the creation of WIG craft, but in recent times we have increasingly become aware of Western rivals 'breathing down our necks,'" Doctor of Technical Sciences A. Maskalik says. "If urgent measures are not taken, we could lose the advantage altogether. We have already designed and successfully tested WIG craft weighing up to 500 tonnes which can easily take off from, and land on, waves up to three meters high." At the "Volga" plant a huge craft with towering, gleaming, duralumin sides stands on the building slipway. It is 77 meters long, with a wingspan of 42 meters; the largest dimensions of the fuselage are equal to those of a six-story block. This craft was ordered by the military and is more than 80 percent ready. But work has been mothballed for almost two years. There was serious talk about whether to ax the craft altogether.... In three decades the Nizhniy Novgorod plant has been allocated funds for the entire "WIG program" which would suffice for only half the cost of a single Il-76 aircraft. In his time R. Alekseyev managed to bring together many talented young specialists, made it possible to create the first studies for the new flying machines to the highest standard. In recent years, because of a lack of funding, many of those who pioneered this work have been forced to leave the collective. Almost 150 designers and project workers now work in the "Tekhnologiya i transport" joint-stock company, developing marine WIG craft of various capacities to meet an order from a foreign firm. Some $2 million has been poured into this project, and the first test models should be manufactured and tested next year. The Nizhniy Novgorod Aviation Plant is involved in the creation of small WIG patrol craft [ekranoplany-katery].... Maybe this is for the best -- the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau will have competitors, which promises the speediest assimilation of the new flying technology. On the other hand, the efforts of the specialists have been dissipated, and the very rich scientific potential has been diluted. But one thing is indisputable -- we must not lose our edge in WIG building. At the same time, many firms in the United States, France, Germany, and Japan are ready to join in the development of new WIG craft with payloads of 1,500 tonnes. Talks on such cooperation are under way. I climbed together with V. Kirillov, the project's chief designer, onto the building slipway of the half-built "Spasatel," which occupied almost the whole of a workshop several football fields in length. The "Spasatel" weighs 390 tonnes; it has a speed of up to 550 kph and a range of 3,000-4,000 km; the craft can carry up to 500 people. As my companion remarked, the "Spasatel" has the dimensions of the well-known "Ruslan" and "Mriya" aircraft. A hospital with an operating theater and a resuscitation ward are envisaged here, and also a special treatment post for providing aid to people injured as a result of accidents in nuclear power installations or in chemical strikes. The crew is equipped with inflatable boats, ladders, and other rescue apparatus for operations in conditions of strong sea gales. All the same, the new WIG craft for peaceful purposes does not yet have as rosy a future as one would like. The point is that, effectively, these flying machines could be used in the form of combined units consisting of three craft. The total requirement for them in the initial period is at least 15 or so vessels, but this already means profitable series production. But at the moment the "Volga" plant complains of a shortage of funds, which the Ministry of Defense is dishing out in overly small portions. Meanwhile Russia's first "Spasatel," which is awaited on the seas, is scheduled to leave the slipway this year.
