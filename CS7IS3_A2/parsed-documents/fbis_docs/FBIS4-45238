FBIS4-45238 "jptdd023__l94082" JPRS-TDD-94-023-L JPRS Narcotics 1 June 1994 WEST EUROPE PORTUGAL Paper Publishes Statistics on Used Needle Exchange Program Paper Publishes Statistics on Used Needle Exchange Program 94P20789 94P20789 CSO [Editorial Report] According to the 30 April Lisbon daily EXPRESSO, in three months Portuguese drug addicts exchanged in pharmacies almost half a million used needles within the context of the operation "Say No to a Second-Hand Needle." Launched by the National Commission Against AIDS in cooperation with the National Pharmacies Association, the campaign, which took place between October and December 1993, involved most of the institutions charged with combating AIDS and drug addiction. Pharmacies made available to drug addicts 610,000 kits containing a sterile needle, an alcohol-soaked pad and a condom, accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet. The kit was exchanged for a used needle. The report compiled about the operation revealed that 57.5 percent of the 446,920 needles were collected in the Lisbon area. Some 20 percent came from Porto, 12 percent from Setubal, 5.2 percent from Braga, 4 percent from Faro, 0.9 percent from Leiria, and 0.4 percent from the rest of the country. Even if it is not possible to extrapolate from these figures, it seems that official estimates concerning the proliferation of drug addiction and the AIDS virus are well below real figures. According to the National Commission Against AIDS, only 1,416 cases of infection were detected until September of last year, 289 of which were among drug addicts.
