As was reported earlier, Varga won the mandate in the May 29 elections by 10 votes, ahead of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] candidate Gyorgy Rasko, who subsequently asked for a re-count by the National Election Committee. Based on this re-count, in which the committee re-classified several invalid votes as valid, and invalidated several valid votes, Rasko ended up in first place. According to Varga's information, there were many ballots among those examined by the committee and classified valid which should be invalid under the electoral law. If the Supreme Court decides on the matter this Thursday, the National Election Committee will declare the final official result of the elections that evening.
