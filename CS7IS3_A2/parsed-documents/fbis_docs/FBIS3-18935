Maroni for Prime Minister"] [Text] Milan -- What a strange couple, [Northern League leader] Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, the two roosters of the "pole for freedoms." They are so different as to seem like opposites -- and not only politically. [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, has this contrast not been deliberately studied in order to create a great force? Are you and Berlusconi playing a game? An attack Monday [7 March], a reply and an explanation Tuesday, so that all the newspapers and television talk about is you? [Bossi] Definitely not. What is at stake here is clarity with respect to the voters. We are not selling washing powder. We have to clarify what the League is, what Forza Italia is, and what the pact means. True, there are some good things, because they emerge when revolutions take the right direction. But while some people want to move directly to the new, some would take the first side turning. [Da Rold] People are confused after the things that you have said about Berlusconi. The opinion polls show you in a strong position. But further questions are arising, for instance about the next prime minister. [Bossi] Not Berlusconi. And I will add nothing further to that. Even he should realize that. I repeat: It must be [League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni, a League member. Somebody asked me whether Berlusconi belongs to P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge]. I said that that is what I read in the newspapers. Then I was asked whether a P2 member can become prime minister. And I said, and I still say, "no." [Da Rold] But how much trust is there among you allies? [Bossi] Let us be clear: Berlusconi is smart. But he is also unscrupulous, as I am, for that matter. So unscrupulous as to use different and conflicting tactics in order to win. However, the point is this: In the long term, Berlusconi is part of a blueprint for freedom. But only as long as the League is at the helm of change. [Da Rold] What is your opinion of Berlusconi's promises? For instance, his pledge to create a million new jobs? [Bossi] Well, we never make such promises. I am talking about selling detergent. Of course, it can be done on certain conditions. But to create a million jobs in such a disastrous situation seems to me definitely an old-fashioned way of waging the electoral battle. [Da Rold] Are you, as a "pole," sure of being able to guarantee the country's governability? [Bossi] Yes. The League's men who are governing in the major cities are demonstrating a great sense of commitment. They are honest people. We have a great contribution to make: pragmatism. [Da Rold] So please be pragmatic too on the subject of trust among allies. Would you buy a used car from [Forza Italia economist] Antonio Martino? [Bossi] I do not know him personally. So I cannot answer that. [Da Rold] But would you sell Berlusconi a used car? [Bossi] Well, yes... I am fairly honest in such matters relating to ordinary life. [Da Rold] How will you succeed in "selling" Berlusconi federalism, the League's precious merchandise? [Bossi] If in the proportional vote the North votes for the League, then there will be genuine economic liberalism. Within the "pole" there will be those whose task will be to moderate us with regard to the kind of federalism. But we must set the pace. [Da Rold] Would you use the same argument with [National Alliance leader] Fini? [Bossi] No, not Fini. The fascists can have no place in the country's future. They come from the darkness and obscurity of history. [Da Rold] Tell me honestly, Senator. Do you think that Berlusconi has dimmed your political image? Do you feel like you have been scaled down? [Bossi] I engage in politics because I believe in a certain ideal. I am not concerned about power. Berlusconi was born to attack the League and to join with the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. And thus to form the moderate pole. Set against the left-wing pole, that pole could permit itself to recycle the entire political class of the past. He has failed in this plan. They therefore tried to present us with a project involving Segni and Forza Italia and to force us into a corner. So first we pretended to form an alliance with Segni, then we returned him to sender, to the DC. Thus Berlusconi was left in a strait jacket, because of the 70 percent of seats due to us. No, Berlusconi does not bother me. [Da Rold] But is it true that you will soon be appearing on television partly because Berlusconi suggested that you do so? [Bossi] Berlusconi cannot make any suggestions to me. I think that television is useful until the election campaign comes. Then the die is cast. It is the public, direct contact; people must experience you at close quarters in order to grant you their votes. It is not enough to make appearances covered in makeup, amid blue skies and clouds, like God Almighty, in order to gain votes. People will give you their votes if they can touch you and see that you are sincere. [Da Rold] You are two strange people, you and Berlusconi -- different, but both with failed marriages behind you. And yet you both talk about the family in your programs and speeches. [Bossi] I do not consider myself perfect. Not everything turns out perfectly. But I now feel that I have a wonderful family. And I am happy. [Da Rold] Would you send your children to private schools? [Bossi] I would indeed. They can play a major role in a modern state. I am thinking about the American universities, with a foundation next door. I am not thinking about state money, public money, for private education. I have in mind a qualitative role for private education. [Da Rold] But would you go to a public hospital or to a private clinic? [Bossi] There is no question. I am an expert on the subject. I would choose a public hospital. [Da Rold] What awaits you at Pontida [League rally venue] on 10 April, after the elections? [Bossi] If nobody wins, a constituent legislature will inevitably be established. But I do not think that this will happen, so it could be a long legislative term. Pontida will be an occasion for celebration. Because the League will score a great victory.
