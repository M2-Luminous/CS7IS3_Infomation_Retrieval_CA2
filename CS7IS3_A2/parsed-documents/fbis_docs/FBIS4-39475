They Are Not Regulated at Federal Level, But Regional Regulation Exists and Is Producing Good Results"] [Text] As is well known, the state now no longer sets prices for any goods -- be they industrial or consumer goods. (With the exception of energy prices.) But the regions are entitled to regulate food prices. And, in my view, this rule has been very successful -- and entirely justified -- in many areas. Provided, needless to say, that the bare formula of reform is not followed, but is given some real content. This April there was price regulation of foodstuffs in 104 cities (out of the 132 surveyed by the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics). Needless to say, the level of influence exerted by the local administration on price regulation varied from region to region. Thus, in the cities of the Volga-Vyatka and North Caucasus regions prices of all the most important foodstuffs were regulated. In the Northern and Northwest regions this process was restricted to a few cities -- Cherepovets, Pskov, and the cities of the Komi Republic. I would like to quote a few figures from the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics which show just what foodstuffs were of particular concern to local administrations. Milk prices were regulated in 69 percent of the cities surveyed by the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics. Beef prices were regulated in 45 percent of cities, and cooked sausage prices in 42 percent. The question naturally arises -- just how do local administrations manage to hold down price growth? The most widespread form of price regulation (around 50 percent of all price regulation) is to limit the size of trading organizations' markups. The profitability of food industry enterprises is controlled in approximately 5 percent of cities. Consequently, there are some sharp difference in food prices in different regions. For instance, in mid-May the average cost of a basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs was 51,100 rubles [R] (over the month). The price of the same basket in Moscow was more than R55,000. The basket is still cheapest in Ulyanovsk -- at R30,000. It is slightly more in Chistopol (R35,000) and Lipetsk (R36,000).
