[Lamassoure] Our relations with Ukraine, which were established from the very start of Ukrainian independence, are developing at a satisfactory level. My visit is a concrete manifestation of the interest in your country, an interest that has never faded in France. We know that Ukraine is going through an uncommon period when the population experiences great difficulties. We realize that the road toward a market economy cannot be covered overnight. The transitional period is always quite long and difficult. However, as follows from experience, the longer important decisions are delayed, the longer and more difficult the road will be. We, therefore, hope that Ukraine develops, as soon as possible, its own economic program, which will enable it to receive international assistance. [Savtsov] What specific trends are there in our cooperation? [Lamassoure] France is an active participant in the G-7 highly developed Western countries striving to improve nuclear safety in the CIS countries, and in particular in Ukraine. French public opinion is attentively following the danger to which the entire European continent and, first and foremost Ukraine, may be exposed by the continued operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Recent incidents have added to our concern. For this particular reason, the French authorities believe that it is necessary to reach an urgent decision, so that all reactors at Chernobyl can be closed down as soon as possible. G-7 has already looked into this issue during the summit in Munich in 1992, when a special fund was created for the purpose. Concern was also voiced at the 1993 summit in Tokyo. On our initiative, this issue will be among the principal ones on the agenda at the summit in Naples this coming July. However, the efficiency of the G-7's actions also depends upon the level of cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities. I want to assure you that, in any case, France will take an active part in the quest for a decision and in the work that will be conducted. Our methods of expert analysis and our know-how have been recognized by the entire international community. We will grant this know-how to Ukraine. There are many other spheres in which we can cooperate. The determination of policy in the area of power engineering, in particular, in energy conservation, may become a area for useful cooperation, because France has much experience in this field. I might also remind you about the assistance in the establishment of a law-governed state and of all the related institutions. We are also ready to take part in training specialists, in particular, the necessary personnel for a market economy. [Savtsov] Does our cooperation have a chance of expanding to European dimensions? [Lamassoure] We are very dedicated to European stability. In terms of its size and geographical situation, Ukraine is an important element in this stability. In January 1994, we welcomed your achievements in the sphere of disarmament. We hope that yet another step will be made after Ukraine ratifies the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine wants to live in peace with its neighbors. That is why we are pleased with your government's participation in the constituent conference dealing with the European Stability Pact, which will be held in Paris at the end of May. The European Union has adopted the French initiative, which is expected to help on finding pragmatic solutions to problems that may arise between the states of central and eastern Europe, more specifically, on minorities issues. We want Ukraine to take an active part in resolving these problems. [Savtsov] Thank you for the interview.
