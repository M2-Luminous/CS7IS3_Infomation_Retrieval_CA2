Cela article: "Can Radio and Television That Speak Albanian Be Considered Albanian?"] [Text] The situation that the independent and opposition Albanian press is experiencing is among the most difficult, or, not to mince words, most alarming that it has ever experienced. Journalists were not as much under threat as they are today even in the days when the system was changing, in the first days of pluralism, nor in the days of severe political tensions with strikes and upheavals. When we say that we have won freedom today, have gained democracy, and no longer live under a dictatorship, we nevertheless have many more journalists before the courts, in the prosecutors' offices, and in prison. We have today more journalists than ever before hit on the head with iron bars, and a journalist is frightened to walk on the street lest he be charged and imprisoned for stepping over the white lines. A journalist today is frightened of drinking coffee with an acquaintance, because he can be charged and imprisoned as an accomplice, and you cannot say that someone in power is incompetent because you will be charged and imprisoned for slander. Thus, journalists are under greater threat today than ever. These threats come from two directions, from the state and the street -- from the state with handcuffs for the wrists, and from the street with an iron bar for the head. To make known and protest these threats, the Professional Journalists Association held a news conference last Saturday [12 March] for Albanian and foreign journalists and representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited to Tirana, a news conference widely reported by some Albanian newspapers. However, what made a greater impression was the way in which the state media handled it. Albanian Television, which had its journalists present in the hall, did not report a single word about this news conference that was so important for the threatened journalists, not a word about extreme and unjust prison sentences, and not a word about physical menaces. Meanwhile, the BBC's Albanian language service from London devoted a prominent eight-minute feature to the news conference, with interviews with participants. The ET3 television station also came to Tirana from Greece with a camera and a microphone, interviewing the association's chairman, Prec Zogaj, and presidium member Aleksander Frangaj, who had spent one month in prison. Albanian Radio-Television's [RTSh] ridiculousness is thus obvious: It does not report problems that worry the independent and opposition press or death threats against these journalists. Europe, London, and Athens turn out to be closer than Tirana (by Tirana, I mean RTSh). Who is it who is making Albanian journalists beholden to foreign associations, newspapers, and radio and television stations and making them say, "Shame on Tirana?" Who are these people who are sullying the name of RTSh, obliging Albanians to turn away from the only Albanian channel and watch and listen to foreign stations to find out what is happening in Albania? Seen from this point of view, the question inevitably arises of whether the only radio and television station that speaks Albanian can be considered Albanian. It is a real scandal that today, when it is claimed that something has been won in the direction of freedom, Albanians should huddle around foreign radio stations in order to find out what is happening in Albania. It reminds one precisely of the early days of changes in Albania, when we were working to bring down the dictatorship, and when Albanians gathered at home at 1830 in order to listen to Voice of America as the only station that then reported developments and activities of those who were in opposition to the state and were working against the dictatorship. At that time, RTSh defended that state and the dictatorship. Today too, RTSh defends the state. The opposition, independent thinking, and events or activities that comment on or conflict with the political regime of today can only be learned about on foreign stations. This shows that this regime is scared of the truth.
