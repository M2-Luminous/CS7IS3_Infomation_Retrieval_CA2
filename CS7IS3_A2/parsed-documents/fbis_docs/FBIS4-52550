Korea Urged" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Choe Yong-su, chief of the Organisation of Korean Residents in Russia, demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea in a statement supporting the appeal of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland to the 70 million fellow countrymen to avert the danger of a nuclear war and pave the way for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification. "The basic cause of the danger of war in Korea and national division lies in the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK and its domination and interference in South Korea," he noted, and said: "The U.S. authorities must stop maneuvering to stifle the DPRK and encouraging the South Korean authorities and immediately withdraw from South Korea, taking along their forces and nuclear weapons." "The danger of war created on the Korean peninsula today is an inevitable offspring of the treacherous policy of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which has sought only confrontation and war, discarding independence, the life and soul of the nation, and dreaming the anachronistic dream of `unification through Northward invasion'", he stated, and said: "The South Korean authorities blocked the progress of the DPRK- U.S. talks by deliberately breaking up the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and are openly agitating a war against the North, crying for `chastisement' and `an opportunity of unification'". He called upon all the parties, groupings and people of broad sections in South Korea and overseas compatriots to rise up as one in the struggle to remove the treacherous forces pursuing the policy of depending on outside forces and defend the independence of the nation.
