Last Wednesday, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, former president of the National Human Rights Commission, the new peace commissioner for Chiapas, replacing Manuel Camacho Solis, who resigned on 16 June. Zedillo said Madrazo's appointment "confirms the government's determination that the dialogue, negotiations, and political solution must be the options to attain a definitive peace soon, one with justice." The presidential candidate of the PRI, which has been in power since 1929, considered it an obligation to support the tasks of the government and the new commissioner for peace in the southeastern Mexican Chiapas State, in which the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) staged a rebellion on 1 January. Zedillo's endorsement of the negotiations came after he strongly criticized Camacho Solis for the EZLN's refusal of the government offer, which the former commissioner presented as an official success, according to the PRI candidate. Camacho Solis resigned because he considered Zedillo's criticism of his work a discredit. Zedillo had said his criticism reflected the feelings of numerous Mexican sectors.
