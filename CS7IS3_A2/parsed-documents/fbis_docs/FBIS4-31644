After all, it is public knowledge that there is no love lost between the Liberals [Liberal Democratic Congress, KLD] and Unionists [Democratic Union, UD] in Krakow.... [Tusk] If it were just a question of feelings and emotions, my presence here would not change anything at all. You cannot influence the way people feel about one another. [Janowska] But we are not talking about feelings: We are talking about political facts. As recently as a few weeks ago, UD and KLD activists in Krakow fought each other over the influence each group wanted to wield in local self-government structures over questions of economic policy. Now, with the drafting of the joint list of candidates for positions in local self-government, the UD candidates were forced to give way to the Liberals, which was not conducive to promoting good relations between the two groups. [Tusk] This phenomenon is not restricted exclusively to Krakow. Problems with integration within the Union of Freedom occur throughout Poland because, as we know, the two groups involved have often followed very different paths. We assumed from the very beginning that, owing to the frequency and intensity of contacts and a different level of conflicts, we would achieve the optimum consensus at the top--that is, in Warsaw--sooner than anywhere else. This assumption has proved correct. On the other hand, sparks tend to fly more often in local circles because of their past experience with local self-government affairs or because of personal considerations. However, I would prefer not to overestimate their significance. [Janowska] Nevertheless, some local KLD activists claim that, fearing that they might disappear from the political stage, Messrs. Tusk and Bielecki have secured for themselves positions in the larger party. [Tusk] Of course, you have the right to form any opinion or arrive at any interpretation, especially when it comes to individual motives. However, we are bound by the party discipline, which obliges us to reason and act in unison. During the congress at which we decided on joining forces with UD, there were only a handful of votes--out of the total of 300 delegates--from abstainers or adversaries of the unification proposal. Liberals from all over the country decided to join forces with the Democratic Union and form a single party by a proportion of about 99 to 1. The subsequent presence and active participation of the Liberals during the unification congress confirmed this decision unequivocally. In addition, Krzysztof Bielecki, who holds the post of a high-ranking bank official in London, did not particularly depend on the outcome of the unification congress. In fact, neither did I--and it could even be said that I lost out by it because I had to give up the attractive position of party chairman in the process. [Janowska] But, instead, you gained the post of deputy chairman of a larger party, which actually commands seats in parliament. [Tusk] Even so, I do not automatically gain access to parliament by becoming a member of the Union of Freedom party. I believe that, contrary to the charges that have been brought against me, the conjunction with UD opens up the field for the activity of several thousand activists of the former KLD, who would otherwise have remained on the margins of political life. After all, the Liberals did not have any realistic chances of an independent victory in the local election anywhere apart from the Tri-City [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot]. [Janowska] Are you not afraid that the unification may increase the already considerable distance between the former KLD's central authorities and its local representatives? [Tusk] At the moment, my priority is to ensure the effectiveness of Union of Freedom policies rather than the comfortable situation of its members. Anyone who fails to tune in to the theme of our new music--that is, the construction of a new, strong party that will win the coming elections--will lose out in the party contest. Nevertheless, I am still moderately optimistic as regards the future, which also goes for the Krakow troubles. Everybody should be given time to readjust. [Janowska] Does this end to the rivalry between the activists of the two former parties mean that the KLD will ultimately merge into UD? [Tusk] I would be happiest if it meant that the former Congress and the former Union merge equally into the Union of Freedom. However, we cannot pretend that things are different from what they really are, and so we must accept that the former UD leaders will continue to play a leading role in places where the former UD was particularly strong. All the same, I do not regard this as a great problem, especially in Krakow, where the former UD circles were more akin to the KLD circles than they were in, say, Warsaw. I am inclined to treat the conjunction of UD and the KLD not as a union between two political parties but as a rapprochement between two separate tendencies that proved capable of pursuing the same philosophy on a number of issues. I trust that there will be no instances, either in Poland at large or, specifically, in Krakow, whereby either of these formerly separate tendencies refuses to participate actively in the life of the new party. On the other hand, it could happen that individual political figures will experience difficulty in carving a place for themselves within that new reality. But that is something that cannot be helped. [Janowska] How long will we have to wait for the actual, practical unification? [Tusk] During the unification congress we held in April, we allowed a year for that. The next national congress of the Union of Freedom will be preceded by a truly democratic internal party election. By April of next year, we will be able to say that the intraparty hierarchy has been determined according to the wishes of all Union of Freedom members. [Janowska] When will the Union of Freedom nominate its presidential candidate? We have already heard certain names being mentioned--such as Jacek Kuron, Leszek Balcerowicz, and Professor Andrzej Zoll. [Tusk] There is no need to nominate our candidate to the office of president today or even tomorrow. However, the Union of Freedom must begin to get used to the thought that it might be best to name a candidate representing several tendencies. I hope that the all-Poland congress of the Union of Freedom, scheduled for the spring of next year, will mark the moment of the official nomination of our candidate. For the time being, all speculation as to his name must remain just speculation.
