FBIS4-30172 "dreas122_c_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 North Korea Official Urges Japan To Renounce Policy Official Urges Japan To Renounce Policy SK2306103194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1014 GMT 23 Jun 94 SK2306103194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 21 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The Japanese minister of justice issued an "order" to keep a closer watch on the movements of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying "this is demanded by the situation". And the general director of the public security investigation agency cried that "it is necessary to take more perfect measures for investigation into the movements of Chongnyon than ever before". In this connection, Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, issued a statement on June 21. Pointing out that this revealed the undisguised intention of the Japanese Government authorities to antagonize the DPRK and suppress and control Chongnyon at any cost, under the pretext of the fictitious "suspected nuclear development", Paek Han-ki said: "Such anachronistic words rolled off their tongues freely at a time when efforts are being made to solve the nuclear issue and ease the tensions on the Korean peninsula through dialogue between the DPRK and the USA. This is intended to aggravate the tension, going against the situation, and is an intolerable hostile act toward the Korean people and Chongnyon. "The Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon sternly protests and denounces with bitter national indignation the hostile policy of the Japanese Government authorities to suppress and control Chongnyon at whatever cost. "We strongly demand that the Japanese Government authorities, particularly the public security authorities, immediately withdraw the "instructions" and stop the hostile policy toward the DPRK and the suppressive policy against Chongnyon."
