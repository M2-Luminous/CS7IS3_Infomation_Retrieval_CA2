Group of Favorites Well-Known. Appearance of `Dark Horse' Unlikely"] [Text] In an interview that Boris Yeltsin gave IZVESTIYA late last week, the head of state confirmed his determination to hold national presidential elections in 1996. One can conclude from what he said that the Russian president only sees himself taking part in these elections as a voter. Thus, there is every reason to conclude that last Friday [25 March], B. Yeltsin effectively announced the start of a two-year presidential race. At the same time other, albeit less important, events last week make it possible to speak of a new political situation that is developing in the country today and in which the election campaign will most likely be held, and also to talk about the most likely favorites. These events include the continuing scandal over the anonymous coup d'etat scenario, A. Shokhin's appointment to oversee the economy [kurator ekonomiki], the developing squabble over the new customs duties on imported agricultural produce, and the State Duma's proposal to stage a vote of no-confidence in the government, Analysis of all these and other events gives grounds for the following conclusion: The structurization of the main political forces is coming to an end in Russia. It is not the clash of individual political figures' personal interests and ambitions that is starting to have overwhelming importance in politics (although that does still happen), but the clash of group interests, and it is only as a result that conflicts arise between the politicians that voice these interests. For instance, the Moscow mayor's continuing attacks on the government do not mean that Yu. Luzhkov personally cannot bear A. Zaveryukha. There has been an obvious clash of interests on the one hand between the agrarian lobby led by the vice premier and national commercial capital on the other led by the Moscow mayor. Things are roughly the same regarding the scandal over the coup scenario. For some reason, observers who have discussed this subject have failed to notice a strange coincidence: The scandal precisely coincided not only with the president's vacation, but also with the end of the work to finalize the draft federal budget. Although you might recall that it was the president's refusal to sign the proinflationary budget law adopted by the former Supreme Soviet that preceded his decision to sign Edict 1400. As you know, the current draft federal budget severely infringes the interests of the military-industrial complex and a considerable proportion of the processing industry. Reports from informed sources indicate that serious conflicts have arisen over this between V. Chernomyrdin, who champions, as you know, the interests of the fuel and energy complex, and O. Soskovets and Yu. Skokov. Although in the past V. Chernomyrdin had put forward O. Soskovets for first vice prime minister. All these names feature among the coup scenario's top men. It is therefore logical to at least conclude that the appearance of the provocative pamphlets was highly opportune. A. Shokhin's appointment late last week to head the economy, a post vacant following Ye. Gaydar's resignation, must obviously be regarded as the final round of the squabble. An effective counterbalance has been created in the person of the minister of the economy to the first vice premier who voices the interests of the industrial and military-industrial lobby, interests that are incompatible with those of the oil and gas lobby. Presumably following the president's announcement opening the election campaign, the fighting over the budget will worsen still further since some of the money that has been channeled into economic sectors as a result will be used by rival groups to conduct the presidential campaign. The impressive force of Russian banking capital did not stay aloof from political life last week either. The "12 December" parliamentary group, which voices the interests of some banking circles, declared B. Fedorov as its leader. Its former leaders -- A. Braginskiy and I. Khakamada -- have become the group's deputy leaders. Here, too, we can see that interests are being structurally formulated. It is thus easy to conclude that a new stage of development is starting for Russian postcommunist society. Society is becoming increasingly structured. The lone politicians whose personal abilities recently enabled them to soar to the Russian political heights are becoming a thing of the past, giving way to figures backing the interests of departments, economic sectors, and, lastly, major social strata. In this respect it is no accident that we are seeing many political "stars" wane. It is not individuals, but political-economic groups that have joined the fight for power and are forming society's political infrastructure. At the moment this struggle is not being conducted in an entirely civilized manner. Not by means of rivalry between parliamentary parties and the formation of a coalition government, but rather by lobbying, by putting pressure on top state officials. To make up for it the first positive factor in this new stage for Russia, where everything is always unpredictable, seems indisputable: The actions of leaders trying to influence the choice of the country's political and economic course are becoming predictable. Since the interests of the groups behind them are predictable. The time of political intriguers seems to be passing for Russia and the time of serious politicians is coming. And this in turn means that it is unlikely that a "dark horse" will appear among the group of favorites in the presidential race. In effect, this very group of favorites can already be said to have formed today. The central figure there is undoubtedly V. Chernomyrdin, who is backed not only by the major Russian oil and gas companies which bring the country around 80 percent of its export revenue, but also the executive apparatus. Yu. Luzhkov, who has the backing of a considerable proportion of our national commercial and banking capital, has taken up position slightly to the right of the former. With B. Fedorov most likely on the very far right. The situation on the opposite, left side of the starting line, where heavy industry, the military-industrial complex, and structures engaged in arms exports, are to set their participants, is more complex. The strongest candidate here is Yu. Skokov. However, he has little chance of reaching the finishing line first, primarily owing to his characteristic style as an "inaccessible" [zakrytyy] politician. The "Zemskiy Sobor" scenario that Deputy V. Isakov proposed in the past would be more promising for Yu. Skokov. But judging by B. Yeltsin's interview with IZVESITYA, that is ruled out. Thus, the "military-industrial complex team" will most likely have to choose between two politicians who have expressed a desire to defend its colors. Namely V. Zhirinovskiy and A. Rutskoy. The final choice will presumably fall on the person who most convincingly proves his loyalty to the team, as well as his manageability and predictability. Amid this group of favorites V. Chernomyrdin looks the main contender for victory. If only because experience of all manner of elections and referendums held in Russia over the last two years shows that contests are won by the man who is able to rely on the state apparatus and has budget funds at his disposal. But two major factors will work against the premier. First, he will be constantly threatened with the possibility of the Duma's staging a vote of no-confidence in the government. The first proposal of this kind by I. Muravyev, member of the "New Regional Policy" faction, last week was just a trial shot. Such attempts should be expected to increase in the future particularly if the other participants in the contest agree among themselves to join forces in toppling their most dangerous rival. But an even more serious factor that may effectively work against the prime minister will of course be the state of the Russian economy on the eve of the elections. One is bound to bear in mind the specific nature of Russian voters, who, as the results of the 12 December elections showed, vote "against" rather than "for." So if the economic situation has not improved by the time the elections are held, one should not rule out the idea that most voters will vote against V. Chernomyrdin and the existing regime and vote for A. Rutskoy or V. Zhirinovskiy, otherwise, they will vote against the threat of war and political instability.
