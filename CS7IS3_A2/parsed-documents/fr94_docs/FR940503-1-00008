FR940503-1-00008 FR940503-1-00002 Novel or Unusual Design Features The Model 45 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays, an electronically controlled braking system, digital electronic engine controls, an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS), multifunction display, and a digital autopilot/flight director system. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane. Discussion The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (§25.581), and the other for fuel system protection (§25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protection of electrical and electronic systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane. There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are proposed for the Lear Model 45, which would require that new technology electrical and electronic systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF. Lightning To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, Protection of Aircraft Electrical/Electronics Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee. The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20&hyph;53A, will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding, airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, test (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation) and/or verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems. The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility to upset and/or malfunction. To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required: 1. First Return Stroke: (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment ``hardness'' level. 2. Multiple Stroke Flash: (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of 50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints: (1) The minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms. An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system under evaluation. 3. Multiple Burst: (Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise, short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset to some digital processing systems. The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order to be used. This ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds. The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) The minimum period between bursts is 30ms, and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined below. The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H). These components are defined by the following double exponential equation: i(t)=I o (e ^at -e ^bt ) where: t = time in seconds, i = current in amperes, and ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1Severe strike (component A) 1Restrike (component D) 1Multiple stroke (1/2 component D) 1Multiple burst (component H) I o , amp = 218,810 109,405 54,703 10,572 a, sec ^1 = 11,354 22,708 22,708 187,191 b, sec ^1 = 647,265 1,294,530 1,294,530 19,105,100 + 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ 5 This equation produces the following characteristics: 0 i peak = 200 KA 100 KA 50 KA 10 KA 5 and, 0 (di/dt) max (amp/sec) = 1.4 × 10 11 1.4 × 10 11 0.7 × 10 11 2.0 × 10 11 ␣ = @t=0+sec @t=0+sec @t=0+sec @t=0+sec (di/dt), (amp/sec) = 1.0 × 10 11 1.0 × 10 11 0.5 × 10 11 ␣ = @t=.5μs @t=.25μs @t=.25μs Action Integral (amp 2 sec) = 2.0 × 10 6 0.25 × 10 6 0.0625 × 10 6
