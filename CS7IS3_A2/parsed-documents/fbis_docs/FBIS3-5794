Edi told a military seminar on Wednesday that the national leadership succession will be one of the most critical issues facing the nation in the coming years, along with democracy and human rights. ABRI's task will be to ensure that the transfer of power takes place in a constitutional manner, said Edi, a retired army general who headed ABRI for a brief period last year. This is the nearest admission by the military regarding the likelihood that President Suharto will relinquish power at the end of this, his sixth five year term in office, in 1998. The ruling political organization Golkar [Functional Group] has declined to be drawn into the succession debate, saying that it was unethical, preferring to leave it until nearer the time of the next election in 1998. Edi's statement followed remarks made by the incumbent himself that he had no intention of remaining president for life and that he would know when to step aside. Suharto is now 72 years old. Edi also made the point in his speech on Wednesday. "Whatever happens, the national leadership succession process must get underway because the time has come for that." He expressed appreciation for Suharto's long service to the country, but pointed out that succession was inevitable because nobody could hold the post forever. The remarks were made during a gathering of middle and senior ranking ABRI officers organized by the Army's Strategic Reserves Command, an elite force once headed by Suharto. The meeting was held to mark the command's 33rd anniversary. Edi said in his speech that ABRI must continue to attempt to define its position and role in the nation, especially to ensure the success of the next 25-year long term development which begins on April 1. "ABRI always stands above the interests of all social, ethnic and religious groups," he said. "Its chief task is to maintain national unity and cohesion and it must fight for the interests of the people." The military must play an active role in national development and set a positive example for the rest of society, he said. He warned that the problems facing the nation will become even more complicated in the coming years, but cautioned the military to remain loyal to its oath and motto. He also said that ABRI must continue to be loyal to the state ideology Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. History has shown ABRI's important role in the nation's life and this will remain true in the future, he added. The minister also discussed the allegation that certain groups in society now seek to replace Pancasila with other ideologies, notably liberalism. "We have to remain vigilant. History has shown that liberal democracy, which Indonesia adopted in the early 1950s, was doomed to failure," he said. "It does not fit with the nation's identity." He did not specifically name the groups but said that vocal opposition exists to the security approach to development and ABRI's role in politics. Edi said the government has no intention of loosening its security grip in the coming years because such an approach was still necessary to ensure development, economic growth and a more equitable distribution of income. The aversion of some people to security baffled him, he said, stressing that people are concerned with security every day.
