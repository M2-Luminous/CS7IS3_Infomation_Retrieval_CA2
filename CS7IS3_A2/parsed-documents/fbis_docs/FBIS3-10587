But the Lower Chamber does want the island to take a number of measures in order to greatly improve the standard of government. Minister Hirsch Ballin (Netherlands Antilles and Aruban affairs) was pleased yesterday evening by Parliament's response. "The protracted mock battle on possible independence is no solution to the problems which Aruba is currently facing." CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal] deputy Bijleveld-Schouten yesterday summarized the position: "Sound and honest government in Aruba is of the utmost importance. Also with regard to the situation in the Netherlands Antilles." The date for independence of 1 January 1996 was laid down in the Kingdom statutes when Aruba broke away from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and achieved separate status. Aruba does not now want independence as the island fears that it will cause foreign investors to pull out. Next week the Upper House must decide whether Aruba will be allowed to remain within the Kingdom.
