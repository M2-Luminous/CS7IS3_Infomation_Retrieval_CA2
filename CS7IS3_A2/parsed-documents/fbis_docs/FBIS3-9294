This prompted the commune authorities and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to intensify negotiations on the exchange of prisoners. Late last night a meeting took place between our negotiating team -- Edo Godinjak, a representative of the republican Interior Ministry, Nedir Hadzic, the commander of the 9th Hill Brigade, and Brigadier Ajnadzic, who heads the team -- and representatives of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] headed by Commander Santana. At the very beginning of the meeting, Brigadier Ajnadzic made a goodwill gesture by offering several concessions to the aggressor side in order finally to deblock the process of exchanging prisoners from Silos for the 189 missing Hadzici citizens, which has generally been the toughest issue in the negotiations between [Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina Haris] Silajdzic and [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo] Krajisnik. It was agreed that today three prisoners from Silos prison would be exchanged for three prisoners from Kula. Four captured aggressor soldiers, which the prisoners in Silos elected themselves, were permitted to attend last night's meeting. Brigadier Ajnadzic proposed that a meeting be arranged on the free territory of the Hadzici commune between the representatives of four families of the captured aggressor soldiers with the families of the missing Hadzici citizens. Moreover, all the Serbian representatives will be allowed to visit the prisoners in Silos. It was also decided that from today [23 March], the prisoners from Silos would be allowed to establish telephone contact with [words indistinct] with families in Hadzici. Mr. Santana expressed his gratitude for our delegation's concessions, and did not hide his dissatisfaction with the uncooperative attitude of the aggressor side, saying that he had the impression that it was not interested in the exchange, something that cannot be said for the family members of the Silos prisoners. Edo Godinjak, representative of the republican Interior Ministry, promised the UNPROFOR representatives that, in the course of the day, he would submit to them substantial documented video material that the republican Interior Ministry had obtained, which documents the ways, places, and those responsible for capturing the 189 Bosniak Muslim citizens of Hadzici. This material will help Captain Mason, who heads UNPROFOR's investigative team, locate the missing persons. According to Mr. Godinjak, Ratko Radic, Zoran Gasevic, Rade Veselinovic, Kiro Glagas, and Mladen Tolj participated in the capture of the missing persons. Commander of the 9th Hill Brigade Nedir Hadzic expressed his readiness to go ahead with an immediate exchange, but he stressed that the local authorities would not agree to any of the types of blackmail that the aggressor side has been using in prisoner exchange negotiations since the beginning of the war. The agreement will be implemented today, provided that the aggressor side decides to cooperate, of course.
