Even though there were reports of conflicts, relations in the Cabinet have always been good, said Mr Bunchu in an interview with the BANGKOK POST. The Phalang Tham leader's optimism is in stark contrast to ongoing heated debate on his party's drive for the election of provincial governors which, observers say, could seriously threaten the unity of the Chuan Likphai coalition government. Prime Minister Chuan last week invited leaders and secretaries-general of coalition parties to a meeting as the debate heated up. Mr Bunchu said the purpose of the meeting was not to reduce conflicts among coalition parties as reported. Instead the leaders discussed ways to convey to the public an understanding that all coalition members are on good terms. Coalition conflicts over decentralisation policy, if escalated, could make a recent prediction on Phalang Tham's future in the coalition come true. Political activist and university lecturer Thirayut Bunmi predicted that a government crisis may arise between the PDP and other coalition parties this year over either the governor election proposal or traffic problems. And as a result the PDP may decide to leave the coalition. Mr Bunchu dismissed the prediction. Mr Thirayut's analysis, he said, was based on inaccurate assumptions. "He has to make more clarifications on what would be the causes and conditions under which Phalang Tham could no longer stay in the Government." He says his party has not changed its policy on decentralisation of government. It has called for direct election of provincial governors -- the same system now used in Bangkok. But the party has to accept the Government's decentralisation policy which is stated more loosely, because it was in the minority when the policy was drawn up, he said. Even though the party was not satisfied with that, it had to accept the policy because it was collectively decided. Mr Bunchu said he had tried to explain to party members that Phalang Tham policy and that of the Government still share the same goal of decentralising power. The Deputy Premier also said delay in implementation of the policy is caused by the Interior Ministry, which was assigned to carry it out. This has led people to think that the Government is not sincere in carrying out its plan for decentralisation. "People have got the wrong impression that one coalition party wants decentralisation while another stalls. This is not true. Bureaucratic mechanisms are necessary for implementation (of the policy)," he said. The Interior Ministry, he said, has been told to speed up implementation. [passage omitted]
