The one chosen as the winner by military aviators will be granted the honor of providing this kind of aircraft not only to Russia and the CIS member countries, but to numerous customers located in distant foreign countries as well. IZVESTIYA has already discussed one of the competitors (issue No 25 of 1994). This is the MiG firm, which is widely known domestically and in foreign countries. Equally famous is its rival in creative commercial endeavors, the YaK corporation, which was the traditional supplier of "flying classrooms" to Soviet aviation and our former allies. The need for this kind of aircraft is great, since Russia alone will require 800 aircraft for employment in the so-called advanced pilot training. Taking into account the needs of the CIS member countries and "Third World" states, the total amount needed is about 1,200 new aircraft. The production program is enormous, with the potential of effecting a substantial change in the nature of Russian exports, an area in which no boasts of a preponderance of science-intensive products can be made. YaK, hoping to emerge as the winner of the competition, has its eyes set not only on financing a military aviation program, but more on mass use of this aircraft, thus attracting the undivided attention of potential foreign purchasers and serving as a reliable indication of quality of the fighter. In any event, this is the view held by the corporation's foreign partner, Aeromacchi, Italy's oldest aircraft manufacturer. The Italians became familiar with the YaK-130 project in last year's air show at Le Bourget, where they expressed a desire to become part of a deal -- to participate in creating the machine and selling series-produced craft in their traditional markets located in Southeastern Asia, the Near East, South America, and even New Zealand. The Russian side will handle sales at home and in the CIS. Also contributing to a great need for a new trainer in our country is the fact that mutual payments between the Comecon partners were made in currency, at full world prices, for components and spare parts supplied to Russia by Hungary, the Czech Republic, or the Slovak Republic. One has only to realize that the obsolete Czechoslovak L-39s, which were used to teach at least two generations of our pilots to fly, are sitting on the ground -- hundreds of them -- due to a shortage of spare parts. To prevent this kind of trouble, the Air Forces have served the designers with a strict requirement: All components must necessarily be manufactured domestically. Strange as it may seem, the Yak-130's most important assembly, the engine, will be supplied by Slovakia, of all places. That is, Russian engine designers have been hard at work coming up with a modification of the small power plant, long produced in that country under Soviet licence, for installation in this aircraft. The "prodigal son," which has been ransomed from the Slovaks to obtain rights to series production in its homeland, will be returning home. This year, the Yak-130 will be fabricated "in the flesh" and flight testing initiated. Nowhere in the world is there yet an aircraft possessing such superior flight and technical characteristics. It is the only craft capable of flying at extreme angles of attack fatal for other aircraft and of executing the famous Pugachev Cobra. Built into the design of the controls is the capability of changing their "habits" to endow the aircraft with the characteristics of the basic fighter models in the inventory of our Air Forces and those of foreign countries. The design computations of the YaK people are being closely followed by the Aeromacchi specialists, who wish to end up with a flying craft offering the same characteristics the project calls for. Of importance in addition to the purely tactical characteristics are economic considerations, an example of which is the requirement for lowering the cost of one hour of flight of the Yak-130 by one order of magnitude, that is, by a factor of 10, as compared to that of the Su-27. If the YaK corporation wins the competition, its trainers will be made available in 1997 to customers located in Russia and in foreign countries.
