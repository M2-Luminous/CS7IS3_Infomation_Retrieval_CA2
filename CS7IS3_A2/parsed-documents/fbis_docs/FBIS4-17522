FBIS4-17522 "drsov079cc_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 23 Apr ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 23 Apr LD2304065094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0635 GMT 23 Apr 94 LD2304065094 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow April 23 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper quotes the Russian president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov who told a Kremlin briefing on Friday that Boris Yeltsin hopes for the success of the treaty on public accord which is to be signed on April 28. The newspaper prints the full text of a statement by the leaders of the member republics of the Russian Federation, which was adopted on April 21 after a meeting with the Russian president. The statement expresses support for the agreement. At the same time, the newspaper singles out a report that the Russian parliament lower house is not ready to sign the document, since its new version needs examination. It is reported that parliamentary groups intend to discuss it at party conferences, and political councils of parties in the remaining days before April 28 "to hammer out a common position". The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries, in this connection, an article by Valeriy Zorkin, the former chairman of the Russian constitutional court, who claims that "national accord cannot be `introduced' by any decree". According to Zorkin, "real compromise means strict implementation of clearly outlined top priority measures supported by all or the majority of people, without which it will be impossible to check the country's sliding to a dreadful disaster". The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper concentrates on the talks between the Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in Sevastopol. The commentary on this topic says that the agreement signed in Moscow on a gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems "was in actual fact a compromise and a concession of the Russian side for the earliest settlement of contradictions between the neighbouring countries". However, the Ukrainian military delegation at the Sevastopol talks "sees weak positions of the partners in the dialogue behind the concession and puts forth absurd demands having nothing to do with the presidents' understanding". The military leaders have not cleared up the question which was unequivocally settled by the presidents: "to divide the Black Sea Fleet bases", the newspaper continues. The way out of the Black Sea deadlock "has only gleamed in the distance but has not fully appeared for the negotiating sides". The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper features an open letter to Boris Yeltsin adopted by a meeting of the Union of Russian North-Western Cities held in the city of Kirov. It expresses concern that administration heads of such big Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok and Nizhny Novgorod were released from their posts under the pressure of regional governors over the past few months. The newspaper claims that the posts were left by honest people vitally interested in the prosperity of their cities. The message contains a demand to carry out inspections in connection with complaints of ousted administration heads and to publish their results. The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin on corruption in executive bodies. Confirming the existence of corruption, including in the top echelon, he stressed: "We know about this and actively work in this direction", but there is no point in raising ballyhoo about this. "We declare an all-out war on corruption", the struggle against which, as general struggle against crime, "becomes an important task of ensuring national security", Stepashin stressed. The Moscow press gives an extensive coverage to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI that Serbs' continued attacks in the area of Gorazde lead to their disaster. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes the following: Since Russia abides by the opinion that "one should not be in a hurry to spread the zone of air strikes in Bosnia", it turns out that Russia, the United States, the EU and the U.N. "have no common approach to a solution of the crisis". The newspaper claims that the absence of a common diplomatic plan for a settlement will lead to a sitation when "a decision will be taken, most probably, without taking into consideration Russia's opinion". According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, Moscow and Washington do not intend to yield the palm to each other in initiatives. The Kremlin insists on calling a summit on former Yugoslavia, and the White House does not object against this, suggesting only that it should be prepared well. In the meantime, the newspaper states, U.S. President Bill Clinton put forth his own plan providing for "possible further air strikes on Serbs". The PRAVDA newspaper runs information on demonstrations and rallies in Moscow by opposition forces on the occasion of Vladimir Lenin's birthday. The newspaper describes in detail exhibits of an exposition named "Attempt on Memory" which opened at the Pavilion "Lenin's Funeral Train" on Friday.
