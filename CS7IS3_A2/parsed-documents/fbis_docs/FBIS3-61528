The Y. pestis EV76 plague microbe is selected mostly due to the fact that preparation of the Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain involves freezing in a protective medium and lyophilic drying. The Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain of the NIIEG line is used in the experiment. The bacteria were grown on a solid nutrient medium at a 28�C temperature for 48 h. The experimental procedure is outlined. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded by a BS 567 A high resolution Tesla spectrometer at a 100 MHz working proton frequency. The dependence of the NMR water signal strength on the temperature in the suspension of Y. pestis EV76 cells without and with a cryoprotector and in a system containing bacterial cells and the temperature curves of the cryoptotectant solutions are plotted. The dependence of the nonfrozen water NMR signal strength on the temperature in the Y. pestis EV76 bacteria suspensions and in various cryoprotector media and the phase transition and congelation temperatures in cryoprotective media under various cooling and heating conditions are summarized. The study carried out within a 0 to -40�C temperature range with the help of the differential scanning calorimetry method reveals that the total amount of nonfreezing water within a range between congelation and melting points in cell suspensions with various cryoprotectors does not follow the simple additivity law with respect to the sum of hydration numbers of individual components. The findings attest to the complex effect of multicomponent protective media on the state of water's nonfreezing fraction in cell suspensions and point toward the possibility of producing material in a congealed state. This makes it necessary to determine the waster state at low temperatures experimentally in each specific case and in developing cryobiological practices, yet the congelation temperatures found in the study can be used for selecting optimum long-term Y. pestis EV76 cell specimen storage temperatures.
