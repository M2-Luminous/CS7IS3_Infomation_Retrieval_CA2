FR940223-2-00012 FR940223-2-00009 Endangered Species; Permits agency: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. action: Issuance of extensions to four permits. On April 13, 1993, as authorized by the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, NMFS issued incidental take Permit 829 (P507F) to the Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF), Permit 830 (P250E) to the Washington Department of Wildlife (WDW), Permit 831 (P211G) to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), and Permit 832 (P503D) to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) to incidentally take listed Snake River sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) and Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon ( O. tshawytscha ) during the operation of artificial propagation hatcheries, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, to be valid through February 15, 1994. The above permit holders have submitted applications (P507G, P250F, P211H, and P503L, respectively) in due form for new permits to authorize the continued operation of their hatchery programs. NMFS is currently analyzing the activities proposed in those applications in accordance with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act; however, this process is not yet complete. Notice is hereby given that on February 14, 1994, NMFS issued extensions to the above permits, authorizing the permit holders to continue the activities therein until July 1, 1994, or until the authorization is superseded by a new permit. All other conditions associated with the permit remain in full force and effect. No release of hatchery fish are authorized at this time. Issuance of these extensions, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that: (1) The taking would be incidental; (2) the applicant would, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, minimize and mitigate the impacts of such taking; (3) the taking would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild; and (4) there were adequate assurances that the conservation plan would be funded and implemented, including any measures required by the Assistant Administrator. These permits were also issued in accordance with and are subject to Parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The applications, permits, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 911 North East 11th Ave., room 620, Portland, Oregon 97232 (503&hyph;230&hyph;5400). Dated: February 14, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3955 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;M
