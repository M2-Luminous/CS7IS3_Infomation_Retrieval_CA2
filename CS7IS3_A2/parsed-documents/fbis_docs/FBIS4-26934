Zou Xiangqun said: According to statistics, in May the general retail price level rose 18.9 percent over the same period last year, while the price rise margin dropped 0.6 percentage points compared with April. In May, retail price rises in the country's 35 large and medium-sized cities were 1.3 percentage points lower than in April. According to an analysis of the changes in the residents' consumption price index, rises in the prices of various kinds of commodities, except clothing, were slower in May than in April. Among these, the price rise margins for food; household equipment; medical care; means of transport and communications; articles for recreational, educational, and cultural use; housing, and services dropped 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 0.4, 1.7, and 0.8 percentage points, respectively. This shows that the state supervision of the prices of daily necessities, the requirement for prices to be clearly marked, and the launching of a general price check have begun to yield results. From the current situation in the development of the macroeconomy, it can be predicted that the rise in the general price level of the whole country will continue to weaken, and the price rise margin will drop further. According to an analysis by Zou Xiangqun -- he based his prediction on the following facts: -- The serious effect of last year's inflation will dwindle graudally. In 1993, the general price level throughout the county began to rise every month from the beginning of the year and reached its peak in December. Because prices rose in a step-like pattern; because the prices of electricity, railway transport were readjusted; and because the prices of a large number of steel products, coal, and grain were decontrolled, inflation mainly occurred in the second half of last year, and particularly the prices of grain and edible oil fluctuated in the fourth quarter of last year. This had a serious effect on price rises this year. This effect will gradually weaken with the passage of time and will dwindle markedly in the fourth quarter of this year. -- The macroeconomic environment is improving. The financial situation is stable. From January through May, the amount of currency withdrawn from circulation was 54.57 billion yuan more than the same period last year; residents' savings deposits rose by 151.8 billion yuan over last year; revenue increased by 24.3 percent over the same period of last year. The margin of increase in fixed assets investment continued to drop because management over loans for fixed assets investment was strengthened and because a general inspection of investment was launched. From January to May, the size of the increase in the amount of investment by state-owned units dropped 35.1 percentage points over the same period last year. -- The supply of important commodities is turning for the better. At present, the supply of and demand for commodities in the domestic market are basically balanced, and the acreage planted in grain this year is expected to be the same as last year's level, but the acreage planted in rape seeds is nearly 8 million mu more than last year. This will lay a foundation for the stable growth of grain and oil-bearing crops. With the advent of the brisk vegetable growing season, the supplies of vegetables will increase, and prices will drop further. -- The practice of raising prices arbitrarily and collecting various types of fees indiscriminately is beginning to be checked. The practice of noninterference in market prices has been gradually reversed through the launching of a general price checkup and the implementation of state measures on establishing grain risk funds, on price monitoring, and on marking prices clearly. Zou Xiangqun said that in accordance with the above comprehensive analysis of the four aspects of the macroeconomic situation, it is estimated that from now on price rises will gradually weaken, but prices will still remain at a comparatively high level. In other words, there is a tendency that prices will gradually drop from a comparatively high level, prices of some commodities might rise again for a short while. Therefore, we must resolutely continue to implement the various regulation and control measures to stabilize market prices and to create a good economic and social environment for reform and development. Zou Xiangqun pointed out: To further stabilize prices, we must do the following tasks well: 1. We should grasp agricultural production and strive to increase grain and cotton production this year. We should work hard to grasp the production of grain, cotton, and other major farm products and successfully carry out the "vegetable basket" project. We should strive for a bumper agricultural harvest to increase the supply of essential products in the market. 2. We must strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets and put a stop to the excessive increase of consumption funds. We must keep bank loans under control and strictly forbid loans other than those approved by the state for investment in fixed assets. 3. We should continue to strengthen management over price regulation and control and strive to stabilize the prices of life's daily necessities for the people. We should ensure an ample supply of goods, keep prices down, and prevent drastic price fluctuations. We should speed up the process of price legislation. The State Planning Commission is drawing up provisions against price swindling and seeking staggering profits. It will strive to promulgate them as soon as possible to protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers. 4. We should continue to launch general price inspections to check price violations.
