On the question of which party they would vote for in the next general election, the number of those who said they would vote for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] increased, while the percentage of those who would vote for the Japan New Party [JNP] dropped by 7 points. The results show signs of Hosokawa's popularity waning. Asked why they think the ruling coalition was thrown into confusion over the plans to reshuffle the cabinet and introduce a national welfare tax, the pollees raised the following reasons: 1) Because Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa exerted too much influence on the plans; 2) because, from the beginning, it was impossible for the ruling parties to coordinate their opinions; and 3) because Prime Minister Hosokawa acted a bit arbitrarily. "Asked how many years they want the Hosokawa government to be in power," 33 percent said another year, 25 percent said another two or three years, 19 percent said the government should step down from power immediately, and 17 percent hoped it would be in power as long as possible. The same question was posed in polls conducted last September, and January this year. Compared with the results of the September poll, the percentage of those who want the government to be in power "as long as possible" decreased by 14 points, those who said "another year" increased by 15 points, and those who want the government to get out of power immediately increased by 8 points. In answering what parties they would vote for if the general election is conducted, 28 percent said they would vote for the LDP, 11 percent for the JNP, 10 percent each for Shinseito and the SDPJ, and 5 percent for Sakigake [Harbinger]. Compared with the results of the January poll, the LDP and the SDPJ gained about 2 to 3 points, while the JNP lost a lot. Nevertheless, the LDP and the SDPJ are far from the level of the approval ratings they obtained last June -- 31 percent and 15 percent respectively. The June poll was conducted immediately before last year's general election in which the LDP and the SDPJ were decidedly defeated.
