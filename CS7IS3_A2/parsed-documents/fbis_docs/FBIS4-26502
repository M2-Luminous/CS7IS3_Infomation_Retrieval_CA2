According to reports, the Czech Government believes China's huge trade market is so attractive that it will send either its Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy or Economic Minister Karel Dyba to attend the opening ceremony. Prague is also planning to earmark 5 million korun (about 220,000 U.S. dollars) to subsidize enterprises taking part in the exhibition, allocating 100,000 korun or some 4,400 dollars for each unit. The Czech Republic exported products worth 250 million U.S. dollars to China last year, registering a 2.5 times increase over the previous two years. They were chiefly machine tools, transport and brewery equipment and chemicals. It also imported raw materials, foodstuffs, textiles and other industrial products from China.
