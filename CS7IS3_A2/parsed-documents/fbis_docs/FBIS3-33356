Representatives of the party's various factions, as well as former President Misael Pastrana, Senator Enrique Gomez, and former Minister Cornelio Reyes, announced the sectors' agreement. Nearly 3,000 of the 4,000 accredited convention delegates cast their votes at the country's 34 voting sites. All except one voted for Pastrana and approved a proposal giving the candidate a free hand to designate his candidate for vice president. The National Salvation Movement released a communique, signed by Gomez, asking the Conservative Party to join a crusade to restore morality. Reyes delivered the opening speech: [Begin Reyes recording] The candidate we will support -- and he has said this with commendable clarity -- will not be the champion of any particular faction, but an apostle of national reconciliation. [end recording] Former President Belisario Bethancur delivered a message emphasizing the national nature of Pastrana's candidacy. Former Foreign Minister Rodrigo Lloreda also attended the convention. [Begin Lloreda recording] The country has a great opportunity to overcome the darkness of corruption. [end recording] Everything was ready very early at the convention, which this time resembled the great U.S. conventions. Old and experienced party members met to proclaim a single person as candidate. That is why there were no ballots, as the statutes stipulate, only a ballot to vote for Andres Pastrana. The convention opened with the entrance of former President Pastrana. He could not contain his eagerness and excitement and nearly cried when he referred to his son. [Begin Misael Pastrana recording] The people who walk with he who walks with his own destiny are not mistaken. [end recording] Although everything was prepared, time caught up with some in the afternoon. Official delegate Antonio Alvarez Restrepo raised his voice when he saw that the sound system was off. Now former candidate Rodrigo Llorente and the women who showed off their hats were seated in the front. Computers worked full steam ahead to tabulate the results of the voting in the departments, and the organizers did not allow anyone to enter the headquarters ahead of schedule. It took 12 hours to erect the stage to present a light, sound, and color show to proclaim Pastrana as the party's presidential candidate. The men responsible for this work are the same ones who produced the show to launch his campaign.
