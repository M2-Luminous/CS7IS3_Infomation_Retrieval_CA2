Before flying to Beijing on Saturday [19 March] for his first-ever three-day official visit to China, he told a group of Chinese journalists here that "Japan's relations with China have entered a new stage." Tokyo and Beijing should double their efforts to develop "the already mature relationship" into a future-oriented one that will benefit the international community, said the prime minister who assumed office last August. "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks and exchange views frankly with each other," the prime minister said. Hosokawa is scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng in Beijing to discuss bilateral and international issues. The trip will also take him to shanghai, China's largest city. Trade between the two countries totalled 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, a 33-fold increase over 1972, the year China and Japan normalized relations. Japan became China's largest trading partner last year, while China emerged as Japan's second biggest after the United States. The prime minister expects trade between the two countries to reach 70 billion dollars by the end of 2000, and 190 billion dollars by the end of 2010 if it maintains an average annual growth of 10 percent. He said that Japan's investment in China amounted to 5.17 billion dollars by the end of last September, one third of which was invested in fiscal 1992. The prime minister told the Chinese journalists, who are here on a week-long visit at the invitation of Japan's Foreign Ministry, that Japan will "pay much attention" to development in Shanghai's Pudong Development Zone, China's industrial hub, which he will visit Monday. He also said that his country will provide more aid to China's northeastern provinces. On security in the Asia-Pacific region, Hosokawa voiced his concern over "unstable elements," an apparent reference to the alleged nuclear development program on the Korean peninsula. He hoped that Tokyo and Beijing will work hard to seek solutions to this problem through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Expressing concern over the prolonged conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and other troubled areas, the prime minister said that Japan will offer economic support to help resolve these problems. The prime minister said his government will work under Japan's war-renouncing Constitution to "make greater contributions" to world peace.
