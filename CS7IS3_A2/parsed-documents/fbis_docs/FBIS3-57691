Kozyrev's remarks defined the Baltic states as belonging in Russia's sphere of influence and justified a continued illegal presence of Russian troops in Estonian territory. Vello Saatpalu, chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Commission, proposed to wind up the discussion and prepare a new statement. Several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction with the parliament's standing rules under which urgent issues cannot be added to the agenda, and referred to the example of the Lithuanian parliament, which reacted to Kozyrev's speech the same day it was delivered. The Estonian parliament failed to reach a decision today because the time ran out and the legislators did not agree to prolong the session. [passage omitted]
