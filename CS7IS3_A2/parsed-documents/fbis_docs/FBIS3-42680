Parliamentarism does not transplant well into the Russian soil, which is so rich in totalitarian tradition. The Union parliament already has been dissolved "early;" the Russian Supreme Soviet has been disbanded. January is a jinxed month anyway: It was in January 1918 that the Bolsheviks disbanded the first truly democratically elected parliament in Russia--the Constituent Assembly. Will the Federal Assembly survive the winter, will it be "luckier" than its predecessors? I would like to be wrong, but I am afraid I am not. The new Russian parliament resembles a miscarried fetus of a tired country long pregnant by totalitarianism. After the tragic September-October events, it could hope to survive only if it grew into a quiet parliament standing ready to approve the decisions of the president and the government--such as, for instance, in Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. This is what President B.N. Yeltsin hoped for in issuing his Edict No. 1400 on 21 September. He miscalculated, though; the hypnosis of self-deception played a bad trick on him. The people no longer believed the promises of the president, the government, and the ruling bloc; the credit of confidence had run out. For the first time since 1985, the strength of the opponents of the current reform exceeded the strength of its supporters. Holding the course of tough economic reforms in keeping with the Yeltsin-Gaydar formula came into an irreconcilable conflict with the ability of pushing them through within the framework of the new parliament as well. The main result of the elections is that half of the popular vote went to pro-communist and national-patriotic forces, who are even more conservative when it comes to the transformations under way than their predecessors in the Supreme Soviet had been; whose modus operandi is rejection; and for whom the crux of their political position is revanche. These forces are organically incompatible with the president, with the current government, and the new Constitution alike. They bear little resemblance to the right in Hungary or the Czech Republic, or to the left in Lithuania and Poland, who recently came into power through parliamentary elections and who observe the commonly accepted rules of the game. The national-communist opposition in Russia, which draws on the marginal strata of the society--which now includes a considerable part of the population--operates on slogans turned toward yesterday (all power to the soviets; the restoration of the Russian empire....); for them the parliament is the same means of achieving their revolutionary (or perhaps it would be more precise to say counterrevolutionary) goals as it is for President Yeltsin to see through to the end the "revolution from above," the revolutionary reform. In a normal, civilized, stable society, parties of this type draw on the support of 5-10 percent of the electorate, and as a rule they remain on the sidelines of the political process. In a troubled transitional time, however, on a wave of a crisis and increasing popular discontent over the worsening conditions of life, disintegration of authority, and the powerlessness of immature democratic institutions, they get their historic chance, as happened in Russia in October 1917 or in Germany in 1933. Russia today has not yet reached a state where various political parties could replace one another at the helm of power as a result of elections without creating sharp cataclysms and destabilization of the situation in the country. Its political system is still dominated by extremes, and centrist forces are still very weak. In the environment of the intensifying economic crisis, this is a clear indicator of an urgent need to shift to a "managed" democracy or an authoritarian regime. The past three months of direct presidential rule graphically demonstrated that the executive branch has increasingly less need for the legislative one; that, having once tasted the "freedom" from various checks and balances, it will not want to waste time and effort on another round of "score-settling" with the new parliament. Therefore, one does not have to be a great prophet to see that it is in the interests of the powers that be to see the Russian parliament discredited as quickly as possible--preferably by its own hand. At the same time, it is necessary to stick to the rules of good behavior: The parliament's exit from the political arena should not "irritate" world public opinion, and neither should it produce a real contender for the president's job in 1996. Now all sorts of politicians and advisers are racking their brains as to when is the best time to put into action Article 111 of the new Constitution (on disbanding the parliament after it rejects three times the candidacy of a new prime minister proposed by the president) so as not to leave to the State Duma an opportunity to make the first step of initiating the impeachment of the president. As to the problem of discrediting the State Duma, this is being taken care of by the leaders of most parliamentary factions, who are incapable of coming to an agreement on a single key issue, with the exception of returning the White House to the parliament. And there is little chance for reaching such agreement given such a weak center and such strong radical flanks. It is not accidental that the government bloc, Russia's Choice, already has refused to participate in negotiations, holding up its sleeve a trump card--the materials on numerous violations of election rules--that will be used as soon as the need arises. It is obvious that the session of the State Duma will follow a spontaneous scenario, without aim or direction. In 1990, it took three days to elect B. Yeltsin the speaker of the Russian parliament; it is hard even to imagine how long this procedure will take in 1994, especially keeping in mind that with the exception of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the RKP [Communist Party of Russia], other factions most likely will not maintain strict discipline in matters of voting. So while the session will be embroiled for several weeks in attempts to resolve routine internal issues (the rules, the law on a deputy status, distribution of portfolios....), the leaders of the new irreconcilable rightist-leftist opposition will rock the "foundations" of the presidential power; they will: --demand a parliament investigation of the 3-4 October events and setting up a commission on investigating the circumstances and the consequences of signing the Belovezha agreements in 1991; --attempt to annul the results of the referendum on the Constitution; --insist on dismissing the cases against GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] members and the organizers of the events of September-October 1993; --propose to repeal president's edicts on land, on the Ministry of Security, and others; --express no-confidence in the government under Article 117-3 of the new Constitution; --call for the restoration of the Constitutional Court in its old composition and for this court to render a definitive judgment on the events of September-October 1993; --come up with militant statements with respect to countries of the near and far abroad. All of this will be happening against a backdrop of intrafactional score-settling, for most factions consist of people who are not inclined to march to the same drum and listen to one leader. With skillful assistance, the State Duma could be turned into a theater of the absurd in a matter of two months. Then later--a paralysis of the parliamentary, workers' requests, Article 111 of the Constitution, and the disbandment of the State Duma. The president will continue to rule the country with the help of the Federation Council--a more complaisant structure which will convene from time to time to approve presidential decrees. Also at "the workers' request," the parliament for the time being will exist as a one-chamber body, and it is well known that there nothing more permanent in Russia than temporary institutions. Everything above is the viewpoint of a skeptic who has spent three years of his life trying to make the previous Russian parliament a more civilized body by creating in it a centrist majority. The failure of these attempts as a result of the December elections does not make me an optimist again. But my, how much would I like to be wrong....
