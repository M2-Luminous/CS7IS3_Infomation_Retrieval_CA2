The United Nations has made new agreements with the Patriotic Front and with government units. Previously, the Patriotic Front had said that the evacuation operation had to be over by yesterday evening. There are about five Belgian citizens left in Rwanda. Apart from that, there are 10 journalists at Kigali airport. In the meantime, about 200 Belgian paratroopers have arrived in Kenya. In the course of the day as many other soldiers as possible will be withdrawn from Rwanda -- their exact number depends on the circumstances on the spot.
