Undoubtedly, the purpose of introducing the separate taxation system is to establish a financial system suited to the market economic system and to arouse the enthusiasm of both the center and localities. However, we cannot evade the reality that implementation of the separate taxation system will have both positive and negative effects. Bai Jingming, associate professor of the Financial Science Research Institute under the Finance Ministry and doctor of economics, said: The existing contract system implemented by localities has proved in practice to have more defects than advantages. It has resulted in departmentalism and economic barriers erected between regions and has weakened the unity and complementarity of macroeconomic policies between central and local governments. But the separate taxation system can bring about the following benefits to economic development. First, the separate taxation system will enable central revenue to become a steadily increasing mechanism and enhance the capability of macroeconomic regulation and control of the central government. Second, the separate taxation system will enable the government at all levels to show more concern for cultivating tax sources, consciously broaden sources of taxes within the scope permitted by law and policies, and not rely on tax exemptions to develop the economy. Third, the separate taxation system will speed up the establishment and perfection of China's financial budgetary system at all levels, enhance the budgetary binding mechanism, and gradually increase the efficiency of spending. Dr Bai Jingming pointed out at the same time: Implementation of the separate taxation system in the early period is likely to yield the following negative effects: First, the status quo of the interest structure remains unchanged during the initial stage of financial reform and no major changes will be effected in the behavior of local governments. However, the center will take over duties imposed on cigarette and liquor, which are high and profitable, a move which will easily dampen the enthusiasm of localities. Second, if 1993 is taken as the base period for central finance to check and ratify local tax return, the sharp increase in the previous year will relatively slow down this year's tax revenue and increase pressure on the balance of this year's finance. If deficits grow for this reason, it will inevitably increase the issue of treasury bonds or even exert pressure on inflation. Third, following implementation of the separate taxation system, local governments will vigorously work out measures to increase revenue and bargain with the central government on the establishment of the local taxation system. Meanwhile, as the existing separate taxation system has not yet smashed the structure which determines the distribution of income according to the relationships of administrative subordination, local governments will continue to adopt measures to protect local interests. Fourth, following the exercise of financial management at different levels, the right to spending of local governments will increase. As a result, local finance will allocate funds to profitable trades and make less investment in infrastructure, education, and science and technology. Fifth, as the separate taxation system has not touched the structure of regional distribution, the previous interests are still taken as the base figure of tax return. This results in uneven regional development. Hence, it will be difficult to narrow the wide gap between the eastern and western regions within a short period. Financial experts hold that ultimate implementation of financial reform will be an arduous course. To ensure that the reform will be introduced smoothly and not go out of shape, there are still great difficulties ahead. The separate taxation system is in fact a division of interests, which will bring about friction between the center and localities, if not properly handled. Hence, it is a pressing task at the moment to standardize and legalize the transfer payment system as quickly as possible. Moreover, we should establish the separate taxation system below the provincial level as early as possible to ensure the integrity of the system.
