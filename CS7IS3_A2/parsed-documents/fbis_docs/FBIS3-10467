Gomes is willing to record his statement at a notary's office. At a meeting with Sao Paulo Senator Mario Covas, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, and Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Gomes said his name is not available. "There are people better qualified than I in the PSDB hierarchy. I have already served four [as published] interrupted terms of office--two as deputy and one as mayor of Fortaleza," he said. Ciro said his youth is another reason he would not agree to run: "I am distressingly similar to Collor, but I'm not a thief," and announced his plan to pursue graduate studies at Harvard, in the United States. In March, he will find out whether his application for a grant to study at the Institute for International Affairs has been approved. He would spend two years there writing a thesis on "Political Aspects of Inflation in Brazil."
