Announcement by Russian Federation State Tax Service"] [Text] A total of 4.86 trillion rubles [R] in taxes and other obligatory payments was mobilized into the country's budget system in January 1994, that is, 22 percent less than in December of last year. Receipts by the federal budget comprised R2 trillion-plus and fell by almost 2 percent in this time. Furthermore, taxpayers remitting tax in foreign currency paid in around $32 million. A reduction in the volume of tax collections for the month was noted practically everywhere with the exception of Leningrad and Yaroslavl Oblasts. The most considerable decrease in receipts occurred in Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug -- by two-thirds, Kabardino-Balkar Republic and Kemerovo Oblast -- by one-half, and in another 17 regions -- by one-third. The reduction in tax receipts was acounted for primarily by the profits tax, which comprised just over R1.8 trillion in January and fell by almost one-third compared with December. Side by side with enterprises' difficult financial position, the changes in taxation legislation introduced at the beginning of the year, connected with giving the taxpayer additional benefits and exempting small enterprises from making advance payments during the quarter, has also affected the reduced scale of collection of this tax. A total of R1.6 trillion in value-added tax [VAT] was collected in January, which approximately corresponds to the level of December last year, while R216 billion -- or one-third less -- were collected in excise duties, mainly because of reduced receipts from gas and alcoholic drinks. Furthermore, one-fourth of VAT and excise receipts was collected ahead of time in December 1993, by way of additional advance payment. Three-fourths of the volume of all profits tax receipts in January were accounted for by current payments, and 59 percent by VAT. Receipts from profits tax were R1.4 trillion in the country as a whole and fell by 29 percent compared with December, with VAT receipts registering R958 billion and a 3-percent fall respectively. Compared with December, the collection of current VAT payments fell in 60 regions. The greatest laggardness from average Russian rates occurred in the Republic of Tuva [Tyva] -- by 74 percent, Khakasiya, Omsk and Magadan Oblasts, and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug -- by 62-67 percent. Among other basic taxes it is necessary to note the significant (34 percent) reduction in volumes of income tax from physical entities. Receipts from the aforesaid tax were only R620 billion as compared with R942 billion in December 1993. As practice shows, every year January income tax receipts are as a rule lower than the previous month's. This is due to the fact that enterprises and organizations generally pay their workers bonuses in December on the basis of the year's work results, and an additional influx of receipts from the aforesaid tax is ensured during this month because of this. In January, the proportion of deductions into the federal budget went up significantly compared with the previous month, constituting 42 percent against December's 33 percent; on VAT the figures are 68 percent and 60 percent, and on profits (income) tax -- 41 and 29 percent. During the month the problem of arrears in the payment of taxes into the budget by enterprises and organizations deteriorated still further. In this month alone this debt increased by R1.4 trillion, or by a factor of 1.5. As of 1 February 1994 the volume of arrears on payments into the budget which accumulated during the whole of 1993 reached almost R4.5 trillion and proved to be equal to the sum of taxes paid in in January of this year. The extent of budgetary arrears for VAT has reached almost R2 trillion, which is 1.5 times more than a month ago. The sum of VAT arrears exceeded the volume of January's payments of this tax by 17 percent. Total arrears on profits tax remained at practically the same level, comprising R1.3 trillion. It must be noted that the federal budget accounts for two-thirds of the arrears of payments into the budget. The volume of federal budget arrears in Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrugs has reached R1.2 trillion, or 42 percent of its size for the whole of the Russian Federation. In Orenburg Oblast the debt on payments into the federal budget is R100 billion, (84 percent of the total volume of arrears), Perm Oblast -- R98 billion (82 percent), Irkutsk Oblast -- R97 billion (76 percent), Tomsk Oblast -- R78 billion (79 percent), and Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast -- R62 billion (85 percent). According to the calculations of the State Tax Service, keeping the volume of arrears at least at the level that prevailed at the beginning of the year would enable us to ensure that tax payments can be levied in January on approximately the scale that was reached in December of last year.
