It is common knowledge that al-Hasan enjoys the support of sectors in Fatah as he was the first to broach the issue of a political settlement with Israel. However, he opposed the current peace process and the agreements stemming from it because they do not respond to the Palestinian people's minimum national rights, as he viewed and continues to view them in his theory for a settlement.
