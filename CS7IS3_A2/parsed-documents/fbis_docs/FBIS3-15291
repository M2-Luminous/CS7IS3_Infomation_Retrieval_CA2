According to the provisions of the Fundamental Law Buryatia is henceforth a sovereign democratic rule-of-law state within the Russian Federation. And the relations of its organs of power with the federal authorities are built on a constitutional-treaty basis. The new system for Buryatia's state structure provides for the post of president, who is the head of the republic and its executive power, and also for the existence of a parliament -- the People's Khural -- as a representative and legislative organ. Before elections to the new organs of power in accordance with transitional provisions the powers of the republic's existing Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers are retained.
