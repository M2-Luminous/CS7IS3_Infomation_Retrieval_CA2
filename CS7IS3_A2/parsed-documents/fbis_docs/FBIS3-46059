The lion's share of the earnings came from the Shanghai Volkswagen Corp., a main producer of "Santana" sedans, and its related manufacturers. The total output of Santanas jumped to 100,000 last year from 65,000 in 1992. The production of the same make for the new year is targeted at 115,000, and a brand new model of Santana will appear on the market toward the end of the year. At the same time, work has been stepped up on the second phase of the "Volkswagen" technical transformation project, and the year 1994 will see a new major auto-maker with a production capacity of 200,000 Santanas. It was reported that the sales slump of Santana cars has been arrested thanks to new measures taken to promote sales. In addition, the auto's cost has been reduced as more than 80 percent of the parts are produced locally and import duties have been lowered on some parts. All these have gone a long way to increase the competitiveness of Shanghai's automobiles.
