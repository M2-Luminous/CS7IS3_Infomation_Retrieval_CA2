The source said these reports are false and baseless, and that they constitute an attempt to cover the crushing blows inflicted by the heroic Armed Forces men on the dens of the secessionist gang inside the Aden Governorate. The source said that the air strikes targeted the camp the secessionists are using as a stronghold west of Aden, and that the civilian and economic installations and residential areas have not been and will never be targets for the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy.
