FR940627-0-00062 FR940627-0-00011 (5) Benefits earned prior to effective date _(i) In general . Allocations under a defined contribution plan or benefits accrued under a defined benefit plan for plan years beginning before the statutory effective date are not subject to the annual compensation limit. Allocations under a defined contribution plan or benefits accrued under a defined benefit plan for plan years beginning on or after the statutory effective date, but before the OBRA '93 effective date, are subject to the annual compensation limit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, these allocations or accruals are not subject to the OBRA '93 reduction to the annual compensation limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (ii) Allocation for a plan year . The allocations for a plan year include amounts described in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;2(c)(ii) or §1.401(m)&hyph;1(f)(6) plus the earnings, expenses, gains, and losses attributable to those amounts. (iii) Benefits accrued for years before the effective date . The benefits accrued for plan years prior to a specified date by any employee are the employee's benefits accrued under the plan, determined as if those benefits had been frozen (as defined in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(3)(i)) as of the day immediately preceding such specified date. Thus, for example, benefits accrued for those plan years generally do not include any benefits accrued under an amendment increasing prior benefits that is adopted after the date on which the employee's benefits under the plan must be treated as frozen. (e) Determination of post-effective-date accrued benefits _(1) In general . The plan formula that is used to determine the amount of allocations or benefit accruals for plan years beginning on or after the dates described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) must comply with section 401(a)(17) as in effect on such date. This paragraph (e) provides rules for applying section 401(a)(17) in the case of section 401(a)(17) employees who accrue additional benefits under a defined benefit plan in a plan year beginning on or after the relevant effective date. Paragraph (e)(2) of this section contains definitions used in applying these rules. Paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section explain the application of the fresh-start rules in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13 to the determination of the accrued benefits of section 401(a)(17) employees. (2) Definitions . For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following definitions apply: (i) Section 401(a)(17) employee . An employee is a section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the statutory effective date, if the employee's current accrued benefit as of that date is based on compensation for a year prior to the statutory effective date that exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the statutory effective date. In addition, an employee is a section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, if the employee's current accrued benefit as of that date is based on compensation for a year prior to the OBRA '93 effective date that exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date. For this purpose, a current accrued benefit is not treated as based on compensation that exceeded the relevant annual compensation limit, if a plan makes a fresh start using the formula with wear-away described in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(4)(ii), and the employee's accrued benefit determined under §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(4)(ii)(B), taking into account the annual compensation limit, exceeds the employee's frozen accrued benefit (or, if applicable, the employee's adjusted accrued benefit) as of the fresh-start date. (ii) Section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date . Section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date means a fresh-start date as defined in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;12 not earlier than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the statutory effective date, and not later than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the effective date of these regulations. (iii) OBRA '93 fresh-start date . OBRA '93 fresh-start date means a fresh-start date as defined in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;12 not earlier than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date, and not later than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the effective date of these regulations. (iv) Section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit . Section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit means the accrued benefit for any section 401(a)(17) employee frozen (as defined in §1.401(a)(4)&hyph;13(c)(3)(i)) as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before the statutory effective date.
