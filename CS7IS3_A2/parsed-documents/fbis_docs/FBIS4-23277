This happened because the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] delegate in that district burned one of the electoral registration posts in the capital of Gile and afterwards, with a group of people, attempted to destroy the District Elections Commission office. Having been immediately detained by the Police of the Republic of Mozambique Command, the delegate of Renamo in Gile District said he was following orders from his superiors since Renamo does not recognize the electoral organs.
