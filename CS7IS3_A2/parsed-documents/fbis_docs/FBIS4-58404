Musa said the talks dealt with many bilateral, regional, and international issues. They also dealt with the peace process and issues of concern to Asia, Africa, and the Arab world. The Japanese foreign minister said he was happy that Egypt was the first country he was visiting after the formation of the new Japanese Government. The visit, he said, comes at an important time, with the peace process witnessing the major development of the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. He said he would be glad to attend the signing ceremony. Kakizawa said Egypt and Japan are playing roles to help solve regional and international problems. He said today's talks were an important step toward boosting bilateral ties and entrenching the international role of the two countries. He stressed the importance of Egypt's African and Arab role and said Japan is eager to hold the necessary consultations with Egypt. The Japanese foreign minister expressed regret at the postponement of President Mubarak's scheduled visit to Japan last month. He said Japan hopes the visit will take place as soon as possible and at the right time. He said he would meet President Mubarak today to tell him that Japan is willing to renew the invitation to his excellency to visit.
