Twenty-four Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew members were found dead in a lower deck cabin of a tour boat on Lake Qiandao in the coastal Province of Zhejiang on March 31. The incident prompted waves of protest in Taiwan because of Beijing's obstruction into investigation of the matter by relatives of the victims and Taiwan reporters. Tang Shubei, Standing Vice Chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and SEF Deputy Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping reached the decision in a meeting Tuesday [12 April] in Beijing. The SEF and ARATS are authorized by Taipei and Beijing to handle cross-strait exchanges. Tang also agreed that Beijing would more thoroughly investigate the incident. The mainland had earlier claimed the disaster was accidental, but later said sabotage was possible. Tang expressed the hope that both sides would take necessary measures to minimize the negative impact on cross-strait exchanges brought about by the incident. Taipei on Tuesday announced the suspension of cultural and trade exchanges with the mainland over the tragedy. Many tour agents also announced a boycott of mainland trips. He said after the meeting that Beijing was concerned about how the investigation into the matter was being handled, and has instructed relevant agencies, including the Taiwan Affairs Council and Zhejiang Province authorities, to probe more deeply into the case.
