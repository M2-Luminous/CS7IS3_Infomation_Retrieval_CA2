Officials said the prime minister filed the request during a three-way meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (sDP) [SDPJ], the largest among the seven ruling parties, and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), who is health and welfare minister. Murayama reaffirmed his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle, telling the prime minister, "an early reshaping targeted at a specific cabinet member would cause turmoil." Ouchi echoed the SDPJ leader and called for prudence on Hosokawa's part, the officials said. In the meeting, Hosokawa reiterated his hope to reshuffle the cabinet soon after the passage, expected this week, of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and of bills revising the political reform package, they said. Hosokawa told Murayama and Ouchi that he will make a decision after hearing the opinions of all the seven coalition party leaders. The seven parties are divided on the proposed cabinet reshuffle, with the SDPJ, DSP and Takemura's Sakigake against it and Shinseito and Komeito pushing strongly for it. Hosokawa's own Japan New Party has a formal alliance with Sakigake, making its stand on the reshuffle complicated, while the attitude of the United Social Democratic Party is not clear. Earlier on Monday, Hosokawa told a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee that he may think of the reshuffle after the Diet finishes debate on amendments to the political reform package and third supplementary budget conclusion. Takemura told reporters Monday he has not accepted Hosokawa's plan to remove him from the post of the chief cabinet secretary and name him to another ministerial position. Newspaper reports earlier Monday said Takemura is ready to give up the key cabinet post.
