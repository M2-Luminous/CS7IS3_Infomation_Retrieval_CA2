Even his own party people did not understand why the veteran politician suddenly went off the track and described the incidents in Ankara and Istanbul over the weekend as an Islamic "uprising," nor his threat that sooner or later his party would come to power to establish a "just order" in Turkey and that people should either accept the transition from the current system to the "just order" peacefully or through blood. There was a wide range of speculations on why Erbakan, also known as the "hodja" [Muslim teacher], decided to make such remarks. Some well-respected Islamic intellectuals felt Erbakan's statements were a blatant provocation and that the RP chairman was serving certain Western interests who are trying to belittle the cause of Islam in Turkey. Erbakan had said: "If you do not accept the election results (the fact that the Welfare had won the municipal polls) then people will rise up as we saw during the weekend." It seems the hodja misses the point that while his party won 19.5 percent of the votes, 80.5 percent of the voters did not vote for the Welfare and thus rejected his program. That means a great majority of the people are not in favor of these pro-Islamic policies. If his so-called uprising means the minority wants to rule the majority then Erbakan will be in for a great surprise. We do not think Turkey experienced an uprising at the weekend. What started as a government approved protest by ultranationalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina got out of hand in Ankara and Istanbul as some radical Islam activists infiltrated the ranks of the demonstrators and tried to exploit the situation. Actually they were successful to a certain extent and the security forces were caught off guard. Erbakan has attracted the fury of everyone, both among the pro-Islamic supporters in Turkey, the moderates and even the radicals. We feel the Welfare should not get carried away with its success at the municipal elections. As we mentioned before, this is not a grand victory but a relative achievement for a religiously orientated party. If they feel they can capitalize on the boost they received at the elections by taking to the streets as a show of force they will soon see how mistaken they are. What Erbakan and his colleagues should be doing now is to reconcile their differences with the masses in Turkey and prove they are an integral part of the Republican order. That way they can put an end to the dangerous polarization of the "believers" and the "nonbelievers" and create an atmosphere of brotherhood in Turkey. Talking of blood and uprisings is not the way to do this because then the silent masses, who are believers but who are also secularist, will feel obliged to deal a heavy blow to the fanatics who think they can turn Turkey into a Muslim fundamentalist state.
