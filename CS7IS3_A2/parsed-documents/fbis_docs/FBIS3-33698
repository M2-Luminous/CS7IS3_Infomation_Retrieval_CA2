The coffin, which was wrapped in Jordanian flag, was taken off the plane while the members of Na'ib's family shouted: Allahu Akbar [God is great], O martyr of Jordan. Official Jordanian sources have ruled out any personal motive behind this operation because it was carried out in an organized way. The Jordanian officials, who do not see any clear explanation for the assassination, noted that it is linked with extremist elements, perhaps against the background of Jordan's involvement in the peace process. Amman is waiting for the results of the ongoing investigations in Lebanon and asked to be briefed on the results as details are available. [passage omitted]
