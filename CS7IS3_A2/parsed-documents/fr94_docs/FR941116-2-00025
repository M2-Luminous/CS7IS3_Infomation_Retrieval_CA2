FR941116-2-00025 FR941116-2-00015 Big Sandy has agreed in writing to provide non-jurisdictional gathering services on an open-access basis for all of CNGT's existing customers at rates no higher than those currently being charged by CNGT. Big Sandy says that it intends to operate the facilities to be acquired in Big Sandy I in conjunction with the facilities that are the subject of the instant petition. As a result, Big Sandy states that shippers shall only pay a single rate for gathering services regardless of the distance and facilities over which the gas must flow. Big Sandy says that those entities now relying upon service will be assured of continuing to receive such service by execution of a gathering agreement neither materially different from nor more expensive than they currently receive from CNGT. As for service to Hope Gas, Inc., (Hope) an affiliate distribution company with sales meters on the facilities to be acquired, Big Sandy states that service will be continued through a gas sales contract between a Big Sandy affiliate and Hope.
