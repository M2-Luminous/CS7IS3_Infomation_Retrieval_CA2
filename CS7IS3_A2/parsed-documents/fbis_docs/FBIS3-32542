The Court's believes that the head of state could have violated the Constitution by authorizing the arrival of foreign soldiers in Colombian territory without consulting the Council of State or the Senate, so it requested an investigation. The issue refers to the 5 January arrival of 150 U.S. military engineers in Juanchaco on Colombia's Pacific coast with the declared purpose of building a school and health center and renovating some roads. The presence of U.S. soldiers in this area and in Meta Department, where radar installations were erected, as well as the constant passage of vessels and military aircraft through Colombian territory gave rise to a heated debate and heightened arguments among candidates during the electoral campaign. In light of the situation, the Council of State asked for an explanation from the president, who last week submitted an extensive document, based on which the Court issued the following pronouncement adopted unanimously following a five-hour session: "1. The government has at no point asked for an opinion to permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as foreign vessels and aircraft in the national territory in accordance with the provisions of Articles 189 and 237 of the Political Constitution. ``2. In light of the Constitution, it does not find convincing the explanations given by the government on the decisions it has made concerning this matter, because the interpretation of the text of the same and the treaties and agreements signed by Colombia is opposed to the letter and the spirit of the Political Constitution and violates national sovereignty. ``3. From the same explanations, it can be deducted that the Senate did not grant the permission established by Article 173 of the Constitution. ``4. Given the situation that has arisen, it believes that U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in Colombian territory without fulfilling with the requisites set forth in the Constitution. ``5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the president of the Republic is responsible for the foreign relations of the Colombian State with absolute respect for national sovereignty. ``Consequently, it is unusual that the president says that the minister of defense gave the authorization without his previous knowledge when the memorandum of understanding signed by said minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993 establishes that they are acting with 'due authorization from their respective governments'.'' It should be noted that the last Colombian president investigated by the House was former General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in 1958. Rojas had assumed power in a coup d'etat five years earlier.
