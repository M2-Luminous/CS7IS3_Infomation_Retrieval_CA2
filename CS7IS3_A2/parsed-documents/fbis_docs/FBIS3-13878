In a departure statement, Sha'th said that at a time when the Hebron massacre brought to the fore the issue of settlements, the United States and Israel raised the issue of Jerusalem. Sha'th added: Jerusalem will remain the capital of Palestine and its future independent state and a capital to all Muslim and Christian people in the world. Israel's claims in this regard are completely rejected. Jerusalem is an occupied city that is subject to all the Geneva conventions and will remain so until the occupation ends.
