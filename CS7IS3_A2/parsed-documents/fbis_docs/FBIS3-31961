Defending the validity of the government decision adopted on 28 January, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said today the increase was "absolutely inevitable." He explained that this decision is aimed at covering the budget deficit caused by the fall in international petroleum prices. In statements made on a radio and television network, Robalino noted that the plan initially proposed to cover the fiscal gap -- estimated by the government at $1 million per day -- did not include fuel hikes, but only tax reforms. "However, Congress rejected the plan and left us no other alternative," he continued. The adjustment, which would result in $250 million in additional revenue for the state in 1994, sparked a wave of protests and street disturbances even before the official announcement was made. On 28 January three policemen were seriously injured in clashes with demonstrators, who closed the major roadways in Ecuadoran cities again today. The United Workers Front [FUT] today called for an indefinite general strike for an unspecified date, while the Transportation Workers Union threatened to paralyze transportation if the government insisted on its announcement to freeze fares. All parties, except the two progovernment parties, voiced their opposition to the measures prior to the government announcement and reported their intentions to fight it in Congress "like we did with the package to increase taxes," said Heinz Moeller, legislative wing leader of the Social Christian Party, the largest in the Chamber. The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen is experiencing a severe popularity crisis, confirmed by polls taken even before the adjustment, with an approval rating of below 10 percent. Additionally, political experts believe that "the government is too weak, alone, and without prestige to try to implement such a harsh and badly presented package." However, the government said that "its economic successes, in particular lowering inflation to less than half in one year, gives it the moral strength necessary to implement an adjustment which, no matter what, is absolutely unavoidable." Different parties and organizations have called for street mobilizations on Monday, but the government anticipated today that "no interference with peace will be tolerated."
