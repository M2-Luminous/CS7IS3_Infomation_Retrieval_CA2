This was the first time Lien publicly confirmed his New York trip. Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, arrived in San Salvador Tuesday to attend the inauguration of the new Salvadoran president, Armando Calderon Sol. Lien will leave here Thursday for Guatemala for a four-day visit. He will then proceed to New York for a two-day stay. Lien told a group of Taiwan reporters after attending a cocktail reception given by Calderon that his New York trip is purely for private purposes. "While there, I won't meet with any person except my children," Lien noted. Two of Lien's children are studying in New York. "I expect a happy family reunion there," he said. Lien, who has a doctoral degree from the University of Chicago, said he visited New York many times while he was studying in the United States. "I have fond memories of that city," he added. Lien's wife, who is accompanying Lien on his Salvador and Guatemala visits, will fly to New York along with Lien. Other members of Lien's entourage, including Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Chairman Sun Ming-hsien of the Council of Agriculture, will return to Taipei after the Guatemala visit. On his way to San Salvador from Taipei, Lien stopped in Los Angeles and Miami. Lien also made stopovers in the two American cities when he visited Honduras early this year. Taiwan does not maintain diplomatic ties with the United States. For fear of offending Beijing, the U.S. Government has been reluctant to engage in high-level contacts with Taiwan. It only allowed Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui to make a short stop in Hawaii on his way to Nicaragua in May.
