INTERFAX: Ukraine's signing of the CIS treaty of an economic union was one of the highlights of the Moscow CIS summit. Why did the Ukrainian leadership choose the status of an associated member and what practical benefit can Ukraine derive from it? KRAVCHUK: I think that in this case the difference between full and associated members is symbolic because the CIS has not taken final shape yet. The Commonwealth is in the making. Ukraine's signature under all economic documents of the summit is another indication of the fact that there is practically no difference between associated and full members. The point is that when the Ukrainian parliament discussed the founding documents of the CIS, it ratified them with certain reservations which remain in force and being president I could not ignore them when I signed the treaty. This is the explanation for our associated status, but it will not prevent us from most active and full membership in the union in the future. IF Note: On 15 April after discussing the implementation of the treaty of the economic union the Moscow summit formed the commission of the union. An agreement on the gradual formation of a free trade zone was also signed. INTERFAX: Some politicians are disappointed with the low efficiency of the CIS and offer other patterns of integration of former Soviet republics. What is your attitude to the idea of the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev concerning an Eurasian union and the calls of the Russian Deputy Prime-Minister Sergey Shakhray for a confederation of Eurasian states? KRAVCHUK: Today the large-scale integration which some politicians speak of imply the European Union as a model is beyond our possibilities. It would be naive to think that the signing of certain decisions automatically leads to the formation of effective integration mechanisms whether it be the CIS or the Eurasian union. In order to be effective, conditions should be formed gradually step by step. We should have complete clarity: what aims and tasks do we put forward? It is an open secret that the European Union covered a road of 35 years before it reached its present form. The CIS is only a couple of years old and we have not yet managed to build mechanisms guaranteeing the Commonwealth at least minimal efficiency. It is not a question of the reluctance of leaders to resolve the matters, but the absence of objective conditions. Besides, the transition to other forms of integration should be civilized. First of all, a team of truly qualified persons should define all the parameters of such transformation and later discuss the matter with the public. Look how tolerantly European countries approach these matters, what respect they show for the public: they hold referendums and polls. Our mentality has been different: leaders would get together, sign papers and consider the matter settled. And we are not concerned at all about the public response, believing that the people will later see what is what. Probably, that is not quite correct. I do not reject the idea of deepening integration in principle, but I do not want it to become a subject of hasty solutions at this moment. INTERFAX: There is certain anxiety in Russian government circles about the results of Ukrainian parliamentary elections. It stems from the victory of opposite political forces in different parts of your country. What do you think of the forecasts about the growing disintegration of Ukraine and the prediction that for the sake of consolidation an attempt might be made to play the nationalist card using such problems as the Black Sea Fleet etc.? KRAVCHUK: The results of our parliamentary elections prompt the question: consolidation around what or confrontation with whom? In Russia, by the way, different forces won strong positions in parliament, but no Russian political circles are debating the possibility of Russia joining Ukraine. If anyone raised the matter in your Federal Assembly, the person would hardly be taken seriously. We can speak of certain differences between western and eastern regions over the future of the country whether it should be independent, with Russia or under Russia. As president I declare that I want to live in friendship, cooperation and partnership with Russia. But I do not wish to be under Russia. Some people accuse me of hypocrisy. I am really convinced that this form of bilateral relations is the best -- friendship and partnership. The acute problems should be resolved so that Ukraine and Russia would live as good neighbors. I think we have managed to resolve one of them -- nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine. I am pleased that the trilateral agreement (Yeltsin-Clinton-Kravchuk) is beginning to work despite the difficulties. The next matter is the Black Sea Fleet. Without going into details I would want to view the Odessa incident as an example of fast and constructive settlement of matters related to the fleet. We should not try to find the right and the wrong side, but use mechanisms worked out in Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra. It is simply necessary to sit down to the negotiating table guided by good intentions. There can be no other approach. When the Russian military say they intend to control the entire fleet and infrastructure and Ukrainians say they will not give away anything, both sides are unrealistic, they are making a mistake. Here are a few figures. According to 1992 prices, the fleet with its infrastructure cost 35 trillion rubles or $35 Bn [billion] according to the then exchange rate. If today Ukraine accepts the version suggested by the Russian military, Russia must immediately pay Ukraine $14 Bn. Can Russia afford that? Therefore one should not kick up a racket. The problem should be resolved gradually on a realistic basis avoiding slogans. First, the fleet should be separated, divided because if there are two commanders "in one kitchen," they are bound to argue. The experience of relations between fleet commanders and the commanders of the Ukrainian navy has proved that. At the next stage the matter of the Russian naval base should be resolved in keeping with international principles. In this case we mean Sevastopol. But that is too little for your military. They are pressuring the political leadership and the leadership is procrastinating the solution of the problem. When your military say, that in addition to Sevastopol Feodosia, Odessa, Izmail, Nikolayev and all airfields should be considered the naval base, I ask them: "Are you serious?" Twelve Russian naval bases in Ukraine! That is impossible. The matter belongs to parliament. Several times already Ukraine has expressed its agreement to sell Russia part of the fleet and I have not given up these intentions. But first we should have a chance to see the documents and find out what costs what. I have the right to know that I am giving away. INTERFAX: One gets the impression that you can effectively cooperate with Boris Yeltsin on the acutest matters, like in Massandra on the fleet problem, but later these concrete decisions of the presidents are not carried out. KRAVCHUK: Every nation elects the leader to its liking. Russians elected Yeltsin, Ukrainians -- Kravchuk. Whether we fit each other as persons or not, we must work together. As for Boris Yeltsin personally, I find a possibility to resolve difficult matters with him. I raise questions and get a clear answer, positive or negative, but clear. You mentioned the Massandra agreement (under the protocol to it the Ukrainian part of the fleet was to be leased by Russia -- INTERFAX). However, this document was preceeded by the Yalta and Zavidovo agreements (on the division of the fleet -- INTERFAX). No one denounced. They were still in force. The Massandra protocol was very beneficial to certain political forces. They forgot about Yalta and Zavidovo and concentrated on the Massandra protocol. The three documents should be taken as a package and the problem resolved fast. IF Note: The Moscow talks between Russia and Ukraine last Friday resulted in an agreement on the gradual settlement of problems related to the Black Sea Fleet. Under the document the two sides "willing to strengthen friendship, cooperation and partnership" agreed on the following: 1. The Ukrainian navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet shall be based separately. 2. Ukraine shall keep 15-20 percent of the fleet's ships and vessels. 3. An agreement on the parameters of such a division shall be worked out within 10 days. The Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy told the press that the fleet shall be divided fifty-fifty. Out of the half that is going to Ukraine 15-20 percent will be kept by Kiev and the rest sold to Russia. However, the Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has not confirmed this interpretation. INTERFAX: Many experts believe that the incident involving the Cheleken hydrographic ship for the first time demonstrated the possibility of an armed clash between Ukrainians and Russians. Do you earnestly think of ways to rule out the very possibility of the repetition of such conflict situations in the future? KRAVCHUK: This is the key question for us. We should not argue over matters related to the Black Sea Fleet and especially Sevastopol, even though I realize how painful they are for the Russian mentality. The Russian leadership is bound to take it into account and protect Russians, while I must protect Ukraine. We must make decisions that would guarantee our peoples who have lived shoulder to shoulder for 340 years against arguments. It is the task of politicians to demonstrate restraint and will without permitting themselves to be dragged into conflict situations which armed people always begin. Sometimes one shot aggravates problems so much that it becomes impossible to stop the avalanche later. The examples and lessons are before our eyes: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia. That is why I am in favor of quick solutions, of not putting things off. We have no right to argue even over the Crimea. We should do so that the Crimea would not separate us and our peoples. Leaders come and go, nations remain.
