The assembly proposes to simplify the complicated procedure of issuing residence permits by reregistering all resident list entries made before July 1990. The statement suggests that persons living in Estonia since July 1990 should be given legal guarantees as to receiving residence permits. "A short, simple and universally understandable procedure needs to be worked out that wouldn't depend on politics and the arbitrariness of officials," the statement reads. The assembly holds the position that the promises and decrees of the government are insufficient as guarantee. The Estonian Cabinet ruled at the end of last month to extend the residence permit application deadline and grant the rights of a permanent resident to those holders of temporary residence permits who were entered in permanent resident lists before July 1990. The government decree stemmed from the wave of protests of Russian organizations against the current procedure for registering permit applications and issuing permits. The Russian Representative Assembly also urges that the issue of granting residence and work permits to Russian retired officers be solved in a "humane manner." "This issue of principle will probably have to be solved at interstate (Estonian-Russian) negotiations," the statement reads. The assembly suggests that, pending solution, all military retirees be issued temporary residence permits and granted all rights of a permanent resident.
