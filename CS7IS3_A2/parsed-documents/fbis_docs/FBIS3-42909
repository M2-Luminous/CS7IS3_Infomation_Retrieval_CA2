Sabirov visited the capital of Ukraine, the city of Kiev. Bilateral negotiations took place in the House of Government of Ukraine. M.G. Sabirov, speaking before participants in the negotiations, emphasized that friendly relations between peoples whose ancestors have from time immemorial populated the banks of the Dnieper and the Volga have their roots deep in past centuries. The historical chronicles mention the agreement between the Volga Bulgars and the Kievan Prince Vladimir. The intergovernmental agreement between the two republics concerning mutually advantageous cooperation in the areas of trade, science, technology, culture, and art will be another confirmation of their friendly relations. In response, the acting head of the government of Ukraine, Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy, noted that the deep changes occurring in the socioeconomic life of the two states and the economic difficulties related to the transition to the market make it necessary to rethink existing experience in business cooperation and imbue it with new content. Relations between our republics should be equal and mutually advantageous and be built on principles of mutual respect and confidence. As a result of the negotiations an intergovernmental agreement was signed for commercial-economic, scientific-technical, and cultural cooperation between the Republic of Tatarstan and Ukraine, which envisions providing favorable economic, financial, and legal conditions for economic and other entrepreneurial activity: the creation of joint ventures, the expansion and establishment of direct ties between enterprises and organizations of the two republics, the opening of trade missions and branches of national banks, and the development of cooperation in the areas of culture, art, science, and education. The Ukrainian side responded positively to the relations that are being arranged between the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic of Crimea. The heads of the delegations gave specific instructions to the leaders of ministries and departments regarding the coordination of the list of goods and the volumes of work and services for which our republics are experiencing a need and for which mutual deliveries should be organized. Chairmen of national banks were instructed to earmark a mechanism for mutual settlements for the goods and services delivered. The negotiations proceeded in a warm, friendly atmosphere. Participating from the Republic of Tatarstan were: Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet A.N. Lozovoy, Deputy Prime Minister R.F. Muratov, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Sh.R. Arslanov, and general directors of the associations Sviyaga--G.G. Agadzhanov, Orgsintez--N.Kh. Yusupov, Nizhnekamskneftekhim--G.Z. Sakhapov, and Tatneft--first general deputy director Sh.F. Takhutdinov. From the Ukrainian side, Deputy Prime Minister V.I. Landik and leaders of ministries and departments. In honor of the delegation from the Republic of Tatarstan the government of Ukraine held a dinner during which M.G. Sabirov and Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy exchanged speeches. That evening the government delegation from Tatarstan headed by Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov returned to Kazan.
