Turkmenistan ceased gas exports to Ukraine early this year after Kiev's failure to service its gas bill of 600 million dollars. Until recently, Moscow was helping Ukraine by stepping up its own gas exports to that country under a deal the two sides struck in the Russian capital on March 10. It is now known that Russia and Ukraine are due to start talks in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the whole range of bilateral relations including Kiev's failure to service its debt for gas imports from Russia. Kiev does not follow the schedule of debt repayment put down in a protocol the two sides signed on April 12, a senior official of Russia's Gazprom company said. He also said that Belarus' gas debt did not increase as fast as Ukraine's and Moldova's debt (Russia cut back gas exports to Kishinev [Chisinau] by 30 percent in April). The official said Moldova was holding talks with a number of European banks to try to get loans to be able to repay its debt to Moscow. Under bilateral agreements, Russia's gas exports to Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova this year will run at 16.4, 54.8 and 3.1 billion cu meters respectively.
