The FRG, for example, was traditionally the Soviet Union's largest Western trading partner, but in 1989 trade with the Soviet Union accounted for only 1.5 percent of total West German foreign trade, that is, less than trade with Denmark. The Soviet model of the past was autarky motivated by military considerations, and that was the case even at a time when war between the two nuclear alliances was impossible and it was clear that the future belonged to whoever led in the civilian technology field. Now that the Cold War is over, we have a chance to achieve lasting peace. In Western Europe, economic integration has led to stability and enduring peace. Economic cooperation and the growth in prosperity resulting from it are significant elements in a new security structure for all of Europe. We want to achieve a state of affairs in which security is primarily guaranteed by extensive ties, cooperation, and trust, not by military capability. Open markets promote an international climate of confidence and fair dealings with each other. They encourage the exchange of ideas and bring peoples close to one another. Free trade relations promote peace. What now has to be produced is a "Strategy for Partnership" for the democratic states of the East and West. The basic idea underlying such a strategy is that in a rapidly changing international environment, mutual interests have to be taken into account and that there should be a long-term strategic vision rather than short-term responses to individual events. One of the most important elements of such a strategy would undoubtedly be support for the reforms in Russia and the Eastern European states. A democratic, stable, economically healthy, open, and predictable Russia accords with the interests of the entire world. It must be clear to everyone that the world does not need a weak, strife-torn Russia, but needs a Russia that is a strong partner, one that will make an indispensable contribution to the creation of global peace structures and will assume a lasting place in the family of free, law-governed, and democratic states. That is the most effective way of putting a stop to aggressive nationalism. Everything possible must be done to give Russia and the reform states of Eastern Europe access to world markets. However, this is only possible to the extent that conditions for free enterprise are created in Russia. The decades of squandering Russia's natural wealth by providing artificially cheap energy at the expense of the population is an example of how violations of free market laws harm the people. Thus, market-oriented reform in Russia is not only a condition for full participation in the global marketplace, but also a condition for the economically sensible and thrifty use of Russia's own domestic strengths. That in turn is a condition for Russia's economic success. Russia will only become democratically stable if it is economically successful, and it can only become a lasting partner for stability in Europe and the rest of the world if it is democratically stable. Russia has had a democratic constitution since 12 December 1993. The Russian parliament enjoys democratic legitimacy. Thus, Russia has moved much closer to membership of the European Council. At the same time, the foundations of the framework for a law-governed state, which is necessary for the functioning of social market economy, have been created. The free market economy needs an active start that can protect its function with regard to competition and laws. A law-governed state and certainty about legal conditions is a basic condition for political and economic freedom. After World War II, West Germany had an opportunity to rebuild the country, which had been ruined, with a social market economy. A social market economy means combining the freedom of the market with the dictates of social justice. At first, West Germany also experienced a wave of inflation and unemployment while the war economy, with its excessive emphasis on armaments and heavy industry, was converted to meet the demands of the population of a country living in peace. Once this conversion crisis had been overcome, however, the social market economy came to mean increasing prosperity for all. The situation in Russia today is in some respects different from that in West Germany 45 years ago. However, the mechanisms of free market development, which were effective then, are no less effective today. Whoever disregards them pays the price in the form of stagnation and decline. Russia possesses immeasurable reserves of mineral resources. However, its greatest wealth lies in its inhabitants, in their professional qualifications, their spiritual strength, and tenacity. Russia possesses first-rate educational reserves. In the research and development field, there are many technologies in which it is a world leader. This valuable potential must be retained and developed. The transition from centralized command and administrative structures as well as state monopolies to a decentralized free market economy based on competition is a unique historical process for which there are no models. The right course will be a tightrope walk between extremes. A shock without therapy is no less dangerous than a therapy that only tries to treat symptoms without addressing the roots of the illness. A difficult political balance between the exigency of effecting a transition and the vital necessity of maintaining social stability will continually have to be struck. Adjustments will be inevitable. There is no ideal way leading to the future. However, there is even less of a way back. Without the reformist beginnings of the past few years, the current situation in Russia would be all the more difficult. The latest economic data provide grounds for hope: Russia's position in foreign trade is beginning to improve, the privatization program is making impressive progress, production is gradually responding to signals from consumers. Russia is demonstrating that it possesses the capacity for self-renewal, a capacity that has enabled Russia to survive times of crisis so often in its history. Russia cannot simply copy Western models and theories. Russia will modernize, but it will not give up its deep-rooted culture and wealth of tradition. In the same way as the requirements in Russia are unique, reform processes must also take account of the elements unique to Russia's situation. The free market economy in Germany is, for example, different from that Japan, although the fundamental principles are the same. With active German support, Russia has made considerable progress on the way to global economic partnership: It is an equal member in international financial institutions and a partner in dialogue with the G-7. Germany will promote the development of this dialogue. Germany supports Russia in developing closer ties with the OECD. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls will be disbanded. Instead, Russia will become an equal partner in a new forum that is to collect comprehensive information on exports of military technology worldwide. Extensive progress has been made in negotiations between the EU and Russia on comprehensive agreement on cooperation and partnership. So far, Germany has provided Russia with assistance totaling almost 90 billion German marks. It thus accounts for over 50 percent of worldwide support for Russia's reforms. This unequivocally reflects Germany's firm commitment to engage in partnership with a democratic Russia. The unilateral transfer of assistance is not, however, a permanent state of affairs. It can only assist the growth of solid, mutually advantageous trade relations, but cannot be a substitute for Russian efforts to achieve a transformation. Until now, Russia has primarily exported raw materials. It must now enter world markets with technologically advanced products. That assumes that military production will undergo conversion with the aim of boosting civilian prosperity. In the future, Russia's greatness will not be measured in terms of the number of soldiers or weapons it has, or the size of its territory. Russia's global role will become all the more important if it succeeds in developing a future-oriented, democratic model of society, bolstering CSCE principles, contributing to an increase in prosperity -- in Russia and worldwide -- and participating constructively in mankind's great future tasks. Not military capacity for destruction, but economic and technical capacity, and positive development will determine states' status and influence. Russian intellectual and cultural life must once again assume its appropriate place in cultural dialogue. Change begins in the mind. If one analyzes the economic successes of the countries of Southeast Asia, one notes that a large number of highly gifted students studied abroad for a time and brought back new ideas and impulses. The same path is also open to the former communist reformist states. For almost three generations, there were virtually insurmountable barriers between the intellectual life of Russia and that of the rest of the world. Now, there has to be a lot of catching up in this respect. Exchanges for students and academic staff must be expanded. That is the only way in which understanding between peoples can grow and knowledge and experience can be used for the good of all transcending all borders. It is also important that Russians themselves see the results of cooperation with other countries with their own eyes. With that in mind, models for this kind of cooperation must be created in the individual regions of Russia. The Murmansk region, which one of the authors of this article represents in the Russian Parliament as a democratically elected deputy, can serve as an example in this respect. This Russian region, which was previously hermetically sealed off, is now being extensively opened up for direct contacts and cooperation with neighboring states and other countries. To provide active support for this process by promoting specific economic and investment projects means demonstrating that our partnership is reality. After World War II, Germany achieved a peaceful reconciliation with its neighbors by way of democracy and the free market economy. This not only facilitated the unification of Germany, but also opened up opportunities for the economic and cultural blossoming of the whole country. Today, Russia has the same opportunities. The transition is difficult and will require time. The Russians themselves know that best of all. However, through that transition, Russia can finally develop its potential and find its role in the international community.
