According to our correspondent in the area, the movement has been ordered by disillusioned Generals Sukissa and Luis Passeira. Preparations for a military offensive against diamond-producing UNITA areas have been going on for some time. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] has warned government troops not to accept such adventures because they will receive shameful and sad lessons since FALA will not tolerate any kind of aggression.
