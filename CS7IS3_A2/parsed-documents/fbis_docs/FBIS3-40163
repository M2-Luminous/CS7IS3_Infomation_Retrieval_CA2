The leadership of the People's Bank of China pointed out at that time that this would be an experimental arrangement, that the Bank of Communications would operate as the bank of the reform, but not become a reform target. What kind of an experiment will it then be, and what kind of a reform? I. No More Feeding From the "Large Rice Bowl" in the Financial System The fundamental reasons for this kind of an experiment by China's financial establishment had been the sharp contradictions that had arisen since the start of reform and opening up to the outside world between the pressing needs for capital funds and China's inappropriate financial and monetary system. Throughout the country, everybody wanted to start up large-scale developments, great undertakings, and new projects. All this needed money, and people rushed to the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance, but that ministry's funds were limited. If some items were serviced, funds were short for others, and then the banks would be asked to grant loans. In the end, as loans were granted year after year, deficits increased year after year. Later, everybody got to know the ingenious way of "business on borrowed money," everybody borrowed from the banks, and economic development was being pursued with much borrowing, as expressed in such common sayings as "much in and much out," "borrow a hen to lay eggs," and "borrow a ship to sail the oceans." Development was given priority, while reforms were being held up. In all quarters, high and low, right and left, pressure was put on the banks, as everybody tried to squeeze money out of them. The organizational system of China's state banks was one of soft restraints, so that anyone clever enough could always squeeze some money out of the banks. If the lower-level banks would be out of cash, they would ask their superior establishments for allocations, and if these higher-ranking banks would be out of cash, they would ask for money supplies from the central bank. "Enterprises were feeding from the `large rice bowl' of the specialized banks, and the specialized banks were feeding from the `large rice bowl' of the People's Bank of China." This system of soft restraints left almost no other devices to the central bank and for the state in its macro-regulation and control of the economy than to take administrative measures, which would then "cut everything with one and the same knife." On the other hand, it is characteristic of administrative measures that "applied loosely, they will lead to chaos, and applying stricter restraint, they will be fatal strangleholds." Their remedies will only be superficial, and if applied repeatedly will inflict immeasurable damage on the Chinese economy. Is there then no better way? II. Indeed, One Ship Has Already Been Launched on its Long Experimental Journey Policymakers in China's financial establishment are now planning to change the said situation: First, a balance has to be established as between development and reform; it is just not possible under the old system of organization to maintain the drive for high-speed development. Second, the state's specialized banks are to be converted into state-owned commercial banks. These banks should truly become financial enterprises with autonomy in their business operations, responsibility for profits and losses, and that operate with self-restraint and responsibility for self-development. Third, separate banks shall be set up for "state policy-directed" operations. These banks shall be specially charged with the handling of all "state policy-directed" financial operations. Fourth, the position and functions of the central bank shall be strengthened. The second point in fact constitutes the core of the entire financial reform. Reforming the banks as they presently exist will be an extremely protracted and arduous process. The fastest method would be to set up a new bank, operate it as an experiment, and if successful promote the experience on a broader scale. Finally, we may cite the case of the newly reconstituted Bank of Communications, which is already engaged in experimental operations since the end of 1986. This is the first publicly owned bank of the shareholding system. The central bank, representing the state, is controlling 23 percent of the shares, finance departments of various local governments are holding 42 percent, and various state-owned enterprises are holding 35 percent of the shares. It is the first bank with a comprehensive sphere of business operations; it has the capability to transact at all times foreign remittance, securities, leasing, insurance, real estate, and investment business. It is the first bank establishing branches throughout the country according to the location of economic centers, and not according to administrative regions. It is the first commercial bank with responsibility for its own profits and losses, with autonomy in its business operations, with responsibility for self-development and self-restraints, bearing responsibility for risks taken, and, all of its own, endeavoring to maintain a well-balanced fund situation. The central bank granted the Bank of Communications a large array of powers, which actually had been of the nature that the various large state-owned special banks at that time had yearned for for a long time. However, the central bank had decisively cut its links with the Bank of Communications as a supplier of funds. If the Bank of Communications should run out of cash, it might as well declare bankruptcy, but will definitely not be allowed to stretch out its hand to demand money from the central bank! This amounts to having the Bank of Communications, even though only recently reconstituted, so to say, fight with its back to the wall. III. Victory in its Initial Battle On 10 December 1986, when the Bank of Communications had been operating in Shanghai on an experimental basis for not quite two months, it is very interesting to hear what some of its customers have to say during this period of its experimental operations. The director of Shanghai No 7 Watch Factory said: "The Bank of Communications approached us on their own accord three times, inviting us to open an account with them. We have never before met with that much warmhearted enthusiasm...." The director of the Shanghai Sports Shoe Main Factory said: "For many years we have tried to raise funds to build a new factory building, but have been rebuffed everywhere. Much steel material has been stored in the open and was getting rusty. It was then that the Bank of Communications helped us out with a loan, `sending charcoal in snowy weather,' as the saying is...." After having been in business for four months, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications had taken in 530 million yuan of deposits at its deposit department; the per capita deposits exceeded 100 million yuan. Li Xiangrui [2621 4382 3843], the then president of the Bank of Communications, went every day several times personally to the big hall of the bank building. He was that eager to have everybody come to the Bank of Communications! In the past, when he had been president of the People's Bank, he had never been so concerned about these kind of things. After four years, the Nanpu Bridge project, that had attracted worldwide attention, has been completed. The one that had undertaken financial responsibility for this huge engineering project was none other than the Bank of Communications, as it had then just started operating. At that time, the chief engineers were rather contemptuous of the young female whom the Bank of Communications had sent them as head of the bank's loan department. They even asked: "Bank of Communications? Never heard of it?" After the spring and summer of 1989, the Asian Development Bank temporarily suspended further loans for the Nanpu Bridge project in Shanghai, and work came to a halt. It was then that the Bank of Communications bravely stepped forward, determined to make use of its own banking reputation in the international financial market to raise funds for the project. It was precisely the female employee of the loan department, whom those oldsters had treated contemptuously, who had arduously struggled on her computer for 10 days, produced a plan to raise funds for the project, and who had startled everybody with her expose at the meeting of those in authority, where her plan was immediately approved. On 17 August 1988, the Bank of Communications issued in Singapore bonds to the amount of $100 million, which were an immediate success! IV. Soul of the Bank of Communications: Control of Assets-Liabilities Ratio A person with inside knowledge of the Bank of Communications once said: "The soul of the Bank of Communications is control of its assets-liabilities ratio." The basic cause for the phenomenon of "everybody feeding from the big iron banking bowl" was precisely that there was no firm self-restraint in matters of bank loans. The thousands of large and small banks shifted the pressures of society's demand for funds on to the shoulders of the central bank, compelling the central bank to again and again expand its scale, increase its currency issue, and thus create an uncontrolled situation as far as the currency was concerned. What if all banks could themselves bear these pressures? The Bank of Communications is a publicly owned bank of the shareholding system. Its ownership is separate from its management right. If it were to run out of money, its shareholders would not stand it, and management would have a hard time. The Bank of Communications has therefore gradually perfected three large systems: One is the system of controlling the use ratio of funds, the other is the system of supervising and checking the quality of its assets, and the third is the system of composite analysis of its financial targets. These together may be called "the system of controlling the assets-liabilities ratio and the system of controlling the risks." The major points of this system are: The total amount of loans must not exceed 85 percent of the aggregate of bank deposits plus capital funds plus annual accumulations. The provision of ready cash must not be lower than 15 percent of total deposits. Fiduciary loans must be limited to within 20 percent of the total amount of loans. Overdue loans must be controlled to within 6 percent. Slow-moving and uncollectible accounts must be controlled to within 3 percent. The Bank of Communications and its various branch institutions are setting up assets-liabilities control committees at every level. These will effect periodical checks, and on the basis of such decide on the promotion or transfer of managers and on the bonuses and welfare benefits for staff and workers. Up to the end of last year, the Bank of Communications has not taken a penny of the central bank's money, but even had a deposit surplus of 12 billion yuan over loans. In transactions with associated banks, its short-term loans to them were 10.7 billion yuan above short-term borrowing from them. Overdue, stagnant, and uncollectible loans accounted for 4.66 percent of all loans, and among these the uncollectible accounts amounted to 0.07 percent. The assets of the Bank of Communications are, within the domestic financial system, undoubtedly first grade quality.
