FR941125-1-00044 FR941125-1-00008 9.5␣Manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance (MCOC). The MCOC must include the results of each test performed for the COMS(s) sampled under section 6.1. The MCOC also shall specify the date of testing according to sections 6.2 through 6.4, the COMS monitor type, serial number, and the intended installation and purchaser of the tested COMS. Section 9.5.1 identifies the minimally acceptable information to be submitted by the manufacturer with the certification of conformance. 9.5.1␣Outline of Certificate of Conformance. a. Instrument Description and Summary of Test Results. The manufacturer shall supply the results of section 6 tests (spectral response curve measurement information, angle of view, angle of projection). b. Test Procedures. The manufacturer shall supply a complete description of the test equipment, procedures, and calculations used in obtaining the results listed in Part I of the certificate. Any procedures not conforming to those specified in section 6 or 7, must be clearly noted. Required supporting documentation for each test (listed below) and any necessary letters demonstrating approval of the alternate procedure by the Administrator shall appear in the appropriate section of Part III. c. Supporting Documentation. Include here any information, besides the procedural descriptions of Part II, which is necessary for verification of compliance with sections 5 and 6. In each section, provide letters demonstrating approval of the alternate procedures listed in Part II, if necessary. (1) Spectral Response. Provide the date of testing, measurement data, and results of the latest calibration performed on the instrument used in the measurement. (2) Angle of View. Include the results of testing. Provide letters demonstrating approval of alternate methods, if necessary. (3) Angle of Projection. Include the results of testing. Provide letters demonstrating approval of alternate methods, if necessary. (4) Verification of Compliance with Additional Design Specifications. The owner and operator or manufacturer shall provide diagrams and operational descriptions of the instrument which demonstrate conformance with the requirements of sections 5.1.5, 5.1.7, 5.1.8, 5.1.9, and 5.1.10. 9.6␣Appendix. Provide the data tabulations and calculations for any of the above demonstrations. 10. Bibliography 1. Experimental Statistics. Department of Commerce. National Bureau of Standards Handbook 91.
