FBIS TRENDS-04APR94-DPRK-IAEA Pyongyang Threatens to Refuel Reactor Without IAEA Presence Pyongyang Threatens to Refuel Reactor Without IAEA Presence SUMMARY Seeking to pressure the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into accepting limited inspection of upcoming refueling activities at Yongbyon, Pyongyang has threatened to proceed with the replacement of fuel rods for its 5-megawatt reactor without an international presence. At the same time, Pyongyang seemed to be hinting at the possibility of some sort of compromise with the IAEA. END SUMMARY Pyongyang used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 4 May to reiterate the position laid out on 27 April that the IAEA will be permitted only to verify non- diversion of spent fuel so as to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards (Pyongyang radio, 4 May). Claiming that for unspecified "technical and security" reasons the refueling of the reactor can "no longer" be delayed, the statement warned that unless the IAEA accepts Pyongyang's terms for inspection, North Korea will have "no alternative" but to proceed with the refueling "according to [its own] operational plan." Clearly seeking to prevent the matter from being referred to the UN Security Council, the statement maintained that even without the presence of IAEA inspectors on the spot, the refueling activities will technically be conducted "under thorough IAEA surveillance," since IAEA-installed monitoring devices and equipment will still be operating to monitor the refueling. Possible Compromise Although couched in its standard self- righteous tones, Pyongyang's latest pronouncement on the limitations of IAEA activities appeared designed to leave North Korea some maneuvering room to avoid a showdown with the agency. While the statement complained that the IAEA is demanding the "selective preservation and measurement" of spent fuel rods after they are replaced, it seemed to focus its objection on the measurement portion of the IAEA's demand, saying that "selective measurement" cannot be allowed. By avoiding an explicit prohibition on "selective preservation" of fuel rods, Pyongyang may be leaving the door open to allowing segregation of sample rods for later measurement--a formulation that could prevent the issue from being referred to the Security Council. In fact, the statement went on to suggest that such measurement would be possible once the IAEA discards its "unfair attitude" toward the DPRK and as part of a "package deal" to be worked out at future DPRK-U.S. high-level talks. Further seeking to project an image of reasonableness, the spokesman's statement claimed that North Korea had already acceded to IAEA demands for additional inspections of the Yongbyon reprocessing plant following the incomplete IAEA inspection last March, but that the agency has so far failed to send inspectors for this purpose. Pyongyang had previously claimed only that it was "studying" the IAEA demands on this matter. Implications Pyongyang's latest authoritative pronouncement on the refueling issue suggests that the North Korean leadership is once again testing the limits of its strategy of minimalist accommodation in resolving the nuclear issue.
