Yang, 50, a Shanghai-based dissident who is also a founder of the Peace Charter movement created last November, said by telephone that he had been released at 9:00 a.m. (0100 GMT) after being held for more than 13 hours. Another CHRA leader, Li Guotao, who was picked up with Yang on Saturday evening, was released at 1:00 a.m. (1700 GMT), Yang said. Yang and Li were the latest dissidents to be taken in for questioning during a police sweep in Beijing and Shanghai that has netted around 15 activists in the last 10 days. The detentions coincided with the opening in Beijing of the annual session of the Chinese parliament and the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
