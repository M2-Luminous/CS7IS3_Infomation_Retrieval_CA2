FBIS3-14248 "drnes057bb_94004" FBIS-NES-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs Sources Discuss King Husayn Visit to Oman, Qatar 94P50110A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 22 Mar 94 pp 1, 4 94P50110A London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:CSO [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat and Salamah Ni'mat in Amman] [Text] King Husayn Bin-Talal began a several-day private visit to the Sultanate of Oman for talks with Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id about regional and Arab issues. Informed sources speaking with AL-HAYAH thought it likely that the two monarchs, who have strong personal ties and conduct regular talks, would confine their discussions to the political crisis in Yemen. They have taken a mediating role and responsibility for the signing of the pledge and accord agreement, which lost no time in breaking down. These sources indicated their belief that the visit of the Jordanian monarch and his talks in Salalah (Sultan Qabus' southern summer capital, about 1,000 km from Muscat) are what will decide whether the two sides will proceed in their joint mediation or whether they will give the opportunity to other Arab parties that have entered the crisis recently, especially President Husni Mubarak, who announced day before yesterday that he is trying to arrange a peace settlement in Cairo between the chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the deputy chairman of the Presidential Council, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These sources said that Oman, which borders Yemen, feels uneasy at the continuation of the Yemeni crisis and the threat that it represents to the stability of the the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. [They added that] it and Jordan have sent a joint military committee composed of officers from the two countries to prevent the outbreak of war between north and south Yemen. The issue that has given these sources the impression that the two countries are studying the next step in their joint effort to solve the Yemeni crisis is the fact that a joint visit announced in Amman that the Jordanian and Omani foreign ministers were to take to Yemen before the 'Id al-Fitr [13 March] did not take place. King Husayn will also present to his host the permanent topic in their discussions since the second Gulf crisis--that of Gulf-Jordanian relations, which have severely deteriorated since that time. The Jordanian monarch will go on to Qatar after his visit to the Sultanate in an official visit that is his first to a Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] country (other than Oman) since the summer of 1990. Observers in Muscat told AL-HAYAH that the visit to Qatar opens a new window for Jordan in the GCC, but does not necessarily mean that normalization with the rest of the GCC states has become imminent. In Amman, Jordanian political sources yesterday opined that King Husayn's visit to the Sultanate of Oman within the framework of his tour to the state of Qatar is a Jordanian move aimed at exiting from the Arab isolation that has been imposed on it by the Gulf crisis and war and at apprising most of the Arab leaders of the likely collapse of the peace process in the region. An informed political authority said that Jordan believes that the isolation it is still suffering more than three years after the Gulf crisis and war is part of the pressure being put on it within the framework of the peace process. A senior Jordanian official indicated that the United States stands behind the political and economic pressure that the Kingdom faces and the continuation of the Arab boycott of it. He pointed out that the continuation of the naval blockade of the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah and the escalation of the International Monetary Fund's pressure with regard to foreign debt servicing have a direct relationship with Jordan's resistance to being pushed in the direction of a quick settlement with Israel without waiting for the achievement of noticeable progress on the other negotiation paths. The political authority says that King Husayn will inform the Omani and Qatari leaders of his concept of the results of the peace settlement between Israel and the PLO, and of its reflections on Jordan and intra-Arab relations. The Jordanian monarch made telephone calls to the leaders of Syria, Egypt, Morocco, and the PLO immediately after the Security Council issued its resolution on the Mosque of Ibrahim massacre, and the abstention of the United States from voting on the part of the resolution that considers eastern Jerusalem part of the Arab occupied territories, as mentioned by Security Council Resolution 242 of 1967.
