FR940912-0-00059 FR940912-0-00010 The Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 Based on the supplementary information set forth above and because the amendments contained in this document reflect existing statutory requirements or merely implement interpretations and policies that are already in effect under interim regulations, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., it is certified that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the regulations are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Gregory R.
