On Saturday night, Ambassador-at-Large Kazimirov arrived in the Azeri capital Baku to discuss some political aspects of the Karabakh settlement. On Sunday, Russia's special envoy met Azeri President Heydar Aliyev. During the meeting, he reported, in particular, about the consultations held in Moscow earlier this week by head of the CSCE Minsk group for Nagorno-Karabakh Jan Eliasson, who also met with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Russian Parliament's upper house and chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin. In the course of these meetings, the participants discussed problems related to the Karabakh settlement. Kazimirov stressed the need for pooling efforts of all concerned parties in strenthening the regime of the cease-fire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This issue is to be considered at the forthcoming meeting in Vienna with the participation of the conflicting sides and mediators. In accordance with preliminary agreement with the Misnk group chief, the meeting is scheduled for early July and thus will coincide in time with a meeting of the CSCE Interparliamentary Assembly. The Armenian and Azeri parliament chairmen are likely to be invited to this meeting. The Azeri president agreed that the pooling of efforts by the conflicting parties, and CSCE, Russian and CIS mediators, as well as of neighbouring countries was critical to the peace-making process. He believes that to achieve a durable peace in the region, it is necessary to liberate the occupied Azeri lands, to create conditions for refugees to return to places of their permanent residence, to restore communications between the two warring republics and to provide security guarantees for ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. For this purpose, Aliyev stressed, "we are ready to work in close contact with the CSCE, Russia and other mediators". He also assured Kazimirov that "Azerbaijan is not seeking to use the respite in hostilities for developing muscles, inventing accusations of the other side, conducting politcal manoeuvres and fuelling a propaganda campaign". After his consultations in Baku, Kazimirov is planning to visit the Armenian capital, according to some sources. He is expected to leave for Yerevan on Sunday night or on Monday morning, the same sources reported.
