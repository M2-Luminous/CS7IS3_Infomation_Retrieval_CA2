Having evaluated the degree of such impact, KOMMERSANT experts came to the conclusion that the state of the world market is becoming decreasingly sensitive to political events in Russia, while attention to economic news from Russia is on the rise. On the basis of this, one may assume that Russia's position at the Brussels meeting will become a major factor to influence the state of the market in aluminum. As to a possible reshuffling in the Russian Government, most likely they will not cause considerable fluctuations in the rates of foreign currencies, financial instruments, and commodity futures prices. The idea of interdependence between economic and political events in Russia and the state of the world markets is not new; actually, the history of the past two years presents prominent examples of this two-pronged impact. While keeping in mind that Russian reforms in many respects depend on the world state of the market, let us look at the opposite correlation: how events in Russia influenced the world markets in 1993. I will take the liberty of suggesting that looking at the still-recent past is quite useful for determining the attitude toward events in which the current week and the entire of 1994 will be rich. Having evaluated the degree of impact that the events in Russia had on the state of leading international exchanges in 1993 and compared it to the analogous results of the preceding year, we may draw the conclusion that by now world trade has developed sort of an immunity to political news from Russia. At the same time, reports of a purely economic nature attract great attention among the traders. Hence, one may forecast a lack of reaction on the part of the world markets to Gaydar's latest statement and at the same time the significance of Russia's position at the Brussels meeting that begins today for future development of the price situation in the world market of aluminum. The most noticeable reaction of the world market to the political events in Russia was registered after Boris Yeltsin's television address to the Russian people on 20 March. Let us remind our readers that on that day the president of Russia announced that he had signed a number of edicts, among them "On Special Rule Until the Resolution of the Crisis of Authority," which envisaged holding on 25 April a vote of confidence in the president and the government. On 22 March, the indices of leading European stock exchanges dropped, gold prices went up sharply, and the dollar rose in relation to the German mark. For instance, at the close of trading at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange stock prices collapsed: In one day of trading, the exchange's index dropped by almost 3 percent, the explanation for which, in the opinion of local analysts, was close economic ties between Germany and Russia. Higher gold prices were registered on that day at all exchanges trading in this metal, without exception, and it caused a chain reaction of rising prices for the entire group of precious metals: silver, platinum, and palladium. At the London Metals Exchange, nickel and aluminum prices went up, since British traders were certain that deliveries of these metals from Russia would not proceed on schedule. As to oil traders, they were the first to manifest the signs of immunity to Russian political events as early as in the beginning of 1993. Therefore, in March, when all exchange dealers in the world were playing almost solely under the influence of forecasts of the political future of Russia, oil traders raised the raw material prices only slightly (by 10 cents--to $18.78 per barrel of brent-blend) and later very quickly adjusted prices down. Later on, a very interesting trend began to manifest itself in the world markets: The significance of Russian events for Russia itself kept increasing, while the intensity of reaction to them in the world markets was waning. Some very interesting statements could be heard at international oil exchanges at the beginning of October. The dissolution of the Russian parliament and the siege of the White House elicited these comments from oil traders: "After all, the parliament is not engaged in oil exports, and therefore there is no need to anticipate a rise." By the way, oil prices did rise a little earlier--not as a result of political news, but because rumors circulated in the markets that the volume of shipping of Russian oil from Novorossiysk had dropped. An almost complete absence of reaction in the world markets to the preliminary results of the 12 December elections leads to an assumption that international financial life has adapted itself completely to the so-called Russian factor. On the other hand, the waning interest in Russian political cataclysms is accompanied by intensified attention to economic factors, especially changes in real volumes of raw material exports, which at this point remain the main source of Russia's foreign currency income. Such attitudes apparently will persist in the coming year, which should be taken into account by those Russian entrepreneurial structures that play in international financial and commodity markets. The Degree of Influence Events in Russia Have on the World Markets Date(s) Event Scope of Impact 1. 22 March Yeltsin signs the 18.2 edict "On Special Rule Until the Resolution of the Crisis of Authority" 2. 15-16 April Outcome of the 10.1 Referendum in Russian forecasted 3. 25 April Referendum results 8.6 published 4. 7-20 September Rumors of curtailment 3.6 of Russian oil exports 5. 4 October Russian parliament 3.1 disbanded 6. 1-5 November Customs regulations 2.5 regarding exports changed 7. 12 December Preliminary results 7.2 of elections to the State Duma published In evaluating the degree of impact of Russian events on the situation in the world currency, stock, and commodity exchanges, the unit of measure was one point. It corresponds to one percentage point of change in the currency exchange rate, commodity prices, or a stock exchange index as compared to the corresponding average level over the week preceding the event. Among items factored into the calculation were fluctuations of the dollar rate in relation to the German mark and Japanese yen, stock exchange indices in London, Frankfurt, Paris, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo, and commodity quotations in contracts for gold, platinum, palladium, oil, aluminum, and nickel.
