It stressed that this new gain constitutes without any doubt new mortar in the building of a free and just society. It is also a sign indicating that the democratic process of this fraternal country is an irrevocable choice. While Tunisia values the courage of the presidents, Mandela and De Klerk, and their foresight, it expresses hope that the multi-racial elections scheduled to take place in April 1994 will bring about a democratic non-racial state under a unified structure with all its capabilities.
