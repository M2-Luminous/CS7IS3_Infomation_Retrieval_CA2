Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, said in answer to a parliamentary question that the embargo -- the last maintained against the Jewish state by any European Union member -- should be lifted now that Israel has handed over Gaza and Jericho to the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In a statement that will please Israel as much as it will anger Arab governments, he said: "The Israeli Government has made it clear that it has no territorial claim on Lebanon." Israel withdrew most of its combat forces in 1985 but still occupies a strip of south Lebanon which it calls the "security zone" and uses as a trip-wire against guerrilla attacks. It has refused to comply with United Nations resolutions calling for withdrawal, citing the inability of the Lebanese government to keep peace on the border. Mr Hurd said that all future applications for the sale of arms to Israel would be considered on a case by case basis. "These include whether a proposed transfer would be likely to increase tension in the region or contribute to regional instability," he said. Sources in the Foreign Office -- long considered by supporters of Israel to have a distinct pro-Arab bias -- made it clear that the timing of the move should be seen in the context of domestic politics and the forthcoming European elections. For Israel the British arms ban has long been of symbolic rather than practical importance since most of its weapons are supplied by the United States. But the end of the embargo could clear the way for Britain to buy Israel's Popeye missile. This was indirectly confirmed in Jerusalem by Israel's deputy foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, who met Mr Hurd in London two weeks ago. "The significance of the cancellation of the embargo is that it had been very difficult for us to sell Israeli weapons in Britain because in many cases there was a formal or informal condition that some of the components be British," he told Israel Radio. "It will now be that much easier." Mr Hurd balanced his announcement with a clear hint that the wider European Union arms embargo against Syria could also be lifted. "We hope to see progress on the Syrian track in line with that seen on the Palestinian track" he said. "In that context we will be ready to raise with our European partners the lifling of the European Union arms embargo against Syria." That embargo was imposed in 1986 after a Syrian intelligence agent, Nezar Hindawi, was convicted of trying to plant a bomb on an Israeli airliner at Heathrow airport. Britain severed relations with Syria but the links were restored later. Syria and Lebanon last week condemned Israel after its forces kidnapped a Shiite Muslim guerilla leader from his home in south Lebanon to hold as hostage in exchange for an Israeli airman believed held by militant Lebanese.
