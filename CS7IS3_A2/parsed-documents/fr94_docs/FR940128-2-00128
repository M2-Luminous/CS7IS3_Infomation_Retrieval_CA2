FR940128-2-00128 FR940128-2-00087 B. Priorities for Transitional Living Grants Part B, Section 321 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to establish and operate Transitional Living projects for homeless youth. This program is structured to help older homeless youth achieve self-sufficiency and avoid long-term dependency on social services. Transitional Living projects provide shelter, skills training, and support services to homeless youth ages 16 through 21 for a continuous period not exceeding 18 months. The first 45 Transitional Living Program (TLP) grants were added in September 1990 for three-year project periods. An additional 32 grants were awarded in FY 1991 and 10 grants in FY 1992, also for three-year project periods. All funds available under this program in FY 1993 were awarded in the form of non-competitive continuation awards to then-ongoing grantees. In order to award new TLP grants as early as possible in FY 1994, however, an open competition was held in the summer of calendar year 1993 for new awards to be supported with FY 1994 funds. Project periods of the new grants were to begin on October 1, 1994, or as soon thereafter as funds were available. This was to allow grantees with project periods ending in September 1994 to compete for new grants and to continue their existing projects with minimal disruption of services if they were successful in the competition. Thirty-two new TLP grants were awarded following the competition, with starting dates on or after October 1, 1993 (the first day of FY 1994). First-year funding for these projects totaled approximately $6.0 million. It is anticipated that remaining FY 1994 TLP funds will be awarded to continuation grantees initially funded in earlier years. Inasmuch as funds for additional new-start TLP grants will probably be available in FY 1995, an open competition will be held in the summer of calendar year 1994 for new awards to be supported with FY 1995 funds. Project periods of these new awards will begin no sooner than October 1, 1994. It is anticipated that approximately $6.0 million will be available for these new grants in FY 1995. C. Priorities for the National Communications System Part C, Section 331 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, mandates support for a National Communications System to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with their families and with service providers. In FY 1991, a three-year grant was awarded to the National Runaway Switchboard, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois, to operate the system. This grant will expire in February 1994. An announcement soliciting competing grant applications to operate the system for five years will be published in the Federal Register late in 1993 or early in 1994. Priority will be given to applicants having experience in providing telephone services to runaway and homeless youth. It is anticipated that $826,900 in first-year funds will be awarded to the grantee in FY 1994. III. Support Services for Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs A. Training and Technical Assistance Part D, Section 342 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to statewide and regional nonprofit organizations to provide training and technical assistance (T&TA) to organizations that are eligible to receive service grants under the Act. Organizations eligible to receive this T&TA include the Basic Centers authorized under Part A of the Act and the Transitional Living grantees authorized under Part B. In addition, Section 3511 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which authorized the Drug Abuse Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (DAPP), authorizes support for T&TA to runaway and homeless youth service providers. The purpose of this T&TA is to strengthen the programs and to enhance the knowledge and skills of youth service workers. In FY 1991, the Family and Youth Services Bureau awarded ten Cooperative Agreements, one in each of the ten Federal Regions, to provide T&TA to agencies funded under the three Federal programs for runaway and homeless youth (the Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program). Each Cooperative Agreement was unique, being based on the characteristics and different T&TA needs in the respective Regions. Each of the Cooperative Agreements had a three-year project period that will expire in FY 1994.
