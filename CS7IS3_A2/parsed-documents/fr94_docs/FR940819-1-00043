FR940819-1-00043 FR940819-1-00011 2. New Classifications: (i) ``Volunteer'' (Class H) and (ii) Volunteer or Contractor Employee Who Is Classified as a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) ``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be added to the classes of persons, for purposes of completing Sections A and B on Form FRA F 6180.55. ``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be defined to include an individual who willingly performs a service for the reporting railroad, who does not receive direct monetary compensation from that railroad, and who is not engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad. Injuries or illnesses sustained by such a volunteer would be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a as injuries to a ``Volunteer'' (Class H). In contrast, injuries or illnesses sustained by an individual, including a ``volunteer'' or ``contractor employee,'' who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the railroad, would be reported as injuries/illnesses to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). 3. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the railroad. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) would replace the presently used classification of persons ``Employee on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Employee Not on Duty'' (Class B). A ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be subject to all of the applicable safety regulations in performance of his or her activities ( e.g., drug and alcohol regulations, qualification and certification of locomotive engineers). When an individual is engaged in ``mixed service,'' i.e., performs both safety-sensitive functions and other functions, the railroad would report all the hours for that tour of service as ``railroad worker hours'' in block ``15'' on the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable injuries and illnesses would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) in block ``5f'' on the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55a together with the applicable job code series of the service performed. Section 209.303 describes ``safety-sensitive functions'' as applying to the following individuals: (a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perform service subject to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61&hyph;64b) during a duty tour, whether or not the person has performed or is currently performing such service, and any person who performs such service; (b) Railroad employees or agents who:
