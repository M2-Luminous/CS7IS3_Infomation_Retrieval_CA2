Latest statistics show that the development zone ranks on top in 14 indices, including tax payment, fiscal income, number of overseas-funded enterprises, contracted overseas investment, and is second in the nine other indices including the export volume. Up to the end of 1993, the zone has approved 1,709 overseas-funded enterprises, with a registered capital of 1.72 billion U.S. dollars, since it was launched in 1984 upon the approval of the State Council. The zone, 137 km to southeast of Beijing, also attracted some 2,930 enterprises funded by other Chinese regions, with the registered capital reaching 7.39 billion yuan. At a new conference Saturday [22 January], officials from the development zone said that they would regard its tenth anniversary as the starting point of a new drive for more investment and better economic returns.
