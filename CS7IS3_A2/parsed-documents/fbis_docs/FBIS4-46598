KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has more than once discussed this nationwide problem, which is relevant to the entire Russian Army. Today we return to this theme. Trapped by Lack of Funds One wall of a room in the district headquarters building is completely covered by a map of central Russia, where the Moscow Military District is stationed. Blue flags mark where troops used to be stationed and red flags indicate units and formations which have already been withdrawn or will be withdrawn from abroad by 1995. There are almost twice as many red flags as blue ones. In short, the introduction of troops has radically changed the face of the Moscow Military District, which has now become a border district. The district is changing, its organizational staff structure is continuing to be improved, and it is being supplied with the latest weapons and equipment. Virtually every staff directorate, service, and department is engaged in tackling this massive task, which -- owing to a lack of finances and capering around the already meager military budget -- is now on the verge of failure. This is the opinion of Major General Aleksandr Groshev, Moscow Military District deputy troop commander responsible for construction and the billeting of troops. "For four years now troops have been arriving in the district from abroad in accordance with a Russian Federation government decision and a schedule approved by the Defense Ministry," Aleksandr Ivanovich said. "During this period we have received more than 200 formations, units, and institutions totalling more than 70,000 men. The biggest transfer of troops and equipment has been to Smolensk, Voronezh, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Tambov Oblasts and a number of other oblasts. Appropriate agreements for providing the troops with all the necessary facilities, building housing, and allocating land as training grounds have been drawn up with and signed by the heads of their administrations. They have also been signed by Colonel General Leontiy Kuznetsov, commander of the Moscow Military District, and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is acting as guarantor. But the majority of these agreements are on the point of collapse, because no money is now being made available from the national budget for the construction organizations with which we have concluded agreements. "Judge for yourself. This year (units and institutions being withdrawn are still arriving in large numbers) we planned to receive 300 billion rubles [R] for this purpose, but in fact only R60 billion have been allocated. There can be no talk of speeding ahead, as planned, with commissioning housing and utilities for the units arriving; the schedule for building barracks and vehicle depots in Smolensk Oblast and in Boguchar in Voronezh Oblast has broken down. Essentially, troops are being greeted by open fields...." It is true what the people say: Better to see something once than hear about it 100 times. The things I have seen in Voronezh and Boguchar really are staggering, because of the difficult conditions in which officers, ensigns, and their families are having to start working and living at their new stations. As a rule, they have been waved off from Germany and the Baltic countries to the ceremonial beat of kettledrums, but at home they have met with neglect. At the will of the state, thousands of military servicemen and their families have essentially been thrown on their own resources in order to survive. But one thing at a time. Even in the square outside Voronezh Station you are struck by the large numbers of people in military uniform. Caps with blue or green bands are glimpsed time and again in the crowd. But most of the servicemen wear emblems common to all arms. "Voronezh has possibly not seen such an influx of troops since the war, when the district headquarters was here," Major General Vladimir Chuzhikov, head of the Voronezh Garrison, told me. "People living in the oblast and heads of administration show them constant attention and help in any way they can. Nevertheless, more than half of our units have been withdrawn to empty, unprepared places. Well, you can see for yourself where we are having to work...." I am talking to Major General Chuzhikov at headquarters, where just two offices have been more or less repaired: the commander's and the duty officer's. This red brick building -- once a convent -- was built at the beginning of the century. All kinds of institutions were here during the years of Soviet power! It has not been repaired at all for about 40 years: The heating and water supply systems are in a dangerous state, the roof is wrecked, and in some rooms the ceiling has fallen through.... According to planning estimates, it will cost more than R6 billion to renovate the building. The capacity of military construction organizations in the city would allow all repair work to be carried out in full this year. But there is no money, alas. Ludicrous though it may sound, the limited resources only cover 0.5 percent of the work. The general shows me piles of documents. Material on receiving corps units (they are scattered over six oblasts), planning estimates for building barracks, depots for equipment, and storehouses for food, and agreements concluded with city and oblast heads of administration.... "All the necessary documents have long been drawn up, but they are not being implemented," Vladimir Petrovich sadly summed up. "They are not being implemented because money is not being made available by the state. The district has given us everything it possibly can and the oblast has helped out with resources, but this does not solve the problem." The conversation in the office of Vasiliy Kovalev, deputy head of Voronezh Oblast Administration, was also about the main issue: money to provide facilities for the troops and build housing for the servicemen. Even now, more than 3,600 apartments are required for officers and warrant officers discharged from the Army without housing as a result of personnel cuts. That figure rises to more than 5,000 if you include all the military servicemen arriving here in need of housing. I should point out that, in addition to the considerable cost of providing troops with the facilities they need, Voronezh Oblast is also gaining indisputable benefits. It is planned to commission several residential buildings erected by military construction organizations in Voronezh by the end of this year. It is also planned to build an entire residential district overlooking the reservoir and, at the same time, lay roads and heat and water supply networks and build social and cultural facilities. In Boguchar, where tank crews are stationed, a Turkish firm is building a military camp with 1,753 apartments, a school complete with swimming pool and conservatory, two kindergartens, a clinic, stores, and so forth. It must be said that the city and oblast administration and some commercial structures take an understanding attitude to the military's needs and help in any way they can. For example, following a decision by the head of the oblast administration, the "Shilovo" and "Rechnoye" Boarding Houses are serving as temporary abodes for officers' families, R6 million have been allocated from the city budget to repair the corps headquarters, and land has been set aside without delay for the purpose of stationing units and establishing training grounds. Viktor Atlasov, head of the Southeast Railroad Administration, has met the military halfway in the lease of containers for storing the personal effects of officers and warrant officers and has organized an efficient train service to take equipment to where troops are stationed. But all this has to be paid for nowadays. How far into debt can you go? For example, the military department owes more than R65 million for the use of just one gantry crane at Kantemirovka Station, where tanks and self-propelled weapons arriving from Germany are being unloaded. "We cannot solve all these problems without a clear government program for providing troops with the facilities they need," Vasiliy Fedorovich Kovalev believes. "The potential of the city and the oblast is now limited: Market relations are everywhere. State subsidies are also meager. For example, in the past the military did not have to pay for land to be used for military units and training grounds, but now they have to hand over the money. Considerable amounts of money. For example, the Defense Ministry must pay R102 billion at 1992 prices for a tank crew training ground near Boguchar. But, instead of money, the ministry has sent us a letter saying that payment for the land will be delayed even further...." It seems that only now are we all, including state structures, becoming increasingly acutely aware that making cuts in the Armed Forces and redeploying them on a massive scale is almost more expensive than it was to maintain the Soviet Army. According to the most approximate estimates, withdrawing just one division from Germany and providing it with every facility in open fields near Boguchar will cost the state R500 billion. We have already mentioned above how many such units have been received by the Moscow Military District alone. But who has counted these costs? Apart from the purely financial side, there are other ways of measuring the loss to the Army and the country as a whole. While preparations for withdrawing troops are underway (this period lasts a year or more), officers and warrant officers -- the backbone of the Army -- lose their experience and professional expertise. How many officers, particularly young ones, have waved goodbye to the Army forever during this period! This trend is very characteristic of units being withdrawn from abroad to new places of service in Russia. Particularly where, for various reasons, they are not ready to receive the troops and where because of a chronic lack of funds plans are being frustrated to build military camps and homes for officers' families in the "back of beyond" of Voronezh Oblast -- Boguchar -- to which the withdrawal of the 10th Ural-Lvov Volunteer Tank Division from Germany is nearing completion. Essentially, the formation is being stationed in open fields. So why has this happened? That is what we will discuss in part two.
