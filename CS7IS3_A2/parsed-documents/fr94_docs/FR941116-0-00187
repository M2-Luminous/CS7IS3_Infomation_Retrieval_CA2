FR941116-0-00187 FR941116-0-00022 (1) Enrolled in the VPLP the previous year and the current year, any carryover production from any previous crop is ineligible carryover, and if marketed, bartered, donated, or used during the current year shall be counted against the PLQ for the current year. However, so that no benefit will occur from the carryover, the producer may destroy the carryover under supervision of an employee of ASCS; or (2) Not enrolled in the VPLP in the previous year but is enrolled in the current year, the carryover production from a previous crop year is eligible carryover and may be marketed, bartered, donated, or used during the current year without being counted against the PLQ for the current crop year; or (3) Enrolled in VPLP in the previous year and is enrolled in ARP in the current year, the producer may devote an amount of acreage to conservation use acreage equal to the excess production divided by the PLQ yield for the crop and have the excess production considered eligible carryover. (c) Production harvested in excess of the PLQ may be stored up to but not more than 5 years. Any excess commodity stored longer than 5 years is subject to forfeiture to CCC. (d) The PLQ for a crop for a marketing year shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the acreage that would be permitted to be planted to such crop under the regular ARP conducted in accordance with part 1413 of this chapter by the PLQ yield. (e)(1) The PLQ yield shall be calculated as the higher of: (i) The farm program payment historic weighted yield for the crop determined in accordance with part 1413 of this chapter; or (ii) The average of the actual yields, as determined in accordance with ยง1416.104 of this part, for the crop for the farm for each of the 1989 through 1993 crop years, excluding the crop years with the highest and lowest yields. (2) Any crop year in which the commodity was not planted shall be excluded. (f) Farms which have either, corn or grain sorghum CAB's, or both, and participate in the VPLP, shall have the PLQ calculated as corn equivalents by multiplying the combined permitted acreage of corn and grain sorghum times the corn PLQ yield. (g)(1) If grain sorghum is harvested on the farm, grain sorghum production credited against the PLQ shall be determined by: (i) Dividing the corn yield by the grain sorghum yield; and (ii) Multiplying the factor determined in (g)(1)(i) of this section times the grain sorghum production (bushels) marketed, bartered, donated, or used on the farm. (2) The result is bushels of grain sorghum expressed in corn equivalents. Subtract this result from the PLQ for the combined permitted corn-grain sorghum PLQ to determine the quantity of corn eligible to be marketed. ยง1416.103 Production evidence for actual yields. The following provisions apply if producers elect to submit actual production for establishing actual yields for determining the PLQ in accordance with ยง1416.102: (a) Production evidence for the enrolled program crop(s) must be submitted to County ASCS Offices on form ASCS&hyph;658, Record of Production and Yield. Additional evidence will be required if a representative of the county ASCS office determines there is insufficient evidence to support the representation of production or acreage of the crop on the farm as certified to by the producer. (b) Producers with an interest in enrolled crops on more than 1 farm shall submit production evidence for all farms. The county committee shall determine whether evidence includes production from any other acreage for each year the evidence is provided. (c) Evidence for commercially stored production or production disposed of off the farm must show the: (1) Producer's name; (2) Commodity; (3) Buyer's or storer's name; and (4) Date of transaction. (d) Acceptable documents substantiating amounts of commercially stored or disposed of production include: (1) Commercial or warehouse receipts; (2) Sales or elevator receipts; (3) Warehouse ledger sheets or copies; (4) Warehouse load summaries or copies; (5) Settlement sheets; (6) CCC-warehouse stored loan documents; (7) Farm stored loan documents, if quantity has been determined by measurement; (8) Weight slips or scale tickets from harvested or appraised acreage;
