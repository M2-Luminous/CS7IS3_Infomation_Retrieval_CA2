The meeting is between President Juvenal Habyarimana and the leaders of the five political parties participating in the current government, namely the Revolutionary National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND], Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], Social Democratic Movement [PSD], Liberal Party [PL] and the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]. The president said at the beginning of the meeting that the agenda consisted of two items. The first item was to see how the current government could function so that, pending the establishment of the transitional government, our country could be saved from slipping into anarchy, a process which has already started due to the current insecurity; to study ways of enabling the government to function efficiently, so as to halt our country's economic decline; and to study ways by which the current government could continue to function well, while continuing its consultations with the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] in implementing the peace accords. The second item on the agenda of the meeting between the president of the Republic and the representatives of the five parties participating in the government is to seek ways of immediately establishing broad-based transitional institutions. Here is what the president of the Republic had to say about the above issues: [Begin Habyarimana recording] When I called this meeting, I had two things in mind. [Words indistinct] which are also of priority importance. But the first thing I see, as we have all noticed, is that the current government is not operational. Now, in the face of problems in the areas of security and the economy, we must look into ways of making the government operational, so that these problems can be resolved. If we keep things as they are now, if we do not show the government how to function, people might turn against each other, [words indistinct] civil war, leading even to anarchy. That is the first thing I am concerned about: Our country should not slip into anarchy. The second thing is that leadership institutions must be established, namely, the transitional National Assembly and the broad-based transitional government. Now, why have they not yet been put in place? How can we speed up the process? This is another thing we can study. Some have asked why we did not invite the RPF to this meeting. As far as I am concerned, the work of the current government does not concern the RPF at all. It concerns the parties which formed the government. There are two sides which are party to the peace agreement, the government and the RPF. When our problems are solved....[pauses] You see, if you ask the RPF why things are not making any progress, they answer: We do not have any problems. The problem is with the government side. So you people who formed the government are the ones who should study the problems of the government side and try to find solutions. [passage indistinct] Once the government's problems have been solved and it feels that the remaining institutions can be set up swiftly, then we will call the RPF and tell them that the problems that existed on the government side have been solved, so come along so that we can establish....[pauses] Otherwise, if you call them, they have their proposals and they put them forward, but the government side does not have proposals [words indistinct]. So let us look for proposals, [words indistinct] on the government side. Once we have them, [words indistinct], even tomorrow, although I have another program for tomorrow, then on Sunday [27 February], maybe if we schedule it for the afternoon, although you might say Habyarimana is putting pressure on us. I will do what you decide upon, but do not say that I am putting pressure on you after I have agreed on matters with you. What is needed is to see how the current government can solve the existing problems, and that is why I (?invited) the prime minister, who heads the government pending the establishment of these institutions, although we want them set up swiftly but only after settling the problems facing the government. [end recording] It is worth noting that the meeting was attended by both prime ministers, that of the current transitional government, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and that of the broad-based transitional government, Faustin Twagiramungu; representatives of the MRND, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, Ferdinand Kabagema and Joseph Nzirorera; representatives from the MDR party included Dismas Nsengiyaremye, Frodwald Karamira and Donat Murego; the PDC was represented by Jean-Nepomucene, [name indistinct] and (Theobald Rwasa); the PL was represented by Justin Mugenzi, Landwald Ndasingwa, Stanislas Mbonampeka and Agnes Ntamabyaliro; for PSD there was Frederic Nzamurambaho, Felicien Ngango, Theoneste Gafaranga, and Emerance Mutuyimana; on the side of the presidency of the Republic there was Enock Ruhigira and Juvenal Renzaho. We have just learned that the meeting has ended. We will give you a report on it in our 2100 news bulletin tonight.
