Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze quoted several points from the statement which he thought were fundamentally important. Among them he listed an appeal to the UN Security Council to urgently decide on carrying out a peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. "If, for some reason, such a decision is not adopted in the near future, the CIS countries-parties to common defence treaty, are ready to send to the area their own peacekeeping forces upon agreement with the two warring sides", Shevardnadze said.
