Its life depends 100 percent on imported equipment, binding materials, ink, paper, and other raw materials. The problems of this industry are now shared by all Central Asian republics of the former Union. The leaders of the press systems of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan decided that a way to overcome the crisis should be sought jointly. Last year, they established an interstate regional commission for the issues of printing, the press, and book publishing on the initiative of A.S. Sarsenbayev, Kazakhstan Republic minister of the press and mass information. The commission was headed by Yanvarbek Tlevlenov, director of the Dauir republic newspaper and magazine publishing house. The results of one year of joint work were summed up in Almaty at a regular conference of the ranking leaders of the systems of the press and mass information of the Central Asian states and Kazakhstan. A KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent asked [first initial illegible] U. Sandybayev, a Kazakhstan Republic deputy minister for press and mass information, to discuss the activities of the interstate regional commission. "During this period, the working group of the commission held conferences in Tashkent, Ashgabat, Dushanbe, and Bishkek. The potential of each region from the standpoint of organizing its own production of import-substituting materials with the existing raw-material and technical resources was evaluated. We are quite in a position to manage ourselves in the publishing business. "Thus, Uzbekistan is prepared to establish, of course with support from neighbors, the production of PVA [polyvinylacetate] glue, which is indispensable in book publishing. The Uzbek Varnish and Paint Plant can master the joint production of printer's inks, binding materials, and bookbinder's cloth. "The issue of paper is also being resolved. Only two specialized enterprises that manufacture cardboard and writing-wrapping paper from imported raw materials and waste paper operate in the Central Asian region; these are the Uzbek Uzbum Joint-Stock Company and the TsKZ [pulp-and-cardboard plant] in Kzyl-Orda. Given the current state of affairs, it is necessary to support them not only through steady waste paper deliveries but also through funding from the budget. Following a partial retooling of the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ they would be able to establish the production of writing and printing grades of paper there. "Representatives of Kazakhstan proposed another way to solve this problem. There are Chinese technologies for boiling pulp out of cereal straw and manufacturing various grades of paper with the pulp. Specialists from the Kazakhstan Ministry of the Press and Mass Information and the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ have already visited such operating enterprises in the PRC. Chinese experts have managed to familiarize themselves with our conditions and potential. It was resolved that the construction of several pulp-boiling plants in the vicinity of the breadbaskets of Kazakhstan is feasible. "The Tajik regional commission submitted interesting information. Experiments aimed at producing paper by the unconventional method of 'wood molding' with the use of a completely new principle of polymerization in the electrical field are underway in Tajikistan. Wood of all types is suitable for manufacturing such paper. The Tajikistan Government is financing this project. In addition, they are working on producing rolled aluminum and PVA glue at one of the local plants. Turkmenistan is also making its contribution to the common cause. Jointly with the Turkmensnab, the printing industry is "pushing through" spare quotas for alumina, sulfur, soot, silicates, and other raw materials necessary to manufacture printing supplies. Deliveries of spare parts, modules, and assemblies for printing equipment have become a headache to all enterprises of the industry. At present, general combined requests for the assortment of spare parts are being drawn up. The plan is to manufacture the spare parts at heavy machine building plants in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Tashkent State Design and Scientific Research Institute for the Integrated Design of Printing Industry Enterprises, the sole specialized design institute in the region, has become involved in solving the issue of a shortage of offset plates. Technical calculations have indicated that the most advantageous scenario calls for establishing a joint-stock company for the production of bimetallic offset plates in Karagandy at the facilities of local enterprises. The contract of incorporation has already been signed; preparatory work is already underway. "However, the development of the industry is naturally impossible without the participation of other printing industry representatives of the once united state. For this reason, the Kazakhstan Ministry of the Press and Mass Information appealed to our Commonwealth colleagues for pooling our efforts in solving our common problems. "Prospects have been mapped out, and the outcome of a well-conceived breakthrough toward cooperation as equals on the printing-industry market of the CIS will now depend on coordination and mutual understanding."
