This statement was made by National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman. Guzman explains Watson's visit by saying he is in Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission. This morning, Watson met with the leaders of the political parties in parliament, with the exception of UNO's leaders, and with the president of the legislative branch. Sergio Ramirez, the leader of the Sandinist National Liberation Front's [FSLN] legislative representation, characterized the U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Nicaragua as being biased. [Begin Ramirez recording] I told him the human rights report looks like an expression of an ingrained antagonism I think should be expunged from the relations the United States maintains with the sector of Nicaraguan society represented by us Sandinists. In many ways, this report is anti-Sandinist and biased. [end recording] Contradicting the human rights report, Watson reported in his speech at the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce that the Clinton administration acknowledges the Sandinists comprise a legitimate Nicaraguan political force, which maintains all of the rights and responsibilities granted to every political party. In response to a reporter's question, National Assembly President Luis Alberto Guzman said internal Nicaraguan affairs must only be discussed among Nicaraguans. [Begin Guzman recording] We mentioned the constitutional reforms issue, but I insisted that we discuss these issues with the understanding that these are strictly Nicaraguan affairs. In no way did I request counsel or recommendations on what we should do in terms of such issues. These matters were discussed as a courtesy afforded to any foreign visitor, but I insisted that this would not be done in any way to solicit opinions or counsel on what we, the Nicaraguan people, should do. I truly understand that these are matters that concern us, the Nicaraguan people. [end recording] This evening Watson met socially with various national political, social, and economic leaders.
