FR941021-2-00043 FR941021-2-00035 Office of Hearings and Appeals Notice of Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of August 1 Through August 5, 1994 During the week of August 1 through August 5, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to applications for relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Request for Exception Noltgas Propane Fuel & Supply, 8/2/94, LEE&hyph;0098 Noltgas Propane Fuel & Supply filed an Application for Exception from the reporting requirement of Form EIA&hyph;782B. In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a serious hardship or gross inequity, as those terms have been defined by the DOE. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. Whistleblower Proceeding Dr. Naresh Mehta, 8/4/94, LWN&hyph;0003 The DOE issued an Order granting Dr. Naresh Mehta interim reinstatement to his former position at the Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory. On March 17, 1994, the DOE had found that Dr. Mehta's dismissal by Universities Research Association, a DOE contractor, violated the provisions of the Contractor Employee Protection Regulations, 10 CFR part 708. Although the DOE had ordered that Dr. Mehta be reinstated in March 1994, the reinstatement was stayed by a request for review filed by Universities Research Association.
