Pork Fat! No, Poppy Straw"] [Text] According to analytical studies of drug-related crimes, Ukraine is increasingly becoming a producer of poppies. Today, it is one of the bases for opium-production raw materials among the CIS countries. As reported by Russian law-enforcement bodies, while in the first half of the last year, poppy straw [solomka] was mainly supplied from Baltic countries, at the end of 1993 it was almost entirely supplied from Ukraine. Estimates are in the thousands of kilograms. As regards domestic consumption, in 1992, almost 10 tonnes of narcotics were confiscated in Ukraine; this amount has doubled this year [1993]. Drug abuse treatment centers have 38,000 drug addicts on their records.
