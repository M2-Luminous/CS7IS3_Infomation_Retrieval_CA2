Talking to reporters following a cabinet meeting on 15 March, Kumagai then said, "It will be impossible to finalize deregulation issues by the end of March; it will probably take until the end of June to resolve them." As for the direction of future tax cuts and financial resources to cover the resulting shortfalls in revenue, which are the issues that the United States is concerned about, the minister said: "Because the matter will have an impact on the formulation of the 1995 budget, we must arrive at a conclusion on it by the end of June. I am shocked by the thinking of some people who believe that this matter can be put off." The minister insisted that the matter should be settled by the time of the [Naples G-7] summit, and he served a warning to the members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and others who are indecisive about the tax-cut question.
