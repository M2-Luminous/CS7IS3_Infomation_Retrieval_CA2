FR941025-0-00076 FR941025-0-00026 (ii) In selecting the best value item at the lowest overall cost (the price of the item plus administrative costs), the ordering activity may consider such factors as_ (A) Special features of one item not provided by comparable items which are required in effective program performance; (B) Trade-in considerations; (C) Probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item; (D) Warranty conditions; and (E) Maintenance availability. (iii) Give preference to the items of small business concerns when two or more items at the same delivered price will meet an ordering activity's needs. (3) MAS contractors will not be required to pass on to all schedule users a price reduction extended only to an individual agency for a specific order. There may be circumstances where an ordering activity finds it advantageous to request a price reduction, such as where the ordering activity finds that a schedule product is available elsewhere at a lower price, or where the quantity of an individual order clearly indicates the potential for obtaining a reduced price. (4) Ordering activities should document orders of $2,500 or less by identifying the contractor the item was purchased from, the item purchased, and the amount paid. For orders over $2,500, MAS ordering files should be documented in accordance with internal agency practices. Agencies are encouraged to keep documentation to a minimum. (c) Mandatory use . (1) This paragraph (c) applies only to orders against schedule contracts with mandatory users. (2) In the case of mandatory schedules, ordering offices shall not: (i) Solicit bids, proposals, quotations, or otherwise test the market solely for the purpose of seeking alternative sources to Federal Supply Schedules; or (ii) Request formal or informal quotations from Federal Supply Schedule contractors for the purpose of price comparisons. (3) Schedules identify executive agencies required to use them as mandatory sources of supply. The single-award schedule shall be used as a primary source and the multiple-award schedule as a secondary source. Mandatory use of schedules is not a requirement if_ (i) The schedule contractor is unable to satisfy the ordering office's urgent delivery requirement; (ii) The order is below the minimum order thresholds; (iii) The order is above the maximum order limitation; (iv) The consignee is located outside the area of geographic coverage stated in the schedule; or (v) A lower price for an identical item (i.e., same make and model) is available from another source. (4) Absence of follow-on award . Ordering offices, after any consultation required by the schedule, are not required to forego or postpone their legitimate needs pending the award or renewal of any schedule contract. 8.404&hyph;1 and 8.404&hyph;2 [Removed and reserved] 9.
