He did this upon his return in the early evening from South Africa, where he took part in President Mandela's inauguration ceremony. Speaking to our special envoy, Souleiman Kantara Cissoko, the head of state stressed, above all, the special character of the event: [Begin Konare recording] It was a grand and historic event. It was the advent of a new state -- a great African state in terms of its demographic weight, economic power, strategic situation, and human resources. The advent of a new, multiracial, and democratic South African Republic is an incontestable sign of democratic progress on our continent. I think that nothing will be as before in Africa. I consider this a new chance offered our continent, so as to assume its responsibilities and become more respected. During our stay, we felt the determination of the people and leaders of South Africa. You know that our people have always been on the side of the South African democrats. It is normal for us to be with them today in the construction of a new, united, and plural Africa. You know also that this is the choice made by Malian democrats. The government has clearly indicated in a declaration that henceforth, nothing stands in the way of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mali and South Africa. Today, we shall do everything possible to make this a reality, especially with the accession of Mandela to the presidency of South Africa. [end recording]
