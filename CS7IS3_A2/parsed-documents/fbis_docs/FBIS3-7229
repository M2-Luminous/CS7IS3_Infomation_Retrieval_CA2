Regarding the economic framework talks, the United States recently urged Japan to accept numerical targets for government procurement, one of the three priority negotiation fields at the framework talks. Commenting on the U.S. demand, the source said: "The U.S. demand probably means they think it is easier to promise (numerical targets) in fields under control of the public sector, but it is still difficult. Even under the market opening policy, we cannot buy what we do not need."
