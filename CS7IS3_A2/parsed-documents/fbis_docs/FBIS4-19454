He had to notice this again and again in his talks with high-ranking U.S. politicians, Scharping said at the conclusion of his one-week visit to the United States in New York on the weekend [16-17 April]. Schaeuble had been in the United States for a similar public relations trip 14 days before Scharping. "Anyone who slanders a domestic policy opponent abroad acts irresponsibly" and damages Germany's reputation, the SPD chief said. The fear of a change in government is "no justification for purposefully launching misinterpretations about political opponents." Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that his interlocutors in the U.S. Administration and in Congress repeatedly asked him about the SPD's attitude toward NATO. When he explained, the Americans were often surprised and said that just recently Schaeuble had told them something completely different. The CDU/CSU Bundestag group chairman also claimed in the United States that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will in any case be at the side of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag election campaign and afterward. Therefore, the SPD is only left with an alliance with the Greens, who have the dissolution of NATO and the abolition of the Bundeswehr in their program. In an interview with U.S. journalists, Schaeuble had deduced from these ideas: "As an American I would decide in favor of our coalition, because it is more reliable." In addition, Schaeuble stressed "profound differences" in foreign policy between the Federal Government and the SPD, even though Scharping gives assurances of the opposite. Schaeuble added: "I am not sure whether Scharping might not actually share our position, but he cannot push it through in his party."
