Source is cited in parentheses following each item. Last night Central Bank President Evenor Taboada disclosed Nicaragua closed 1993 with a deficit of more than $50 million in its international reserves. Taboada reported the country's current total gross reserves amount to approximately $100 million -- in other words, $50 million less than what is necessary to have a financially acceptable economy. In addition, the Central Bank president conceded the government sold 74,476 troy ounces of solid gold, which resulted in $28.255 million in revenues. Taboada described as "completely baseless," however, Ramiro Gurdian's, Higher Council of Private Enterprise president, remarks, who said such a transaction was proof the government "is broke." He also rejected Gurdian's remarks that the gold was sold to pay debts to creditors. Taboada added the country still has 13,000 troy ounces, equivalent to 20 percent of Nicaragua's average annual production.

Some 275,000 individuals in an economically active population of approximately 1.4 million do not have jobs. In addition, 707,000 are underemployed as they hold no formal jobs. The report attributes the unemployment increase to the incorporation of 68,120 people into the so-called economically active population, as well as to a 0.72 percent drop in the country's economic activity. In Nicaragua, 70 percent of its 4 million people live in poverty. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1651 GMT 4 Jan 94) In 1993, Nicaragua registered the highest inflation rate in Central America. Prices for goods and services increased 19.25 percent in 1993. According to official figures, the cost of living in other Central American countries went up an average of 11 percent, with Costa Rica having the lowest figure with an annual increase of 9.05 percent. A Central Bank report revealed that housing, transportation, and communications were the areas with the highest price increases. The government had estimated the year would close with an inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Also, the Central Bank added currency devaluation was 25.83 percent in 1993, and the price of the basic basket went up by 17.61. Nicaraguan economic activity was characterized by recession, a significant lack of liquidity in enterprises, high interest rates, and a large reduction in internal demand levels. The Central Bank admitted the measures implemented in early 1993, when a 20-percent devaluation was applied followed by an annual 5-percent drop, "has unfortunately had a negative effect" on economic activity.

In addition, Denmark will open an embassy in Managua this year. On the second day of her official visit to Nicaragua, Degn informed President Violeta Chamorro of this decision in the presence of her Nicaraguan counterpart Erwin Kruger, with whom she signed a mutual cooperation protocol.
