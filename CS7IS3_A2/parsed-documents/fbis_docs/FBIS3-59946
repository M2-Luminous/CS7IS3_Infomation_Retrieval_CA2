A 10-point paper published today by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn calls on all those states which have not yet signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or conventions on biological and chemical weapons to do so without delay. In addition, the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons should be extended indefinitely from 1995. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should be augmented to become a model for the regional nonproliferation of nuclear weapons which could also serve as a model for other regions. In addition, the German initiative envisages international cooperation in the area of export controls. The Foreign Ministry also urges greater support, including financial aid, for disarmament programs in the CIS. Plutonium coming into circulation as a consequence of disarmament should in the future be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United Nations should compile a nuclear weapons register to create a better overview of the number of nuclear weapons in existence. The German Government also reaffirmed its call for a worldwide and comprehensive agreement against nuclear testing. The Foreign Ministry paper also points out that in a basic resolution the UN Security Council described the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a threat to international security and peace. This gives the Security Council scope to impose the appropriate coercive measures.
