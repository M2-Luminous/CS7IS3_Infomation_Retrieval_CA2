The AFTA, which took effect last 1 January, requires the six ASEAN countries to reduce intra-regional tariffs on all manufactured goods to between 0 percent to 5 percent within 15 years through the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme. Its primary objective is to create a single ASEAN market of 330 million people and a combined GNP exceeding $300 billion. In the said meetings, it was proposed that the harmonization of tariff codes be accelerated with priority accorded to products enjoying high volume of intra-ASEAN trade and products that fall under the 15 fast-track product groups in the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) agreement. Product groups under the fast-track program are vegetable oil, cement, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastic, rubber products, pulp, leather products, textiles, ceramic and glass products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, wooden and rattan furniture. Other proposals adopted by the council are: -- to improve the frequency and availability of shipping between ASEAN countries; -- identify, through regional industry clubs, industry specific non-tariff barriers (NTBs) that should be eliminated; -- upgrade the efficiency of trade procedures including the possibility of implementing an electronic data interchange; -- facilitate product certification and acceptance; -- raise the capability of the services sector such as banking, insurance, and telecommunications to support trade; and, -- address the issue concerning developments in global trade such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Other recommendations are being pushed by working groups of ASEAN-CCI. These include: -- the establishment of joint promotion of ASEAN agricultural products; -- the development of infrastructure such as the establishment of a pan-ASEAN land bridge; -- pursuing open skies policy; and, -- the development of ASEAN optic fiber network and the expansion of cellular phone network beyond country borders.
