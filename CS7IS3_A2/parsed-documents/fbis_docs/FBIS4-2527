The regional military district issued a circular on commending and recording the merits of Zhou Fuqun, Zhang Wei, and other fighters who were ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause. Not long ago, Zhao Ping, a female driver of the Urumqi Taxi Company, was held under duress by two ruffians with knives for as long as seven hours when she was driving a taxicab. When the automobile was passing a military camp in Urumqi, fighters Zhou Fuqun and Zhang Wei, who were on guard and heard the calls for help, promptly rushed to the site of the incident. The two ruffians dropped the female driver and hurriedly ran away when they saw fighters coming in their way. Zhou Fuqun and Zhang Wei fought with the two ruffians, and the ruffians were finally arrested with the help of other fighters and people who rushed to the scene. At 0300, in the wee hours of the morning, on 6 March, two criminals who had escaped from a prison went to the dormitory of their former friend Wang Guangyao, who is a soldier assigned to guard the Urumqi Medicine Warehouse. Wang Guangyao did not act wrongly out of personal consideration. Wang Guangyao left his dormitory with an excuse of wanting to wash his face and reported the matter to the authorities, and then returned to his dormitory to set the minds of the two criminals at ease. A concerned department immediately dispatched personnel to the site to arrest the two criminals.
