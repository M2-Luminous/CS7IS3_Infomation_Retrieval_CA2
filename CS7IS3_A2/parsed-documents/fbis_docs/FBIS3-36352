At a news conference Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs stressed that joining this program is one more step in implementing the number one priority of the state -- security policy. The security and defense policy is currently being implemented in Latvia in three main aspects. [Begin Birkavs recording] One is the budget intended for defense and security structures. Compared with the past year, it has been increased by 57 percent; obviously it is not enough. The second step in that direction is the talks that we have begun to also use credits for strengthening our armament. We need international guarantees. We have to interweave into the European context with all our structures. And the Partnership for Peace, this initiative, is the one that gives us new opportunities. But I would like to say that that is not a security market, on which everyone buys his security, but rather that it is an opportunity for a state to achieve gradual approach to NATO structures in talks with NATO. That is a vehicle that will allow us in the event of a crisis to obtain consultations and thus react correctly to specific crises. This will require a great deal of strength, this will also require additional funds, but this has to be done, because otherwise we may lose all that we have achieved. According to the Partnership for Peace, each state can set up its own communication bureau in Brussels with NATO Headquarters. So then, I consider that we will need a person who would be specifically oriented toward cooperation with NATO so that we can actively participate in the creation of the NATO partnership. The 14th clause of the declaration, Partnership for Peace, reads: NATO will provide consultations for each active participant in the partnership in the event that they feel direct threats to their territorial integrity, political sovereignty, or security. So then, a simple passive statement will not be enough and we are oriented toward active participation in this process. [end recording] [Announcer] It is envisaged that Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs will sign a document on Latvia joining the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels as early as next week.
