FBIS4-55191 "dreeu091_i_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Muslims `Violated' Sarajevo Exclusion Zone Muslims `Violated' Sarajevo Exclusion Zone LD1005142394 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1357 GMT 10 May 94 LD1005142394 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Zvornik, May 10 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on Tuesday violated the truce in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo introduced in February this year, by attacking the Serb suburb of Ilijas from small arms and mortars, the Bosnian Serb army said in a statement. The same source also reported Moslem sniper activity against the Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo, especially the suburbs of Nedzarici, Grbavica and Ilidza. Extensive Moslem engineering works are under way in the Sarajevo suburbs of Vojnicko Polje and Mojmilo and the area near the Jewish cemetery, the statement said. Following a NATO ultimatum and guarantees from Moscow that Russian peacekeepers will be deployed along the Moslem-Serb demarcation line in Sarajevo, the Serbs in February withdrew from the exclusion zone and placed their heavy weapons under U.N. control. The Moslems have evidently not complied with the NATO demand. A U.N. officer told the AFP on Tuesday that Bosnian Moslems deployed six of their heavy weapons on the southern slopes of Mt Igman near Sarajevo, on the line of contact with the Serbs, along with about 1,000 troops. Bosnian Serb military sources reported that the Moslems on Tuesday launched artillery attacks on Serb-controlled Han Pijesak, Vlasenica, Sekovici and Zvornik in the east of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serb reconnaissance teams have reported Moslem troop movements and concentrations towards the Serb towns of Sekovici and Zvornik.
