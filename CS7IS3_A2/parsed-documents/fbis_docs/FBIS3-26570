Public utility enterprises refer to enterprises dealing in public services such as water supply, heat supply, gas supply, postal service, telecommunications, and transportation. According to the "Regulations," public utility enterprises may not use their advantageous positions to obstruct fair competition from other businesses, nor are they allowed to infringe upon consumers legitimate rights and interests. Specifically, public utility enterprises are prohibited from taking the following competition-restricting measures: -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only purchase and use relevant commodities provided by them but not similar commodities provided by other dealers that meet established technical standards; -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only purchase and use relevant commodities produced or sold by dealers designated by them but not similar commodities provided by other dealers that meet established technical standards; -- Compelling their clients and consumers to purchase unnecessary commodities and accessories provided by them and unnecessary commodities provided by dealers designated by them; -- Using commodity quality and performance inspections as a pretext to obstruct clients and consumers from purchasing and using commodities provided by other dealers that meet the established technical standards. If a public utility enterprise commits one or more of the aforementioned offenses, the concerned industry and commerce administration department must order it to stop the practice and, according to the seriousness of the case, may impose a fine ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 yuan. If a public utility enterprise refuses to accept the punishment decision and continues its illegal practice, this constitutes a new offense and the enterprise in question should be more severely punished.
