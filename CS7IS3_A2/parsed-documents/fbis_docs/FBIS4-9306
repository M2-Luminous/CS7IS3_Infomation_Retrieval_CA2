FBIS4-9306 "dreeu079_i_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Situation in Gorazde -- 25 April Situation in Gorazde -- 25 April TANJUG: Muslims Massacred Serbs LD2504122594 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1202 GMT 25 Apr 94 LD2504122594 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Moslem authorities in Gorazde have killed, tortured and in different ways maltreated several hundreds of Bosnian Serbs, thus abusing this U.N.-designated "safe area". About 12,000 Serbs lived in this town before the outbreak of the civil war. Moslems did not even spare the dead, because they demolished the Serb graveyard. Moreover, they pulled down St. George's church built in the 13th century. The truth about Moslem crimes against Serbs started coming out only after the Bosnian Serb army had reached the outskirts of the town, having first crushed in a counter-attack the Moslem offensive, mounted right from Gorazde, the Belgrade dailies VECERNJE NOVOSTI and EKSPRES POLITIKA write on Monday. After the failure of the Moslem offensive waged in very sight of U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) members, the Moslem authorities committed horrible atrocities against Serbs, and then showed the massacred bodies of the dead to foreign reporters claiming that they were victims of "Serb shells and snipers." There is "a special job" in some parts of Gorazde called "pushing the massacred bodies of dead Serbs" into the river Drina, the Belgrade dailies write. In the section of the town under control of notorious Moslem fundamentalist Ferid Buljubasic, there is still some 400 Serbs. In that section of the town, from which Moslems open mortar and sniper fire violating a truce, there are prisoner camps for Serbs. In the camp in the Vinarici settlement and "printing-works" and "cement works" in Vitkovici near Gorazde, hundreds of Serbs (men and women) have been tortured and killed, the dailies write. Moslems killed seven Serb soldiers captured in early August 1992, having tortured them first in the most brutal way. They were kept in the Trnovrh prisoner camp overhanging the town. One of the captured Serb soldiers, Rade Kacar, cut the agony of being tortured and humiliated by hanging himself while the bodies of the other six soldiers were thrown into the river Drina which runs through Gorazde. In the Serb village of Crkvice near Gorazde Moslems killed the entire population and completely burned down the village. Western media zealously reported about the U.S. relief operation "Provide Promise", but was silent about NATO aircraft supplying 15,000 Moslems troops in Gorazde with up-to-date weapons over the past months, although Gorazde is a U.N.-designated "safe area" and as such should have been demilitarized as far back as last spring, the Belgrade dailies say. The Bosnian Serb army has come into possession of the information that NATO aircraft have been dropping weapons and ammunition to Moslems in Gorazde every night in recent months, the dailies say.
