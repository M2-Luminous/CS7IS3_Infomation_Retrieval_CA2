He said the April 19, 1960, popular uprising in South Korea was a righteous resistance of the people who rose up in demand of a new politics, a new system and a new life against the colonial ruling system and fascist suppression by the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique. "The day is gone when the United States could model the world to its pleasure with strength and a strong arm," he said, and demanded: "The United States must squarely face the situation, immediately stop its adventurous war moves and get out of South Korea at once, taking along its forces and destruction weapons." Denouncing the anti-reunification, anti-national and anti-popular crimes of the "civilian government", he said: "What Kim Yong-sam has done under the civilian mask eloquently proves that he is a truculent fascist dictator, splittist, sychophant traitor and warmaniac putting the preceding military dictators in the shade".
