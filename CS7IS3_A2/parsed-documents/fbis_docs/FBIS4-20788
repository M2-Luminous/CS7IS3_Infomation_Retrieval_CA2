The Public Accounts Committee [PAC] has indicted the Union Finance Ministry for not having carried out a "meaningful probe" in a case of unauthorised import and under-invoicing by Reliance Industries. The case involves customs duty of Rs. 119.64 crores on goods imported by the company for its Patalganga polyester filament yarn project in Maharashtra. The allegation of unauthorised import of plant and machinery, misdeclaration and underinvoicing of goods was made in a showcause notice issued by the Customs Department in 1987. The PAC, presided over by Mr. Bhagwan Shankar Rawat (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party), pointed out that the report submitted by the Director-General Inspection (Customs and Excise) "does not inspire confidence" while the Finance Ministry has not undertaken any meaningful probe on the lines recommended by the committee earlier. It therefore urged the Ministry to re-examine the whole issue to check "any unhealthy practices in the department." The committee submitted its 61st report today to both Houses on Government's action on the 164th report which had recommended a thorough probe into the entire issue. Decision Delayed The PAC observes that the case pending since April, 1989, before the Customs, Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) has not been decided even after a lapse of over four years. It was following the committee's recommendations that the Government had filed a review petition against the adjudicating order passed in January, 1989, dropping the charges contained in the showcause notice issued against the company in February, 1987. The PAC notes that the stay order obtained by the company against the proceedings in CEGAT has since been vacated and the matter is said to be pending before the Tribunal for a final decision. But the committee felt this was another instance of an importer resorting to tactics of successfully buying time for paying huge amounts of customs duty. It has, therefore, urged that the matter be thoroughly examined and effective measures evolved to ensure that Government's legitimate dues are recovered in time. In the previous report, it was noted that Reliance Industries had registered three project contracts with the Bombay Custom House for availing of concessional duty rates. It was found that against the prescribed time limit of 15 days of the import of the last consignments, the company was allowed a period of four years and two months for the first contract, nine months for the second contract, and nearly a year and one month for the third contract to file reconciliation statements. The PAC had urged that the circumstances in which the company was permitted to submit reconciliation statements in this manner be thoroughly probed and responsibility fixed for the "undue favour." The Department of Revenue in the Finance Ministry, in its reply to the PAC on this issue, said it had been studied by the Director General of Inspection (Customs and Central Excise). His report revealed that the file remained in the Custom House unattended for two years and five months in the first case, nine months in the second case and 10 months in the third case. The Director-General concluded that while there was administrative slackness, there did not appear to be any `motivated delay' by Customs officials. On fixing of responsibility, the Central Board of Excise and Customs felt that work of this nature "tends to fall in arrears" owing to acute staff shortage. In this case, though delayed, corrective action has been taken by issue of show cause notice, it was pointed out. Besides, fresh instructions have been issued to Collectors of Customs to ensure that reconciliation statements are submitted by importers within the prescribed period and to enforce bonds where these are not submitted within the stipulated time.
