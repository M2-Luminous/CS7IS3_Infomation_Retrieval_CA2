The location and duration of the talks as well as the make-up of the teams were not revealed. The source said that the meeting was shrouded in the "greatest secrecy", and an Israeli diplomat here refused to give any details. The talks are to prepare the ground for a meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat here on Sunday. The two reported important progress when they met last weekend in Davos, Switzerland, although Israeli officials have been stressing that a final agreement will still take several weeks. The outstanding disagreements include control of international border crossings, the size of the Jericho autonomous area and security for Jewish settlements. PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Monday that the two sides in Davos "managed to resolve all problems concerning Gaza, Jericho and the crossing points" but added: "I don't want to be too optimistic, because stumbling blocks sometimes emerge for reasons beyond our control." He had said the two sides would resume talks in Cairo on Tuesday in a bid to resolve remaining differences, but Israeli officials said consultations were continuing in Jerusalem and the talks were not scheduled to begin. The disagreements have held up the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, which should have begun on December 13 under the Declaration of Principles signed on September 13. The handover should be completed by April 13.
