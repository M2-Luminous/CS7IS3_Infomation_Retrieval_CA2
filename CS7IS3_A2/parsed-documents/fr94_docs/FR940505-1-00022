FR940505-1-00022 FR940505-1-00011 ACRA asserts that under any of the three approaches, the opportunity for odometer fraud is minimal. It notes that, under the first two approaches, the universe of vehicles potentially qualifying for exemption is carefully limited to new vehicles (registering very low mileage), and only those new vehicles transferred to a business engaged in ``short-term leasing.'' Under the third approach, ACRA views the combination of factors (i.e., new vehicle, fleet purchase) to pose a similarly low risk of fraud, while eliminating the need for manufacturer disclosures in cases involving joint dealer and car rental company transferees. Discussion The central purpose of the Truth in Mileage Act was to make the title document the sole vehicle for odometer disclosure. Congress sought to institute a uniform system of disclosure that would be readily available to assist the consumer in making motor vehicle purchasing decisions. Prior to that time, the use of separate documents for odometer disclosure was not uncommon, and was found to be vulnerable to abuse. Subsequent statutory amendments in 1988 and 1990 have deviated from the absolute requirement to use the title document, by authorizing the use of powers of attorney in strictly limited circumstances when titles are physically held by lienholders. Additionally, Congress has authorized the approval of alternate odometer disclosure procedures, provided they are determined to be consistent with the Act, but only when these procedures are submitted by a State. However, there is no indication that Congress intended to extend the opportunity to seek alternate procedures to any other entities. Indeed, such a course of action would seem anomalous, considering that it is the States that are charged with institutionalizing the odometer disclosure procedures. The limited circumstances articulated for deviation from the primary intent of the Act reflect Congress' reluctance to stray from the overriding goal of achieving comprehensive odometer disclosure procedures to protect the public. It is significant that several States have voiced concern regarding the granting of additional exemptions to the disclosure requirements, arguing that new exemptions would introduce serious burdens to an already complex titling review process. Even under the current procedures, NHTSA is aware that some States have administratively rejected certain exemptions provided for in NHTSA's regulation. The differing practices among States with respect to the existing exemptions have resulted in a disruption of interstate vehicle transfers, as title transfer documents from some States have been rejected by other States. Favorable action on this petition would likely compound the problem, in apparent contradiction to the intent of Congress that the interests of the States be accommodated, where consistent with the Act. Apart from issues of Congressional intent evident in the legislation, the agency's authority to deviate from the Act has, over the years, been thrown into question by court decisions rejecting one of NHTSA's regulatory exemptions under Section 580.6. Several courts have ruled that NHTSA does not have the authority to exempt vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating in excess of 16,000 pounds from the odometer disclosure requirement. See W. W. Wallwork, Inc. v. Duchscherer, 501 N.W.2d 751 (N.D. 1993); Davis v. Dils Motor Co., 566 F. Supp. 1360 (S.D.W.Va. 1983); Lair v. Lewis Service Center, 428 F. Supp. 778 (D. Neb. 1977). It is significant that these courts reached such a conclusion despite NHTSA's administrative determination that, in transfers of the subject vehicles (heavy trucks), maintenance records are of key importance but the odometer reading is not generally relied upon in determining value or condition. NHTSA continues to believe that it has the requisite authority to consider exemptions in cases where odometer readings are not relied upon in the course of vehicle transfers. However, the vehicles that are the subject of this petition do not enjoy such a distinction, and so it is especially doubtful that the courts would support the requested broadening of exemptions. In view of these limitations, the agency's discretion to allow exemptions to the odometer disclosure requirements is highly circumscribed. This is especially true in the instant case, where the proposed changes have been requested by an entity other than a State (whose right to seek approval of alternate requirements is the only one specifically recognized by the Act) and, moreover, would target a large vehicle population (the top ten companies had over one million vehicles in their fleets in 1992, according to ACRA's figures). Each of the proposed solutions advanced by ACRA raises serious problems. The first and third proposed solutions would introduce a new exemption, in the face of court decisions increasingly rejecting NHTSA's authority to grant such exemptions. Moreover, they would do so for vehicles with respect to which mileage is relied upon as an indicator of value or condition. The second proposed solution would expand the use of the power of attorney, in the face of Congressional intent that it be strictly limited. All of the proposed solutions would compromise the States' implementation procedures. Under the circumstances, and mindful of the fact that the petitioner is not a State, NHTSA concludes that it does not possess the authority to implement any of the proposed amendments. NHTSA is aware of ACRA's assertions that the current procedures are causing hardship to the car rental industry, and that its proposed solutions would not compromise the integrity of the system. Although the denial of this petition rests on the agency's lack of authority, the agency offers the following comments on ACRA's assertions.
