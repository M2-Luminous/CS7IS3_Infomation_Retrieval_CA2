On this day, the state is supposed to recall its littlest citizens, its own future; but because of various circumstances it does not recall the basic principle which was still in use until quite recently: "Everything the best for the children." However, doctors are providing accurate statistical data, showing that every year, as a result of the ecological situation, the health of the children is getting worse. At this time, we do not have a state concept of what needs to be done to stop this process. Since I have a direct relationship to studying the influence of the ecology of the city of Kiev on the state of health of its younger population, I wish to share with my readers some of my own observations on this subject. First of all, let us turn once more to the sad, even terrible statistics on the ecological status of Ukraine, so that we can once more convince ourselves as to what we have come to by our brutal approach toward nature. And toward ourselves as well. Today, the atmosphere of Ukraine is the most polluted among all the countries which used to belong to the USSR. Over 40 percent of the territory of Ukraine, air pollution is two to three times greater than the levels in Europe. Every year, over 110,000 different enterprises send into the atmosphere tens of millions of tons of chemically harmful materials ejected from means of transportation. In this way, there are almost 300 kilograms of poisons for every citizen of Ukraine. It is known that 38 percent of incorrect physical development and growth of a person is conditioned by the surrounding environment. Negative genetic changes accumulate in the hereditary material from air pollution. If these changes reach 30 percent, the nation must disappear--this is a biological law. For example, this level has already reached 19 to 24 percent for the Donetsk-Prydniprovsk region. If the pollution of the atmosphere is 1.2 to 1.5 times higher than the acceptable levels, it causes significant strains on the organism's defense system; if it is more, it leads to illness of the immune system. The ground of Ukraine is significantly polluted by wastes, and by the uncontrolled use of mineral fertilizers. Vegetables grown with them, and fruits with high levels of nitrates and nitrites, have a very negative effect on people's health. Add radionuclides to this, of which there is quite a bit in plants and animals, and the water--and we have a picture of the effect of the environment on our health that is not at all exaggerated. In fact, materials from water without adequate purification make up almost 40 percent of industrial wastes. The water plants of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, Rivne, and Ternopil oblasts do not meet sanitary rules. In almost all local drainage waters, there is a large content of heavy metals. And this is only a few lines for the ecological "portrait" of Ukraine, without even touching on the Chornobyl disaster. How could the people be healthy? But let us return to the statistics. The general level of illness of the population is 634.7 per 1,000 people. As a result of ecological disasters, the life span in Ukraine has decreased to 68 years (60 years for men, 75 years for women). Ukraine is in 32nd place in the world, according to this indicator. We have the lowest birth rate among the countries of the former USSR (14.5 to 15 children per 1000 people, in 1991). And this tendency is getting worse. In the last three years, child mortality in Kiev in the first year of life has grown thus: 1990--12.6, 1991--13.3, 1992--16.4 per 1,000 births. The high level of child mortality is explained by the increased number of children who are born sick. In the last 10 years, the births of children not capable of life has grown by 65 percent. If in 1985 14.5 percent of newborns in Kiev were sick, in 1992 24 percent were. Especially worrying is the early mortality of infants that do not survive their first year. It is one and a half times higher than for the republic as a whole. And one more troubling number: out of 1,000 births, an average of 20 are deformed. Also, the level of mental illness is increasing among children. The health of an infant, usually, is transferred to the school and older student years. By the end of middle school, various chronic illnesses are noted in 46 percent of the pupils, and in 50 percent morphological and functional problems are present. Today, 5 to 8 percent of the graduates can be considered healthy. Children with chronic pathologies now make up 23.4 percent, and those with two chronic illnesses, 13.5 percent. About 80 percent of pre-school children have health problems. Over a third of students in schools and professional and technical institutes suffer from nervous or psychological disorders. Today in Ukraine, one family in 8 to 12 is childless. And one girl in five to six has health problems which might effect her reproductive function. In Ukraine, for more than three years the population has not reproduced itself; the nation is dying. The state of health of the nation is a mirror of the nature of Ukraine. The statistics are not reassuring. No matter what we wish, the situation will not soon get better. But what is there to be done now, when eight years have passed since the disaster at the Chornobyl nuclear power station? I will begun with something concrete and current: it is necessary to lower steadily the level of toxic substances in the organs and tissues of children, to the maximally safe levels. These poisonous substances essentially get into the organism through eating and drinking. With prophylactic methods, the child (and the adult) can be healthy even in today's unfavorable ecological conditions. The effectiveness of such prophylaxis depends on resolving several problems. It is necessary to have simple and reliable methods for detecting risk factors for the endoecological pollution of the organism, a method of removing from it the ecological poison in a controlled way, and means for renewing its defense functions. Concepts for such a program were developed in the Institute of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, together with a numerous team of doctors. Later, this program began to be introduced through a newly formed civic structure: the Institute of Ecology of the Person. In the program, fundamentally new methods of investigating the endoecological pollution of children were developed, which in the majority of cases do not have analogs in the classical diagnoses. Besides this, a series of effective methods of the endoecological purification of the organism were developed, which can be recommended to parents for use in the home. In the year and a half that the introduction of this program has been allowed, more than a thousand children of different age groups and in different ecological circumstances both in Kiev, and outside it, have gone through dispensary investigations. Today, certain generalizations can be made. Few children with ecologically pure organisms were found. They made up an average of 20 percent of those studied. In general, the health of the children of Kievans is now practically the same, as that of the children, who were moved to Kiev in 1986 from the 30 kilometer zone. In fact, three or four years ago there was a quite noticable difference, in the better health of the children of Kievans. Investigations show that the basic reason for this is the uncontrolled influence of the surrounding environment--ecological poisoning. The complex methods which we developed, which are chiefly connected with the utilization of prophylactic phytotherapy, make it possible to purify the organisms of children from ecological poisons by 85-90 percent. This works best when, for a period of two or three days before the application of the phytotherapy, the children take synthetic enterosorbents, or better, natural ones. After this, prophylaxis by phyto-preparations is applied for two or three weeks. A necessary condition at this stage is control over the organism of the child, in order to make certain of the effectiveness of the application of the methods of the prophylaxis, for each one, individually. In the process of the investigation, certain general special points appear. The ingestion of radionuclides has the greatest effect on the gastrointestinal tract (over 60 percent), on the liver (20 to 30 percent), the kidneys, and the urine bladder, since in some children an increase in the radioactivity of urine is noted. This rule is clearly noted: in relatively identical ecological conditions, younger children, for example pupils in the first and second grades, have a pollution of the organism two to two and a half times greater than the older pupils. It is possible that this shows that the child, as he is growing, accumulates more radionuclides and other harmful substances. A basic point in this work is carrying out the controlled prophylactic purification of the organism, and proof, that after two or three weeks it will really be purified and reach a state of relative norm. In this case, it is necessary only to carry out, regularly and periodically, such prophylaxis either in home conditions, or in kindergartens, and in schools as well. Considering the very important, main role of the mother in strengthening the health of a child, we are convinced that good results can be achieved when diagnosis and purification of the organism, and the renewal of its protective functions, is carried out simultaneously by the mother and her child. This is especially the case for small children. Indeed, this concerns the ecology of the family. When the constant prophylactic purification of the organisms of all members of the family is looked after, this will be a healthy family. We think that it is through the ecology of the family that it is possible to look for the survival of the nation in these complex ecological and economic circumstances. There is yet one more side to this matter. It is necessary for all of the state's pre-school and school institutions to move to regulated and controlled ecological conditions. The first results of this work in two rayons of Kiev show the great usefulness of the organization of ecologically pure kindergartens. Moreover, it is possible to carry out in them the ecological education of the children, which is an important factor in ecoprophylactic endeavors. Since vacations are coming, children and parents are trying to begin to get healthy. It would be worth recalling a few pieces of advice which can be useful in purifying the organism from ecological poisons. Occasionally we remember general health-giving, vitamin, and herbal teas. There are many recipes for them. Each family can choose several types of such teas for itself. There are many medicinal herbs, which people have used for thousands of years, and which have curative force because they purify different organs and tissues. For example, broth from the leaf of the coltsfoot facilitates purification of the kidneys. Tea from the leaf of the red bilberry purifies the walls of the blood vessels, the liver, and the kidneys. In the summer and fall, each family can prepare for itself an adequate quantity of medicinal herbs, in the necessary assortment, for the winter. They are especially necessary for children. Food is also important in making children healthy. To some degree it has to be divided up. Foods that have a lot of protein (meat and fish), and those largely made up of carbohydrates (kasha, bread, baked goods), must be used separately, in one and a half to two hours. In all of this, regular purification of the bowels, especially the large bowel, can never be forgotten. We recommend that all people, children, have cleansing enemas at least once every 10 or 12 days. The means for this procedure are simple, and there are different ones; every family knows how to do this. Let us remember an old truth: if a person takes care of the cleanliness of the large bowel, he will avoid almost all illnesses linked with environmental pollution. It is possible also to make quite a few recommendations concerning general health. There are physical cultures that we have half-forgotten, and the applications of baths or saunas, when through the pores of the skin various toxins come out of the body. It is important to be aware that the health of our children is first of all a concern of the family and its relationship to ecology. The sooner we understand this in the contexts of one family, village, city, oblast, and the country as a whole, the better we will protect our children from illnesses. Life itself demands that more new professionals join our medical services, especially physician-ecologists. At every children's polyclinic, offices for the ecology of the mother and child should be created, special centers, where each family could always have consultations on the ecological pollution of the organism of the child. An example could be the office of the ecology of the mother and child, which has operated already for almost a year in the First Children's Polyclinic of the Moscow rayon of the city of Kiev. This office is one of the agencies of the Institute of Ecology of the Person. But if our efforts are not supported by morally and financially on the state level, they might come to nothing. We have to do all this so that the children of Ukraine will grow up healthy and strong. In this is the future of our state. And the nation. In its entirety. Let us consider this on the anniversary of the Chornobyl catastrophe. From the editors. In future work, the author plans to give more concrete recommendations for purification of the organism of the child from radionuclides.
