Security Council Committee monitoring the application of sanctions against Iraq in a bid to highlight the Jordanian case at the United Nations headquarters. Jordanian losses due to the observance of the sanctions imposed on Baghdad in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis of 1991 have been carefully documented and conservatively put at $300 million annually. Numerous attempts have been made by Jordan to explain the extent of the hardships that our economy has sustained as a result of the application of these measures and to seek adequate compensation for them. It is no secret that industrial production in the country has been oriented with the Iraqi market in mind, in view of the geographic proximity and in order to maintain a trade balance commensurate with Jordan's dependence on the import of oil from Iraq. All nations of the world which admit to having a stake in the stability and development of the Kingdom, whether for the promotion of the peace prospects in the Middle East or for the overall security of the region, have now an opportunity to translate this faith into action. This they could do by lifting the secondary "sanctions" that have been applied against Jordan and by ending their indiscriminate interference with sea shipping to and from al-'Aqabah. Jordanian imports and exports have been unduly and unnecessarily jeopardised because of routine inspection of freighters bound to the Jordanian Red Sea port. Costs to the economy attributable to such unacceptable practices have been staggering. Needless to say, this country can ill afford the additional costs to its imports and exports. Sea lines to Jordan have also been curtailed considerably, by up to 30 per cent, because ship owners cannot afford the unusual delays experienced by their ships en route to Jordan. The alternative Jordanian proposal to replace sea searches by on-land inspection by a neutral party is a lesser evil, even though such idea had been anathema to us until the recent past. In principle, the proposal is a threat to Jordan's sovereignty but it would work out as a temporary alternative. As to the prime minister's other major concern--that Jordanian applications numbering already in the thousands, requesting U.N. authorisation to export certain food and medical products be processed on criteria basis rather than on the existing case-by-case method--is also a step in the right direction. There is no sense in spending precious time on the applications and working on the 15 members of the committee to discuss each and every request if the majority of requests fall under similar general category. The current method is simply not cost effective. A more rational way to deal with this issue could be found in the Jordanian proposal. Still, the central problem lies in neither dimension of the application of sanctions against Iraq. It is the question of the sanctions themselves that has to be reasked, especially after it was proven beyond a shadow of doubt that it is the Iraqi people who suffer most from them. Besides, Baghdad has enforced most if not all of the U.N. Security Council's resolutions imposed on it after the Gulf war. There is a good case to at least relax the sanctions and start lifting them on a gradual basis, commensurate with the extent of Iraqi adherence to the original U.N. resolutions.
