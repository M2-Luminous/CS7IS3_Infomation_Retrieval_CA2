He told reporters this morning Israel will stand firm on the issue of the Qatif Bloc, in spite of the last minute demands of the Palestinians in the Cairo talks. Our reporter Jack Katzenell asked him if the talks were proceeding too slowly: [Begin recording] [Rabin] There are differences of opinion, but I believe that we will succeed to overcome the difficulties. We are not expecting to achieve an agreement in few days, but we have agreed to start building the nucleus of the Palestinian police in two places in Gaza and in one place in Jericho. We will do it gradually. We believe that it will allow -- once we reach an agreement and sign it -- and help a more smooth hand over of the responsibilities that will be transferred from the Civil Administration and the military government to the Palestinian authority. [Katzenell] If Israel allows the Palestinians to deploy bit by bit in this way, will it not in the end force our hand? Can Israel hold the Palestinians to their promises about all the limitations on the Palestinian police? [Rabin] Well, I believe that the bringing of a few dozen Palestinian police to these places -- to each one of them, every one of them -- will not undermine our capability to reach the agreement that we want, so that our vital interest will be served. [Katzenell] Is Israel standing firm on the issue of the Qatif Bloc and the idea of its being one single bloc which the Palestinian police cannot enter? [Rabin] We signed an agreement in Cairo, including attached maps. Of course, everything is dependent on the conclusion of the agreement; but the maps were signed and we take them as they signed as the basis for whatever will develop. [end recording]
