They work in certain circumstances, but not in others. This is why Western-style democracy and free market enterprises do not harmoniously guarantee a national success. It differs from country to country. China is one of them. As Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed pointed out in Beijing, the country has its own political and economic agenda. So far, it has worked for the country which is grappling with a population in excess of 1.2 billion people. Therefore, to bring prosperity to all its people is a tall order. Absolute democracy based on Western standards is not practical in China. Neither is a completely free market economy. Russia is a prime example of how capitalism after the scrapping of a centrally planned economy has failed. China does not want to suffer a similar fate. Its economy is a dome of a free enterprise coupled with socialist elements. In this way, it guarantees the distribution of wealth to the people. At the same time, the country realizes it needs foreign markets. So, it opens its own market to foreign enterprises while making inroads into to others. This is what Southeast Asian countries have a lot to gain. China offers a huge market potential. Rather than harboring fears about its alleged military aggression, it is time to look to China as a valuable business partner. But China has to reassure others that it is not bent on a military conquest. A recent report that the country was building up its military facilities is indeed disturbing. This is compounded by overlapping claims on certain territories. Without doubt, flash points do exist. But in the overall scheme of things, China, too, has to trade with Southeast Asian countries. It is the interdependent relationship that China would not want to jeopardize through unwarranted military exploits. If that is all China is keen to assert, then such a picture has been painted by the Western powers. After all, Western powers believe self-preservation can only be achieved through military expansion. This is not the case in this part of the world. For business to succeed, a country needs order. Otherwise, it will lead to a weak government and discourage foreign investment. That is what China has set out to do for there is a massive potential for all through greater economic interaction. Even without China's potential not fully exploited [as heard], the Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the fastest growth area in the world. What more if the huge potential in China is harnessed? This is unimaginable given China's potentially vast market. Most importantly, it can be the engine of growth for this region first and perhaps the rest of the world. Malaysia recognizes China's huge economic potential and the vital role it can play. It has already embarked on enhancing two-way trade and investment with China. Numerous Malaysian companies are penetrating the huge Chinese market. In return, many Chinese companies are looking into trade and investment in Malaysia. Malaysia's move is, therefore, a step in the right direction in its approach toward China. Malaysia welcomes a wealthy and prosperous China, knowing very well its [word indistinct] benefit would be far-reaching.
