Uljin County Commissioner Kim Tong-hui met reporters Wednesday afternoon to make public Science and Technology Minister Kim Si- chung's message containing the retraction. The message read in part, "This is to inform you that although some residents of the Uljin area tried to induce a radioactive waste management facility, the government has decided not to set up such a facility in the Uljin area in consideration of various conditions." Meanwhile, large crowds of Uljin people mounted various protest actions for the fifth straight day Wednesday against the planned creation of a nuclear waste yard. About 1,500 high school students staged a sit-in along a major road near Uljin-up beginning around 2 PM while about 200 shop owners in the Uljin town closed their shops for the day as a sign of protest. Around 12 noon, some 1,000 villagers of Puk-myon poured into the street and blocked traffic. Of the 12,000 primary and secondary school students in the Uljin area, about 10,000 boycotted classes Wednesday in a protest move.
