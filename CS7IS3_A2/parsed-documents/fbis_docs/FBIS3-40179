As a full participant in the Uruguay Round, China must restore its status as a GATT contracting party as soon as possible so as to sign the final act of the Uruguay Round and perform the obligations specified in the act. On the one hand, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has provided a more open external environment for us to further export-oriented economic development. On the other hand, a more open market means keener competition--a new challenge to the makeup and quality of our exports. Town and township enterprises are the main subject of this challenge. Generally speaking, township enterprises are faced with the following internal and external problems: First, we have a large number of township enterprises, but their operations are small-scale. Now, there are more than 10 million township enterprises, employing 110 million people. On average, each enterprise has less than 10 employees, and cannot take advantage of large-scale operations. There are only a few dozen enterprise groups. This makes macro-management and guidance a very difficult task. Second, township enterprises lack technical personnel, and their technology and equipment are backward. Most staff members and workers of township enterprises come from the countryside. Their education and training cannot meet the needs of industrialized production. Most of their equipment is backward, and most needs to be replaced. Third, products are not technology-intensive. Most of them are common, low-grade products, which cannot compete with imported goods. Fourth, the products are of poor quality. Many products are manufactured in a careless way, and some are fake or shoddy products. How can such products compete with their foreign counterparts? Fifth, this year the world economy will move out of difficulty and enter a steady-growth stage. Competition in the international market will be keen. In particular, our neighboring areas, such as Southeast Asia, are regions in the world noted for their relatively fast economic growth. Their economic growth rate is expected to surpass the European and U.S. countries by 4 percentage points. The "threat" of competition from these regions will be severe. Six, China can no longer rely on such methods as high tariffs to protect domestic products. After our "re-entry into GATT," our products will be directly subject to the impact of international market prices and world economic situations. The GATT's primary function is to set the international trade behavior of its contracting parties, and the contracting parties must implement a market economic system and enforce unified trade and tariff rules as required. How will township enterprises meet this challenge? This is a serious question before us. The correct answer is: They should create brand-name products to welcome "re-entry into GATT." When the tide of "re-entry into GATT" comes, they should be "tide riders"! 1. They should launch a vigorous publicity and education campaign aimed at fostering and strengthening the determination to improve product quality. It is imperative to increase the leaders' and employees' sense of urgency, crisis, and responsibility. They should foster the intention of "improving their product quality with the ultimate goal of revitalizing the country" and reinforce their concept that "quality is the lifeblood of township enterprises." 2. They should use the strategy of creating brand-name products to increase the popularity and competitiveness of their products both at home and abroad. Authorities at all levels in charge of township enterprises should formulate a "brand-name products" strategy and put it into practice step by step. The state should establish a policy to give preferential treatment to quality products turned out by township enterprises. 3. They should painstakingly "improve themselves." They should go all out to conduct technical transformation, readjust the product mix, understand high technology, and develop high-tech products. 4. They should catch up with the tide of nationwide economic reform this year. Positive efforts should be exerted to implement and perfect the cooperative shareholding system, promote various kinds of lateral economic and technological alliances and cooperation, and encourage the formation of superior industries, manufacturers of brand-name products, or backbone enterprises based on the principle of voluntary participation. Small and mini enterprises and those operating at a deficit should be merged, leased out, or sold by auction. Township enterprises should transform their operational mechanism in line with the modern international enterprise system with a view to approaching the standard of regular modernized enterprises in the world.
