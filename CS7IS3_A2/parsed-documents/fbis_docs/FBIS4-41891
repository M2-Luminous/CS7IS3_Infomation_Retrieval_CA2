Since then representatives of approximately 160 countries have already signed this document. Work on the convention lasted almost a quarter-century. Very complex problems were encountered. Although only three states -- the United States, Russia, and Iraq -- officially admitted that they possessed chemical weapons, in fact 20-25 countries had them. Also, until recently the political climate was not disposed to the adoption of an agreement that would have been acceptable to all. In the final analysis, however, such a document was elaborated. It prohibits everywhere the acquisition, development, production, sale, or use of chemical weapons. All stocks and also production capacities must be destroyed within 10 years of the convention's entry into force. Provision is made for monitoring of national chemical industry installations and for appropriate inspections to be conducted on a permanent basis, as well as inspections on demand, when any country is obliged to give foreign observers access to installations which have come under suspicion. According to the terms of the convention, it will come into force once ratified by 65 participant states. This is expected to happen next year. At present, however, the ratification process is proceeding slowly. Just five countries have confirmed in legislation their adhesion to this act of international law. It is perfectly obvious that the majority of countries are waiting for it to be ratified by Russia and the United States. In Russia the State Duma has now begun examining the convention, and preparations are under way to ratify it. The document is also being discussed in the U.S. Senate. Hearings on ratification of the chemical weapons convention were held recently in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Administration's representatives at the hearings -- James Woolsey, director of the CIA; General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and John Holum, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- pointed out that this international document, which prohibits an entire class of mass destruction weapons, meets U.S. national security interests. On the whole the senators listened favorably to the Administration representatives. But it is no secret that there are also opponents of the convention in the United States. It can hardly be considered a coincidence that on the eve of the hearings the U.S. press launched a new campaign of accusations against Russia, which is allegedly "concealing its efforts" to develop the latest types of chemical weapons, including binary weapons. THE NEW YORK TIMES has shown special zeal. It has repeatedly addressed this topic in the past few days. At the same time, not possessing any facts, since none exists, it has returned to the long-refuted "revelations" of the Russian chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov in his sensational interview with THE BOSTON GLOBE. True, in passing, it made the reservation that "some of his frightening statements elicit a skeptical attitude." But this was only a reservation. As far as it is possible to judge, the majority of U.S. congressmen still incline toward ratifying the convention. The speediest positive examination of this problem in our State Duma would obviously make a favorable impression on them. Although it would be perfectly legitimate to put the question this way: Ratification of the convention on chemical weapons in the U.S. Senate would also prompt Russian legislators to make such a decision.
