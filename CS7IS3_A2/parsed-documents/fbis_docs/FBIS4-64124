"If the three Baltic countries reach a common system as to the technical and organizational level of their air space defense, this may become a strong starting point in their joining NATO. The NATO members have set up a common air space defense system which strongly ties these countries with each other," said Colonel Vello Loemaa, head of the air space defense division at the Estonian Army Central Staff. All three Baltic countries have joined NATO's Partnership for Peace plan and are working toward setting up a common peacekeeping battalion to take part in UN operations by November 1995. Also these steps are expected to speed up movement toward full member status in the North Atlantic Alliance. Air space defense chiefs of the three countries at a meeting in Lithuania's Meskuiciai air base Tuesday [24 May] signed a protocol about starting preparations for setting up a common air space defense system and joint training of pilots. "We try to coordinate air space defense-related activity and develop it with minimum expense. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania currently are in a rather similar situation, but develop different contacts. We must make joint efforts to create a common air space defense system," Loemaa told BNS. He said the Baltics are also considering the purchase of air space defense-related technology, including radars. "This, of course, is a long-term program that will become a reality only after several years. But we expect to make the first concrete steps already this year," Loemaa said. Lithuanian experts have estimated that setting up a structure to control the entire Baltic air space would take between 5 and 10 years. Loemaa added that the defense forces of Latvia and Lithuania are better equipped with aircraft than the forces in Estonia. Lithuania currently operates three air bases for its air force fleet of four Czech-made L-39 jet fighters, two L-140 transport planes received as gift from Germany, and tens of older Soviet-made AN-2 aircraft the country uses to train its paratroopers. Lithuania also has Soviet-made Mi-8 helicopters, mainly used by the country's rescue service.
