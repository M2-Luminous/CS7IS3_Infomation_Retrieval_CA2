FR940318-0-00184 FR940318-0-00023 In order to evaluate the acceptability of proposed halon substitutes, the Agency divided the fire protection sector into two end-uses: (1) Streaming Agents, and (2) Total Flooding Agents. The `Total Flooding' category includes all total flooding applications, including normally occupied, normally unoccupied, and explosion inertion and suppression applications. For some substitutes, data required by the Agency to complete a risk assessment is not yet available or has not been submitted to the Agency as requested. As a result, not all candidate substitutes have been fully evaluated by the Agency. Those substitutes which the Agency is currently reviewing, but for which a final determination cannot yet be made, are listed as pending review in the table in Appendix B. The evaluation of these pending submissions will continue, and the results of these continuing evaluations will be published in the Federal Register as part of EPA's quarterly updates to the SNAP lists. The listing decisions are compiled by type. Thus, for each end-use, an agent may be listed in one or more type of decision, including `acceptable,' `acceptable subject to use conditions,' `acceptable subject to narrowed use limits,' `unacceptable,' or `pending completion of review.' The table in appendix B summarizes EPA's decisions by each type of decision for each end-use. EPA's finding of acceptability of a halon substitute should be viewed only as a listing based on the criteria briefly set out in this Preamble as governing the SNAP program and described in detail in the background document entitled ``Characterization of Risk From the Use of Substitutes for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Fire Extinguishing and Explosion Protection (Halon Substitutes)''. EPA's finding of acceptability should not be considered an endorsement of the substitute for the suppression or prevention of any given fire or explosion scenario, for which the user is referred to a fire protection specialist. a. Acceptable. (1) Streaming agents. (a) HCFC&hyph;123. HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. Because of its relatively low weight equivalency, HCFC&hyph;123 could replace Halon 1211 at ratio of 1.8 by weight. However, testing has indicated that application of this agent may require special handling or nozzles to successfully extinguish a fire. Its extinguishment concentration based on cup burner tests is 6.3 percent. With an ODP of 0.02, HCFC&hyph;123 has the lowest ODP of all the HCFCs proposed as halon substitutes, and its 100-year GWP of 90 is lower than that of other proposed HCFC substitutes. In addition, it has a short atmospheric lifetime of 2 years. Since HCFC&hyph;123 has a cardiotoxic level (LOAEL) of 2.0 percent in the dog, with no effect (NOAEL) apparent at 1.0 percent, potential users have expressed concern about using HCFC&hyph;123 or blends containing HCFC&hyph;123 as the primary constituent. However, actual exposures were assessed using personal monitoring devices, and the Agency concludes that likely exposure levels from its use as a streaming agent do not exceed safe levels when used with good ventilation. Similar exposure concerns exist with the use of carbon dioxide or Halon 1211 streaming agents. All must be used only in areas with adequate ventilation. The manufacturer of portable extinguishers using these agents should include cautionary language on the label indicating the need for ventilation. The manufacturer has raised its allowable exposure limit (AEL) for HCFC&hyph;123 to 30 parts per million (ppm). The AEL is set at a level believed to protect workers who are regularly exposed from adverse chronic effects. As a practical matter, exposures should not exceed this limit for any working day; this practice is consistent with OSHA's enforcement of its own PELs. If it is likely that exposures may exceed 30 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA), proper protective gear should be worn. For the purposes of determining the proper respiratory protection, the user should consult the manufacturer of the product for their specific recommendations for respirator use of the particular end use. As discussed in the section on HCFCs generally, this agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA. EPA intends to publish a proposed rulemaking that will ban the use of this agent in residential applications. (b) (HCFC blend) B. (HCFC blend) B is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute. This blend consists largely of HCFC&hyph;123, therefore, as with HCFC&hyph;123, it has been shown in tests to have a weight equivalency ratio to Halon 1211 of 1.8. While HCFC&hyph;123 has a cardiotoxic level of 2.0 percent in the dog, with no effect apparent at 1.0 percent, actual exposures from use of this blend as a streaming agent were assessed using personal monitoring devices. The Agency concludes that likely exposure levels do not exceed safe levels. The manufacturer of HCFC&hyph;123 has raised its allowable exposure limit (AEL) to 30 parts per million (ppm). The AEL is set at a level believed to protect workers who are exposed on a regular basis from chronic adverse effects. As a practical matter, exposures should not exceed this limit for any working day; this practice is consistent with OSHA's enforcement of its own PELs.
