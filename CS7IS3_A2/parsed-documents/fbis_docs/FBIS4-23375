The flights were suspended "until further notice," the officials said. A Canadian C-130 military transport plane that had just landed with Rochetta and three other Italian officials on board took off again before they could disembark after a shell slammed into the airport behind the control tower. Seconds after the plane left the ground, a second shell hit the runway. Nobody was hurt and there was no damage to the plane. "The shells were certainly fired by the RGF (Rwandan Government Forces)," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante told reporters on the tarmac when the shells landed.
