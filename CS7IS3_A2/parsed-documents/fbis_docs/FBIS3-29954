The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formalized the great leader's revolutionary ideology and promulgated the task of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea as the supreme program of our party in his historic work published 20 years ago. With the publication of the work, our party has come to have a mighty ideological and theoretical weapon which makes it possible to push ahead with the forward movement toward socialism, communism with certainty, and this is a historic event which opened a new, epochal turning point for the development of our party and the revolution. The modern history of the Korean revolution which has been advancing under the banner of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea and today's realities clearly prove the greatness of the work and its invincible vitality. Today we recall with dignity the course of our glorious struggle for the work of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea on which we have been victoriously advancing along the party's leadership, upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the head of the party and the revolution. Comrades: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's work is an immortal classical document which is of historic significance in the building of our party and in the development of our revolution. As historic experiences show, the party of the working class can victoriously develop revolution and construction and outstandingly perform its mission only when it has the right guiding ideology and revolutionary theory and the right struggle program, strategies and tactics. Because it takes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, as its guiding principle, the Korean revolution has been able not only to victoriously open the road ahead of its struggle with the chuche-oriented line, strategies, and tactics, but also to consistently advance along the track of chuche without the slightest degree of deviation and derailment in defiance of all sorts of trials in history. Indeed, the entire course of the Korean revolution is not only a proud course of victory on which the great leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, has been brilliantly embodied and turned into a reality, but is also a historic course on which its truthfulness and vitality have been fully proven in all sectors of society. The glorious course of the Korean revolution and the great epochal changes achieved in our country have clearly shown that the only guiding ideology which leads to victory the revolutionary struggle and socialist and communist construction of our era, that is, the era of independence--which is fundamentaly different from the previous eras of history--is precisely the revolutionary ideology of the respected and beloved leader [suryong], that is, the chuche idea. Taking the great leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideology as a guiding ideology and making efforts for socialist, communist construction under its banner was not only a strong aspiration of the times, but was also a unanimous desire of hundreds of millions of people in the world. With his deep insight into the aspiration of the times and the demands of our developing revolution, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published his historic work on 19 February 1974 and, thus, gave perfect answers to the problems that the times and the revolution presented as urgent tasks. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has profoundly elucidated the historic position and characteristics of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, which is the only guiding ideology of the revolution and construction of our times; presented not only the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, but also the basic mission of the party's ideological work and the immediate tasks for the realization of the program; and systematized them in a monolithic manner. Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has provided an invincible, mighty ideological and theoretical weapon which can firmly guarantee the victory of the working class' revolutionary cause, the socialist and communist cause. This is precisely the dear comrade leader's immortal achievements for the times and the revolution. The dear comrade leader's historic work is a library of the great leader's revolutionary ideas which have made it possible to bring about momentous changes in developing the communist revolutionary theories, building a working-class revolutionary party, waging revolutionary struggles, and carrying out construction projects. It is also a militant banner that leads our people and the revolutionary people in the world to victory. The work has brought about a new change in the development of the guiding ideas of the revolution by strongly defending the great chuche idea and further enriching it. The dear comrade leader has developed the great leader's revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of chuche-oriented ideas, theories, and methods and made them completed communist revolutionary theories on realizing the popular masses' independence. The dear comrade leader has formulated the great leader's revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of the immortal chuche idea and revolutionary theories and leadership methods which the chuche idea has elucidated and, thus, clearly stated that the great leader's revolutionary ideas have different characteristics from the working class' previous revolutionary theories. In this way, the perfect definition of the great leader's revolutionary ideas has been given at last, and the question concerning the guiding ideas of the revolution in our era has been resolved brilliantly. Since the question concerning the guiding ideas of the revolution has been resolved completely, the working class and the popular masses of our era, equipped with the most correct guiding principles and strategies and tactics, have been able to successfully build socialism and communism. In his work, the dear comrade leader presented an idea and theory on imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea and stated that a communist society is a society that is based on the chuche idea and where the chuche idea has been implemented completely. In this way, he has provided our party with a fundamental guideline for its activities. The dear comrade leader early on elucidated the leader's [suryong] status and role in the development of history and the implementation of the popular masses' cause of independence, and declared for the first time in history that imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea is the foremost program of our party. In this way, he firmly transformed the course of socialist, communist construction into a course of implementing the leader's [suryong] revolutionary cause. The program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea is a great communism building program to reform man, society, and nature as required by the chuche idea, successfully conquer all the ideological and political fortresses and materialistic fortresses of communism, and completely realize the popular masses' independence. Because the program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea has been presented, our party has been able to successfully carry out the chuche revolutionary cause -- which the great leader cultivated -- along the most straight road and more vigorously accelerated the historic march toward socialism and communism. Truly, the program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea is an immortal milestone that has opened a road toward historic changes in implementing the popular masses' cause of independence, the socialist, communist cause. The work has elucidated the most correct road for the ultimate victory of the socialist, communist cause in our country and, thus, become a firm guarantee that enables our party to fulfill its historic mission. Our party's historic mission is to realize the popular masses' cause of independence, the socialist, communist cause, and completely realize the independence of all members of the society. Thanks to the program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea, our party has been able to effect social changes in building socialism and communism in compliance with the ideal of realizing the popular masses' independence, and, as a result, a new history has unfolded in which man's independence has been fully realized in all fields of his social life. The dear comrade leader has presented a general direction to complete the chuche revolutionary cause in our country and elucidated detailed ways to implement the cause. In this way, he has provided a guiding principle that we must firmly adhere to in strengthening and developing our party into an honorable chuche-oriented party forever and endlessly enhancing the party's leadership role and militant function as required by the demand for imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea. Persistently keeping up and thoroughly embodying the revolutionary policies for socialist and communist construction put forth in the work, our party has been able to successfully carry out the three major makeover projects, namely, remaking nature, society, and people, as demanded by the chuche idea, and to splendidly build the popular mass-centered socialism of our style. Truly, the historic work of the dear comrade leader is a monumental work that has summarized the great leader's revolutionary idea and further developed and enriched the theory on building communism and the theory on revolutionary party building. It is our lasting assets that firmly ensure the ultimate victory of socialist-communist construction. Because of this immortal classic work, our party has been able to make clear its revolutionary nature and mission as a chuche party both in name and reality, and to steadfastly accelerate its historic march for the completion of the chuche revolution. Comrades: Because of the greatness of the work, the historic work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has boundlessly stirred our people and the world's progressive people and thoroughly demonstrated its indestructible vitality in our practice of the revolution. For the past 20 years since the publication of the work, the struggle to remake nature, society, and people as demanded by the chuche idea has been waged vigorously in our country under the wise leadership of the party. Through this process, a momentous advance has been made in occupying the ideological, political, and material fortresses of socialism and communism, and the chronicle of our revolution has been more splendidly embroidered with epochal changes and heroic events. The dear comrade leader organized and mobilized the entire party membership and all the people to the struggle to realize the tasks set forth in his historic work, making it possible for the vitality of the program for modeling the entire society on the chuche idea to be highly displayed in all fields of party and state building and social life. The struggle of our party and people to model the entire society on the chuche idea has been an arduous and difficult struggle in which we had to pioneer the untrodden road of socialist construction in the fierce struggle against all sorts of opportunism and class enemies within and without society. Our party, based on its deep insight into the prevailing situation and the reality of the international communist movement, vigorously pushed ahead with the revolution and construction, placing itself firmly in an independent position, and has firmly built political, ideological, and material bases for the ultimate victory of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. We are proud to recall the past 20 years, because, through the struggle to realize the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea, our party's authority has been extraordinarily enhanced, its might further strengthened, and the main force of our revolution solidified as an invincible one. The dear comrade leader, who made it a theme of key importance to strengthen the party and enhance the party's leadership role in leading the revolution and construction, put forth the party building policy, above all, on modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea. By implementing this policy, he has strengthened and developed our party to be invincible ranks which are firmly united based on the great leader's revolutionary idea, and to be a militant and refined leading political organization. The dear comrade leader put forth a precise course and slogan of struggle at every point in the development of the revolution. He published numerous historic works, such as "on destroying the old frame and effecting a new upturn in the party work," "the historical lesson in socialist construction and our party's general line," and "the fundamental problem of the revolutionary party building," and led the party work along the road of great upturn, thus providing a firm guarantee for vigorously pushing ahead with the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader's wise leadership made it possible to make a fundamental turning point in the party work, and it enabled our party to greatly demonstrate its majestic appearance as the vigorous and seasoned party, which is excellently fulfilling its functions and role as a militant political organization winning the people's absolute confidence, with its roots deep in the masses, and as the General Staff office of the Korean revolution. The dear comrade leader has renewed the party's appearance under the slogan for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea and strengthened the party to be prosperous, ever-victorious, militant ranks. This is indeed the most brilliant achievement that the dear comrade leader has made for the party building cause. The revolution's chuche might is its political and ideological might guaranteed by human remolding and ideological remolding. Considering the establishment of the party's unitary control system in the entire party and society to be the first task of the human remolding work, our party has constantly intensified and developed the party's ideological work in accordance with the developing revolution. While keeping up with the ideological revolution as a key problem, our party has intensified the indoctrination of the party members and working people on principles of the chuche idea, faithfulness, party policies, and the revolutionary tradition, so that it has armed them with our party's revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea and has vigorously pushed ahead with the ideological transformation of the entire society. As a result of the party's vigorous ideological work of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, party members' and working people's loyalty to the great leader and the dear comrade leader has increased more than ever. At the same time, the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses has been consolidated as firm as a rock; the socialist chuche has been further strengthened; and its role has been enhanced greatly. This is a great victory achieved in the communist-style human remodeling work under the banner of remodeling the entire society after the chuche idea, and this is where the source of the invincible might lies, which enables our revolution to be ever-victorious under any stormy circumstances. The entire society has formed into a large revolutionary family with the great leader and dear comrade leader as the parents, according to the communist principle, "One for the whole and the whole for one." All party members and working people help one another and share joys and sorrows for the sake of the fatherland, the people, the society, and groups, and they are continuously innovating and advancing, filled with optimism and faith in victory of the revolution. This is the real look of our society, where the chuche idea has been embodied. The reinforcement and development of our party and the fundamental changes in our people's political, ideological, spiritual, and moral aspects clearly show that the dear comrade leader's historic works serve as powerful weapons for building the party and strengthening the main forces of the revolution. It is a brilliant result of his works that through the struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, economic and cultural areas and all other domains of our social life are being reformed in accordance with the demand of the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader originally elucidated principled problems in reforming the society in accordance with the demand of the chuche idea in all domains of our social life, including economic and cultural areas, and has wisely led the struggle to solve the problems. Thanks to the dear comrade leader's wise leadership, the line for chucheizing, modernizing, and scientizing the people's economy could completely be implemented; our economic independence has been strengthened; the farming industrialization and modernization has been accelerated according to the rural theses; and a lot of problems in freeing the working people from hard and difficult labors have been solved. Thanks to the party's tested leadership we have been able to make great advance in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan in defiance of the international events of the collapse of socialist countries and under the situation in which the imperialists' maneuvers against socialism and our Republic are viciously perpetrated. We have also been able to build in succession monumental edifices for the ages which amaze the people of the world, thereby changing the appearance of our fatherland in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea. This extensively shows the vitality of the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea and the might of our country's self-reliant national economy and clearly symbolizes the heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is victoriously advancing without being influenced by the worldwide upheaval. The dear comrade leader has taken it as an important principle to establish chuche in all sectors of cultural construction, to embody the party spirit, the working class spirit, and people-mindedness, and to correctly combine socialist content with national form, and wisely led their thorough implementation. With the implementation of the socialist education thesis the growing new generations have been prepared to become chuche-type communist human beings, a large unit of 1,730,000 intellectuals has been established, a grand flower garden of chuche-oriented literature and arts has been unfolded, and all of the people have become the creators and enjoyers of culture. This is the immoral achievement of our party in its struggle for reforming culture in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea. Through the course of struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea a brilliant victory has been achieved in the implementation of the cause for Army building, too. As a result of the implementation of the party's self-defending military line our People's Army has been further strengthened politically, ideologically, militarily, and technologically and has grown up to be an ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces capable of repelling any invasion by the enemies at one blow. As a result of the firm establishment of an all-people defending system we have come to have a firm military guarantee for the victory of the chuche revolutionary cause. The epochal changes and rapid development achieved in our country's socialist construction and national defense construction are mighty proof to the vitality of the dear comrade leader's historic work. Through the embodiment of the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style has been further strengthened and developed, its invincible might is being demonstrated, the generation of our revolution has firmly continued, and its prospect is endlessly bright. Indeed, the period of the past 20 years during which we have accelerated the work of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea along the road designated by the dear comrade leader is not only a period of 20 years of great change, but is also a period of the 20 years of creation and change which has brought a great golden age to chuche Korea by molding nature, society, and human beings. The period is also a period of the 20 years of victory during which we have sternly smashed all sorts of challenges by the imperialists and reactionaries and the counterrevolutionary maneuvers by the opportunists and, thus, resolutely safeguarded and defended and infinitely glorified the socialism of our own style. All victories and successes achieved in the course of struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea are a noble result of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's excellent and tested leadership. By elucidating the path for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea and by wisely leading the party and the popular masses into its realization the dear comrade leader has completely improved party work, that is, the party's ideological work, and effected a new revolutionary turn in all sectors of social life, including the economy and culture. Thanks to the farsighted wisdom and excellent leadership of the dear comrade leader, a great change has been effected in all sectors of politics, the economy, culture, and military, let alone party work. Thus, our revolution has been able to meet a period of new upsurge, and our party and people have been able to vigorously continue their advance along the path of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea even amid the formidable trials in history, full of faith in certain victory and without the slightest trepidation. Truly, the dear comrade leader's leadership is a source for the victory of our revolution and a firm guarantee for boundless prosperity and development in our fatherland. On this meaningful occasion today, with a sense of loyalty of all party and people in the entire country, I extend the highest honor and warmest thanks to the dear leader of our party and people Comrade Kim Chong-il, who, by carrying out outstanding ideological and theoretical activities and exercising energetic leadership, is endlessly developing and enriching the great chuche idea, the guiding idea of our era's revolution; victoriously leading the cause of imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea; and, thus, highly displaying our party's authority and the might of chuche Korea. Comrades: Our party and workers has advanced far while carrying out the cause of imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea. Still, the road toward completing the cause is arduous and turbulent, and we have many things to do. The imperialists and reactionaries are more viciously maneuvering to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our Republic and crush [apsal] our socialist cause, and the situation in our country is growing very tense. In compliance with today's situation in which we are building socialism amid tense confrontation with the enemy and in compliance with the demand of our revolution's development, we must thoroughly implement the revolutionary lines of self- dependence, self-support, and self-reliant defense and more vigorously carry out the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and culural. By so doing, we must resolutely defend and maintain popular masses-centered socialism of our own style and develop it endlessly, and realize the cause of the fatherland's reunification, the nation's earnest desire, at the earliest possible date. If we are to maintain socialism of our country and brilliantly realize the cause of imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea, we must cherish single-hearted loyalty deeper in our hearts and be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the dear comrade leader. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The entire party and all people must dutifully follow [chalbadduro nagaya] Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership if they are to maintain popular masses-centered socialism of our country and brilliantly complete the chuche revolutionary cause. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is our fatherland's destiny and our revolution's banner of invincibility, and loyally following the dear comrade leader's leadership is a decisive guarantee for completing the cause of imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea. All party members and workers must have the unchanging, firm belief that our revolution will win victory without fail as long as there is the dear comrade leader's leadership and must be loyal to the party's leadership single-heartedly. Important in possessing single-hearted loyalty with which we absolutely worship [sungbae] and follow the dear comrade leader is cherishing the greatness of the dear comrade leader deep in our hearts. We must walk along the single revolutionary road, cherishing deep in our hearts how great is the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the people's great leader [inminui widaehan yongdoja], an outstanding ideologist and theoretician and politician, and a distinguished [pibomhan] military strategist who has literary and military accomplishments and loyalty and devotion. Strongly arming ourselves with our party's ideas and thoroughly implementing those ideas is a prerequisite for loyally upholding the party's leadership and completing the chuche revolutionary cause. We must strongly arm ourselves with our party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, thoroughly implement the idea in all fields of revolution and construction, and wage an uncompromising struggle against toadyism [sadaejuui], doctrinism, revisionism, and all other antiparty, antirevolutionary ideological trends that run counter to our party's ideas. In this way, we must firmly defend the purity [sungyolsong] of the chuche idea. All party members and workers must make loyalty to the party as their faith, conscience, morality, and daily life and make it their absolute rule to think and move only in compliance with the party's ideas and intentions anytime, anywhere. If we, in hearty response to our party's leadership, are to successfully carry out the cause of imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea, we must more thoroughly establish the party's unified leadership system. All the party members and working people should accept the party's lines and policies as the most just ones and as the demand of life, and by unconditionally implementing them under any difficult conditions and environment, they should fulfill their fidelity and duty as revolutionary fighters sharing fate with the party. We should establish a firm revolutionary discipline in which the entire party membership, all the people, and the entire army move as one under the party's leadership, and should never tolerate any disciplineless and nonsocialist elements. In so doing, we should make sure to firmly establish the ethos that within our revolutionary rank, everyone breathes with the party, speaks in the voice of the party, and walks in step with the party. To victoriously advance and complete the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, we should continuously strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party and the revolutionary ranks. The wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses is the everlasting vitality of our-style socialism, and the backbone of our revolution. Our revolution has victoriously advanced overcoming extraordinarily arduous trials, and we are turning adversity into a smooth condition, adhering to and adding luster to socialism, in a grave environment where the imperialists' antisocialist offensive is intensified in an unprecedented manner. All this is attributable to the fact that our revolutionary ranks have formed a strong main force of the revolution wholeheartedly united around the leader. revolutionary ranks around the leader. We should taintlessly inherit the tradition of unity and cohesion created in the pioneering period of the Korean revolution, solidify the wholehearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks as firm as a rock, crush all sorts of challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries with the might of the wholehearted unity, and effect continuous upsurge in the revolution and construction. To successfully carry out the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, we should accelerate the socialist economic and cultural construction continuously and vigorously. As a present task, we should concentrate all our efforts for the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth the revolutionary economic strategy in the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth party Central Committee and in his New Year's address this year setting aside three years as an adjusting period in which to carry out the agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy. Dwelling in the party's revolutionary economic strategy is our party's firm resolve and will to momentously improve the people's living standard within a few years and to develop the country's economy into a chuche-oriented economy which does not shake under any economic blockade by the imperialists. We should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy in order to further strengthen the might of our-style socialism and highly display its superiority. To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we should highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. Under the present condition where the imperialists are further intensifying the maneuvers for economic blockade [kyongje pongsoe] to stifle [chilsik] our country's socialism, the way to vigorously accelerate socialist economic construction is to exert the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. Under the party's militant slogan "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist all-out march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude," all the party members and working people should dash forward vigorously with the spirit of the chollima plus the speed of the nineties and effect great upsurge in all sectors of the people's economy. We should actively struggle to achieve a new development in all areas of the socialist cultural construction -- including science, education, literature, art, and public health -- upholding the party policy on cultural revolution. We should constantly concentrate great efforts on increasing the national defense strength to cope with [taecho hayo] today's acute situation, in which the enemies are ceaselessly conducting war provocation maneuvers. We should completely implement the party's military line and make every preparation so as to actively cope with any emergency situation [ku otton puruiui chonghwangedo chudongjoguro matsolsu ittorok]. We should also thoroughly establish the ethos of army-people unity in the entire society so as for the people to value the military and for the army and the people to share their fates. The fatherland's reunification is the supreme national task [minjok chisangui kwaop] for our people that cannot be delayed any further. We will make every effort to achieve the unity of the whole nation and to reunify the country in a way of confederal system based on the three principles of independence, the peaceful reunification, and the great national unity, upholding the 10-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Fatherland presented by the great leader. Although imperialists are indulging in bravado and bluster on the international stage, talking about an end of socialism, no one can reverse the historical trend of the worldwide people's advance for independence. The struggle of our party and people to implement the cause of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea is a honorable and sacred struggle for our fatherland's endless growth and prosperity and for mankind's bright future, and it will vigorously encourage the progressive people of the world who are struggling to protect their independence. We should actively contribute to implementing the global cause of independence and fulfill our international duties [uriege matkyojin kukchejuuijok uimu] by vigorously pushing ahead with the struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea. Our people's struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea is arduous, but our cause will achieve the victory without fail. There is no force in the world that can block the sublime march of our people, who are fighting for the just cause under the leadership of the great leader and the great party. Let us all firmly unite ourselves around the party Central Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, and vigorously fight for the ultimate consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause, with faith in certain victory and revolutionary optimism, under the banner of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea. Long live Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people! Long live Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and people!
