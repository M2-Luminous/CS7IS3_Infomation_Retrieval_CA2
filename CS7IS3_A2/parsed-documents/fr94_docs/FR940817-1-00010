FR940817-1-00010 FR940817-1-00004 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 210, 239, 274 [Release No. 33&hyph;7081; IC&hyph;20472; S7&hyph;22&hyph;94] RIN 3235&hyph;AF94 Payment for Investment Company Services With Brokerage Commissions AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule and form amendments. SUMMARY: The Commission is proposing for comment rule and form amendments relating to the reporting of expenses by investment companies. The proposed amendments would require an investment company to reflect as expenses in its statement of operations certain liabilities of the company paid by broker-dealers in connection with the allocation of the company's brokerage transactions to the broker-dealers. The amendments would also require an investment company to include expenses paid in this manner in the fee table and financial highlights table appearing in the company's prospectus, and in calculating the company's yield. The amendments are designed to enhance the information provided to investors so that they may be better able to assess and compare investment company expenses and performance. DATES: Comments should be received on or before October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. All comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;22&hyph;94. All comments received will be available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric C. Freed, Senior Counsel, Office of Disclosure and Investment Adviser Regulation, (202) 942&hyph;0726, or Anthony Evangelista, Assistant Chief Accountant, (202) 942&hyph;0636, Division of Investment Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Securities and Exchange Commission today is proposing for comment: (1) Amendments to rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X [17 CFR 210.6&hyph;07]. (2) Amendments to Form N&hyph;1A [17 CFR 239.15A, 274.11A], Form N&hyph;2 [17 CFR 239.14, 274.11a&hyph;1], Form N&hyph;3 [17 CFR 239.17a, 274.11b], and Form N&hyph;4 [17 CFR 239.17b, 274.11c] under the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. ] (``1933 Act'') and the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;1 et seq. ] (``1940 Act''). Executive Summary The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X, the regulation setting forth form and content requirements for financial statements included in registration statements, proxy statements, annual reports, and shareholder reports under the various securities laws. The amendments would require a registered investment company (``fund'') to adjust the amount of expenses reflected in the statement of operations in its financial statements to include amounts the fund would have paid to its service providers had a broker-dealer or any affiliate of the broker-dealer not paid or agreed to pay those service providers on behalf of the fund in connection with the allocation of fund transactions to the broker-dealer. The Commission is also proposing amendments to various fund registration forms to require that the adjusted expenses be reflected in the fee table and financial highlights table included in fund prospectuses, in the yield quotation required in fund Statements of Additional Information, and, as a result, in yield quotations in fund advertisements and sales literature. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require that the financial highlights table disclose the average commission rate paid by the fund. I. Background Some investment companies recently have entered into arrangements under which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the cost of certain products or services provided to the investment company in exchange for fund brokerage (``brokerage/service arrangements''). Under a typical brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a fund's custodian fees or transfer agency fees and, in exchange, the fund agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The fund usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider, who is paid directly by the broker. 1 1 Brokerage/service arrangements are structurally similar to the more common research soft-dollar arrangements by which an investment adviser uses client commission dollars to obtain research services. In a research soft-dollar arrangement, however, the receipt of a benefit by an adviser through the use of its clients' commission dollars raises conflict of interest concerns addressed by the safe harbor provisions of section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``1934 Act''). These concerns generally are not raised by brokerage/service arrangements, which typically involve the use of a fund's commission dollars to obtain services that directly and exclusively benefit the fund. Nevertheless, a fund's investment adviser can benefit from these brokerage/service arrangements, particularly if a reduction in fund expenses affects the amount of any expense waiver or reimbursement by the adviser. The receipt by a fund's adviser of any direct or indirect economic benefit as the result of these arrangements would almost certainly violate section 17(e)(1) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;17(e)(1)], unless the benefit received fell within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e). By entering into a brokerage/service arrangement, a fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement of operations, fee table, and its expense ratio and can increase its reported yield. 2 This is because the costs paid on behalf of the fund by the broker are embedded in the brokerage commissions the fund pays. 3 Under current accounting treatment, brokerage commissions are reflected in the cost basis of the purchased securities or as a reduction of the proceeds from the sale of securities. 4 In substance, however, a brokerage/service arrangement involves a rebate on brokerage commissions which, if paid in cash to the fund, would not reduce fund expenses. 5 2 A fund is currently required to disclose in footnotes to its fee table, financial highlights table, and financial statements its participation in brokerage/service arrangements and the effect the arrangements may have on the level of brokerage commissions paid by the fund. To the extent practicable, a fund must also quantify in these footnotes the effect of brokerage/service arrangements on fund expenses. This footnote disclosure would no longer be necessary if the amendments are adopted. 3 The safe harbor provided by section 28(e) of the 1934 Act does not encompass soft dollar arrangements under which research services are acquired as a result of principal transactions, i.e., when a broker buys or sells securities for or from its own account. U.S. Department of Labor (pub. avail. July 25, 1990). Because, as discussed at note 1 supra and accompanying text, brokerage/service arrangements do not fall under the Section 28(e) safe harbor, a fund may use principal as well as agency transactions to accumulate credits with brokers for the payment of fund expenses. Therefore, references in this release to ``commissions'' or ``commission dollars'' rather than ``spreads'' or ``mark-ups'' are not intended to indicate otherwise. 4 See R. Kay & D. Searfoss, Handbook of Accounting and Auditing 12&hyph;18 (2d ed. 1989). 5 Cash rebates would reduce the cost basis of securities purchased or increase the proceeds from securities sold. As a result of the current accounting treatment of brokerage/service arrangements, investors may not be able to evaluate fully the expenses of a fund that pays for services with commission dollars and accurately compare expenses and yields among funds. This lack of comparability is particularly significant considering the wide use of fund expense data by investors. Brokerage/service arrangements may benefit funds (and their shareholders) by reducing overall fund costs and increasing total return, 6 particularly if lower commissions are not available to funds that do not enter into the arrangements. 7 The receipt of a net benefit by a fund does not, however, alter the substance of the services provided under these arrangements. The services provided are generally wholly distinct from the execution of securities transactions, and their reflection as capital costs can distort fund financial information. 8 6 The characterization of costs as expenses or capital items will not affect a fund's total return calculated in accordance with Commission standards. The formula for total return is based upon ``ending redeemable value''; expenses and capital costs are both inherent in this formula. See, e.g. , Item 22(b)(i) of Form N&hyph;1A. 7 Entering into a brokerage/service arrangement when lower commissions are available raises questions whether the fund is receiving best execution for its transactions. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 23170 (Apr. 23, 1986) [51 FR 16004 (Apr. 30, 1986)] (``Release 23170'') at Â§V (discussing best execution obligations of money managers in the context of section 28(e)). 8 The Commission believes that a fund's board of directors or trustees, in connection with its review of brokerage allocation policies, should be informed of the fund's brokerage/service arrangements and the effects of the arrangements on fund expenses and commission rates. The Commission, therefore, is proposing to amend its accounting rules to require that amounts the fund would have paid for services in the absence of brokerage/service arrangements be reflected as ``expenses'' in fund financial information and in fund performance data. II. Discussion A. Accounting for Expenses Paid From Brokerage Commissions 1. The Proposed Accounting Method The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X 9 to require that the amounts of the various expenses (such as custody fees, transfer agency fees, printing and legal fees, and other miscellaneous fees) listed in a fund's statement of operations be adjusted, or ``grossed-up,'' to include amounts paid with commission dollars. 10 The required adjustments to the statement of operations would be made at the time financial statements are prepared, and no daily expense accruals for services paid for with commission dollars would be required. No amounts in the financial statements other than expenses and the expense ratio would be required to be adjusted. 9 Article 6 of Regulation S&hyph;X specifies the contents of financial statements included in registration statements, proxy statements and shareholder reports of registered investment companies. Rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X sets forth the requirements for investment company statements of operations. 10 Rule 6&hyph;04(15) of Regulation S&hyph;X [17 CFR 210.6&hyph;04(15)] requires fund financial statements to disclose material contractual commitments. Contractual commitments covered by this rule include material commitments to allocate commission dollars for payment of fund expenses.
