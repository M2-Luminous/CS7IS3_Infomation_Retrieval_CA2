FR940926-0-00053 FR940926-0-00011 Historically, Ctenitis squamigera was recorded from above Waimea on Kauai (HHP 1992b3); Kaluanui, southeast of Kahana Bay, Pauoa, Nuuanu, Niu, and Wailupe in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1992b4 to 1992b5, 1992b9 to 1992b12); at Kaluaaha Valley on Molokai (HHP 1992b6); in the mountains near Koele on Lanai (HHP 1992b7); in the Honokohau Drainage on West Maui (HHP 1992b1); and at ``Kalua'' on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992b13). The seven populations that have been observed within the last 50 years are in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, Lanai, and East and West Maui. The two Waianae Mountain populations are in the East Makaleha/Kaawa area and at Schofield Barracks (HHP 1991, 1992b2; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). On Lanai, Ctenitis squamigera is known from the Waiapaa-Kapohaku area on the leeward side of the island, and Lopa Gulch and Waiopa Gulch on the windward side (HHP 1991). The West Maui population is in Iao Valley (Joel Lau, HHP, pers. comm., 1992). The East Maui population is at Manawainui Stream, 3.5 kilometers (km) (2.2 miles (mi)) north of Kaupo Village (HHP 1992b8). The seven populations are on State, Federal, and private land and total approximately 80 plants (J. Lau and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). This species is found in the understory of forests at elevations of 380 to 915 m (1,250 to 3,000 ft) (HHP 1991, 1992b8), in Òhià/ Diospyros (Lama) Mesic Forest and diverse mesic forest (HHP 1991). Associated plant taxa include Myrsine (kolea), Psychotria (kopiko), and Xylosma (maua) (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The primary threats to Ctenitis squamigera are habitat degradation by feral pigs ( Sus scrofa ), goats, and axis deer ( Axis axis ); competition with alien plant taxa; and stochastic extinction due to the small number of existing populations and individuals. Diplazium molokaiense was published by Winifred Robinson (1913) as a new name for the Hawaiian plants that had previously been referred to as the extra-Hawaiian species, Asplenium arboreum Willd., by Hillebrand (1888). Diplazium molokaiense , a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), has a short prostrate rhizome. The leaf stalks are 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) long and green or straw-colored. The frond is thin-textured, ovate-oblong, 15 to 50 cm (6 to 20 in) long and 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) wide, truncate at the base, and pinnate with a pinnatifid apex. The sori are 0.8 to 1.3 cm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long and lie alongside the side veins of the pinnae (Hillebrand 1888, Wagner and Wagner 1992). Diplazium molokaiense can be distinguished from other species of Diplazium in the Hawaiian Islands by a combination of characters, including venation pattern, the length and arrangement of the sori, frond shape, and the degree of dissection of the frond (Wagner and Wagner 1992). Historically, Diplazium molokaiense was found at Kaholuamano on Kauai (HHP 1992c7); Makaleha on Oahu (HHP 1992c3); Kalae, Kaluaaha, Mapulehu, and the Wailau Trail on Molokai (HHP 1992c5, 1992c11 to 1992c13); Mahana Valley and Kaiholena on Lanai (HHP 1992c8, 1992c9); and Wailuku (Iao) Valley and Waikapu on West Maui (HHP 1992c1, 1992c4). However, within the last 50 years, it has been recorded from only one location on Oahu and three on East Maui. The Oahu population is at Schofield Barracks in the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1992c2). The three Maui populations are on the slopes of Haleakala: Two populations on the north slope at Ainahou and Maliko Gulch (HHP 1992c6, 1992c10), and the third on the south slope at Waiopai Gulch (Robert Hobdy, Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife, and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992). The currently known populations of Diplazium molokaiense are between 850 and 1,680 m (2,800 and 5,500 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992c6, 1992c10) in lowland to montane habitats, including Montane Mesic Òhià/Koa Forest (R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). The four populations are on private, State, and Federal land and total 23 individuals (R. Hobdy and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). The primary threats to Diplazium molokaiense are habitat degradation by feral goats, cattle ( Bos taurus ), and pigs; competition with alien plant taxa; and stochastic extinction due to the extremely small number of populations and individuals. Cheilanthes lidgatei was described in 1883 on the basis of a specimen collected on Oahu. Hillebrand (1888) erected the genus Schizostege for this anomalous species. In 1897, it was placed in the genus Pteris by H. Christ, resulting in the currently accepted combination Pteris lidgatei (Wagner 1949). Pteris lidgatei , a member of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae), is a coarse herb, 0.5 to 1 m (1.6 to 3.3 ft) tall. It has a horizontal rhizome 1.5 cm (0.6 in) thick and at least 10 cm (3.9 in) long when mature. The fronds, including the leaf stalks, are 60 to 95 cm (24 to 37 in) long and 20 to 45 cm (8 to 18 in) wide. The leafy portion of the frond is oblong-deltoid to broadly ovate-deltoid, thick, brittle, and dark gray-green. The sori are apparently marginal in position, either fused into long linear sori, or more typically separated into distinct shorter sori, with intermediate conditions being common (Wagner 1949). Pteris lidgatei can be distinguished from other species of Pteris in the Hawaiian Islands by the texture of its fronds and the tendency of the sori along the leaf margins to be broken into short segments instead of being fused into continuous marginal sori (Wagner and Wagner 1992).
