[Begin Garcia recording] The counterinsurgency operations of the 13th Army Brigade's special forces are being coordinated at Huasca military base. These forces are seeking out FARC's 53 group, which occupied Gachala a few hours ago. Official sources reported that the insurgents dynamited four facilities, the Agrarian Fund, and some banks. So far, one policeman is reported dead. This newswoman was unable to reach Gachala because, in addition to the rebels' activities, the place is isolated as the result of a landslide on the road leading to the town. Counterinsurgency reinforcements continue to be dispatched to the area by air. The 13th Brigade commander, General Norberto Agra, is coordinating operations from Santa Fe de Bogota. [end recording]
