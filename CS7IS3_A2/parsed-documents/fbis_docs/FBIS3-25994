He pointed out: Speeding up economic development is a basic task of ethnic affairs during the new period. Experiences prove that differences among people of various nationalities and problems in minority areas must eventually be resolved through economic development. When the economy has developed, the strengths of the socialist system can be brought into full play, people of all nationalities will love the CPC and the motherland even more, and they will become even more aware of the need to safeguard the unification of our motherland and the solidarity among people of all nationalities. He pointed out: People of all nationalities should respect, trust, support, emulate, and understand each other. We should breathe the same breath, and share the same destiny; and our hearts should be linked. Only by so doing can our cause prosper and become invincible. To achieve solidarity among people of all nationalities, the key lies in the solidarity among cadres, especially leading cadres, at all levels. We must rally and count on cadres and the masses at all levels to wage a justifiable fight against the national separatists' conspiracies, giving full scope to the role of people's dictatorship. For hostile elements engaging in separatist activities, in promoting unrest [gao dong luan], and in opposing the party and socialism, we must exercise dictatorship on them. By no means should we be lenient on them.
