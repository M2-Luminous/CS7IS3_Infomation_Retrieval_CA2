At the same time, the EZLN, in another document sent to the media, asks journalists to be "patient" regarding the beginning of the peace dialogue. Regarding the peace dialogue, the EZLN argues that the delay is due to details over "security for our delegates" and not due to "disagreements in the agenda." The EZLN believes that "most" Chiapas mayors "are the product of electoral fraud, the trampling of the popular will." In this document, dated 8 February and addressed to the Civic Front of Mapastepec, the rebels state that "municipal councils chosen democratically by the people" should fill the mayor posts that are left vacant. In the past days, the civilian population has seized five mayors' offices in Chiapas to demand the dismissal of the mayors, who are all members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, and whom people accused of mismanagement. The offices seized include those in Cacahoatan, Huehuetan, Teopisca, Tuzantan, and Mapastepec. According to witnesses, the police on 10 February eliminated the blockade of the Mapastepec municipal palace with tear gas and shots, leaving a total of 15 injured. Before the police intervened, residents partially burned the mayor's office in order to protest that their demands were not heeded.
