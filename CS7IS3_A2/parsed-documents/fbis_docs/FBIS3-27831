Kuriyama, who is back in Japan temporarily, made the remark in discussions with Hosokawa in advance of the prime minister's summit talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington. Economic issues such as easier U.S. access to Japanese Government procurement orders as well as to the auto and insurance markets are expected to be high on the summit agenda. Kuriyama, however, was quoted as saying Washington has a good impression of the cabinet of Hosokawa. Hosokawa staked his political fate on a controversial package of political reform bills which cleared the Diet on Saturday. The four bills introduce major changes in the electoral system for the House of Representatives and tighten controls over political donations to politicians. In a related development, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday in an attempt to break the deadlock in the bilateral talks prior to the summit talks. Hosokawa will leave for the United States on Thursday night and return home Sunday after his meeting with Clinton.
