According to Gjorgi Icev, financial director of the enterprise Izvorski, which with 24 hectares covered with plants is the biggest agricultural exporter in the region, their business is in a tragicomic situation: "We used to obtain the fuel for heating the plants and all the pesticides through Greece, but now it all has to travel here through Bulgaria as well." The embargo that Greece decided on for extremely questionable political reasons is having destructive consequences for the Macedonian economy. The country was already seriously weakened because of the sanctions against Serbia, which at one time was its most important trading partner, and also because of the harsh requirements of a stabilization program under the supervision of the IMF; now everything is even more difficult. The Macedonians estimate that every month the blockade is costing them approximately $80 million, which includes both lost exports and the higher transportation costs for shipping goods through the Black Sea entrance to Bulgarian Burgas and Albanian Durres. Only a few Macedonian exporters were as far-sighted as Izvorski, which compensated for the lost "Greek route" in time through a joint company with a certain Austrian commercial enterprises, which will take this year's early vegetables, worth 10 million German marks [DM] to the markets of Eastern and Central Europe by air. On the other hand, heavy industry is literally collapsing; a few days ago the Skopje state steelworks finally closed its doors and dismissed 8,000 workers; something similar is in the outlook quite soon for the other state enterprises, which were dependent upon the railroad link with the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. After Macedonia's GNP declined by 15 percent in 1993, it is expected to drop another 8 percent this year. Last year the annual income per capita was $700, and inflation is ranging around 70 percent. In spite of everything, the Skopje government does not intend to give in, since it does not have any guarantee that Greece will not resume the blockade again even after its demands are met. According to some estimates, Macedonia only has oil reserves in its warehouses for another two months, and during that period it will attempt somehow to acquire the necessary funds ($120 million) to build a 65-kilometer-long railroad link with Bulgaria, from which it would obtain crude oil for the Skopje refinery. According to the latest news, oil is already coming into the country by road from Albania, and Macedonia thinks that it could bring 7,500 metric tons of black gold a day from Durres.
