It is not ruled out, Navumchyk stated, that in the event of Paznyak's victory in the presidential elections Henadz Karpenka will be appointed prime minister. The joining of Paznyak's team by this politician, in Navumchyk's opinion, is helpful in three ways: First, such a political personality would do credit to any democratic organization; this will also be helpful to the state in general. Second, this is an important step in unifying democratic forces in Belarus. Finally, Karpenka has good connections in Russia's political circles, which is also of great importance.
