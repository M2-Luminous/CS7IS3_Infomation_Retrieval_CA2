What was surprising was that the "views" of both candidates Murayama and Ito were drafted by the ultraleft wing. The characteristic of the recent election of the SDPJ chairman was the fact that the direction of the executive branch shifted from the moderate/ultraleft wing faction of Makoto Tanabe (Japan Postal Workers' Union centrist faction), Sadao Yamahana (ditto moderate left-wing faction) and Wataru Kubo (Nikkyoso [Japan Teachers' Union] moderate right-wing faction) to the left-/ultraleft-wing faction, which is backed by the Jichiro [All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union]. It means that the struggle between the centrist faction and the left-wing faction over the political direction within the Kankoro [National Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions], which forms the core of the SDPJ-Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions of Japan] alignment, has ended in victory for the left-wing faction. Under the Murayama aegis, the SDPJ will ostensibly maintain party solidarity while placing itself within the coalition government in the area of domestic politics, but in reality will shift to control by the left wing. This is illustrated by the withdrawal from the candidacy for party chairman by Wataru Kubo, who represents the moderate left wing, followed by the candidacy of Masatoshi Ito of the extreme left and Tomiichi Murayama of the left wing and also by the victory process by Murayama as chairman. In order to quickly understand this, let us look at the backgrounds of the candidates. Masatoshi Ito (upper house proportional representative, elected once) is an anti-U.S. base activist and a member of the "National Network To Revitalize the Pro-Constitution SDPJ" [the "Network"]. His electorate consists of the Tokenkyo [National Liaison Council for the Study of Party Construction], a party organization of local activists, and the "Network," an extraparty citizens' organization. Both organizations are controlled by the party's extreme left-wing faction, which is oriented toward a united SDPJ-Communist front and forms the Heiwa Senryaku Ken [Peace Strategy Study Group] led by Akira Iwai (former Sohyo chairman). The Tokenkyo was formed in late 1980 with the Zenrokyo [National Council of Trade Unions]--the national center of the ultraleft opposition to the Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions]--as its base. On 4 Sepember [1993] at the general meeting held at the Jichiro Kaikan Building in Tokyo, it submitted a request to Sukio Iwatare (affiliated with the Peace Strategy Study Group) to run for party chairman, and Torao Takasawa and Tetsu Ueda were among those who called for a signature movement in support of the request. (If Takasawa had won in the previous general election, he probably would have been asked to run for chairman.) Ito Candidacy a Display of Power by the Ultraleft The policies set forth at the general election were as follows: 1. In order to revitalize the pro-Constitution party, to make all-out efforts for the victory of a candidate for chairman who opposes the continued single-seat constituencies with a proportional representation system. 2. To reaffirm the importance of preventing a single-seat constituency proportional system rather than remain as a minister in the Hosokawa cabinet. 3. To reaffirm the maintenance of the party's key policies concerning the security treaty, the Self-Defense Forces, and nuclear power development. To formulate conditions for the recovery of Diet seats in order to realize the party's policies in the coalition government. 4. To create a citizens' movement through the party's subsidiary structure and the "Network" toward revitalization of the pro-Constitution party. The "Network" may be viewed as a reorganized version of the existent "Group To Protect the Constitution" generally known for its extreme-left nature and was formed to seek further expansion. Although such "lone-wolf politicians" as Shizuo Wada (party vice chairman), Tetsu Wada, and Kazuo Saito of the former Ota Society and the Labor-Farmer Party make up the core that stands out in front, the matrix is formed by the Tokenkyo and the Peace Strategy Study Group led by Akira Iwai and Iwatare. In the recent election, Tetsu Wada served as Ito's chief secretary for election policy. Immediately prior to the 9 September [1993] deadline for chairman candidacy, Ito replaced Iwatare as a candidate. Iwatare withdrew his candidacy on condition that Murayam accept the Tokenkyo's policy. Murayama promised that he will "study it and do his best." Ito's purpose was to consolidate the "Network" organization through the election, expand it, gather as many votes as possible to manifest the power of the "ultraleft" and to apply pressure on future party operations. Tomiichi Murayama (lower house, Oita 1st district, seven election wins) -- His colorful electorate ranges from the Peace Strategy Study Group to the centrist "Social Democratic Forum" and a portion of the Suiyokai, in addition to a united SDPJ-Communist front-oriented ideological group, the anti-Tanabe faction and the anti-single seat constituency faction. The Peace Strategy Study Group consists of members of the party secretariat affiliated with the group, centering on Yutaka Shitoma, Osamu Yatabe, and Sukio Iwatare. Although it was not generally known, they controlled the nuclei of the election policy headquarters of both Murayama and Ito and drafted the "views" of both candidates. Secretariat Cold-Shoulders Yamahana Next is the "Society To Promote True Political Reform" [Shino seiji kaikaku o susumeru kai] ("Promotion Society") formed by members of the anti-Tanabe and anti-single seat constituency factions. The principal members are: the Suiyokai (Tsuruo Yamaguchi, Toshi Oide, and Tadatoshi Akiba); former and present members of the Social Democratic Forum (Koken Nosaka, Sekisuke Nakanishi, Seiko Kitasawa, Mankichi Kato); the "Creative Society" [Tsukuru kai] (Yamahana faction) (Reijiro Sawafuji); the former Ishibashi-Hori faction (Hideyuki Maeshima, Masaru Hayakawa); and the Sangatsukai "March Society," ultraleft faction (Yasuo Yamashita). In particular, Yamashita, former secretary to Tetsu Ueda, actively assisted Murayama's preparations for the recent election. The "Promotion Society" requested Chairman Yamahana to 1) immediately stop corporate contributions, 2) lower party subsidies to 250 yen per constituent, and 3) prevent a conservative two-party system and maintain the SDPJ's identity through a multiparty system. Its strategy was not to display its opposition to the single-seat constituency system, but to push for "an immediate stop to corporate contributions" and to conform with the Communist Party's contentions and simultaneously crush the single-seat constituency system. In addition to Mankichi Kato who formally switched from the "Social Democratic Forum" to the "Promotion Society," the majority in the "forum" supported Murayama. It was based mainly on anti-Tanabe sentiment. In the "Creative Society" also, half of the Diet members including Yuzuru Shimasaki are Murayama supporters. As for the party secretariat, the members refused to act in support of Yamahana's election even after his announcemnt to run. Backed thus by the the extreme left and left wing as well as a portion of the centrist faction, Murayama followers constituted a majority, and it turned into a de facto defeat for the Tanabe-Yamahana line--i.e. the pro-coalition, pro-political-structuring faction. In form, because Murayama accepted the coalition administration and upheld the single-seat constituency system, Kubo withdraw his candidacy, but the reality was quite different. The Murayama clique follows the tradition of the Narita-Asukata-Ishibashi-Doi line. In other words, while ostensibly setting up a chairman from of an independent left-wing faction, in reality the intraparty left wing--in particular, the extreme left wing--holds the cards, and is bent on "purifying" the SDPJ into a scientific socialist (Marxist-Leninist) party. Rush Toward Obstructing the Coalition Administration The party right wing, including the Zendentsu [All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union] has already become little more than a name since the chairmanship election, while the Kankoro moderate right wing centering on Tanabe and the Zentei [Japan Postal Workers' Union] is already rapidly weakening. The group's future fate will depend on whether Wataru Kubo is able at the party convention on 25 Sepember to place Masao Sakon, a member of the Suiyokai's right wing and the faction behind the coalition administration, to the post of secretary general. If he should fail, the SDPJ will eventually rush toward opposition against the coalition administration and defeat of the single-seat constituency system under a complete left-wing leadership, and no one will be able to stop it. In any case, under the Murayama organization, the alienation between the SDPJ and the coalition government, and between the Rengo, will inevitably widen. Particularly the Rengo's new direction, pushed by the eight left-wing independent industrial unions, will solidify along the Jinnosuke Ashida (chairman of Zensen Domei [Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment, Chemical, Distributive & Allied Industry Workers' Unions] and Etsuya Washio (chairman of Tekko Roren [Japanese Federation of Iron & Steel Workers' Unions] line. If present Chairman Yamagishi should retire, the trend would further accelerate, and there is the danger that, while the Kankoro faction within the Rengo will approach closer to the Zenrokyo [National Council of Trade Unions], the Rengo mainstream's detachment from politics will increase. For the time being, the focus will be on attitude of the some 20 members of the "Promotion Society" and the members of the Peace Strategy Study Group regarding the single-seat constituency system under the Murayama reign.
