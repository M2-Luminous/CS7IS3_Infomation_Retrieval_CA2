Ciskei Civil Servants Association (Cisa) Secretary General Mthimkhulu Mashiya said on Friday [11 March] that although there was dissatisfaction about pensions and related matters, civil servants had hoped their fears would be addressed by military ruler Brig Oupa Gqozo. Mr Mashiya criticised Brig Gqozo, however, saying the Ciskei leader had found time to address his soldiers, but not the civil servants.
