FBIS4-27281 "dreas105_a_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Finance Ministry Announces Foreign Reserves Record Finance Ministry Announces Foreign Reserves Record OW0106083994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0814 GMT 1 Jun 94 OW0106083994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange reserves rose 2.34 billion dollars in May from April to hit a record for the third month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday [1 June]. The rise to a month-end balance of 106.91 billion dollars indicates continued yen-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan to stem the Japanese currency's rise against the U.S. dollar. The May rise was the seventh consecutive monthly increase, the ministry said. Foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, gold and International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights. A ministry official, as usual, declined comment on the reasons for the change in the foreign exchange reserve balance in releasing the figures. Market players watch fluctuations for evidence of intervention by the central bank, which dealers said continued during May. The official declined to cite any factors besides such interventions that would have affected the foreign reserve balance during the month. The dollar started the month of Tokyo trading at 101.80 yen on May 2 and hit its monthly low that day at 101.48 yen, the official said. The dollar was approaching its postwar record lows that day, which preceded three days of Japanese national holidays. During the holidays, the U.S. Federal Reserve led a concerted intervention with some 16 other central banks to prop up the dollar. Dealers cited repeated dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan during the month in addition to the fed intervention, which was confirmed by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The ministry official said the dollar peaked for the month on May 16 at 105.15 yen, for a range of 3.67 yen for the month, and ended May trading at 104.38 yen Tuesday. According to the most recent comparable figures available, Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves with a total at the end of March of 101.7 billion yen, he said. Germany and Taiwan each had 84.8 billion dollars, but Taiwan's most recent figures are from January. No. 4 was the United States at 78.7 billion dollars, followed by Spain at 42.5 billion dollars, the official said.
