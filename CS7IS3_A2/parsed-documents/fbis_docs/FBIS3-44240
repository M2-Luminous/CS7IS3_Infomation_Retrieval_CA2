This state of affairs has given rise to protests these days by members of the National Association of Zaire Enterprises [ANEZA). Over to you, Kalinda Molonu: [Molonu] For businessmen, FIDA's measure is causing sheer anarchy because the fixing of the official exchange rate, they argue, is only within the competence of the Central Bank. It is illegal for any public service to fix the foreign exchange rate for its charges outside the official rate fixed by the Central Bank and the commercial banks. In a note to FIDA regional directors, the headquarters of this state public company explained that its decision was made in view of the very big loss incurred by the public treasury in implementing the Bank of Zaire's official exchange rate. ANEZA feels that the more than 150 percent increase in the exchange rate decided by FIDA will cause a more than 150 percent increase in the prices of basic commodities, as well as total confusion in the exchange market because businessmen will no longer know which rate to refer to in their export transactions.
