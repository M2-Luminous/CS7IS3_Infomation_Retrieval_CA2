FBIS4-846 "drafr074_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 17 Apr South African Press Review for 17 Apr MB1704101794 MB1704101794 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Liberal Democracy -- South Africa "has now joined the nations where political choice is a matter of of weighing freedom against welfare, the efficiencies of the market against the bureaucracy of government, liberty against order" or "crudely put, how much government, how much freedom," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TINES in English on 17 April on page 34 notes. THE ANC "has tried to define the future" putting forward a "comprehensive `plan' for reconstruction and development" which is "attractively populist, showing a sincere concern for needs of deprived and relatively helpless communities," but "it perceives solutions not in the disorderly process of a free society, but only in the coercive interventions of government." "To its left is the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], mired in primitive socialism and driven by an anger that is deeply racist" and the SACP [South African Communist Party], intent on "dragging the ANC and the country leftwards and backwards." President de Klerk wears his new "liberal democracy" clothes "uncomfortably and his party is simply bewildered by the change." The Democratic Party, DP, "does at least understand the principles of liberal democracy, but it has fallen on hard times." The Federal Party is considered "a lobby rather than a political movement." "A vote for any of these would serve to strengthen opposition to the ANC, but only the DP -- given fresh leadership -- can possibly form the base around which a liberal-democratic alternative must, sooner or later, consolidate. To change leaders is easy, but to create a new institution to serve as the vehicle of liberal-democratic values would be the work of a generation." SUNDAY NATION Inkatha Defiance -- As "past experiences gained during Inkatha demonstrations" have shown "we ought to be concerned about the safety of those that will chose not to heed the stayaway call" and to prevent violence "serious measures" have to be taken, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 17 April on page 6. "The marches cannot be allowed to go ahead in the Witwatersrand at least" because "several areas have been declared as unrest areas." "We expect the security forces to be out in full force to enforce the law by preventing unlawful marches from taking place, take action against any transgressors and protect all those wishing to go about their day-to-day business. Those intending to defy the ban and unrest regulations against the carrying of dangerous weapons should be prevented from leaving their hostels." "The police also need to show their capacity and will to enforce the law, as what we might see this week, could be a rehersal of what we are likely to see next week when millions of people are supposed to go to the polls." Rightwing Sabotage -- "The SA Police Union (SAPU) has threatened to disrupt the elections and refuse to perform election protection duties" unless salary demands are met, the second editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION on 17 April notes. "Clearly, this threat is nothing but the pursuance of a well-known rightwing agenda to sabotage the forthcoming election." The South African Police campaign against the National Peacekeeping Force, NPKF, since the NPKF "started training," "is something Law and Order Minister Hermus Kriel should be ashamed of." RAPPORT Inkatha Youth March -- The Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 17 April cautions in a page-18 editorial: "Even in the confusion of the final days of transition to a new dispensation two wrong actions do not make a right. The fact that the police failed to thoroughly search the ANC's headquarters at Shell House in Johannesburg after the massacre of Zulus was totally at odds with the generally held view of the authority of the law." "But the march planned by the Inkatha Freedom Party Youth Brigade to the -- to them -- hated ANC headquarters is equally ill-considered and wrong. By marching in their thousands through the streets of the country's financial capital they are not only challenging the law. They are exposing innocent lives to danger and playing with the kind of fire which makes even the most peace-loving and law-abiding citizens shudder. Not to mention a week's mass action. The IFP youth may argue that in the ANC they have outstanding teachers for this kind of action. After all, the ANC and its allies conducted strikes, marched, and demonstrated -- and then patted themselves on the back over the sucess of this kind of action, ignoring the cost to the country." "The public shakes its head at the futile attempts to maintain law and order by the people involved in the Peace Accord and by the police. Through their office windows in the city center they have actually seen bodies being carried past, and now they look with suspicion at what they perceive to be a cover-up of what actually happened. Even at this late stage the guilty, regardless of who, what and of whatever political conviction they might be, must be brought to justice by the guardians of the law. In this they must have the full coooperation of all parties, and all doors open to them. Fast. Because if that does not happen, the next error, worse than the first, will take place, namely, people beginning to march, and continuing to march through and after the election, out of a feeling of injustice and revenge. With all the accompanying dangers for the future." Moderates Must Show More Muscle in Election -- In his "Actuality" column on page 18 of RAPPORT, Izak de Villiers writes: "When South Africa became a republic in the sixties, the English-language press referred to the `silly season.' If that period was silly, the present one is certifiable." "After the De Klerk-Mandela debate this week, the names of the parties which will contest the election rolled across the television screen: Trotskiites, black racists, old-world socialists, liberal democrats. Names which did not appear were those of the communists sailing under ANC banner, the Inkatha Freedom Party...and the Conservative Party..." "Will an election be able to satisfy all these participants and nonparticipants? That is the question facing a dazed electorate which must make their crosses in little more than a week." To keep things together "will demand more than a handshake from Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk. It needs statesmanship, wisdom, and realistic planning. For decades the world's successful countries have not been faced with choices across such a broad political spectrum." "These days if a politicl party wants to become the government of a couuntry it must walk the middle of the road and look after all its people, but must also be committed squarely to the proven ways of democracy and the free market." "During the past few weeks international impatience has been clearly evident. In particular, after the happenings in Bophuthatswana, the massacre of IFP members at Shell House in Johannesburg, and the struggle to get Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi involved in a constitutional settlement, there has been growing skepticism towards the ANC and its authoritarian lust for power and flirtation with socialistic dinasaur politics. Prominent overseas newspapers which used to be in the front ranks against apartheid have been critical." RAPPORT warns that "Western opinion makers will give an ANC-dominated government very little time to prove its good sense or stupidity. And only one test will be set: to what degree does the new regime satisfy the recipe that works, particularly with regard to the economy and human rights." "That is why moderate voters have such a tremendous responsibility to form an effective counter to the ANC in a new parliament. Should the ANC and its communist and socialist allies opt for all kinds of wild and ill-considered courses, there must be sufficient muscle to pull them back sharply in their tracks."
