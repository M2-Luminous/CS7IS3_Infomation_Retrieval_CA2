The British veto against Jean-Luc Dehaene probably hurts the Belgian prime minister less than anyone. The whole affair caused acerbic reactions in the Netherlands where they threaten to have an impact on public opinion regarding the whole question of European unification, enthusiasm for which has already cooled in recent years, as evident in the low turnout for the European elections. Dehaene cannot withdraw after 11 countries, some more spontaneously than others, have supported his candidacy. Major, on the other hand, has committed himself so strongly that it is impossible for him to agree to the appointment of Dehaene without loss of face. The question as to who will or will not be considered as Delors' successor will now be the subject of a great deal of string pulling, especially behind the scenes. We have seen how these things work. In the meantime, we cannot avoid drawing a number of conclusions. Prime Minister Major is seeing a constant crumbling of his own authority and of his parliamentary majority. His leadership of the Conservative Party is being openly questioned. Since Maastricht, it has become increasingly clear that he is the prisoner of a relatively small, but vociferous and determined group of Euroskeptics who are constantly threatening to bring him down. This group's hold is becoming stronger as Major's position becomes weaker. The worst of it is that the group is gradually getting the whole of Europe in its grip by hindering the decisionmaking process. London could more or less correctly claim that France and Germany sought to impose their candidate on the other European Union (EU) countries. But how can one defend the fact that one country can oppose the will of 11 other countries? Not just once, in the Dehaene affair, but on countless occasions. The position is in fact that British interests, or rather the interests of the British prime minister and his government, weigh heavier than those of the whole of Europe. In such a situation, Major should have the courage to give up EU full membership, as France did under De Gaulle in the case of NATO membership when it failed to correspond to the basic philosophy of the alliance. With the opt-outs in the Maastricht Treaty, he has in fact already gone down this road without admitting so in public. He would do better to formalize the British position. If he does not do so, the other EU countries must demand that he does. German Chancellor Kohl will be faced with a difficult issue right from the start of his European presidency on 1 July. In a year which will decide his political future at the parliamentary elections in the spring, Kohl has to find a way out which cannot be interpreted as a sign of his own weakness or a victory by British Prime Minister Major. Kohl is rightly aiming at a solution before the first meeting of the recently elected European Parliament (EP) on 19 July. The EP would certainly feel the failure of the government leaders to elect the EC president as an attack on one of its most recently acquired major competences, namely the granting of confidence in the EC. It would threaten the essential good working relationship between the political EU institutions right from the outset. The idea for the European Commissioner to be elected by the EP if necessary then becomes more attractive. Such a proposal was already circulating at the time of the Maastricht negotiations. Under the present "constitutional" relationships in the Union, this is impossible. But it should be a subject for the intergovernmental conference on the review of Maastricht in 1996.
