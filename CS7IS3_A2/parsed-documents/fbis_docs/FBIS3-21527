It was the place where the history of Russia's military space forces started in 1955, though they developed into an independent structure much later, at the beginning of the 1980's. The jurisdiction of the military space forces, if one can call it that, covers the cosmodromes of Baykonur, in Kazakhstan, and Plesetsk, which is in the Arkhangelsk oblast, as well as the main center of the control and telemetry complex in Golitsino in the Moscow countryside, and the tracking stations situated across the country from the western borders to Kamchatka. [Begin recording] Valeriy Grin, chief of the headquarters of the main center of the control and telemetry complex: It is our duty to ensure that our military and political leadership is warned of the preparation for a possible aggression or war by -- well, it is not the fashion now to call them a probable enemy, but that does not matter, it is our duty to do this. Galkin: Well, the spy satellites, are they your business? Grin: It is the the state's duty to ensure its security, including by means of intelligence work in all spheres, both on the ground and in the air, and in space as well. Galkin: So you manage these spheres [words indistinct] as well? Grin: Like any other power. Look at the United States, and certainly China. Galkin: One can speak about this openly now. All the space launches, from the first sputnik to the international teams, were done by the military. I remember with shame how we made the officers and soldiers change their clothes because of the censorship. How whole episodes were cut out of programs if a service cap was glimpsed in the background. And that was at a time when all the world knew that the military were participating in the Soviet space programs. Today the military space forces have dropped the masquerade, thank God. But by no means does this mean that there are no longer any real secrets here. Of course there are, and as usual they are being well guarded. The highest qualifications are needed to manage space. One cannot achieve them in one or two years. That is one of the main problems of the military space forces today. According to the present rules officers are transferred to the reserve the same as in line units, at the age of 45-50. But a mathematician, a ballistics expert, or a programmer is at the height of his professional skill at that age. How can this unique system, which so far acknowledges no state borders and is resistant to any hindrance except a political one, be preserved? The staff problems are, of course, a difficult thing, but they can, one hopes, can be surmounted. The cutting of funding for space programs, however, is already being felt in carrying out economic and military tasks. Unfortunately, our history is full of cases where small economies led us to lose on important things later. Space systems should not become hostage to the ruble and society's disdainful attitude to them. Galkin: Which arms of service will be the first to disappear in the future and which ones will remain to the end, so to speak? Grin: Well, I find it difficult to say which ones will disappear first, but I know that military space forces will remain to the end. [end recording] Galkin: Yes, times have changed. We have stopped viewing the world through a vision slit. We are viewed now without the previous suspicion. But it is premature and even dangerous to say that there is no need for the army.
