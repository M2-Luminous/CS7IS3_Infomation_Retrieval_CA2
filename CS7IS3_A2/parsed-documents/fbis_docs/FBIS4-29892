Yong Roi, told managing director of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), 'Ali Larijani on Tuesday that the U.S. has private goals behind its avowed concern about nuclear proliferation, and that it exploits the U.N. as a platform for pressuring Pyongyang, and also pulls its strings in the International Atomic Energy Organization in order to make things needlessly difficult for DPRK. He said DPRK is interested in talks with South Korea and that already many meetings have been held between the officials of the two Koreas. Larijani said the Islamic Republic of Iran has valued its friendly relations with DPRK which, he said, is obviously annoying to the United States. He said Iran would all the same continue to support the anti-imperialist position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
