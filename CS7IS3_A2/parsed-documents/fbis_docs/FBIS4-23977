"The only legal and legitimate transitional government remains the one that is led and should be led by the prime minister who was democratically elected at the national conference and confirmed by the political class to which the head of state does not belong, in accordance with Article 78 of the transition constitutional act," the radical opposition pointed out in a communique published by the opposition media. Mr. Tshisekedi's supporters feel that he is the only one who was mandated by the radical opposition grouped under the umbrella of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR]. However, the moderate faction of USOR, led by the Union for the Republic and Democracy [URD], does not share this opinion. The URD presented three candidates, including Kengo Wa Dondo, for the post of prime minister. These divergent views caused a split within the USOR, characterized by the exclusion of political parties and personalities from the union. The USOR is currently divided into two factions -- a moderate one represented by the URD and a "hardline" one led mainly by Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress.
