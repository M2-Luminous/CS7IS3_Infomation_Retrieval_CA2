FBIS4-1856 "drchi064_u_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 PRC MEDIA ON TAIWAN AFFAIRS Failure of Beijing-Taipei Talks Examined Failure of Beijing-Taipei Talks Examined Beijing Radio Views Talks OW0304122994 Beijing Central People's Radio in Mandarin to Taiwan 2200 GMT 1 Apr 94 OW0304122994 Beijing Central People's Radio Mandarin BFN [Commentary by station reporter Liao Xuefeng: "Based on Sincerity and Keeping the Words"; from the "News and Current Events" program] [Text] The fourth round of working-level talks between the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], which ended in Beijing recently, did not produce the expected results. In this connection, our station reporter Liao Xuefeng has written the following commentary: "Based on Sincerity and Keeping the Words." The latest round of talks between the two organizations failed to make progress largely because prior to the talks, the Taiwan side had partially reneged on the common understanding reached between officials of the two organizations in Beijing last February. During the talks, SEF further raised questions which expanded or narrowed (?the scope of understanding). This is indeed regrettable. As is known, the three topics, including repatriation of those who have entered the areas of the other side in violation of relevant regulations and other relevant issues, discussed at the latest round of working-level talks between the two organization are issues of deep concern to the masses on the two sides of the strait. Both the mainland's ARATS and Taiwan's SEF agree that these issues, which have inconvenienced the two sides for a long time, should be settled as soon as possible. For this reason, the two sides should respect and trust each other and hold talks on an equal footing so as to reach an early settlement, eliminate the inconvenience, and enhance cross-strait friendship. If these issues remain unsolved for a long time, they will affect the vital interests of the people on both sides of the strait, as well as cross-strait relations. This is absolutely not a wise man's action. To achieve positive results from talks, the two sides should first agree on two major points: first, it is necessary to separate political from routine issues so as to foster (?consensus); and second, it is necessary to value the common understanding and strictly carry out the promises reached during the previous rounds of talks. It is a fact that currently the two sides of the strait practice different social systems and follow different political ideologies. However, this should not become an obstacle to the settlement of routine issues. If one side insists on mixing political ideologies with routine issues, even a simple matter can become complicated and can encounter mounting difficulties in the process of settlement. (?Therefore), the willingness to separate political ideologies from routine matters has become the yardstick for measuring one's sincerity of settling issues. Moreover, it was a very remarkable feat that the two sides of the strait, which had been separated, got together to discuss common problems and reached rare understanding on some aspects. We should cherish the fruitful results of talks by respecting each other. As the saying goes, a gentleman attaches great importance to promises and keeps his word. ARATS-SEF talks are high-level contacts and negotiations between the two sides' nongovernmental organizations. They have conducted the negotiations in a serious manner and have reached an earnest common understanding. In a sense, the common understanding is a kind of promise that must be kept by both sides. For this reason, one should not make accusation as one pleases and should not renege on the understanding rashly. (?In fact), during the final-day discussion between the two organizations, Mr. Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu], SEF deputy secretary general, suggested that the next round of working-level talks be arranged in Taibei [Taipei] as soon as possible, thereby showing in a certain way the Taiwan side's sincerity and determination to settle problems. We express our appreciation toward his suggestion. Meanwhile, we hope that the next round of working-level talks will be based on the common understanding reached between officials of the two organizations in Beijing last February; will be conducted in the spirit of avoiding political issues, discussing matters as they stand, solving first easy and then difficult issues, and seeking common ground while reserving differences; and will see that promises are kept with sincerity to achieve fruitful results and that no side issues crop up to complicate matters.
