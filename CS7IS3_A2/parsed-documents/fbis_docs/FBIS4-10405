According to Dultzin, included among the areas in which Mexico is willing to make midterm and long-term adjustments is maritime transportation. He also noted that, in general, all environmental agreements are being carried out. Modifications will have to be made in 38 economic areas, including capital goods, services, environment, foreign investments, multinational corporations, consumer protection programs, agriculture, nuclear energy, and tourism. Other areas that will need to undergo adjustment include financial markets, fiscal issues, trade, employment and social issues, insurance, scientific and technological policies, computer technology, data processing and communications policies, development assistance, and others. Dultzin also mentioned areas such as education, in addition to specific naval construction and steel agreements. Although adopted agreements affect all of these areas, the energy sector will not be affected because "we decided not to participate in this area, and also, we did not participate in developmental assistance or in independent agreements on exports." Other agreements are aimed at creating a more prosperous, stable Mexican economy that will raise the people's standard of living and increase employment, and all of these agreements "are designed to improve the Mexican economy." Daniel Dultzin explained that the adjustments really have nothing to do with trade: "There is a Trade Committee that thoroughly reviews international trade policies. If the OECD's mission is to safeguard a multilateral trade system, they can rely on the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. This, however, has nothing to do with the required adjustments on issues such as trade deregulation or the granting of preferences. "We are not about to lose our status as a developing country; our admittance into the OECD does not connote this. This is something completely different; we are not going to lose this status." The SRE [Foreign Relations Secretariat] official explained: "We have lost our concessional credits [creditos concesionales] because our per capita income has surpassed the fixed $2,300 amount, and also because of the overall income level. In terms of increases in our level of income, we will be losing some of the advantages that come with being a poor country, or one in development." At any rate, this will not take place just because we are an OECD member. On the contrary, the Basel Agreements between all of the central banks imply government credits are rated as zero risk for all OECD members. They fell from 100 to zero, but for the commercial banks they will fall to 20. In other words, it is expected that there will be an impact on the cost of what is paid in premium for the credits Mexico acquires. [Aranda] What can we expect from our admittance to the OECD? [Dultzin] What we can expect is, first of all, to be completely involved in all discussions of the more than 200 working groups and committees. Mexican officials will be receiveing training in every area of government. The OECD covers all areas of government except security, sports, and culture. In addition there will be "improved training and increased coordination of programs in the interior, and, therefore, we will be better informed, which in turn will allow us to better apply new policies." "We are gradually committing ourselves to offer nondiscriminatory, fair treatment as long as economic conditions in Mexico and the legal structure allow this. However, we also expect to guarantee these liberties to all Mexicans living in other countries. It is vital that the Mexican economy is capable of globalizing. Of course, all of this depends on what we might do." [Aranda] Up until 31 December, there was a certain perception of Mexico abroad. Considering Colosio's murder, what support can the OECD provide Mexico? [Dultzin] All of the governments are well aware of the problems we have had. They have decided not to modify the discussions or the manner in which these are being carried out. Our internal problems are our problems, and it is up to us to resolve them. They have accepted us as a mature [maduro] country confronting problems related to growing up. Maybe it is a transition in our development process. We are being accepted as a mature country by other mature countries. "It will be up to us to resolve our problems as best we can. However, the other nations are there, not so much to tell us what to do, but to offer support and guidance, as well as to help as much as possible because many of them have similar problems." [Aranda] The member-states have a democratic culture. Was there any problem when you adopted the decision concerning Mexico's admission? [Dultzin] There are principles; these include a basic philosophy, market economies, and economies that date back hundreds of years. The relationship between states and markets is very old. Democracy and respect for human rights are very old principles and, obviously, they are essential to those countries and to us, too. Within the OECD, there are various cases in which various countries have faced very difficult political situations. "Mexico's pledge basically deals with human rights, democracy, and a market economy that improves the people's overall lifestyle and will become increasingly prosperous. These are the principles we share. They do not touch on political issues; they deal with other topics -- in depth and vigorously. Daniel Dultzin Dublin said Mexico's pledge is to strive for a better trained work force; a better adaptation of the labor market to the need for more industrial services, greater competitiveness, and productivity; and to include the working class in the overall marketplace with a better lifestyle and training. [Aranda] The country faces uncertain times. What does the admission to the OECD represent? [Dultzin] Admission was scheduled for 24 March; the date was established so the OECD Council could adopt a decision. It adopted the decision despite all of the events that have recently occurred in Mexico. The council was fully aware that its decision was coming within a new context, but it nevertheless adopted the decision as scheduled. The confirmation and acceptance were planned for 14 April. "It is an element of all of these countries' great confidence in Mexico, in its institutions, in the maturity of its society, and in Mexican society's ability to face these problems and overcome them. This can result in specific and mutual benefits, and the OECD countries will be more aware of the problems that afflict developing nations such as ours." The director general of multilateral negotiations in the SRE says OECD countries know what conditions prevail in Mexico: "They know perfectly well how revenues are distributed and that we are 5 percent above the median for the population with the highest income -- a level in which Mexico is above the median for industrialized countries. Some 20 percent of the low-income population is way below the median for industrialized countries. The general trend is for greater overall productivity and a better distribution of wages." Moveover, "very specialized work is being carried out on regional development and rural development, which will give us the experience to attack the poverty problem." [Aranda] What topics interest Mexico the most as an OECD member? [Dultzin] There is one critical issue. In order to ensure that economic development will be sustainable in the long run in Mexico, higher growth levels must be compatible with reduced inflation, price stability, and a sustainable external deficit. "Also, everything dealing with the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, their problems, and international production tasks." [sentence as published] In addition, Mexico is interested in "doing everything possible to incorporate an underground economy, and this must be increasingly strengthened through production chains, large companies, and large distribution chains or their international counterparts, because this will help us a great deal." The official emphasizes it is essential for Mexico to have much more access to international markets. "If this does not happen, we will be inhibited in our development; we will not be able to develop the Mexican economy's potential, which could be around 5, 6, or 7 percent, and we will not be able to achieve an in-depth solution to the problem of increasing our participation in international markets with Mexican assets, services, and experience. Mexican products are competitive, and they have a market. "It is an enormous challenge, but there are many topics within the OECD that can help promote Mexico." [Aranda] What other topics are important for Mexico? [Dultzin] The basic problems that afflict large cities -- pollution, development, and urban planning -- as well as similar problems dealing with regional development, more successful agricultural policies, and assistance for the peasants. We can find many areas in which we can improve our economy. [Arenda] We have joined the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] organization, NAFTA, and the OECD. What next? [Dultzin] Our admission does not guarantee we will fare better. Mexico has maturity, knowledge, and experience that are of interest to industrialized countries, as well as to East European countries, where Mexico's experience may be of great interest -- both our achievements and our backwardness, and what we do with them -- and we can benefit from this. Mexico has made a name for itself in the world community because it has something to say, and it is capable of absorbing the experience of others for its own benefit.
