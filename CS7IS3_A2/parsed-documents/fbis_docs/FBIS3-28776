The details are not yet known. But Hata later told reporters he will hold one or two more rounds of talks with Kantor before Friday's meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. "Both Japan and the U.S. hope to bring the trade talks to a conclusion," said Hata, also deputy prime minister. The meeting was held as Japan and the United States head toward a showdown over a plethora of trade issues before the summit. Hata arrived in Washington late Wednesday on an emergency mission seeking U.S. understanding of the Japanese position. He said he was bringing no new proposals to Washington. Tokyo has turned down a U.S. demand that numerical targets be set to measure the progress in opening Japan's markets, saying they would result in managed trade. Hata is also scheduled to hold separate talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Vice President Albert Gore before the leaders' meeting. Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, U.S. negotiators suspended a series of high-level trade negotiations with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday. The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a firm commitment to reduce its massive current account surplus, which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications equipment, and insurance. U.S. Government sources have said Washington might impose trade sanctions against Japan if no agreement is reached. In Tokyo, a top Foreign Ministry official said Japan will appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if such sanctions are imposed. The official asked not to be identified.
