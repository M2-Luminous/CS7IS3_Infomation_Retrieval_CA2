The news analyst points out: The puppets, as they customarily do, are now advertising the war game as designed to cope with "a surprise attack" and "infiltration" of the North. But this is no more than a sophism to cover up their bellicose nature in aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula on purpose and seeking only confrontation and war. It is the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmaniacs who scheme a surprise attack and infiltration on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean puppets in league with the United States have worked out "new operational plan 5027", designed to unleash a war against the North. The United States has massed huge aggression forces in and around South Korea and deployed Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. Some time ago Defense Secretary Perry, the war boss of the U.S., flew to South Korea to have war confabs. The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must know that the dangerous play with fire driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war will bring nothing good to them.
