This is the gist of the speech made by Chen Huanyou, provincial party committee secretary and governor, at the provincial summing-up and commendation meeting on antipoverty work. On 29 January, the provincial party committee and government held this meeting to give a warm welcome to the honorable return of the provincial party committee's second antipoverty work team, sum up the province's antipoverty work in recent years, and commend 198 advanced workers and 75 advanced units in antipoverty work. Cao Hongming, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting. Cao Keming, Xu Zhonglin, Gao Dezheng, Jiang Yongrong, Zhang Huaixi, Duan Xushen, and other provincial leaders attended the meeting. The Yancheng City party Committee and Government, the provincial planning and economic commission, the provincial antipoverty work team stationed in Shuyang, and other units as well as representatives of antipoverty team members gave reports on their experience in this regard. Chen Huanyou delivered an important speech on antipoverty work. He said: Antipoverty work is a very important and significant issue. Helping people in economically weak areas to break away from poverty and become prosperous as soon as possible has been an important issue to which the provincial party committee and government have paid a good deal of attention. According to the strategy of "stressing reform and opening up of more economically developed areas, mainly along the Chang Jiang, and accelerating economic development on the one hand; stressing the reform in economically weak areas with localities north of Huai He as the center and stepping up the pace of breaking away from poverty and becoming prosperous on the other hand," the provincial party committee and government have further supported economically weak areas in developing the economy in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials during the past couple of years. The provincial authorities concentrated efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction in northern Jiangsu and as organized the linkup of units directly under the provincial authorities with poor townships and towns by dispatching work groups to help develop the economy and by promoting an exchange of cadres between northern and southern Jiangsu to carry out cooperative activities. Through the joint efforts of all sectors around the province, particularly the hard work of cadres and people in economically weak areas, gratifying achievements have been made in antipoverty work. In view of the conditions in areas north of Huai He, a road of development for braking away from poverty and becoming prosperous as soon as possible has been found and preliminary achievements have been scored in the course of practice. The agricultural production rose steadily, structural readjustment was remarkably accelerated, and the development of a diversified economy has become the main source of the increase in peasants' income. New vitality was added to industrial production and some townships and towns formerly weak in industry are starting their own backbone projects. Infrastructure construction continued to be stressed; the construction of markets saw a good beginning and more and more peasants are participating in the circulation services. Individual and private economies became active by the day; labor export grew rapidly; peasants had higher income and collective accumulation increased. Another 400,000 people in Jiangsu shook off poverty in 1993. The per capita income of most of the 58 poor townships and towns, which were emphatically supported by the provincial authorities, has exceeded 600 yuan; of which, the per capita income of 30 townships and towns in Shuyang County exceeded 700 yuan, the village revenue increased by 20.3 percent over the previous year, and the income of village-level collective economies reached 20,000 yuan on average. If economically weak areas develop along such a course, they will surely bring about an even greater change by the end of this century. Chen Huanyou stressed in his speech that we should further implement various antipoverty measures and strive to beef up the capability of economically weak areas in self-development with a strong sense of urgency and a high sense of political responsibility, so as to step up the pace of breaking away from poverty, becoming prosperous, and moving toward a relatively comfortable life. On this year's antipoverty work, Chen Huanyou noted that the provincial authorities should stress the following issues: 1) Supporting the work with policies -- it is necessary to continue to implement and improve the policies of supporting the economic development in poor areas and to provide the support in the aspects of personnel, capital, and materials. We should do our best to add more key projects in northern Jiangsu. 2) Organization and coordination -- in line with the principle of taking measures suitable to local conditions, rational division of labor, supplementing each other's advantages, and joint development and having consolidated the linkup of the north and south, we should further expand economic alliance and cooperation between economically developed cities and counties and their less developed counterparts through various forms and levels. The provincial authorities should take measures to help launch projects with participation of both the north and south. 3) Intensifying infrastructure construction, particularly the construction of power supplies and transport networks, with a view to making an end of no-electricity villages and basically establishing highway networks among cities, counties, and townships within three years or so. Chen Huanyou announced at the meeting: The provincial party committee has decided to keep dispatching antipoverty work teams to poor areas this year, appropriately readjust and expand supporting areas, and make greater efforts in antipoverty work. Some units originally stationed in Shuyang this year will be transferred to Guanyu and Suining. He hoped that units concerned would take the overall conditions into consideration, happily accept the mission assigned to them by the provincial party committee, overcome difficulties through all possible means, and do a good job in their work. In addition to doing their best to give personnel, capital, and material support, leading comrades of various rear units should go deep into townships and towns involved to give more concrete guidelines and solve actual problems there. He called on antipoverty work teams to conduct their work with creativity. The major tasks of the teams are assisting localities in reform, opening up, developing the economy, handling well the relations between reform and development and stability, and promoting a comprehensive social progress. All work teams should go deep into the realities of life, intensify investigations and studies, forge close ties and unite with local cadres and people, and do more actual and helpful work for the localities wholeheartedly. He demanded that party committees and governments of localities, where the work teams are stationed, actively strengthen their ties with work teams, keep in touch, respect, and support each other at work and unite together to advance forward. Chen Huanyou also demanded that all cities and counties link up with economically weak townships and villages level by level and help them promote coordinated regional economic development.
