FR940503-2-00036 FR940503-2-00028 Environmental Impacts of Alternatives Alternatives considered in the Environmental Assessment include no action, receipt of a greater or lesser number of spent fuel elements, alternate ports of entry, alternative modes of transport from the receiving port to the Savannah River Site, and reprocessing abroad and transport of low or highly enriched uranium to the United States. No Action: Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no environmental impact in the United States. However, United States nonproliferation policy would be adversely affected. Foreign reactor operators will try to avoid shutting down their reactors. The operators of two reactors can elect to reprocess their spent fuel at an existing facility in Scotland, although one of the two would need United States authorization to do so. Reprocessing would allow the uranium to be extracted for reuse, and thus would increase the threat of nuclear proliferation. Reactor operators in Belgium and Germany resorted to reprocessing on four occasions in 1993 and 1994. Six of the eight research reactors from which DOE proposes to accept spent fuel either do not have the option to reprocess their spent fuel or could not obtain regulatory authority to reprocess in time to avoid shutdown. Shutdown of these reactors would severely undermine the United States' credibility as a reliable partner in matters of nuclear cooperation. This, in turn, could influence other reactor operators to cease their conversion to low enriched fuel or to revert to the use of highly enriched fuel if they have already converted. In fact, several reactor operators have stated that, if the United States is unable to accept spent fuel, they will cancel or delay their reactor conversions to low enriched uranium fuel. Such actions would encourage development of a world market for highly enriched uranium, thereby undermining a key aspect of the United States nonproliferation program. Selection of the No Action Alternative would also adversely affect the upcoming 1995 international conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The conference will consider the indefinite extension of the Treaty, which the United States strongly supports. Other Treaty parties will want assurance that the United States has fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation. If several countries that are parties to the Treaty are compelled to shut down their research reactors, thereby foregoing the benefits from these reactors, the United States may be accused, fairly or unfairly, of not sharing the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation. Such an accusation, however ill-founded, could create or increase opposition to the indefinite extension of the Treaty, which is the foundation for the international nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime. Greater or Lesser Number of Spent Fuel Elements Accepted: In addition to the proposed action (shipment of up to 409 spent nuclear fuel elements), the environmental impacts of shipping alternative numbers of spent fuel elements (i.e., 953, 359, 291, and 248 spent fuel elements) were also considered in the Environmental Assessment. The risks for the 953-element alternative are slightly more than double the risks for shipping 409 elements through the proposed ports. Conversely, the risks of shipping 359, 291 and 248 elements are less than the risks for shipping 409 elements. While there are differences in the risks depending upon the number of elements shipped, the impacts associated with the shipment of any alternative number of elements are extremely small.
