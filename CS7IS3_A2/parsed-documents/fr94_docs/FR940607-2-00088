The Committee has the power to enforce such rules and regulations by recommending staff investigations for violations thereof, in accordance with the procedure provided in Article XII. See CHX Article IV, Rule 3. 16 CHX Rule 23(a) would be amended to state that any controversy between parties who are members, member organizations or their nominees or associated persons which arises out of the Exchange business of such parties shall be submitted to arbitration, through the Director of Arbitration, to an Arbitration Panel composed of members of the Committee on Floor Procedure, unless non-members are also parties to the controversy. If non-members are also parties to such controversies, the arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with Section 8 of Rule 24 under this Article unless the non-members consent to arbitration before an arbitration panel selected by parties as provided in this Rule. However, controversies shall be resolved by the Committee on Floor Procedure if the parties to such controversy agree to be bound by the decision of that Committee or if Exchange rules otherwise require resolution by the Committee on Floor Procedure. The rules and procedures applicable to arbitrations which are set forth in Rule 24 do not apply to controversies which are to be resolved by the Committee on Floor Procedure.
