Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave a speech. He called on leaders at all levels to use practical experience and to resolutely attend to anticorruption struggle in line with the central demands. Mayor Li Qiyan presided over the meeting. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, relayed the important speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin. On behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal government, Li Yongan, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection committee, gave a report "on the opinions for implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session of the central discipline inspection and deeply conducting the next stage of anticorruption struggle." Li Yongan said: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability is the overall situation of the whole party's work. Anticorruption and the building of party style and administrative honesty must obey and serve this overall situation. The overall demands of this year's Beijing municipal anticorruption struggle are to continuously and resolutely implement the central plan on anticorruption struggle, uphold the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both," proceed from the reality of the work of the entire municipality, and on the basis of consolidating the achievements, grasp the prominent problems that hamper and affect reform, development, and stability, define this year's anticorruption specific tasks and objectives, and integrate anticorruption with the work of comprehensively promoting party style and administrative honesty; combine the establishment and perfection of rules and regulations with the strengthening of ideological and political work and professional ethics; combine administrative honesty with diligent administration, deepen reform, firmly grasp education, improve systems, strengthen supervision, strictly enforce law and discipline, integrate honesty with diligence, deeply, enduringly and effectively carry out anticorruption struggle, and serve Beijing Municipality's reform, development, and stability. He said: It is necessary to resolutely implement the "opinions for implementing the five stipulations on keeping leading cadres of party and government organs at and above the county (section) level clean and self-disciplined," "on the method of handling in line with party discipline the acts of violating the five stipulations on honesty and self-discipline of party and government leading cadres at and above the county (section) level; and continue to attend to supervision, inspection, and implementation. The central authorities have issued another "five stipulations" on keeping leading cadres clean and self-disciplined this year. The problems involving in these "five stipulations" have existed at varying degrees and within a certain scope in Beijing Municipality. The masses have expressed comments on and criticism of the phenomena that a small number of party and government leading cadres have ridden on "black plate" cars used by foreign enterprises; arbitrarily misappropriated the cars of subordinate units for a long time under the pretext of borrowing them; and replaced their old cars with imported luxurious cars. The problems as reflected by the masses, were concentrated on the using of public funds for furnishing one's own house above the set standards, which should be listed as a priority for investigation and rectification. In addition, cases on holding lavish weddings and funerals have frequently occurred in some cadres; and cases on borrowing and misappropriating public funds (articles) or delaying the payment of public funds have also existed at varying degrees in some departments and units. Although these two problems have not yet become a common practice, we should conscientiously resolve them by proceeding from reality. Regarding the aforementioned problems, party committees and governments at all levels should proceed from reality and resolutely carry out their work in accordance with the stipulations of the central authorities and the municipal party committee and government. He said: Continued efforts should be made to investigate and handle major and appalling cases. We should continue to persist in regarding investigation and handling of cases on law and discipline violations involving party and government leading organs, leading cadres and judicial department, administrative law-enforcing departments, economic management departments, and other functionaries as the priorities. Priorities should be given to investigating and handling cases on leading cadres who engage in corruption and bribe-taking and abuse their powers to seek personal gain and cases on law and discipline enforcing personnel who practice favoritism and engage in malpractice, who take bribes and bend the law, and who violate law and discipline, and cases on law and discipline violations involving legal entities. It is necessary to attend to the handling and punishment for typical cases. He said: Continued efforts should be made to check unhealthy trends in various trades. While checking the random collection of fees, fines, and forced donations this year, we should put special emphasis on strengthening supervision and inspection and firmly carry out this work. On the one hand, we should pursue the responsibility of relevant leaders who continue to collect funds which are formally ordered to be abolished by the municipal party committee and give them necessary punishment in line with party and administrative discipline; on the other hand, we should organize inspection activities, experiment with the method of "using cadres to supervise the collection of funds," implement the stipulations and other measures on separating the management of the collection of administrative funds from the collection of fines, and consolidate and expand the achievements in checking the random of collection of fees, fines, and forced donations. Meanwhile, we should continue to grasp the work of reducing the burdens of peasants. Li Yongan said: The demands of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the municipal party committee and government on strengthening party style and administrative honesty are also applicable to enterprises and units. The party committee and administrative leaders of enterprises and units should proceed from the reality of their own units, set forth explicit demands on self- discipline for party and government cadres of enterprises, institutions, and units in line with a series of relevant demands of the central authorities, and supervise the implementation of these demands. In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: Last year, in line with the decision and plans of the central authorities, all sectors in the municipality made common efforts, resolutely conducted anticorruption struggle, strengthened administrative honesty, and achieved expected results. Most units made achievements of varying degrees, units with good performance made more obvious achievements, and some units that were slack in their work went through the motions. This year the whole municipality should act in accordance with the central demand on deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conducting anticorruption struggle, and the plans and tasks of the central discipline inspection commission, launch the struggle in line with Beijing's reality, apply the experience of the previous stage, and continue to exert strenuous efforts to make the anticorruption work a greater success. Chen Xitong stressed: To fight corruption, we must first be resolute. If we fail to be resolute, we will not have fighting strength, will not be able to fight corruption, will depart from the masses, and will not be qualified to be a leader. We should soberly recognize that some systems, laws, and regulations are not perfect under the new situation, leaving loopholes for the people to exploit. Therefore, anticorruption struggle has become more important, and must be grasped resolutely. At present, the idea of "that is good enough" and the worries that anticorruption work may affect reform, development, and stability which hamper our efforts to fight corruption are all wrong. Actually, we still have disparities in anticorruption work. Only by resolutely carrying out anticorruption struggle can we facilitate reform and opening up, win support from the people, and bring about stability. Leaders at all levels should persist in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both, and combine anticorruption with deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Only by resolutely grasping anticorruption work can we consolidate the ruling status of our party, and better undertake the historical heavy task of leading reform, opening up, and modernization. Chen Xitong said: Anticorruption work must be constantly carried out. We must guard against impetuous. Some people inside the party will be contaminated by things of the old society. It is impossible to be absolutely perfect. For many reasons, including the "mosquitoes and flies" brought in by history, society, class, ideology, and opening up, anticorruption is a long-term struggle. It is impossible to finish a work at one go and accomplish one task at one stroke. We must fight a long war. It is not right to be rash, not right not to grasp this work conscientiously, and not right to do it slowly. Chen Xitong said: To fight corruption, we must grasp a portion of the expected achievements because this is the manifestation of the principle of being resolute and enduring, carry out this work stage by stage, and sum up every portion of the expected achievements to form an overall achievement. In this way, we may reduce the corrupt phenomena to the minimum. He said: We should strengthen both self supervision and mass supervision. Party organizations should do a good job in holding democratic life activities, conduct self supervision, use criticism and self-criticism as a weapon, and help one another, and should not establish vulgar relations or engage in hypocritical work style. Last year, we persisted in holding democratic life activities, promoted honesty and self-discipline, encouraged people to exchange views, and then reported the results to the masses of each specific unit and to the democratic parties to listen to their opinions, and gradually form them into a system, which was welcomed by the masses. This good experience should be upheld. He said: It is necessary to strengthen education and deal strict blows to criminals and combine the two together. We should conscientiously investigate and handle major and appalling cases, resolutely deal strict blows to serious crimes, and never be soft-handed. Regarding those who are contaminated by bourgeois work style and commit mistakes which should not be punished in line with the criminal law, we should educate them, and encourage them to find out the reasons for their mistakes, to absorb lessons, and to make corrections. Some should be punished in line with party and administrative discipline, which is also an education for them. We should make full use of negative examples to enhance the understanding of the people, and must not neglect everything after ending a case without noticing its educational role. The core of education is to cultivate the communist outlook on life and the world outlook. Struggling to fulfill the communist ideals is a lofty move, and letting the Chinese people reach common prosperity and lead a happy life is of great significance in life. He said: We should combine diligent administration with honest administration, attend to administrative honesty and promote diligent administration, attach importance to both, do a better job in this aspect, work for the well-being of the people, and do more practical and good things for them. Practice has proved that we will achieve good results in promoting diligent administration by always introducing the achievements of anticorruption and administrative honesty to it. Chen Xitong said: We should concentrate efforts on grasping administrative honesty and grasp it regularly. Leaders should concentrate their energy and time on solving problems. For example, last year we universally held democratic life activities. However, concentrating efforts on grasping this work does not mean that we should turn it into a movement. We should attend to it regularly and should have systems and inspection to support this work. He called on leaders at all levels to uphold these experiences which have been proved by practice and apply them this year's work so as to achieve greater achievements in anticorruption struggle. In his speech, Li Qiyan said: Anticorruption work is one which has a vital bearing on the overall situation. It should be carried out under the party committee's unified leadership and plans and with the joint efforts of the party and government organs. Administrative leaders should not neglect anticorruption struggle even under the situation of having numerous economic work and heavy tasks. A success in this work will help develop our various undertakings. It is necessary to conscientiously relay the conference guidelines, form a momentum, adopt practical measures, and realistically achieve a portion of the expected results in anticorruption struggle. Municipal leaders Wang Baosen, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, Duan Bingren, Qiang Wei, Meng Zhiyuan, Xia Qinlin, Tao Xiping, Xue Bingzhong, Lu Yucheng, Hu Zhaoguang, Duan Qiang, Feng Mingwei, and Fan Yuanmou attended the conference.
