The drug-sniffing dogs got extremely nervous when the couple's camper approached the customs station. Therefore, the customs officials disassembled the vehicle. The two Germans have already made a confession. According to what they said, they entered Turkey via Izmir at the beginning of April to meet a Turk they knew, who had worked in Germany for a long time. The drugs were destined for a client in London. The couple was in financial difficulties, which they wanted to remedy by smuggling drugs.
