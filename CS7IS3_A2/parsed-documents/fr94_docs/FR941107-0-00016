FR941107-0-00016 FR941107-0-00008 7 CFR Parts 932 and 944 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;932&hyph;3FIR] Olives Grown in California and Imported Olives; Revisions of Outgoing Inspection Requirements and Size Requirements for Whole Pitted Olives AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with changes, the provisions of an interim final rule amending outgoing inspection regulations under the California olive marketing order to authorize handlers to use in-plant Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs) in lieu of continuous in-line inspection. This rule also permits handlers to size whole pitted olives by diameter as an alternative to the requirement that such olives be sized by weight prior to pitting. Conforming changes are made to the size requirements for imported whole pitted olives so that the requirements for domestic and imported olives are applied similarly. The changes in the California olive requirements are designed to result in more efficient handling operations. The changes in import requirements are necessary under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective on December 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Terry Vawter, California Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721, telephone 209&hyph;487&hyph;5901; or Caroline Thorpe, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2525&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, telephone (202) 720&hyph;5127. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Marketing Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], both as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. This final rule is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including olives, are subject to grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements under a Federal marketing order, the same or comparable requirements shall be applied to imports of those commodities. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this final rule on small entities.
