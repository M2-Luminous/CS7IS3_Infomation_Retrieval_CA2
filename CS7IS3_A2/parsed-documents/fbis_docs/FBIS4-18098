The European capitals, including London, ended up giving the green light to the compromise concocted last weekend by the foreign ministers. But is it a good compromise? And will it allow crisis to be avoided both in the EU and the United Kingdom? This is far from sure. Certainly, by choosing to tone down the dispute which has been agitating them for several weeks, the EU governments are indicating that the enlargement process can continue according to the planned time schedule. Two and one-half months away from the European elections, that could be interpreted as a sign of confidence in the future, addressed to public opinion. And in the perspective of the referendums which are to be organized in the new member countries, it could cover over the poor impression left by their indecision. But before reaching that point, they must manage to convince the European Parliament (EP) that the modifications are acceptable. And it is far from certain that the MEPs will be as conciliatory as the ministers themselves. After all, warnings have been fired off from all quarters in recent weeks, far exceeding nationalities and political families. The compromise, proposed in Ioannina on Sunday [27 March] by the Greek presidency and backed yesterday by the EU governments, allows for the blocking minority to be adapted arithmetically from 23 (out of 76) to 27 (out of 90 votes) after the enlargement to 16 members, as 10 countries were demanding. But, in order to answer the opposition from the British and Spanish, a vote of between 23 and 26 could nevertheless allow negotiations to be continued for a "reasonable period." What is this period and how can it be defined? The question is unanswered and will certainly be controversial. Even if the principles of the supporters of a federal Europe have been apparently safeguarded, it is no less true that the rot has set in. That, to use the expression of the Commission president, the solution contains a real danger of creating "negative jurisprudence" which could have implications for the more fundamental institutional reform which will take place in 1996. And that there has been an increase in the threat of Community decisionmaking procedures being diluted. Even if crisis does not break out today, it could well emerge in the near future. And, while we are waiting, it is far from certain that John Major will manage on his side to overcome his domestic problems. By choosing in the end to follow the most European-minded of his cabinet, the British prime minister managed to avoid any break with the continent. But now he is going to have to save his head, which has had a price put on it by the Eurosceptics in his party who are speaking only in terms of "surrender" and "capitulation." That will certainly not be the easiest part.
