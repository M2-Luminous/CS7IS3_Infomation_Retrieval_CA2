He took the opportunity to demand democracy for Cuba right in front of Fidel Castro, to highlight the changes in Argentina since 1989, and to reject abortion. In his seven-minute speech -- the time allowed for the presidents to express their position -- Menem called for a political "change" in Cuba based on a request made earlier to Castro by Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. He concluded his message calling on the 21 heads of state and government to speak out against abortion. "No Latin American government has been able to develop under a dictatorship or totalitarianism, which are systems that have completely failed" said Menem in reference to the situation in Cuba. "I understand that perhaps in some countries those conditions do not exist but that depends on each of those countries, and it is not my intention to meddle in the affairs of other countries." Menem was quick to clarify that he had not made a special reference to Cuba. After recalling that he also suffered "imprisonment, persecution, and torture," like some of his colleagues, Menem emphasized: "The Venezuelan president (Caldera) referred to this issue. With great affection and love I also call on this friend who is the commander of Cuba, under the same terms and form, on the need for change in Cuba which is a country we all love." Menem never mentioned the name Castro and only identified him as "the commander of Cuba." He spoke at noon yesterday. He was the third speaker after Fidel Castro spoke. The first session was interrupted for a few minutes over a special request by Menem to the summit president, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. Following Gaviria's address, the speakers were Brazil's Itamar Franco, Uruguay's Luis Lacalle, Guatemala's Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Venezuela's Rafael Caldera, Cuba's Fidel Castro (who harshly criticized the United States), Ecuador's Sixto Ballen, Panama's Guillermo Endara, and Carlos Menem whose speech was delayed for a few minutes after Gaviria granted the brief recess he requested. Menem's speech first covered economic matters, which is one of the main issues of the summit that will close this evening when Menem will deliver another speech, as will Gaviria, because Argentina will host the next summit. Unexpectedly and based on the mention by Venezuela's Caldera, President Menem talked about dictatorships and could not avoid referring to the Cuban issue. Menem returned to his prepared speech to talk about the state reform. He said: "Based on our experience, I can say that a reform strengthens the state in such a way that it can begin a process of profound economic change." Directly addressing President Gaviria, who spoke on this issue, Menem pointed out that in Argentina "we are conducting an all-out struggle against corruption. Argentina has completely changed its history with the state reform." He emphasized that "every enterprise that we have privatized was a monument to corruption." The privatizations "have given us an opportunity to begin a new stage with growth and development, and to fight the worst scourge that could hit a community which is hyperinflation." Menem wore white pants and a light blue shirt as the meeting was informal. He compared the $60 million in the safe of the Central Bank when he assumed the government with the current $18 billion. He added: "We have made some great achievements, and those who say this is just some kind of adjustment policy are lying." He said: "Argentina has the greatest growth in the western world and is third at the global level thanks to the state reform, a market economy, and a strong fiscal adjustment." President Menem took this opportunity to urge the summit to speak out against abortion. Menem said the leaders will probably talk about "human rights, democracy, freedom ..." He then paused for a deep breath and said: "The protection of life. For me, and I hope the other presidents agree, life begins at the moment of conception in the mother's womb." Menem added: "These issues related to man's dignity will be discussed and talked about." He was applaused by those attending the summit.
