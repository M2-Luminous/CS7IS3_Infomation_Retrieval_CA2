FR940928-0-00067 FR940928-0-00021 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction A. Statutory Authority for Labeling Pool Heaters, Instantaneous Water Heaters, and Heat Pump Water Heaters The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (``NAECA 87'') 1 amended EPCA 2 by, among other things, adding pool heaters (which include spa and hot tub heaters and heaters for similar applications_for convenience, the Commission will refer to these products as ``pool heaters'') to the list of appliances for which DOE must establish minimum efficiency standards and testing procedures. EPCA requires the Commission to consider labeling requirements for any covered products for which DOE has prescribed a final test procedure. 3 1 Pub. L. 100&hyph;12, 101 Stat. 103 (1987). 2 Pub. L. 94&hyph;183, 89 Stat. 871, 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. (Dec. 22, 1975). 3 42 U.S.C. 6294(b)(1)(B). NAECA 87 also amended EPCA by adding definitions, in section 321, 4 for some of the products enumerated as ``covered products'' in section 322, 5 including a definition for water heaters that subdivided the category into three subcategories_storage-type units, instantaneous units, and heat pump units. 6 In 1989, DOE amended its definition for water heaters to be consistent with the NAECA 87 amendments, 7 and, in 1990, refined its test procedure for water heaters so it would apply to some (but not all) of the different kinds of instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters that are currently being produced, as well as to storage-type units. 8 Previously, DOE's definition (and test procedure) for water heaters applied only to conventional storage-type heaters. The Commission's current labeling Rule, like the previous version of the DOE rule, defines water heaters only as storage-type units. 9 Thus, these other products did not come within the Rule's definition of water heater. 4 42 U.S.C. 6291. 5 42 U.S.C. 6292. 6 42 U.S.C. 6291 (27). 7 54 FR 6062, 6075 (Feb. 7, 1989). 8 55 FR 42162, 42169&hyph;77 (Oct. 17, 1990). 9 16 CFR 305.3(d). EPCA provides that, after DOE prescribes a final test procedure applicable to a product category covered under EPCA, 10 the Commission must initiate a proceeding to consider labeling requirements for that category. Because of DOE's publication of a final test procedure for pool heaters, the Commission commenced a proceeding to consider labeling rules for pool heaters. Further, because DOE amended its definition for water heaters in section 430.2 of Subpart A (General Provisions) of its rules, 11 to include instantaneous water heaters and heat pump water heaters, and amended Appendix E to Subpart B of Part 430_ the test procedure for these products_so the energy usage of most of these new products can be determined, the Commission also initiated a proceeding to consider requiring labeling for these water heaters. 10 42 U.S.C. 6293(b) gives DOE the authority (1) to prescribe test procedures for new products, and (2) to amend existing test procedures if amended test procedures would more accurately or fully measure energy consumption. 11 The applicable DOE rules are codified at 10 CFR Part 430 (1994). The language in ยง305.3 of the Commission's Rule (``Description of covered products to which this part applies) is based on the definitions in ยง430.2 of Subpart A of DOE's rules. B. Regulatory History On February 9, 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the Federal Register soliciting comment on a proposal to require EnergyGuide labels on pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters. 12 As required by EPCA, 13 this rulemaking was conducted pursuant to section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA''). 14 Section 553(b)(3) of the APA provides the Commission with the option of publishing the substance of a proposed rule instead of specific proposed rule language. The Commission exercised this option and sought comment on the substance of the proposed amendments to the Rule, except for specific definitions for each of the proposed new product categories. 12 58 FR 7852. 13 42 U.S.C. 6306(a)(1). 14 5 U.S.C. 553. In accordance with EPCA, 15 the NPR afforded interested persons the opportunity to present their views in writing and orally at a public hearing. The Presiding Officer did not receive any requests for an oral presentation, so no hearing was held. During the comment period, which extended from February 9 through April 26, 1993, the Commission received eight comments. 16 These comments are from two appliance manufacturers, one appliance industry trade association, two public utilities, one utility trade association, one state energy office, and one public interest group. 17 Part II, below, discusses the issues on which comments were sought, the comments received, and the amendments the Commission is adopting today in response to them. The amended Rule sections appear in ``Text of Amendments.'' 15 42 U.S.C. 6306(a)(1). 16 The comments are found on the Public Record at the FTC in Washington, D.C. under Rulemaking Record Number R611004 (Appliance Labeling Rule). They are grouped under Category E (Pool and Water Heater Proceeding_Industry Comments) and Category EE (Pool and Water Heater Proceeding_Comments from Other Sources). Other material submitted to the Public Record in this proceeding can be found under Category A (Public Notices and Petitions). 17 The commenters were: Thermo-Dynamics Boiler Company (``Thermo''), E&hyph;1; Paloma Industries, Inc. (``Paloma''), E&hyph;2; The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association (``GAMA''), E&hyph;3; Washington Gas, EE&hyph;1; The California Energy Commission (``CEC''), EE&hyph;2; The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (``ACEEE''), EE&hyph;3; The American Gas Association (``AGA''), EE&hyph;4; Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company (``ALG''), EE&hyph;5.
