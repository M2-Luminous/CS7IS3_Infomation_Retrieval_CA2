We must select the best coal mines and transform them [words indistinct]. We must pay attention to the production of anthracite and coke and support the development of coal mines run by townships and towns. We must strive to boost the province's annual coal production output to 4.5 million tons by 2000. The above-mentioned meeting convened by the provincial government made a conscientious analysis of the present situation of the coal industry in our province and the present difficulties facing the coal enterprises. It worked out preferential policies for supporting the development of the coal industry in our province and made overall arrangements beneficial to that development. Coal has occupied an important position in our province's fuel production setup. At present, coal has accounted for 58 percent of our province's energy consumption; however, our province's self-supporting rate of coal last year was only 52 percent. We need to import 1,700,000 tons of coal every year. Developing the coal industry and increasing its self-support rate is our province's long-term goal of struggle. Vice Provincial Governor Wang Hanmin spoke at the meeting on the future development of our province's coal industry. He said: Our province's coal industry has been developing under difficult conditions, but it has nonetheless made marked contributions to economic development throughout the province. In recent years, though coal enterprises have encountered enormous difficulties and their output has dropped, we must understand that demand in the coal market is currently in a state of change. A favorable opportunity has come our way. Wang Hanmin stressed: We must seize this favorable opportunity and have sense of urgency for reform and development. We must focus on running existing coal enterprises well, increasing investment, and speeding up the pace of updating facilities and technical transformation. We must transform or expand several of the existing enterprises' production projects, increase their production staying power, and boost their production output. Coal enterprises are also facing the problem of transforming their operational mechanisms. They must free themselves from the long-term traditional planned economic pattern, must transform their internal management systems to meet the needs of the market economy, and must promote the development of the coal industry in our province.
