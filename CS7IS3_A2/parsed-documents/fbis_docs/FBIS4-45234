As Joachim Pirker from the Vienna Security Office reported, 26-year-old Jozef F. and his 22-year-old compatriot Radoslav K. were arrested at the Westbahnhof railroad station in Vienna on 14 May. [passage omitted] F. and K. tried first to pose as harmless tourists. However, in their car, a rented Skoda with a Slovak license plate, the officials found about one kg of heroin of very good quality, which was packed in small portions in a plastic bag and is valued at about 4 million schillings. After first denials, the Slovaks became entangled in contradictions and finally admitted that as drug couriers they had "supplied" heroin from the Bratislava area via Austria to Switzerland and Germany for months. So far, the security office has succeeded in proving eight smuggling trips against the two men, where heroin valued at a total of about 22 million schillings had been transported. Only two days before their arrest, F. and K. had been with four kg of the drug in Switzerland. F. and K. were not able or willing to say anything about the people behind them. However, they are probably Kosovo Albanians. The drug squad at Vienna-Schwechat Airport has again exposed a Colombian drug courier. On Wednesday [18 May], the man had arrived from Ecuador via Amsterdam with 770 grams of cocaine with a black market value of about 2 million schillings in the false bottom of his travel bag and the hollowed-out soles of his shoes.
