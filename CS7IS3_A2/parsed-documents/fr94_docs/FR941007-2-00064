FR941007-2-00064 FR941007-2-00038 [PR Docket No. 94&hyph;106; DA 94&hyph;1067] Commercial Mobile Radio Services; Connecticut State Petition to Retain Regulatory Control of Rates of Wholesale Cellular Service Providers AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice; extension of time. SUMMARY: The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in this proceeding in response to a request filed by Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut Mobilecom, Inc. This extension will provide interested parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies on the issues we raised in this proceeding. DATES: Reply comments must be filed on or before October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send reply comments to the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regina Harrison, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Matter of Petition of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control to Retain Regulatory Control of the Rates of Wholesale Cellular Service Providers in the State of Connecticut; Order Adopted: September 28, 1994; Released: September 29, 1994. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut Mobilecom, Inc. (collectively Movants) have filed a motion for a 15-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments. 1 For the reasons given below, we grant the motion. 1 Joint Motion for Extension of Time (dated Sept. 26, 1994) (Motion). 2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory authority by filing a properly supported petition with the FCC. 2 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to decide any reconsideration. New York filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules, 3 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies. 2 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, Title VI, section 6002(b)(2), 107 State. 312, 392 (1993), amending Section 332(c)(3) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(3). 3 Second Report and Order, Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services, 9 FCC Rcd 1411, 1522&hyph;23 (1994), 59 Fed. Reg. 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) (to be codified at 47 CFR 20.13). 3. Movants, who support the petition of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, state that they need the requested extension to analyze the filings of the parties opposing the petition, which contain ``putative antitrust, competitive and economic analyses of the cellular markets as well as other testimony.'' 4 They state that grant of this ``modest'' extension will ensure a complete record in this proceeding and facilitate a timely Commission decision in the proceeding. 5 4 Motion at 2. 5 Motion at 2&hyph;3. 4. We believe that the motion has merit. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues, including the state of competition in the cellular market in the state and the reasonableness of rates, intricate. We find that good cause has been shown for the requested extension. 5. Pursuant to Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 6 we GRANT the Joint Motion for Extension of Time of Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut Mobilecom, Inc., AND HEREBY EXTEND the period for filing replies UNTIL October 19, 1994. 6 47 CFR 1.46.
