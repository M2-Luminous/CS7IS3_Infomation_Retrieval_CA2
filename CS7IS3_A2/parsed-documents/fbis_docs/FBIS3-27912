Under the public servants' ethics law, government officials above the grade one level who are obliged to disclose assets had to report any change in their financial standing since registration last Aug. 12 by Monday. Kim himself is worth 575 million won, up 15.21 million won from 560.29 million won last August, due to the accumulation of monthly savings of 3 million won. His other assets include a 410-million-won house in Sangdo-tong, Seoul, and 150 million won worth of farmland in Koje, South Kyongsang Province. Thanks to a bumper anchovy harvest, his father, Kim Hong-cho, increased his wealth by 425.38 million won, which he has deposited in three separate banks. President Kim's wealth grew by 15.21 million won due to interest increases in his monthly savings while his father benefited from the fact that he can deposit all his earnings now that he no longer has to contribute to his son's political activities, according to Hong In-kil, senior presidential secretary for administrative affairs. Another change in Kim's assets resulted from his second daughter-in-law's purchase of a used car for 6 million won last September.
