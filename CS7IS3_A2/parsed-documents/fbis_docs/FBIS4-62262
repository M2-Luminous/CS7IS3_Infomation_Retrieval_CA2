But those forecasts were not to be realized. The regular meetings held between our countries' leaders are the best indicator of the scale of bilateral relations in the political sphere. Perhaps no other state leader in Europe maintains such close contacts with the Russian Federation president as Chancellor Kohl: There are reciprocal visits and a constant exchange of opinions with Boris Yeltsin by telephone and in the form of personal messages. Yesterday the Russian president arrived in Germany on an official visit, and in August he will take part in the send-off ceremony for the Russian troops. The cooperation between the two states rests on a strengthening treaty and legal basis. Twenty five intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements have been signed in the recent period alone. Germany is now one of Russia's main economic partners. It accounts for 17 percent of our foreign trade turnover. Russia is a very important partner for the FRG in the east. Fifty-five production-sharing contracts, mainly in machine building, are now in operation between the two countries' companies. More than 100 companies in production, trade, transport and dispatch, insurance, and other areas of cooperation have been set up in Germany using Russian capital. A considerable amount of our exports to the FRG go via them. The German side is helping the process of privatization in Russia. The spectrum is diverse, ranging from the formation of the legal bases of private enterprise to joint research efforts and specific projects. For example, a company promoting economic reforms in the Moscow Oblast is operating with active German government department support and oversight. The Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus joint venture is functioning successfully. Enterprises with German share capital on Russian Federation territory number more than 1,700. Germany is entering into cooperation with Russia in the implementation of international space projects. It also intends to make its contribution to the program of implementing projects of ours in chemical production, power generation, capital construction, and aircraft construction. Business relations are being set up between our two states' regions. Sessions of the Russian-German Cooperation Council for Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation are held regularly. A bureau for a representative [delegat] of the German economy has been opened in St. Petersburg. Special bursaries for Russian graduates of higher educational institutions studying management, economics, and production organization are being established in a number of German concerns, for example, Daimler-Benz AG. The FRG government intends to promote the involvement of German private capital in Russian reforms. According to experts' figures, German companies, with a total capital of $4.2 billion, make up 60 percent of foreign investors in Russia. The FRG has helped in no small way the development of relations between Russia and the EU. Moscow and Bonn are stepping up their cooperation at the UN and CSCE level. It has stated its readiness to support Russia's membership application to the Council of Europe and is in favor of the creation of strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO. Bonn has welcomed Russian diplomacy's efforts to unblock the crisis situation over Sarajevo. The stances of Russia and the FRG regarding the solution of the Yugoslav crisis coincide to a large extent and there are no substantial disagreements. All-around contacts are maintained in the military sphere. Joint maritime exercises involving naval combined units will be conducted this year. Troop exercises at the level of tactical subunits are planned in the future. A center for training and retraining our servicemen returning from Germany in civilian specialisms was recently opened in the Russian capital with FRG financial assistance. The sides are cooperating effectively in the sphere of eliminating nuclear and chemical weapons. A joint Russian-German commission for the reciprocal return of cultural treasures removed during World War II has begun work. Consultations on events to mark its 50th anniversary are being held. The problem of the ethnic Germans on Russian Federation territory is a very important aspect of Russian-German relations. A protocol was signed in July 1992 which envisages cooperation in the phased restoration of the Russian Germans' statehood and better provision of facilities in areas where they represent a high proportion of the population. This year the FRG will allocate 65 million German marks [DM] for these purposes. For the first time Russia's draft budget earmarks 30 billion rubles likewise. Thanks to these measures, it has been possible to check somewhat the growth of repatriation of Russian Germans to Germany. But our relations are not unclouded. Touching on problems in the economic sphere, reciprocal trade turnover last year, according to preliminary figures, was DM20.5 billion as against DM21.8 billion in 1992. The worrying thing is that Moscow has not to date been able to repay the debt of approximately DM40 billion accumulated since Soviet times. True, an intergovernmental accord consolidating the foreign debts of Russia and the former USSR was signed in September 1993. We have been granted a 10-year deferment of payment on DM8 billions' worth of debt. The question of German investments in the Russian economy is critical. The amount of investment is substantially less than in, say, a country like Hungary. This year new arrangements regulating the cost of export credit guarantees have been introduced through the well-known FRG company Hermes: We now have to put 15 percent up-front in order to obtain credit guarantees. This makes it less interesting for us to take them up. But these sore points can be treated. Boris Yeltsin's visit to our friendly neighboring country will undoubtedly make a substantial contribution to further deepening all-around Russian-German parnership links.
