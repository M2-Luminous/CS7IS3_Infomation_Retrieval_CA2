Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told reporters the decision will do good for the nation's economy. On Tuesday, he urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to delay the planned rise in Japan's highway toll fares, saying public charge increase will trigger hikes in workers' wages and invite an upward spiral in both wages and prices. Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata instructed his aides to halt "until the end of year" planned hikes in the rate of domestic telephone charges and in rent for public housing, as well as taxi fares and highway tolls. Local governments are to be asked to refrain from raising fees for buses and subways. Nagano said, "I am surprised and glad that the government halted raises in not only highway tolls but also other public charges." He was calling for the freeze to last for two years, "but I won't complain that the suspension is until the end of year," Nagano said. He said he is still willing to testify at a public hearing over the proposed rise of an average 10.4 percent in highway tolls if it is held on next Tuesday as scheduled.
