FR940203-0-00093 FR940203-0-00021 San Diego County. The Pacific pocket mouse has been detected at three general locales in San Diego County: the San Onofre area, Santa Margarita River Estuary, and the lower Tijuana River Valley. Another report of a single Pacific pocket mouse in suitable habitat from Lux Canyon, Encinitas, in June 1989 is now considered probable by the observer (Erickson 1993). The only known extant population of the Pacific pocket mouse was rediscovered in July 1993 on the Dana Point Headlands in Orange County, California. Between 25 to 39 individual Pacific pocket mice were detected during trapping surveys conducted into August 1993 (Brylski 1993). This was the first time the Pacific pocket mouse had been collected at this site since 1971 (Erickson 1993). Numerous small-mammal survey and trapping efforts within its historical range (D. Erickson, in litt., 1993; Erickson 1993) have failed to locate any additional populations. The remaining site is imminently threatened by a development that is expected to receive final approval in the very near future. Previous Federal Action The Pacific pocket mouse was designated by the Service as a category 2 candidate species for Federal listing as endangered or threatened in 1985 (50 FR 37966). It was retained in this category in subsequent notices of review published by the Service in the Federal Register in 1989 and 1991 (54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58804, respectively). Category 2 comprises taxa for which information now in the possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support proposed rules. The Service made the determination to list this species on the basis of new information received in 1993 that resulted in the elevation of the Pacific pocket mouse to category 1 status. Category 1 comprises taxa for which the Service has on file sufficient information to support proposals for endangered or threatened status. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Pacific pocket mouse should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Pacific pocket mouse ( Perognathus longimembris pacificus ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. Although originally known from eight locales, the Pacific pocket mouse now occurs in one site on the Dana Point Headlands of Dana Point in Orange County. Although the Dana Point Headlands have remained relatively unchanged since the Pacific pocket mouse was first detected at this locale, a land development project has been approved by the Planning Commission, with final approval anticipated in early 1994. This proposed residential and hotel complex project would result in the removal of 3.65 acres of the 3.75 acres of habitat that Brylski (1993) identified as being occupied by Pacific pocket mice (EDAW 1993b). Grading that would destroy the only known Pacific pocket mouse population may proceed upon final approval of the proposed project. This site is also threatened by fuel modification for fire protection. In Los Angeles County, two of the three historic locales for the Pacific pocket mouse (Clifton and Wilmington) have been developed, and the third (Marina del Rey/El Segundo) has been substantially altered since the species was last detected there. Recent surveys have been unsuccessful in relocating the species in the vicinity of Marina del Rey or El Segundo. The Hyperion area, which formerly contained relatively large expanses of coastal strand and wetland habitats, has been extensively developed. In Orange County, the development of the Spyglass Hill area began in 1972. This development resulted in the destruction of the formerly occupied habitat at that site.
