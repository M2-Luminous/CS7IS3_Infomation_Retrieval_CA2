FBIS4-27462 "dreas106_i_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Cambodia Paper Reports on Poipet Market, Other Issues Paper Reports on Poipet Market, Other Issues BK2705141294 BK2705141294 BFN [Editorial Report] On 27 May, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reports on page 4 the following in its business section: On the halt to delivery of goods from Thailand in the wake of the burning on the Cambodian side of the Poipet border market, the paper says some goods from the market arrived in Phnom Penh on 23 and 24 May. Recently, Cambodian and Thai provincial-level delegations held talks on reopening the border pass, but they were not able to arrive at a decision. Reopening the Poipet market is vitally important because commodity prices in Phnom Penh markets have gone up exorbitantly since it closed. Concerning a new 10% tax on rents collected from houses rented to foreigners or international organizations, the paper quotes an official at a Phnom Penh tax office as saying the tax will be implemented in early June. According to the municipal tax office, the reason the Finance Ministry has imposed the tax is, that collecting taxes on rent earned from renting houses to foreigners, doing business, or working in Cambodia was extremely difficult in the past as most landlords were unwilling to pay. As for the planned exportation of Angkor beer, the daily quotes Jame Fong, marketing manager of the Malaysian Cambrew company producing and distributing Angkor beer, as saying that next year the company will start exporting the beer to Japan, other Asian countries, the United States, Australia, France, and Great Britain. Commenting on the currency exchange market in Phnom Penh, the paper says that since the announcement of the king's departure on 18 May, the rate of the Cambodian currency has begun to swell from 2,590 to 2,600 riels a dollar. Between 22 and 25 May, $1 could fetch as much as 2,645 riels. The precipitous decrease in the value of the riel, it adds, is caused by the political situation, which has become confused since a demonstration was planned to disrupt the National Assembly and since fighting erupted in various provinces. On the expansion of Shell oil company operations, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA says the firm has spent $6 million to rent and restore a fuel depot in Sihanoukville. In the past few months, the paper continues, Shell signed with Cambodian Airlines an agreement on construction of a $3-million fuel depot at Pochentong Airport for storing aviation fuel. Shell has also been building service stations along all national routes.
