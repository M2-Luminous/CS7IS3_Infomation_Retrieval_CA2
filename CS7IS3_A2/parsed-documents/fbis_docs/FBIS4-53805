FBIS4-53805 "dreas098_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 South Korea IAEA Inspections Proceeding Without Problems IAEA Inspections Proceeding Without Problems SK2005002794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0010 GMT 20 May 94 SK2005002794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, May 19 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are continuing their activities at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the area, it was reported Thursday [19 May]. Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to separate the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later inspection have not been confirmed, sources said. The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added. The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other way, they said. "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the reactor are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks," one source said. Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude. Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.
