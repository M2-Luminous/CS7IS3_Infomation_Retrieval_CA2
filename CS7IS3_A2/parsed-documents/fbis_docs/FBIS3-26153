What are the advantages of implementing the new taxation system? How great an impact will it have on foreign-funded enterprises? With all these questions in mind, I interviewed Xu Yongfu, senior researcher in the economic research department of the Bank of China's Hong Kong and Macao Management Office. The Two Old Taxation Systems Have Their Own Shortcomings Xu Yongfu said that in the past, China implemented "one country, two taxation systems." That is, speaking in terms of circulation tax, for foreign-funded enterprises a unified industrial and commercial tax was levied; and for enterprises set up with domestic funds, since 1984, a number of taxes such as value added tax [VAT], product tax, and business tax have been levied, leading to different tax burdens on foreign-funded and domestic-funded enterprises. The abovementioned two taxation systems have their own shortcomings. For example, the unified industrial and commercial tax was implemented as early as 1958. At that time, the enterprises' productive ability and technological levels were relatively low and, although the tax included 108 tax items and 141 tax rates, it still failed to include many commodities. In particular, since China began to import foreign funds in large amounts, many new commodities could not be found among the tax items, to the extent that some special rules had to be established for them but this lacked adequate legal basis. As for the VAT which is levied on domestic-funded enterprises, it is levied only in the production domain and not in others; this is not in accordance with the prevailing international practice and is not conducive to the mass and professional style of social production. Nor is it adapted to the adjustment of investment structure and the needs of economic development. The New Taxation System Will Not Have a Great Impact on Foreign- Funded Enterprises "Implementation of the new circulation tax seems to have some effect on foreign-funded enterprises but actually the effect will not be great," Xu Yongfu explained. The old unified industrial and commercial tax had a tax rate ranging from 1.5 to 69 percent, generally it was 5 to 10 percent, whereas within the new circulation tax, the tax rate for a majority of tax items falling into VAT is 17 percent; the tax rate of consumption tax ranges from 3 to 45 percent; and the tax rate of business tax ranges from 3 to 5 percent. Judged superficially, the new taxation system will cause some foreign-funded enterprises to pay additional taxes. However, in reality, after the implementation of the new taxation system in China, the overall revenue will not increase but, in concrete terms, different enterprises will experience different conditions. Xu Yongfu thought that within the new taxation system, the business tax will not have a great impact on foreign-funded enterprises and that the consumption tax is mainly targeted on expensive consumer goods, which in the past were also subject to a higher tax rate under the unified industrial and commercial tax. Therefore the impact will not be great. What will be affected most perhaps will be VAT. VAT Has a Direct Bearing on the Tax Burdens on Foreign-Funded Enterprises Xu Yongfu said that the ratio of effect on the tax burdens on foreign-funded enterprises caused by VAT which is within the new circulation tax, is 40:30:30, that is, 40 percent of these enterprises will see their tax burdens remain unchanged, 30 percent of them will experience an increase, and 30 percent will have a decrease. He said that the unified industrial and commercial tax which was collected from foreign-funded enterprises in the past, was levied on various links such as imports, production, and sales and the tax collection method was to take the tax-included price as the tax base and this increased the tax burden. Although VAT under the new taxation system is also levied on various links, the tax levied on a former link can be calculated with relation to VAT on a latter link for a reduction. Therefore, under the unified industrial and commercial tax, even if a certain enterprise enjoys a tax rate which is lower than 17 percent, due to taxes levied on various links, the tax burden on the enterprise might be higher than the 17 percent relating to VAT. It Can Help China To Rejoin GATT Xu Yongfu said that the purpose of standardizing the circulation tax for foreign-funded and domestic-funded enterprises in China is to conform to the prevailing international practice. He said that GATT demands its signatories give foreign-funded enterprises the treatment enjoyed by their citizens and this includes duties and rights. In the area of duties, foreign-funded enterprises must shoulder tax burdens identical to the ones shouldered by domestic-funded enterprises; in the area of rights, restrictions on the business of foreign-funded enterprises must be lifted, step by step, and more opportunities must be provided for them. For example, we restricted foreign-funded banks from operating renminbi business in the past and one of the reasons was that the tax burdens on foreign-funded and domestic-funded banks were different. Xu Yongfu pointed out that, in general, implementation of the new system of circulation tax in China will not cause a heavier tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises. On the contrary, VAT stipulates that all the exports are free from tax and this will lighten the tax load of the foreign firms which have set up factories on the mainland. He also stressed that China will implement the new company tax regulations this year but this is mainly to standardize the income tax rates for enterprises of different nature in the country and will not affect the preferential tax policy enjoyed by foreign-funded enterprises. Inside the special economic zones and the development zones, foreign firms will still be able to enjoy the preferential 15 percent income tax policy as well as the favorable "two waivers and three reductions" which they have enjoyed up to now.
