On the contrary, they have hit the civilian population, especially in Vojvodina, extremely hard, deprived the warring parties of equal opportunities and caused Hungary's economy a loss of $1.3 billion. For this reason, the embargo policy needs to be reconsidered and, if need be, a new sanctions system has to be introduced, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Csoti of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF) told reporters in Budapest on Monday [31 January]. Csoti stressed that, despite the ensuing losses, Hungary will continue to observe the sanctions imposed by the international community. He denied that Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade has anything to do with calls for reconsidering the embargo. "Hungary has nothing to talk about with Serbia concerning the embargo, nor should the lifting of sanctions be initiated by Budapest alone," csoti added. "It is mainly a question of effectiveness. The embargo has proven futile so far," he said. He admitted that he has no idea what kind of a new system should replace the present sanctions. Csoti recalled that Hungary's association agreement with the European Union will come into effect tomorrow, opening new prospects for the country's development. He proposed that Budapest immediately start preparations for becoming a full-fledged EU member, and file its application as soon as possible so that genuine talks can start in 1996. Csoti considers it important for Hungary to get involved in the work of the EU's political institutions. In addition, Hungary should press for the Western European Union to grant a status corresponding to associate membership for Hungary and Poland in its June general assembly, he said. Evaluating Hungary's relationship with neighbouring countries, Csoti said that bilateral ties with four of Hungary's seven neighbours are free of problems, and there are no obstacles to the development of friendly contacts. Unfortunately, this is not true for ties with Slovakia, Romania and Serbia. Hungary's foreign policy towards these states should seek historical reconciliation, he said. However, good relations are only conceivable if ethnic minorities are allowed to exercise their right of self-determination and their collective rights, Csoti said. He mentioned South Tyrol and the Swedish minority in Finland as proper examples. Csoti pointed out that the Hungarian minorities living in neighbouring countries have declared their efforts for autonomy in a responsible and civilized way which is recognized by the world public. In Csoti's view, Hungary should always stand prepared to hold talks and forge agreements with its neighbours, but this policy should not go to the minorities' detriment. "This does not mean that Hungary gives an ultimatum to its neighbours. We only expect Slovakia and Romania to observe the rather lenient recommendations of the Council of Europe," Csoti said.
