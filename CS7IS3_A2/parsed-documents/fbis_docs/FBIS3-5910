According to the National Plant Quarantine Service on Friday, 74,520,000 tons of imported grains and special crops were found unacceptable. The amount accounted for 44.1 percent of the total brought into the country last year. By item, the "unacceptable" goods represented 75 percent of the total corn imported last year, 74.3 percent of raw coffee, 38.7 percent of sesame, 35.1 percent of red bean, 33.3 percent of soy bean, and 8.9 percent of wheat.

The imported items discarded last year included 502 tons of acorns and 309 tons of dried fernbrakes, both from China, and 28 tons of grapefruits from the United States.
