The agenda for his talks with Boris Yeltsin is known: questions of security in Europe and the world, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and settlement of regional conflicts, questions of bilateral relations, mutual exchange of information on the development of the countries they represent. On learning of the visit in advance, the Ukrainian leadership tried to amend it, proposing that Clinton visit Ukraine. The Washington Administration explained to the Ukrainians that President Clinton considers it more expedient to visit the capital of Belarus, which is unconditionally fulfilling the international pledges it has made on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. And Washington sees this as a most important principle in the creation of a system of collective security in Europe ad in the world as a whole. The content of what were unsuccessful talks for the Ukrainian leadership was made public. This resounding diplomatic slap in the face showed who is master of the present situation. It was made clear to Kiev officials that Washington is not merely unhappy with Kiev's behavior, but is annoyed and does not consider it necessary to conceal its annoyance. What is this unusual situation all about? [passage omitted] The world community's concern is understandable. Following the breakup of the USSR, 130 SS-19 ICBM's, each with six warheads, 46 modern missiles, each with 10 warheads, 564 cruise missiles, and 30 strategic bombers with 416 warheads on board were left on the territory of the Ukraine. That makes 1,656 warheads in all. That is greater than the French, British, and Chinese nuclear arsenals put together. So Ukraine is the world's third biggest nuclear power (after the United States and Russia). In Ukraine's current conditions of political instability this nuclear potential could be a threat to European security. The public in neighboring countries knows, for example, that the founding session of the Ukrainian National Fascist Party took place in December in the Officers' Club in Lvov. It said that its aim is the forcible expansion of Ukrainian borders by conquering part of the territory of Russia, Belarus, Poland, and the Baltic states. We know how nervous the West was when it heard the results of the elections in Russia and of Zhirinovskiy's party's success in them. What if the elections in Ukraine in March follow the Russian model?... Of course, the situation does not appear dangerous at the moment. As is known, not a single missile in Ukraine can be launched without Russia's consent, since the keys to the launch codes are in Moscow. But it is also known that Ukrainian specialists have been trying secretly for a year to decipher the codes. What if they decipher them and start blackmaining the West in an attempt to extort financial compensation? The United States is obviously seriously concerned about this prospect, aware of the true reasons why Kiev is clinging to the nuclear weapons. It was obviously no accident when John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, recently let drop that defense against Russia is certainly not the reason why Kiev wants to keep the nuclear weapons on its territory. Is that not why Bill Clinton himself telephoned Leonid Kravchuk on 30 November to complain about Ukrainian policy in the sphere of its position on nuclear weapons? Russia's position on this question is clear and it has been repeatedly expressed by President Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev: Ukraine must not join the club of nuclear powers. To all appearances, we are at one with the leading powers of the West, in particular the United States, on this question. The United States and Russia are not shutting Kiev out of a dialogue on this question. According to the information that is available, although Clinton has refused to go to Kiev during his Jaunuary trip, he will allow the organization of a tripartite meeting involving the three presidents on the question of dismantling Ukraine's nuclear missiles. So it is very possible that Leonid Kravchuk will be invited to Moscow during the 12-15 January period.
