The talks are expected to be characterised by "requests for clarifications" before the two sides draw the mechanisms for the implementation of the accord, particularly that the PLO signed an economic agreement with Israel in April after months of negotiations in Paris. Officials said the talks would go deep into the practical implementation of the Jan. 7 Jordan-PLO accord and that the Kingdom's delegates would be seeking clarifications on the implications for Jordan of the Paris accord. Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO, and five other Palestinian economists are expected to be in the PLO delegation to the talks. Describing the Jan 7 agreement as a "broad framework agreement," PLO officials told the JORDAN TIMES in Jerusalem that the two sides should now negotiate a detailed Jordanian-PLO economic accord based on the previous broad framework. They said amendments may be needed in the accord in light of the new powers Palestinians have gained in the Paris economic talks with Israelis. "There are answers and details that we would like to have from the Palestinian negotiators," said an official, adding that only then "can we, in Jordan, play a positive role to serve the Palestinian people on a scientific and acceptable basis that also protects Jordanian and Palestinian interests." This and other senior officials said Jordan needs to clarify details of the PLO-Israel agreement and other economic arrangements that the PLO had struck before the Kingdom draws up a detailed accord with the PLO. The quest for these clarifications carries in its folds many of the fears that Jordanian officials have been trying to keep hidden pending the arrival of Mr. Quray' in Jordan. These fears began when the PLO signed the Oslo agreement with Israel without prior consultation with Jordan and have been repeatedly underlined since that time as the PLO shied away from committing itself to anything with Jordan before concluding its negotiations with Israel. Repeatedly since then, Jordanian officials have been asking the PLO to coordinate its steps with the Kingdom to avoid hurting the interests of Jordan but at the same time had tried to extend support to the Palestinian negotiators so as not to undermine their negotiations with Israel. At one time, His Majesty King Husayn issued an ultimatum to the PLO calling on it to coordinate an economic agreement with Jordan by a set date or all coordination would be called off. In response, the Palestinians showed up on the set deadline date and reached the Jan. 7 agreement with Jordan, setting out a general framework for economic cooperation that at the time was seen as "a letter of intent" rather than a binding agreement. When the details of the PLO-Israel economic agreement were first announced, Jordan officially welcomed the agreement as having achieved "symbols of sovereignty for the Palestinians." Minister of Finance Sami Qummuh at the time told the JORDAN TIMES that the PLO should be credited for making gains that underline its independence and he rejected charges that the PLO-Israel agreement contradicted the agreement reached with Jordan. However, other officials had expressed reservations about the agreement and questioned its ramifications on Jordan. Mr. Quray', aware of the Jordanian fears, sought to dispel them by making statements at the time denying that the agreement annulled the Jordan-PLO economic agreement. "It looks like the Palestinians kept us at bay with an unbinding economic agreement until they went and strengthened their hand with the Israel-PLO Paris agreement," economist Fahd al-Fanik said. "They feel that they have a stronger bargaining position with this Paris agreement," he said, adding that Jordan "now has the choice of taking it or leaving it." Another economist, who asked he not be named, said that the PLO move to force Jordan's hand with the Paris agreement and asking Jordan to agree to a "compatible" agreement with it "is an attempt to force us into Benelux-type arrangements." Benelux, a 1960 agreement creating economic integration between Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg, is an idea that was floated as an option for a similar arrangement between Jordan, Palestinian territories and Israel. "The Palestinian negotiator is trying to make the Jordanian decisionmaker consider the idea of economic integration similar to Benelux in terms of making the Jordan-PLO agreement compatible with the Israel-PLO agreement," the economist said. "It is very clear that PLO-Israel agreement should not be used as a pressure card against Jordan," he said. The Lower House of Parliament's Finance Committee, apparently in response to the fears created by the Paris agreement in economic circles in Jordan, has requested copies of both the Israel-PLO economic agreement and the Jordan-PLO agreement as well as the Oslo and Cairo agreements. 'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, head of the Finance Committee, told the JORDAN TIMES Monday that this request came to "hold the proper discussions with the government and concerned officials and draw a policy that will reflect constructively on the Jordanian and the Palestinian people." "There is fear that the Jordan-PLO agreement has become a subsidiary agreement to the PLO-Israel agreement," Mr. Abu al-Raghib said "when this appears to be the case, it can only draw suspicion and depression in economic circles," he added. Mr. Abu-al-Raghib agreed with Jordanian officials that "proper elaboration of what happened in Paris is needed." Otherwise, he added, "Jordan's mixed economy can only suffer and this will reflect negatively on the people both Palestinian and Jordanian." "As representatives of the people we cannot sit back and watch," he said, making an appeal that the interest of the people be dealt with "the highest and utmost responsibility and patriotism." "Otherwise it will reflect negatively on both sides," he said.
