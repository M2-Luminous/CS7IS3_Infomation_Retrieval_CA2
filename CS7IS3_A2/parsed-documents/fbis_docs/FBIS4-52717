Noting that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty [NPT] has not stopped nuclear proliferation but has become a cause of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the appeal stressed that the signatories to the NPT must not extend the period of its validity but ban the nuclear weapons as illegal and place all plutonium and other fissionable materials under international safeguards for ever. It said that with a view to proceeding to a universal and comprehensive disarmament, all the nations must give up nuclear weapons and the United States must fully play its role in reducing its nuclear arsenal, beginning with the complete withdrawal from northeast Asia of its nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed and nuclear-capable warships.
