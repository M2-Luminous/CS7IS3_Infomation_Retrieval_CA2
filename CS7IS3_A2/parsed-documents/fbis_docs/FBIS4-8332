This animated picture of party life became obvious after the government reshuffle of 6 March this year, and some political observers see it as a direct effect of the changes made by Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu, considered to have dissatisfied all the parliamentary political forces. Two weeks after the reshuffle, two leading polling institutions were reporting a redistribution of the electorate's preferences. Though susceptible of interpretations as interests were dictating, the results of the two opinion polls revealed a slight advance of the opposition on the ruling party, and practically spread among Romanian voters the idea of early elections. Asked about such a development, many political leaders said early elections were untimely. Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Social Democracy Party (PDSR), and speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, was saying on 29 March that calling early elections "would block Romania's political and economic functioning." He was also saying that what the polls seemed to indicate was that the ruling party was still enjoying a high degree of popularity, even if the opposition's hold was increasing. Close to this point of view was Corneliu Coposu's (National Peasant Christian Democratic Party-PNTCD) assessment that "early elections would be noxious for romania, they would halt the on-going of the reform, would entail huge expenses, and would carry a pretext for social troubles." Concomitantly, the leadership of PDSR started, in mid-March, a series of meetings with its local organizations in Transylvania and in the counties of Buzau, Bacau, Ploiesti. PDSR's executive president explained this as an activization of its branches, and denied that his contacts in the province had electoral purposes. The following days, however, the parties allied with PDSR, and among them were the National Unity Party (PUNR), and the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), started a touring campaign in the territory, or scheduled such activities for the period following. in the meantime, the leadership of the ruling party continued its meetings with opposition parties, initiated by its honorary president, Oliviu Gherman, on 4 February this year through a letter sent to PNTCD, Democratic Party-PD(FSN), PAC, Social-Democratic Party (PSDR), and to the independent group which titles itself "A Future for Romania." The overt intention of the ruling party is that the negotiations proposed help reach a political pact, apt to bring to light the best solutions for the problems of the transition period. The Saturday, 9 April dailies were writing about a meeting PDSR was planning to have with Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania (PDAR) this week, an opportunity for the small parliamentary supporter of the ruling party to claim the agriculture portfolio, commentators say. It was also at the end of last week that three party documents surprisingly had something in common: They were all pleading for the necessity of political compromise. The ruling party launched the initiative of "the pact for national consensus," which maintains that the present internal and international context, the world and European developments of the moment "compel all the political parties and conglomerates that claim to pursue the good of this country to join solidary on the platform of national consensus." PD(FSN) launched the "Statement of Oradea", and the Democratic Convention of Romania (CDR), the largest opposition bloc, issued a "Manifesto for the Salvation of Romania." The plea for national consensus by parties of different leanings is something new for the political life of Romania after December 1989, so far "stimulated" more by party interests rather than national interests, often sacrificed for the sake of the former.
