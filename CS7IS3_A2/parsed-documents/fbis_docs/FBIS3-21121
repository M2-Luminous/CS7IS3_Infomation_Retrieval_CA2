Next, Mr. Matsuno of Compaq Computer gave a lecture about Notebook PCs and TFT-LCDs from the user's point of view. In order to accelerate sale of the color Notebook PC that is expected to show sharp growth, there remain major issues to resolve including: reduced cost for color LCDs, improvement of screen image, complete software, and lower power consumption. Also, the size of the next generation standard LCD will be determined by: cost efficiency, technical constraints (LCD makers), price, maximum dimensions, stable supply (PC makers), price, and the demand for large screens (PC users). Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba gave a lecture focusing on the manufacturing line structure and relooking at the cost of parts and materials for the second term. According to a study done by Toshiba, it was verified that there is the ``possibility of faster production than first term'' by looking at the specification of four multiphases, and tripled production investment based on glass baseboards of 360 x 465, multi-sheet equipment, and automation. If the number of production lines equipped for different generation production necessary to meet the demand for TFT-LCD is set as one (4 lines) for the first term, then it is viewed that the second term will be three times (12 lines) and third term will be over five times. Mr. Morimoto at NEC gave a lecture about second term line structure. For the first term, although emphasis was placed on the verification of creation and mass production for the TFT market, there are some reconsiderations left before pursuing sharply increased mass production. For this reason, he mentioned the need for: 3-4 times higher manufacturing lines than in the first term, secured and improved quantity from manufacturing, realization of reasonable price, and establishment of a TFT-LCD manufacturing base. Mr. Nakada of Sharp gave a lecture about the status and issues regarding equipment for a second line. The scenario of ¥50 thousand by 1995 involves, ``twice the productivity, and 80% performance level reducing idling time, and the reduction of material cost by half.'' That is to say, the keys for the second term are: (1) improved production by multiphase; (2) improvement for idling time by employing shorter processing and dust control; (3) batch vs. piece, improvement and selection of inline method vs multichamber method; (4) improvement for high speed and high quality film throughput. Concrete Solutions Suggested by Each Material Maker In the afternoon the panel discussion adopted the debate format, and the status of each material and approach to the low cost regarding color filter, LCD driver, glass baseboard, and blacklight were discussed. In the discussion, at the request of LCD makers, each material maker talked about their projections from now on. 1. Color Filter (CF) Chairman, Mr. Fukazu of Toshiba opened the session, and indicated that CF takes 30% in logic material cost, which is disadvantageous for lowering the cost of LCDs. It is necessary to study improvement of idling time and investment production, and the possibility of new methods. In response to this, Mr. Nakano of Toppan Printing indicated, ``in actual cost of CF, the ratio between black matrix (BM) and glass baseboard is quite large. By improvement of performance in low reflection, improvement of through-put, interface with large model, and atomization of the inspection process, a cost reduction of 40% is our aim.'' Mr. Tsuda of Dainippon Ink said that reduction of processes such as elimination of BM, and improvement of performance are under study. Dainippon Ink is currently constructing a new plant scheduled to begin operation in 1994, and the company will employ a four phase interface which will increase the performance by 3 to 4 times. Mr. Yasukawa of Shinto Painting specializing in STN talked about the company's plan to increase production in 1994, and in the beginning of 1995, at that time STN will complete its phase, the company intends to plan mass production of TFT-LCD by electrodeposition. LCD makers welcomed the newcomer. Each CF maker indicated a 60-80% price reduction by 1995. Also standardization for glass baseboard was requested. 2. LCD Driver Chairman Mr. Kato of NEC pointed out that LSI cost structure ratio in TFT-LCD used for the PB98 Notebook is 30%, and the cost is high next to CF which is about 40%. Also, doubt about the possibility of high performance and low cost were evident. Mr. Sano of Sharp representing the driver cited: (1) low LCD operation voltage (15V 5V); (2) digital LCD operation; (3) minute wafer processes; (4) minute pitch; (5) multiple outputs. Furthermore slim TCP packaging was also cited. Responses from Mr. Aoki of NEC, Mr. Takagi of Toshiba, and Mr. Takuma from Japan Texas Instruments were almost the same. Reduction of chip size will continue and discussion about packaging still left some issues to resolve. 3. Glass Baseboard Mr. Iwai of Corning Japan which has quite a large market share cited: (1) improvement of solvent, molding, processing, and inspection techniques; (2) large original board size; (3) thin board; (4) eliminating grinding; (5)eliminating annealing. Mr. Iwai indicated that it is possible to realize a 50-60% cost reduction by adopting the above. Mr. Makino of NH Techno Glass, a newcomer, indicated that an annual 10% reduction by eliminating the complete grinding process; and Mr. Hara of Asahi Glass Fine Techno indicated 20% cost reduction by 1995 by eliminating annealing and using a thin baseboard. As a request to LCD makers, not only standardization of baseboard size, but standardization of other specifications were cited. Also other opinions were expressed, indicating that especially the method of inspection must be intensified from now on, and standardization is urgently needed. 4. Back Light (BL) Although BL is most active in the four material groups, to fulfill 1/3 of the goal and 1/2 of the cost cut are quite difficult. Already types are limited to short axial single light types for black and white, and long axial single light for color. Mr. Kojima of Chaya Industry indicated that ``power consumption is reduced from 5W to 2.4 W.'' Also ``a complete automated inspection process will be realized by 1995,'' said Mr. Kojima. The other solutions he cited included the development of material technology for standardization, automation line (Toshiba), review of production system, improvement and efficiency of mass production of optical conductor baseboard and invertor circuitry, review of each material for BL and improvement and effect of total material technology. Danger Of Seeking Only Low Cost As a closing statement, Mr. Horikiri of NEC gave a lecture. ``TFT-LCD especially still has a problem of stable production largely due to idling. Still the product has not yet reached the mass production level. But stable supply by second term production structure is important,'' mentioned Mr. Horikiri. Also he said that material cost ``has been cut in half in the past two years. To lower the cost, it is necessary to approach the cost aspect at a design stage.'' This time, concrete solutions for low cost were suggested by each maker. Issues to solve such as the specification and standardization of glass baseboard and other materials were left to LCD makers. Response to these issues will be the key to explore ¥50 thousand by 1995. At last, Mr. Kanetani of Sharp pointed out, ``most of all marketability and a commercial base are important, and unless the configuration for a commercial product in 1995 is understood, the debate this time will have been nothing but nonsense.''
