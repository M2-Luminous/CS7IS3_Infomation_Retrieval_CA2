The press service of the President of the Russian Federation has distributed the text of this address: Address to the Ingush and Chechen peoples: Esteemed compatriots! Today, on the tragic anniversary of the deportation 50 years ago of the Ingush and Chechen peoples, I offer you my sincere condolences and sympathy. The Ingush and the Chechens became the victims of the criminal arbitrary measures taken by Stalin and Beriya. It is particularly incredible that it took place when the best sons of the Vaynakh people were displaying their heroism and loyalty to their patriotic duty alongside other peoples of Russia at the front in the Great Patriotic War. It is also a terrible truth that totalitarianism implanted "delayed-action mines" in interethnic relations. Unfortunately, they have started to explode in our times of nascent democratic change. This is especially felt in the case of the Ossetian-Ingush tragedy. I mourn with you over the victims of the armed conflict, and share the grief of those who have lost family and close ones, who are looking for a roof over their heads. I want to assure you that it has been and remains my goal and concern to eradicate the grave consequences of the tragic events. With this in mind, I signed a decree on 13 December 1993, the main aim of which was to return refugees and deportees to their original place of abode. We are firmly on the road to thorough democratic transformation, to creating a genuinely lawful, humane Russian state. We are coming up against quite a few obstacles and problems, one of which is the unresolved nationalities issue, whose seriousness, even existence, were practically ignored before. The Northern Caucasus, where dozens of peoples live in a small area, remains the most difficult region today in this respect. But problems can only be solved by political means, with armed force ruled out. I am convinced that democratic Russia is capable of resolving any issue for the sake of a better future for its peoples and for each citizen. One confirmation of this is the Law "On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples", which lays down the legal bases for the restoration of historic justice. The federal bodies of state power have directed much effort at improving the situation in the Northern Caucasus. The right of the Ingush and Chechen peoples to an independent national state system in the Russian Federation has been restored. They have been given the same opportunities for development as other peoples of the Russian Federation on the basis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Russian Federation Constitution. The situation now is that you yourselves must move forward towards national revival in all spheres of public life by patiently settling disputed issues with your neighbors on the basis of mutual accord. You can count on the help and wholehearted support of the Russian president, the federal bodies of state power and of all peoples of the Russian Federation. I am convinced that it is only through democracy and firm constitutional law and order, without legal excesses or lawlessness, but using the wise traditions of Caucasian peoples tested over centuries, that peace and interethnic accord can be achieved in the North Caucasian region along with calm and wellbeing in every Ingush and Chechen family.
