He called for further Japanese investment in the country's booming market. With a 28 percent share of Chinese high-tech imports, Japan is China's most important supplier of modern technology, Zhu told a news conference. This is not only a "very important factor" for China's economic development, but it also benefits Japan's economy by strengthening the competitiveness of Japanese products in the world market, he said. Zhu arrived Wednesday for a nine-day trip to drum up Japanese investment and support. Know-how transfer through Japanese production in China is what benefits both sides most, said Zhu, pointing to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.'s production of heads for video recorders at a plant in Beijing. Japan-China trade soared by 54 percent to 39 billion dollars last year, but it nevertheless is "still small" considering the potential of China's huge market, he said. Zhu, who also heads the central bank, played a major role in the drafting of a comprehensive reform package introduced at the beginning of this year. Since the start of Chinese market reforms in 1979, Japan has provided Beijing with trillions of yen in loans through its overseas development assistance program. Another 819 billion yen have been allotted for the 1990-95 term. As part of the ambitious modernization program, the country's burdensome state-owned sector will be privatized along different lines, including selling them off to foreign companies, Zhu said. Already, two-thirds of them are in the red. Beijing also is considering mutual stockholding as practiced by many Japanese companies, he said. However, for the time being most companies will be turned into ordinary corporations and not into stock-holding companies. Zhu said Beijing is eager to avoid the occurrence of the asset-inflated economy of the late 1980s that afflicted Japan. Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will help gradually increase the central government's revenue share from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by 2000. While the provinces grew rich over the last decade by pocketing more levies, the falling tax revenue has left the central government with a cumulative budget deficit of 400 billion yen (70 billion dollars). Zhu, dismissing allegations that local governments will try to defend their vested interests, said Beijing has their full support for the reallocation of tax revenue. Zhu said he is confident that the Chinese yuan eventually will become a fully convertible currency. The yuan's value has been stable since the introduction of a single, market-oriented foreign exchange rate on January 1 and "will continue to be stable," he said. Zhu, who leaves Saturday for the Kansai region, has had a busy schedule in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, and a number of former prime ministers. He will visit the Kansai region to study Japanese corporate structures. He indirectly warned against inviting Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui to Tokyo saying that "the Taiwan question has always been a very sensitive matter" between Japan and China.
