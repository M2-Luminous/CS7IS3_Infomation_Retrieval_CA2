This was stated by an exponent of pan-Islamism, former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lt Gen (Retd) [retired] Hamid Gul while addressing a select gathering of the citizens here on Wednesday. The meeting was organised by the Citizens Action Committee. The former ISI chief, who played a pivotal role during the Afghan Jehad observed that now Pakistan should go nuclear. He said this could infuse a new life in the nation, which according to him was facing a decadence like situation. He said the Pressler Amendment is aimed at cutting off aid to a country which is following the nuclear option whereas it is not against those nations that have already acquired the nuclear capability. Advocating his case Gen Hamid Gul said by doing so Pakistan will stand at par with India when new nominations for the nuclear club may take place in 1995. Besides, he said, our best friends like China and Iran which consider us fast becoming American surrogate will come closer to us. The former ISI chief said a wave of re-awakening had run throughout the Islamic world. The secular world was falling apart and the secular philosophy, he said, had failed to hold the nations together. He said only Islam provided a basis for movement and mobilisation with a forward looking philosophy while secularism has no future. He said not the governments but the people of the Islamic world are coming closer for a common cause. [passage omitted]
