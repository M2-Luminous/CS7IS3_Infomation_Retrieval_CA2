Since the promulgation of the foreign investment law six years ago 895 foreign investment projects were licensed with total prescribed capital of USD [U.S. dollars] 8.5 billion. These investment projects involve more than 500 companies from 42 countries and territories. Of the 895 investment projects, 635 are joint ventures concentrated in three key areas: Ho Chi Minh City-Dong Nai-Vung Tau in the south Hanoi-Hai Phong-Quang Ninh in the north and Danang in the central. Thirty-nine of them belong to overseas Vietnamese with total registered capital of USD 72 million. The average of size of each project has increased rapidly from USD 3.5 million in the first years to USD 9.9 million in 1993. Up to now, the joint ventures with foreign investors have created goods and service valued at USD 780 million, provided nearly 50,000 jobs, and remitted to the state budget USD 211 million. Investment and cooperation have improved the capacity of many existing establishments of Vietnam. Moreover they have increased the capacity of some industrial branches, including transport, post and telecommunications, and hotel services. The telecommunications system in particular has been improved greatly creating favourable conditions for economic development in Vietnam as well as its all-round exchange with the world outside.
