According to Bespalov, forces of the Black Imam group played the leading role in the terrorist actions. General Bespalov described them as fanatical and exceptionally ferocious. The latest assault on Russian border guards was reported in Dushanbe on 24 June. Bespalov said that on orders from the Tajik opposition leaders and the commander-in-chief of the opposition forces Rezvon, opposition buildup continued in the Shuroabad, Darvaz and Bakhorak directions on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border. The Tajik opposition leaders issued orders for the Badakhshan group of forces to move from central Afghanistan to the border areas and eventually into Tajikistan. Iranian, Pakistani, and Saudi mercenaries had joined the Tajik fighting units. A field hospital for Tajik forces and mercenaries had opened in the Afghan city of Chakhiab. Nationals of Islamic countries worked on its staff, General Bespalov said. All that proved, Bespalov said, that the Tajik opposition leaders aimed to launch a new round of hostilities. Those who opposed moves for peace on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border and inside Tajikistan, he stressed, would be held responsible for escalating violence.
