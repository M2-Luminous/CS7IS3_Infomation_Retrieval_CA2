"The `consultation' conditions that the government is trying to impose on us are unacceptable (....) We will not put down our weapons until our demands are accepted," it is stated in the EZLN communique, written in four pages and sent to TIEMPO newspaper in San Cristobal, Chiapas State. The guerrilla members demand "recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force," a "cease-fire by both parties throughout the territory involved in the conflict," and the "withdrawal of federal troops from all the communities, with full respect for human rights." A communique from the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the EZLN also demands an end to the "indiscriminate bombardment of rural towns." "Our troops pledge to respect those conditions (cease-fire and others) if the federal government does likewise. Otherwise, our troops will continue to advance toward the country's capital," the EZLN emphasizes. The text also states: "Since 1 January this year our Zapatista troops began a series of political-military actions the goal of which is to let the people of Mexico and the rest of the world know under what conditions millions of Mexicans, particularly we the Indians, live and die." "The actions we started prove our decision to fight for our most basic rights through the only means left by the government authorities," the text adds. The rebels issued an appeal "to the U.S. Government and peoples. They ask the U.S. people to initiate actions of solidarity and support for our fellow citizens and ask the U.S. Government to suspend all economic and military assistance to the Mexican Federal Government, which is a dictatorial government that does not respect human rights, and because such aid will be used to massacre the peoples of Mexico." The guerrillas state that "our EZLN does not have in its ranks, its organization, or its leadership, any foreigner, nor has it ever received any support or advice from revolutionary movements of other countries or foreign governments." "The report that there are Guatemalans trained in the neighboring country in our ranks are stories invented by the federal government to undermine our cause," the communique states. The EZLN also rejected any links with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of El Salvador, or the church. "The EZLN commanders and troops are mostly Chiapas Indians. That is because we, the Indians, represent the most humiliated and dispossessed sector of Mexico," the communique says. It adds that the EZLN also includes Mexicans of other social levels and different states of our country." Commander "Marcos" who signed the communique asked the newspaper TIEMPO to release the document to national and international media.
