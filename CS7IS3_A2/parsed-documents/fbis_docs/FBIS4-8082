Supported by their artillery, Moslems attacked from Bugojno in the direction of Srbobran, central Bosnia, while the corridor and Serb positions near Brcko and Doboj bore the brunt of Moslem attacks in northern Bosnia. Early on Monday Moslem forces delivered a heavy mortar-infantry attack 7 km southwest of Brcko on Serb positions in the area of Ulice, Lukici and Lipovac, Bosnian Serb military sources said. Members of the Bosnian Serb army defending access points to Brcko and the corridor linking eastern and western Bosnia and the republic of Serb Krajina, responded to the attack and a lull followed in that part of the front along the River Sava valley. Moslem units are launching heavy attacks along nearly all directions around Doboj, the sources said. Moslem forces on Monday resumed unabated artillery attacks on the western positions on the Doboj front and its suburbs and residential areas. Except for a few observations by U.N. representatives that Moslems were undertaking offensive actions in the Doboj region and warnings to them not to provoke Serbs, there were no stronger reactions by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to a nearly two-week-long Moslem offensive on Doboj, Bosnian Serb sources said. The media attention was in that period focused on Gorazde, from which 10,000 Moslem troops mounted a fierce offensive and thus provoked the Serb counter-offensive. Serb positions and localities on the right bank of the River Bosna, from Zavidovici to Maglaj (south of Doboj), were a target of heavy infantry and mortar fire. Serb forces did not have any casualties and repulsed a stronger artillery-infantry attack in the Trebava front, northeast of Doboj. Moslem forces did not cease attacks on the Srbobran front either, from the direction of Bugojno in central Bosnia. Attacks were renewed along almost all sectors of the front in this area, Bosnian Serb military sources reported on Monday. Since the outset of the all-out Moslem offensive on the Bosnian Serb Republic mounted late in March, forces of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic have been trying to reopen the strategically important road to Jajce and western Bosnia, by breaking through Serb lines in the direction of Srbobran.
