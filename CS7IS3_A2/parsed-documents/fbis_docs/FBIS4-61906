We propose an interview with him. [Kobulia] Batono Vazha, if I may be so bold and begin by asking you a direct question: Why were you precisely chosen when the decision was adopted to extend to such a degree the functions and powers of the head of state's personal envoy in the Shida Kartli region? [Khachapuridze] Not only the functions and powers but also responsibilities (and this is the most important thing) have been considerably increased. Proceeding from the situation that has taken shape, this is fully justified. There is a real danger that the Georgian-Ossetian conflict could soon turn into a chronic Georgian disease. It is no secret that the war in Abkhazia and our internal political upheavals have ostensibly transformed events in former South Ossetia into a problem of secondary importance. The fact that there has apparently been no fighting here for some time has contributed to this. However, in reality, the situation has been getting more complex from day to day and...unfortunately, this is continuing. In addition, the psyche and mood of the region's Ossetian population is changing. In reality, many of them today no longer consider themselves to be Georgian citizens! If we delay things again, this process could acquire an irreversible character. Given that, let us say, former relations between the Ossetian population and the north [North Ossetia] are becoming stronger and more extensive by the day, immediate measures need to be adopted if we are not to lose forever this historic part of Georgia. This is not to mention such a common plague as drug addiction.... I will say without exaggeration that the struggle against Ossetian separatism could become child's play compared with the struggle against drug addiction. We let slip the opportunity to nip the drugs business in the bud (the Georgian Government at the time was faced with other vitally important problems); it has today turned into a monster that will be difficult to defeat. In short, the complexity and variety of the problems that need to be solved have necessitated extensive powers and considerable responsibility. As regards my appointment, probably one factor in this was that I come from Samachablo; I grew up there and began work there. I continue to have close contacts and relations with Georgian and Ossetian circles and am able to enter into dialogue with them, which is so essential today. One should also take into account that I have normal relations with the command of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the region.... [Kobulia] At the end of last year, our press wrote that you travelled to North Ossetia and established contacts with local sociopolitical circles. Are these contacts continuing? [Khachapuridze] Of course. While we were in Vladikavkaz, we had fruitful meetings with North Ossetian scholarly circles, parliamentarians, and representatives of the Georgian compatriots' association. We now plan to have another meeting but, this time, with the participation of CSCE representatives. We pin great hopes on this process. There are, after all, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Georgia in North Ossetia and the local leadership is extremely interested in a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The main thing is that everyone is clearly fed up with the "hot" or "cold" war.... [Kobulia] If it is not a secret, what position does Vladikavkaz hold regarding the question of the status of Samachablo? [Khachapuridze] I will begin by telling you that no one questions the territorial integrity of Georgia. As regards its general status, it is natural that the resolution of this political problem of state importance does not and cannot fall within the jurisdiction of the region's state plenipotentiary. The Constitution will decide this, taking into account the interests of all national minorities and all peoples living in Georgia in accordance with the recognized norms of international law. It does not accord with Georgia's interests if we fill our future statehood with new time bombs as the Bolsheviks did in the 1920's. Therefore, I believe that, taking into account every moment, Ossetian and Georgian specialists should discuss the status issue together; after all, one should not disregard the fact that more Ossetians live outside the former South Ossetian Oblast -- in the same Georgia -- than within it. What rights should Ossetians living in Tbilisi, Gori, Khashuri, Kareli, Akhmeta, or Lagodekhi have? In no way do we want them to have fewer rights than their compatriots in Tskhinvali or Java. I am not a lawyer but I do know that all Ossetians should enjoy equal rights in the future Georgia. Any other Georgia will not be a democratic state. [Kobulia] Your words have an optimistic ring about them. As can be seen, you view the future with hope. Upon what is this optimism based? After all, today's opposition blame the authorities for the loss of both Abkhazia and Samachablo. [Khachapuridze] What opposition does not blame the authorities for one thing or another? To what extent these accusations are justified is another question. It is a fact that our jurisdiction has become fiction in a number of regions of Georgia. However, I personally have no doubt that this is a temporary phenomenon. Take a look at our history. How often and for how long have we lost this or that territory? Didn't the amir [Muslim governor] have his residence in Tbilisi itself? God forbid that even the opposition should sincerely believe that Sukhumi or Tskhinvali have been lost forever. The Georgian nation will not forgive anyone -- neither the current authorities nor that opposition that could itself come to power tomorrow -- for the loss of Georgia's ancient land. This issue is a double-edged sword and any attempt to use it for narrow political motives is extremely risky. Finally, it is not a particular government but the country, the entire nation, and posterity that loses any territory. As regards specifically Samachablo, it is in no way "lost." If I did not believe this, I would not have assumed this post. I accepted it because I believed that Samachablo was and will be a part of Georgia where Ossetians and Georgians will live together. [Kobulia] We Georgians have difficulty in finding the "golden mean" everywhere and in everything. We have to go to either one extreme or the other. Now also, one part of society pins its hopes only on diplomacy and international organizations while the other believes that the only way of getting back Abkhazia and Samachablo is by force. As you have told us, you are opposed to violent methods. [Khachapuridze] As a person with a certain knowledge of politics (I do not wish to call myself a politician), I do not exclude violent methods in principle; in a certain situation, the interests of the state demand the use of force. After all, hasn't the United States often used force to establish order in the country? You remember how they dealt with the "Black Panthers." As regards our case, I believe that there are no prospects for resolving the Georgian-Ossetian conflict by force. Let us suppose that, with the help of external forces, ultranationalist and separatist forces on the Ossetian side would be able to maintain temporarily independence from Georgia. Then what? First, this would not constitute any kind of independence; even Vladikavkaz itself does not recognize them. Second, this would bring more misfortune to the Ossetian people! Likewise to us. If we use force to get Ossetians to accept conditions that do not correspond to their legal interests, this will also not be a guarantee of firm and lasting peace. The very first minor pretext will become a catalyst for renewed bloodshed, destruction, and a fresh flow of persecuted people; there can be no victor in a civil war and, likewise, one cannot neutralize once and for all relapses into civil war by force. Only a political approach and mutual agreement are acceptable here, when neither side feels that it is being deceived. Therefore, while there remains the slightest chance of settling the conflict by political means, I exclude any use of force. We should use our power and Ossetian power against the common enemy -- the drugs business and the drugs mafia. That is why we are calling upon the help of scholars and experts and I view this as a great force. Kalbatoni Marika Lortkipanidze and Batonebi Nodar Lomouri, Zurab Porakishvili, Levan Toidze, Soso Tsintsadze, and Levan Mataradze are already actively cooperating with us. [Kobulia] A final question: Today, we are talking in Tbilisi although any person will tell you that your place is in Tskhinvali. How long will it be, do you think, before we can meet and continue our chat in Tskhinvali? [Khachapuridze] Desire always exceeds reality. There is a difference between optimism and illusion. A great deal of work is necessary before a Tbilisian can freely go to Tskhinvali and feel safe. We are ready to do this work and we have elaborated a plan for this. This is no longer an illusion but optimism that is based on real factors. Ossetians from Tskhinvali, Java, and Akhalgori will arrive in Tbilisi without fear. This is how it was in the past and this is how it will be in the future. I will add that I have three daughters and I would like one at least to be married in her father's native region. You will see how many Ossetians will be my guests there.... [Kobulia] May God hear you!
