Boris Yeltsin Focuses on Peace and Food"] [Excerpt] Leaving Sochi on Sunday, the president singled out three objectives of primary importance that he is going to deal with right upon his return to Moscow -- the completion of the work on the mechanisms of implementing the presidential message to the parliament, the drafting of an agreement on civil peace, and the revision of new customs tariffs with a view to lowering them. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that a draft agreement, which had been drawn up by a group under Boris Topornin, director of the Institute of State and Law, was presented to Boris Yeltsin yesterday. Work on the mechanisms of implementing the presidential message is going on. As for food importers, they will apparently have to be patient. Boris Yeltsin To Revise Civil Peace Agreement "Version No. 0" of the Agreement on Civil Peace and Accord, which had been drawn up by Boris Topornin's group (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 26 March), was seriously revised last weekend. According to unofficial reports, the text of the draft agreement (which, in the drafters' view, should not be made public before it is studied by the president) has been cut to nearly one-half of its original size: many declaratory provisions, already set forth in the Constitution and Russian laws, have been deleted. There have been qualitative changes, too. The latest version of the "universal peace pact" as of yesterday no longer included the term "Third-Party Public Court," which, under initial plans, was to be made responsible for monitoring the implementation of the agreement and vested with the right publicly to demand that violators be removed from office or give up their deputy powers voluntarily. Now these functions have been given to the Conciliatory Commission, to be made up of representatives of the president, the government, State Duma factions, and political activists, and designed to work out mechanisms of the phased implementation of the agreement. The working group has decided that a two-year moratorium on amending the Constitution should not be included in the draft and that it will be replaced with the proposal that "changes destabilizing the situation in society not be made to the Constitution." Provisions regarding the moratorium on changing the status of regions and concluding bilateral treaties between them and the federal authorities have been retained, as has the trade unions' obligation not to call strikes for the purpose of reallocating budget revenues. It is hard to predict how much time Boris Yeltsin will need to comprehend the draft agreement and with which provisions of it he may disagree. At the same time, the question of the sequence of signing the agreement has not yet been resolved, and the Public Chamber's meeting to discuss it, initially scheduled for 2 April, will be postponed at least for a week, KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned.
