Chichelov, deputy director of the Department of the Tax Police of the Russian Federation, by Ivan Sas, under the rubric "Law"; place and date not given: "Do Not Take Too Much From the Bee. Can This Commandment of the Beekeeper Become a Commandment for the Tax Police?"] [Text] The Russian tax police is now two years old. Our interlocutor, Tax Police Lieutenant General Yuriy Vasilyevich Chichelov, deputy director of the Department of the Tax Police (DNP) of the Russian Federation, was among those who initiated the creation of this new law enforcement structure. [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, what caused your service to be created? [Chichelov] To understand the situation, let us mentally go back about two years and try to look at our reality through the eyes of the main enforcer of the law in the area of taxation--the tax inspector. These positions in state tax inspectorates were mainly held by women. What did it mean for the tax inspector to go and check out a so-called "commercial" or private company? It was quite an ordeal. Tax legislation was violated every step of the way, and then not in trifling ways but to the tune of millions or even billions concealed from taxation. Two ways for circumventing the law became the most common. The first was to bribe the tax inspector. The second was to intimidate the inspector. There were a great many scenarios for carrying out either one. It became obvious that the new system of taxation could not function effectively in the absence of a compact, well-equipped structure with the powers of a law enforcement organ that would be capable of putting an end to the rampage of crime in the sphere of tax legislation, offer protection to tax inspectors in the line of official duty, and prevent corruption in the tax organs. All of these tasks were entrusted to us. By now, we can say with complete confidence that the creation of the tax police was a farsighted and timely step. [Sas] However, Yuriy Vasilyevich, the number of violations of law in the area of tax legislation is growing.... [Chichelov] Unfortunately, this trend is gaining strength, which seriously concerns us. Nonetheless, the current situation is fundamentally different from the one that existed two years ago. At that time we just had to state the facts and throw up our hands. At present, both the criminal business and just dishonest taxpayers are forced to reckon with the fact of the existence of the tax police. It has already made its presence known as a major force. Look at the results of the operation of the federal organs of the tax police last year, for example. These organs, independently or jointly with the State Tax Service, uncovered and put an end to more than 32,000 violations of tax legislation. More than 600 criminal cases were initiated in conjunction with the concealment of income on both a large and particularly large scale. More than 1,000 enterprises and organizations were uncovered which were not even registered with the tax inspectorates, to say nothing about the payment of taxes. About 1 trillion rubles [R] was assessed for collection by the state budget, with the foreign exchange equivalent included, based on the results of independent audits and those carried out jointly with the State Tax Service. As of now, the tax police has 88 territorial organs of the tax police with more than 11,000 employees; in keeping with a decree of the government, this number will come to about 40,000 by the end of the year. [Sas] Not a whole lot for a country like Russia. In some Siberian rayon-seat town they will perhaps learn about the existence of the tax police only from the newspapers. Meanwhile, the situation needs to be controlled there, too. [Chichelov] You are right in that we indeed will not have an opportunity to establish our local organs in each rayon seat. However, this is not at all to say that no attention will be paid to the Russian backwaters. Now that you have touched on Siberia, I will also explain this by using an actual example. In Kemerovo Oblast there is the city of Berezovskiy. The operation of the local tax inspectorate there was actually paralyzed by October of last year by several criminal groups that controlled local commercial structures. The employees of the inspectorate were literally terrorized by continual threats. Seeing that they were getting away with everything, the criminals began to act on their threats. Setting fire to the apartment of the chief of the Berezovskiy GNI [State Tax Inspectorate] became the high point of the activity of the local mafia clan. For this reason, the DNP Directorate for Kemerovo Oblast, jointly with the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime of the Oblast Internal Affairs Administration, developed and executed an operation to normalize the situation in Berezovskiy with their own resources. The operations team also included the best trained employees of the State Automotive Inspectorate and GNI of the oblast. As a result, they succeeded in more than just straightening out the situation in the city. The operation that was carried out had a great preventive impact in other rayons of the oblast. I am driving at a simple truth: Crime should be combated by skill rather than by numbers. We bet here on two things--the supreme professionalism of our employees and the closest possible cooperation with the State Tax Service and other law enforcement organs. [Sas] Where do you get such professionals, given that, to my knowledge, nobody trains them in Russia to this day? [Chichelov] Complaints have already been voiced in some quarters about the department supposedly "luring away" the best cadres from other ministries and departments. However, this is not happening, and it never has. At the very beginning, small quotas for specialists on temporary assignment from the organizations of the former Ministry of Security and Ministry of Internal Affairs totaling about 1,000 people were given to us on instructions from the government. The Ministry of Defense detached to us more than 3,000 people. We did not set any conditions for anyone; we just took the people who were given to us. Later, we professionally trained them ourselves. The leadership of the department was the first to sit at the training desk. Take a look--here is my certificate of graduation from a special course of the Instruction and Information Center of the State Tax Inspectorate of the city of Moscow. [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, I see that you even had to take a test in accounting.... [Chichelov] The complexity of it is in the fact that the profession of tax policeman requires a combination of the most varied skills. As a rule, he should know finance, the credit system, and monetary circulation well in order to be head and shoulders above any accountant, if you will. On the other hand, he is a functionary of the law enforcement organs; he cannot do without substantial legal training. There are virtually no such ready-made professionals. This is why we have to train people. Naturally, former employees of "coercive" departments come here. We also hire experienced financiers and lawyers from among the civilian population. Of course, this is not to say that our doors are open to all. It is equally important for us that these are people with a high safety margin as far as morality goes. There have been new developments that are particularly pleasant for us: Not long ago it was resolved to open the Tax Police Institute using the facilities of the Finance Academy of the Russian Federation Government; classes will begin as early as this September. We are also opening our own center for training and retraining newly hired employees with a college education. [Sas] Yuriy Vasilyevich, the tax police needs incorruptible people. However, at present the popular view is that there are no such people, and the amount given is all that matters.... [Chichelov] Such cynicism is characteristic only of those who recognize no values other than money and wealth. Luckily people are still around for whom the notions of duty, honor, and conscience are not the least important ones. There is no dearth of relevant examples. Last year, only four criminal cases were instituted against the employees of the tax police for having taken bribes. Naturally, the continuation of service with us is out of the question for these individuals. [Sas] What is your assessment of the current tax legislation? What is necessary in order to change the situation? [Chichelov] An entire set of measures of an economic, legal, and organizational nature which would eliminate the very grounds for tax crimes and violations of law is necessary. The main trouble with tax legislation is that thus far it does not give incentives to the manufacturers of merchandise and services, and renders their efforts unprofitable. It is no accident that this was noted in the message of the Russian Federation president to the Federal Assembly. I recall a story by Agranovskiy Senior in which an old beekeeper applied the wisdom of beekeeping at the level of state policy. The first commandment of the beekeeper and the architect of state alike should be: Do not take too much away from the bee. Take as much as will motivate the beehive to labor, and not the other way around. At a difficult time, he should incur expenses himself but should feed the bee family. If he gets greedy, he will be left not only without honey but also without bees. The basket of the beekeeper whose bees prosper is always full.
