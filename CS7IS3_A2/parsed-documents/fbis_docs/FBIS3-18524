The Europeans are trying to mediate -- in their very own interest. In fact, compulsory measures by the United States against Japan in the sphere of trade policy would also affect the Europeans. In a trialogue among the major GATT countries, a solution must be found. President Clinton has announced "several trade measures" against Japan for March. During the meeting with Clinton, Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa was not ready to bow to pressure. However, there is still a possibility of "improving" the agreement and opening up the import markets to a greater extent. The 1993 Japanese-U.S. trade balance turned out to be fuel on the flames. The U.S. deficit increased by 20 percent to an alarming level of $59.3 billion. This corresponds to 50 percent of the entire U.S. deficit. In the Pacific dispute, Japan must show flexibility. In the meantime, Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced that Japan is preparing "emergency measures" to open up its market to a greater extent. They should be adopted before the next G-7 meeting at the end of the week, if possible. However, the secretary general of the government, Masayoshi Takemura, has dampened excessive hopes of the GATT partners. Tokyo continues to reject the U.S. demand for the stipulation of fixed quotas against which the level of market access can be measured. No additional spectacular concessions in the sphere of trade policies are to be expected from Tokyo. Yet Japan apparently wants to avoid an escalation in the dispute with the United States. The unilateral U.S. policy of pressure, which threatened "retaliatory measures" in the form of new import barriers and increased tariffs against Japan is rightly meeting with criticism from both the GATT secretariat and the European Commission in Brussels. The United States is a long way from applying the principles of liberalism in its own country that it demands from its trading partners, GATT pointed out. The main targets of criticism are the U.S. laws impeding imports, which are summarized under the name "Super 301." The number of complaints of the partners against the application of these laws adopted in 1988 (U.S. definition of dumping, ban on subsidies, and the adoption of retaliatory trade measures) is growing constantly. On the part of the European Union, its chief GATT negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, criticized above all the U.S. demand that Japan should guarantee the United States fixed market shares in certain areas (for mobile telephones, for example) in bilateral agreements. If these markets were only opened up for the United States, this would entail disadvantages for the European enterprises that want to export goods to Japan. In addition, the Japanese exporters would squeeze the products which they can not sell in their domestic market (because of the "guaranteed shares" for the Americans) into the tight European markets. After all, the trade deficit of the European Union vis-a-vis Japan has increased to $26 billion this year. Thus, the U.S. trade attack on Japan upsets the fragile triangle among the three major world trading powers. In any event, both the Americans and the Europeans did not negotiate successfully with and vis-a-vis Japan in the large GATT round. Tokyo skillfully hid in the shadow of the transatlantic quarrel about the liberalization of agricultural trade and the reduction of "green subsidies." It is not exactly a sign of diplomatic skill to bang the table during the current talks. The Europeans and the GATT partners are also interested in greater access to the Japanese markets but they want -- in accordance with the most-favored-nation clause of the GATT -- equal rights for everyone. They want to prevent disadvantages both in the Japanese and domestic markets that would result from bilateral Japanese concessions for the United States. The European Commission is considering two kinds of actions to settle the transpacific conflict peacefully: The above-mentioned trialogue among the three major world trade partners, and comprehensive informative assistance for the enterprises to enable them to gain a foothold in the difficult Japanese import markets. The worldwide GATT agreement must be "utilized to the maximum extent by all partners in friendly cooperation," Brittan demanded. In any event, it must be prevented that strong "interest groups and the creators of markets" establish new trade barriers. Like the criticism by the general secretariat of the GATT, this is an indirect appeal to President Clinton to show fairness vis-a-vis all partners and to avoid a trade war. Above all, the partners should vest greater direct powers in GATT for the settlement of trade disputes -- on a multilateral basis. Bilateral agreements, preferred by the United States, or more or less forced export restrictions undermine GATT as a multilateral world trade organizations.
