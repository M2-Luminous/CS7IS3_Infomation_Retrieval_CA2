A statement issued by the President's Press Center on the subject noted that Demirel first asked experts to study the law, which was passed by the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA], and then personally studied it himself. The statement stressed that although a long time has passed since private radio and television stations began broadcasting in Turkey, there were no legal arrangements as in all other countries. The statement recalled, however, that the number of private broadcasting companies in Turkey has reached 525. Under these circumstances, the statement pointed out, it has become socially necessary and essential to provide a legal framework for private radio and television stations as soon as possible and prevent these communications organs, which wield great influence, from operating in a vacuum. Pointing out that the president approached the broadcasting law based on the view that it meets this basic need, the statement remarked that Demirel determined that some of provisions included in the final form of the bill are open to criticism. According to the statement, in approving the law, Demirel took into account the current sensitive circumstances in the country. Demirel also noted the national need to take special care to protect the country's indivisible integrity and the nation's unity and solidarity and not to violate the society's traditions, norms, and general morals. Expressing his conviction that the TGNA will quickly eliminate the possible dangers and shortcomings to ensue from the implementation of the law, the president also said that he trusts that the councils to be established within this framework and the responsible persons will fulfill their duties with total impartiality and maximum goodwill. The statement continued: Our honorable president, who sincerely favors a congruence between the needs of the society and the output of the media in our country -- which has caught up with the era of private radio stations and television broadcasting beginning with black-and-white broadcasting in the 60's and going on to multi channel and colored broadcasting -- has approved the new broadcasting law on the basis of these beliefs.
