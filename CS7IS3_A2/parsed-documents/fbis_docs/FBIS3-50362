The authors of the draft gave up a few of the provisions that had been submitted before but that were sharply criticized (as aiming to make local elections overly political); these provisions pertained first of all to direct elections of wojtowie [chief officers of groups of villages] and mayors. The authors of the draft also gave up the idea of distributing the same electoral list numbers among the parties as they had during the parliamentary elections. The authors of the draft think that the draft should be debated as soon as possible by a specially created Extraordinary Commission. "Whatever it is possible to save, from among the principles applied during elections to the Sejm, must be maintained with regard to local elections"--this is how Sejm Deputy Ryszard Grodzicki of the SLD explained, during Wednesday's [26 January] press conference, why the authors of the draft want to see a uniformization of the election system and proportionate elections to gmina councils everywhere. Up to now, this kind of elections took part only in those gminas whose population exceeded 40,000 people. In smaller gminas, elections took place in one-seat districts: Whoever won became the gmina council member for his particular district. "Such elections were accidental and did not reflect the configuration of forces within gminas," Grodzicki says. "Fears of allegedly rendering local elections overly dependent on political parties are unjustified," says Professor Stanislaw Gebethner, an expert for the SLD. According to him, the June elections will demonstrate a weakness by all of the parties, with groups of citizens being the primary winners. "Individual candidates will have no chance," Sejm Deputy Grodzicki admits. But he also adds that any party wanting to run in the elections in a particular gmina will have to collect an appropriate number of signatures, which would support that party's list. "There is no danger of a formalized structure submitting its candidates without the inhabitants' support," Grodzicki says. According to the draft, 15-150 signatures are enough for submitting a list. To secure places in gmina councils for people who are popular in the particular gmina regardless of the their political affiliation, SLD activists are proposing that anyone who manages to gain 7-percent support can become a council member, even if, according to electoral-law arithmetic, his list will not be taken into account in seat distribution. According to Sejm Deputy Krzysztof Janik, there were three reasons for the SLD's giving up the idea of direct elections of wojtowie and mayors by all inhabitants of a gmina. First of all, there emerged a fear that the Small Constitution might have to be changed. Second, there emerged "significant opposition by political groups and by those parts of parliamentary clubs that have the power of shaping opinions." Third, the SLD wanted to avoid being accused of settling its own party interests. "We can see no particular benefits for ourselves from the introduction of the new electoral law," says Ryszard Grodzicki. According to Krzysztof Janik, the SLD is eager to see political parties strengthened, whereas the new election system is supposed to be conducive to that. Janik also announced that Sejm deputies for the SLD will return (although not at the time of the next elections) at some point to the idea of directly electing mayors and wojtowie. They will also submit a proposal for an electoral law with regard to self-governmental powiat [small administrative units] councils "in the near future." That will be done along with other draft laws pertaining to powiats.
