FR940428-0-00005 FR940428-0-00002 Over the past five years, the average utilization of Native oil between March 1 and May 31 is 91,375 pounds. This figure is considerably more than the existing available supply. In addition, a majority of spearmint oil buyers indicated they will be in a position to buy additional Native spearmint oil if it is made available. By increasing the Native spearmint oil allotment percentage by three percent, the available supply (as of February 23, 1994), will increase by 55,553 pounds, from 59,599 pounds to 115,152 pounds. In its deliberations on how best to meet the anticipated demand, Committee members and other industry participants indicated that the available Native spearmint oil supply should be increased by three to seven percent. The majority of the individuals recommending some level of increase favored three percent, indicating a higher level may push Native oil supply into a surplus situation before the end of the marketing year. The Committee did not recommend an increase in the supply of Scotch spearmint oil since it is anticipated that there will be a surplus supply of this type of oil by the end of the marketing year. The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that an allotment percentage of 40 percent should be established for Native spearmint oil for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year. This percentage will provide an increase in the salable quantity of Native spearmint oil from 714,665 pounds to 772,611 pounds. Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed and final rules in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 1993&hyph;94 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is found that to revise ยง985.212 [58 FR 28340] to change the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) This final action increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately; (2) The Committee recommended this rule at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input; (3) Handlers and producers should be apprised as soon as possible of the salable quantity and allotment percentage of Native oil contained in this interim final rule; and (4) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
