More than 200 people attended a discussion meeting in the Great Hall of the People this morning to mark the publication of the pictorial. They included personages of the judicial and jurisprudential circles and Dong's relatives and aides. Wang Hanbin, Song Ping, Song Renqiong, Ren Jianxin, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Guangying, Zhang Siqing, Wang Ping, Wu Xiuquan, Jiang Hua, Chen Xilian, Lu Zhengcao, Zheng Tianxiang, and Wang Heshou attended a publishing ceremony and the discussion. Comrade Dong Biwu was one of the founders of the CPC. He was an outstanding party and state leader, as well as the principal founder of the people's judiciary during the period of the new democratic revolution and socialist construction. He held concurrent posts as vice premier of the central people's government and chairman of the political and law committee. He also served successively as president of the Supreme People's Court and acting president of the People's Republic of China. The pictorial, compiled by the China Revolutionary Museum, contains a large number of photographs showing Dong Biwu's activities during various periods from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution and socialist construction. Bo Yibo made a written speech to greet the publication of the pictorial. He said: Comrade Dong Biwu was a great revolutionary. He unselfishly dedicated his entire brilliant life to the liberation and prosperity of the Chinese nation and to the independence and prosperity of our country. We should learn from his great spirit and lofty character, work hard with one heart and one mind under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and build well socialism with Chinese characteristics as Comrade Xiaoping has advocated. Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, delivered a speech at the meeting. He highly praised Comrade Dong Biwu for having made outstanding contributions to China's revolution and construction and particularly to China's legal system during his several decades of revolutionary career. He said: Comrade Dong Biwu dedicated himself to the formulation of China's socialist legal system. He profoundly expounded Marxist views on state and law, summed up the historical experience of the building of the people's regime and the formulation of the legal system, and explained and proposed a series of policies and principles on strengthening the socialist legal system. His far-sighted views and propositions remain an important guidance for us to uphold the policy of "building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both" and to further strengthen democracy and the legal system.
