FR941128-2-00050 FR941128-2-00040 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with FEMA's interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35770), FEMA has established a fiscal year (FY) 1994 hourly rate of $120.79 for assessing and collecting fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees for services provided by FEMA personnel for FEMA's REP Program. DATES: The user fee hourly rate is effective for FY 1994 (October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Vasta, Chief, Regulatory Services Coordination Unit, Preparedness, Training and Exercises Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;4570. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As authorized by Public Law 103&hyph;124 (107 Stat. 1297), an hourly user fee rate of $120.79 will be charged to NRC licensees of commercial nuclear power plants for all site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel for FEMA's REP Program under the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35770). All funds collected under this rule will be deposited in the U.S. Department of the Treasury to offset appropriated funds obligated by FEMA for its REP Program. The hourly rate is established on the basis of the methodology set forth in the referenced FEMA interim rule at 44 CFR 354.4(a), ``Determination of costs for FEMA personnel,'' and will be used to assess and collect fees for site-specific and generic services rendered by FEMA personnel. For FY 1994, the total Salaries and Expenses funds obligated for FY 1994 was $5,941,306.82 and the total number of site-specific hours expended was 49,186. Applying the formula set forth in the interim rule, the FY 1994 hourly rate is $120.79. The establishment of this hourly rate is intended only to address charges to NRC licensees for services provided by FEMA personnel, not FEMA charges for services provided by FEMA contractors, which will be charged under the interim rule at 44 CFR 354.4 (b) and (c) for the recovery of appropriated funds obligated for the Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) portion of FEMA's REP Program budget. On May 19, 1994, FEMA published in the Federal Register (59 FR 26350) a notice continuing the FY 1993 methodology to establish the fee for services to support FEMA's offsite REP activities. This notice stated that FEMA would be doing a mid-year user fee billing for FY 1994 using the FY 1993 hourly user fee rate of $122.88 and that any billing adjustments necessary after calculating the actual FY 1994 hourly rate would be made after the end of FY 1994. The hourly rate of $120.79 is the final hourly rate for FY 1994 and adjustments will be made using this rate. On July 27, 1994, FEMA published in the Federal Register (59 FR 38306) a proposed final user fee rule that revised the methodology contained in the interim rule. The final rule will be published when FEMA has completed its analysis of public comments received in response to the proposed rule. Dated: November 22, 1994. Kay C. Goss, Associate Director.
