A few days ago, the bodies of six Haitians -- including those of two children -- who arrived in Florida on rickety boats were cast into the sea; meanwhile, a group of Cubans obtained asylum easily. [sentence as heard] Is this a typical aspect of U.S. immigration policy? At the end of the 1960's, the U.S. Congress passed a law providing for preferential treatment for Cubans. Despite the intensive pressuring by Cuban-Americans, more than a few in Washington question that law. What is happening and what people are not realizing, however, is that many of those who have obtained residency under this law, claiming that they could not return to Cuba for fear of Fidel Castro, are now visiting Cuba. There are many examples of this biased immigration policy. A few months ago television stations throughout the world were showing images of Haitians and denouncing their deportation from the naval base at Guantanamo. Meanwhile, Cubans arriving at that same place by swimming or crossing minefields are automatically granted asylum. In the light of these examples, Cuba seems to be more dangerous to Washington than is Haiti. Are there reasons a Cuban deserves U.S. residency more than a Haitian? The United States' refusal to grant a number of visas to Cuban citizens annually is what encourages the illegal departures from Cuba. So far, the U.S. Government has maintained that the policy of repatriating the Haitians is necessary to prevent many of them from dying on the high seas. The other side of the coin is quite different, however. As you can see, internationally, there are attempts to present Haiti solely as a land of emigrants who flee in rickety boats. Less publicized are the struggles for economic power. The wealthy are apparently linked to the military who destroyed Haiti's institutions; but the truth is that they see their future as being in jeopardy. Many businessmen have gone bankrupt because of the international sanctions, the black market, and drug trafficking, which is in the hands of the military chiefs, in collusion with the CIA and the Pentagon. The rich, made up mainly of mulattos and whites and with a mentality similar to that of the Afrikaners in South Africa, are worried about the resurgence of the Tonton Macoutes, a paramilitary group made up mostly of blacks. However, the Haitian elite fears a popular uprising more than anything else, because such an uprising could ruin everything. For this reason, the members of this elite reject the return to democracy that would curtail their privileges, and for this reason they close their eyes to the murder of fellow citizens or to the progressive disintegration of Haiti.
