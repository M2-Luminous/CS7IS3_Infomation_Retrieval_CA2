FR940127-2-00135 FR940127-2-00079 6. United of Omaha will deduct a Policy fee of $30 each Policy year. This charge will be deducted at the end of each Policy year prior to the annuity starting date (and upon a complete surrender) to compensate United of Omaha for the administrative services provided to Policy owners. Currently, this fee is waived if the Policy's accumulation value exceeds $50,000. United of Omaha also deducts a daily administrative expense charge from the assets of each subaccount of the Variable Account. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of the subaccount. United of Omaha imposes no charge for the first twelve transfers in any Policy year, but may impose a $10 fee for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer. A withdrawal processing fee equal to the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn will be imposed for the second and each subsequent partial withdrawal request during a single Policy year, including certain withdrawals that are applied to provide annuity payments. However, the withdrawal processing fee will not be deducted on the annuity starting date if the accumulation value is applied after the second Policy anniversary to provide lifetime annuity payments. United of Omaha does not anticipate making any profit from these four charges, none of which will be increased. 7. In order to permit investment of the entire purchase payment (net of any applicable premium tax charge), United of Omaha does not deduct sales charges at the time of investment. However, a contingent deferred sales charge of up to 7% is imposed on certain full or partial Policy surrenders during the first seven years after a purchase payment is made to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Policies, including commissions to registered representatives and other promotional expenses. During the first year after a purchase payment, the withdrawal charge is 7% of the amount withdrawn. The charge declines 1% per year for older purchase payments withdrawn, and becomes 0% in the eighth and subsequent years. Each year, the Policy owner can withdraw up to 10% of total purchase payments (less any previous withdrawals), without imposition of the withdrawal charge. In addition, the withdrawal charge is waived in certain cases. United of Omaha does not anticipate that the withdrawal charge will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Policies. If this charge is insufficient to cover the distribution expenses, the deficiency will be met from the general account assets of United of Omaha, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks. 8. United of Omaha seeks to impose a daily charge to compensate it for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Policies. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Variable Account, and it will not increase. Of that amount, approximately three-fourths is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately one-fourth is attributable to expense risks. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on United of Omaha. Conversely, if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to United of Omaha. 9. The mortality risk borne by United of Omaha arises from its obligation to make periodic annuity payments regardless of how long all annuitants may live and from its obligation to pay a death benefit that may be greater than the Policy's accumulation value. The expense risk assumed by United of Omaha is that its actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered through the administrative charges.
