The organization estimates that there are about 3 million infected women in the world. The rise in AIDS among women means more infected children by vertical transmission. The virus is transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, at birth, or during breast-feeding. In Sao Paulo -- the state which best illustrates the development of the disease in our country -- the ratio was 43 infected men for every infected woman in 1985. Today the ratio is four to one. That ratio -- equivalent to 25 percent -- is much higher than in the United States (where 12 percent of cases are women) and Canada (5 percent). Some African countries are way out in front, with women constituting more than 50 percent of the cases. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |AIDS in Brazil: Reported Cases by Mode of Transmission | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transmission |Men |Women | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Homosexual |12,094 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bisexual |6,284 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Heterosexual |4,919 |2,923 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drug use |7,910 |1,815 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hemophilia |663 |- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transfusion |1,100 |702 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vertical transmission |440 |418 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Unknown |4,044 |652 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |37,454 |6,510 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Of the total 43,964 reported cases, 18,128 have already died. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Ministry of Health bulletin, November 1993. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AIDS Cases in Sao Paulo (62.8 percent of national total) Cases reported in state Mode of Transmission (both sexes) Description Number Mode of Number transmission Total cases 27,637 Homosexual 7,391 Men 23,221 Bisexual 3,106 Women 4,416 Heterosexual 3,939 Already died 18,089 Intravenous 8,731 (both sexes) drugs Hemophiliacs 246 Blood 618 transfusion Vertical 677 transmission Unknown 2,929 Source: State Secretariat of Health Epidemiological Bulletin, November 1993 In Brazil, the increase in the disease among women is linked especially to intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. According to experts at the Ministry of Health, it is the man who becomes infected through drugs or by homosexual relations without the use of condoms and who then passes the disease on to his wife or girlfriend. According to data from the Sao Paulo Secretariat of Health, 48.85 percent of the women were infected through heterosexual relations. Another 29.8 percent caught the virus through intravenous drug use. According to the Ministry of Health, our country currently has 43,964 reported AIDS cases. The figure may be at least 20 percent higher. Of the official total, 18,128 have already died. The number of infected individuals -- those who have not yet manifested the disease -- ranges from 500,000 to 700,000, depending on one's source. Sao Paulo State has 62.8 percent of the cases. It needs to be remembered that Sao Paulo has less underreporting and is faster at recording reported cases. Rio de Janeiro State is in second place with 6,208 cases.
